going to present salon from here to
infinity the big picture in what's
coming which is mostly a talk consisting
of demos and presenting the ecosystem
around salaam so we'll start with a
quick intro of lamb and what it is i do
in the under project and then a few
words about the the salon language but
more is it going to be more about the
ecosystem and what you can do with the
language than you know repeating feature
after feature of the language and and
will conclude with the future of salon
and the roadmap so I work for red hat I
work on salon mostly the jvm compiler
and the hurt module system which both of
which i will present in more details
later on I also work on trying to glue
all the pieces together pieces which I
will again present in more details later
so quick intro bats along salon is a new
language created by redheads which is
aimed at being both powerful and modern
and and to be something usable by large
teams so something that is readable that
is predictable it's a language that
should put everyone at ease when they
come from Java or C sharp when they
start learning the language the go is
that you know there's no big surprise
for them I can learn it in a day or two
and and and so they feel right at home
the other big aspect is that it has to
be readable and predictable so once you
know the language there are few rules
that you have to know when you can learn
them fast and when you read somebody
else's code because most often you write
some code but you often
eat your own code later on and you don't
remember what it is it does there should
be no surprise as to what the program
should do so it's it's a very much a
language for teamwork and it's also
modern and powerful because you know
we're in 2014 now we expect languages to
be able to to do more than we expected
of for instance Java 20 years ago it's
it's more than language so it's also an
ecosystem it's a whole platform for
instance we can run salon both on the
JVM and on JavaScript PN's so you can
compile it to JVM you can compile it to
to JavaScript it runs on no the runs on
the browser ransom JVM it has modularity
in the language from the start so that's
something very important and very
interesting and I will talk more about
this later and it has also strong
tooling so we ship the language with an
IDE we ship the with a good command line
we ship with a good module system and
web repository for modules which I will
all of which I will demo later if you
worried about the language I'm not going
to go into details about all the
features that we have in the language I
did that a couple of years ago and it
turns out that you know reading about
the language from the features is a bit
problematic because you don't really see
what you can do with it you just see a
list of features it doesn't tell you
much so I'll quickly go through the lift
here it's as I said it's inspired by
Java and C sharp in terms of features
and also the syntax but then it has a
bit more type inference and than those
languages it has a bit of a more
powerful type system which i will also
demo later on it supports some of the
things that were introduced in Java 8
for instance mix-ins and lambdas but a
bit differently also again this later on
you know unique features that might be
interesting to you we we have refi
generates so you're able to know at
runtime the type of objects that have
generic type Arden's we have modules in
the in the language supported by all the
tools we have a very interesting
metamodel metamodel is the the
equivalent of Java's reflection except
you can also query the list of all the
modules that are running which packages
they have and everything as I said
earlier we compile to the JVM and
JavaScript and we have of course full
interrupt with Java and JavaScript which
I will show also later on quick intro
but the salon ide as well so we have
salon ID which is based on Eclipse it's
an eclipse plugin I was started by the
Beatrice Thailand and Gavin King it
integrates with JD TJ DT is the Java
mode for for for eclipse so you are able
to edit in the same salon project java
code and salon code and they can call
each other we have the familiar editor
that you have for java of course it
supports compiling to both backhands
lots of quick fixes refactorings wizards
it integrates with the module system so
you can directly curry the list of
modules running on remote repositories
you can also publish to remote
repositories directly from the IDE and
in terms of status this is very much
feature complete we have a little bit of
pieces missing in the in the debugging
in the
begging area but for the rest it's it's
very very fast very strong it's very
definitely on par with what JEP provides
whichever we have also an start of an ID
for IntelliJ which was started by by
community members Bastian Johnson and
machame see it supports a few things
like syntax coloring completion
application and think tooltips and so on
but it's not finished in the same way as
stated the Eclipse begins finish so I'm
not going to demote that one but if
you're interested in in you know trying
it and then and adding new features to
it then it's an interesting project so
i'll start you know in the the meat of
the matter the first demo so this is a
demo that i did last year at javaone
during the jvm language ball that
session which i will be be doing
tomorrow with with other languages so
this is an interesting demo that I
thought I should you know explore more
in depth today I have here I'll tell you
quickly what I'm going to do in this
demo I'm going to show you that we can
run on the JVM and that we can run on
the browser in JavaScript I'm going to
have the the browser call the call the
server and ask for a list of modules
using a using a what's it called let's
just hook up the name beer sorry yeah
yeah it likes but the WebSocket right
query they so the client is going to run
in salon is going to be written in so
long the server is going to be written
in so long and I'm going to show first
the first part which is the server part
the first thing to note here is how we
describe modules in insulin as a
it's in the language so very much so
like packages are part of the language
of Java and modules once you know we
hope they will be good 60 in insulin
modules are inside the language so it's
not like maven or greater or IV where
you have to have a third party tool to
to handle all the dependencies and the
publishing and the fetching of
repositories everything is works from
all the tools here you can see a number
of things i have defined the the server
module so it has a name has a version
and then it has a list of module imports
the first ones are from the salon sdk so
as i said from the beginning salon is
more than just a language it's a whole
it's a whole thing that comes with with
an sdk as well motorized sdk so salon
DBC net I oh and Jason come from the
salon SDK and then we have a module
which is called Java base we so this is
the jdk motorized as it will be in
jigsaw we took the list of the plan that
they had four tix oh and split it up
that way so you can of course as I said
we have pulled into a butcher you can
import Tara modules from the JK the org
postgres one is ajar so it's it's a
maven module that you can also import
there's no problem with that and now i'm
going to show you what we are going to
do this so this is a bit of salam here
we have a run function which is a
declare that the top-level the first
thing you can see is that we can declare
functions at the top level they don't
have to be part of a class when they're
at the top levels are part of the
package so we have a run function part
of this package we have value keyword
here you but you can see which is where
I would define type inference so we can
see here that salon is a statically
typed language it's not a dynamic
language it's a statically typed
language we have type inference but at
during compilation the compiler is able
to look on the right hand side and infer
what it is that we're going to put on
the left hand side which is the opposite
of what Java dot Java has left hand side
inference that we have right right hand
side entrance so we can say a value and
then the type checker will know it's a
it's an object of type sequel and again
here we are going to first get a sequel
connection which is a function that I
define here I get a data source which is
something I get straight out of the
maven module for the bosphorus the JDBC
driver then I said a few properties to
it excuse me I have a question yes value
is immutable so have a few a few setters
that I call here you can see that we
hide the fact that behind the scenes
were calling setters were showing
properties javabean properties as if
they were field which is what they're
doing in c-sharp there abstracting in
salon it's the same thing to have an
attribute that is virtual or non butyral
and you see it from the outside as
exactly the same you can change the
implementation and it's it's an
implementation detail so I create a data
source said I tell it where to look at
have a database on my machine Postgres
database here and then I return a new
sequel object you can see here we're not
calling you we're not using the new
keyword for constructors we consider
that classes are functions as well in
the sense that they take they have a
list apart like constructors they have a
list of parameters and they return a new
value which is the new instance and here
I pass it a lambda so it's a very much
the similar to the syntax that you have
in in JavaScript or Java 8 or lots of
languages where we say it's a function
takes no pioneers it returns a new
connection
timely you invoke it so I this is I
could go back to Iran function I create
my sequel connection and then I'm going
to call a new server to start a new HTTP
server which is from the SDK and I'm
going to start to to open a web socket
endpoint and new you can see something
interesting which is that I'm calling
functions with curly brace instead of
parentheses and when i call it function
with curly braces it means i'm going to
pass prime years by name so I'm going to
say for instance WebSocket endpoint
supports a number of parameters in its
constructor I think we can see them here
it's not very well formatted but we can
have we have lots of different callbacks
and I want to provide only one callback
which is on open so whenever a WebSocket
connection is open on the / WebSocket
path then i'm going to call this call
back here which is a lambda and this
this allows you to have cause we support
optional parameters as well in insulin
so you can also you can just specify the
ones which you want to pass so here i
have the syntax for lambda you can see
it's very similar to two other languages
we have the type the list of five meters
and then the body whenever I have a
connection on my web socket i'm going to
call read sequel which is a function
defined here reach sequel as a function
which takes sequel connection and then a
call back so I say okay it's a call back
it has to be of type void and then take
three parameters of these types I'm
going to do something very boring a do a
select statement and then I'm going to
iterate my rose and again you can see
here type inference are not specifying
the type of the row because it's
inferred from the right-hand side each
row here is a map of string to object
and I want to make sure that i have in
fact a name version and
hellos and that they're not new and
they're up the right type in salon you
cannot have no point of exceptions
because mule is not a valid bottom type
value in the language so whenever you
have something which is could be
optional and in fact when you get
something from a map you get something
which is optional optional return type
Xperia we could be new you have to check
before you can do anything with it that
its meal or they it's not new so here
we're going to assert that we do have a
name a version of downloads and make no
mistake here if I shake that I have a
string it cannot be no right so I'm
guarantee that within I can call my
callback and pass it to name version and
tunnels and it won't happen you know the
other thing to note here is that we have
no primitives in the language so we have
no special hole in the type system to
accommodate a bunch of special types
that don't fit in the object hierarchy
that makes everything simpler for
everyone of course behind the scenes we
do optimize things to primitives at
least on the JPM where we can so here I
get a name a version downloads and I
call my callback so which is the coke
right the name okay sorry i forgot to
mention that we have fro typing in salon
so once you assert something it's going
to stay valid for the rest of the block
so so the bindings the bindings name
version and downloads are going to be
visible in the rest of the block so
within the four it's not visible out why
it's visible outside assert but it's
only visible inside inside the block
this block how are how are these
optional types
what is the type of bro yes yes it's a
object ? so here right so if i look at
the the type inferred here have object ?
which is a shorthand for object or new
at the union type could be object it
could be new i have two possible types
right once i check that it is a string
it cannot be nil so when i get a web
socket i read my database and for every
row i have this callback which is called
so i have a name and version and a
number of downloads i'm going to create
a JSON object to represent this again i
call the constructor and then I pass it
the arrow the simple arrow is to make an
entry so it's a couple of two special
syntax we have for things that are map
oriented it's see the equivalent of map
dot entry if you use the JDK a lot so
I'm going to print something here you
can see the syntax we have forced string
interpolation which is double backtick
allows you to put any sort of expression
here like a paste for instance then i'm
going to send the json pretty fight over
the channel i'm going to sleep a bit
because i'm lazy all right let's run
this before i forget and now we're going
to see the client and what the client is
going to do I'm going to show you what
it does as the result I have a web page
here I'm going to have a button when i
click on the button i'm going on the
button i'm going to connect to the
server open a web socket and then for
every time it sends me something i'm
going to display it so i'm going to show
you what it does then i'm going to show
you how it does it you can see it
connects and then every time the server
sends
thing I'm going to update and show it so
let's go back to eclipse and show the
client one here add the client module
once again it's module it imports the
jason module from the sdk so so the
important thing to note here is that
even though we're going to execute on
the javascript vm we have access to be
sdk epsilon if we had implemented
everything for instance only if we had
no sdk and we had implemented everything
depending on just the jdk which is DK
and we could not run on the on
JavaScript having around SDK allows us
to have the same modules that are
compiled for both javascript and the JVM
and once you learn how to use for
instance collections in salon or or JSON
or any of the modules from the SDK you
can we use your knowledge of these
modules from the back end to the client
and use the same thing I don't know how
many of you code in JavaScript but when
you do very often it turns out that you
realize that you know you don't have the
same collections for instance on
JavaScript that you have in the JVM
which can be problematic so here is the
code here the interesting bit about
interrupt with javascript is that it's
very different from interrupt with Java
Java is a typed language statically
typed language javascript is not so
whenever we want to interrupt with Java
you've seen earlier it's very
transparent it looks like it's just a
long coat you don't really realize that
you cross the line between between Jeff
and so long um JavaScript it's a bit
different because you have lots of
things that are not known at compile
time and the compiler cannot really help
you much for those but you still have to
access them you still want to exist them
so what we allow you to do is to enter a
dynamic
lodge and a dynamic block is a scope in
which you're allowed to call methods
constructors that are not known at
compile time so it's assumed that if
it's known that you get the full type
checking of those things and if it's not
known then the type checker will say
okay we'll see how it goes it Renta and
same for types you know whenever you
have something of a type that is not
known then you need to use dynamic type
so here we enter a dynamic block and I'm
going to call the constructor of web
socket which is something provided by
the browser by the Dom or buy them but
but the browser I'm going to assign that
into a variable of type dynamic again I
don't know what type it is I know I will
have it at runtime I'm doing to call
jquery as well and this is this is just
jquery as defying in javascript right so
i get a hold on my target and then i'm
going to register call back returns void
takes a dynamic event on the circuit
whenever I get a new message I'm going
to call a function from the SDK which is
sparse Jason which is an interesting
function here because you can see the
return type of the function is a number
of cases which is a union type when you
parse JSON the standard says that you
can have any one of those values in
there so it can be a string a boolean
integer floats JSON object array it
could be a new and and you know if you
try to if you try to represent the same
thing in Java fq making a if you make an
API in Java that we that returns a Jason
value then you have to find the comments
of the type of all these possible body
types and the comments of the type in
Java is java.lang.object which doesn't
really tell you much for instance it
doesn't tell you that you can't have an
SQL value in there
so so here we have a bit more
fine-grained information about what we
get we check that it is in fact adjacent
object and not an array or a boolean
then we check again that we have a name
aversion and that they are off the right
type then i create a new div with jquery
and then I sit some some info in there
and then I I show it as I showed you
earlier yes like you're signing I iron
my amex you don't know it's time later
you say like I don't Maya p.m. yes in
this bill no no more gave it an hour now
we do all the type checking on things
which are not dynamic so for instance
this is this is tight about Jason it is
typed because it is known at compile
time things that are not known like
jQuery you know you get exactly the same
thing when you compile when you write
JavaScript it's also not type check at
compile-time right we are going to try
to improve this in the future by
incorporating support for a typescript
which is which is a language but but
mostly a set of interfaces it's a bit
like a common definition language like c
dl which specifies the schema of a very
large number of javascript libraries
microsoft has written a very large
number of interfaces that describe the
the interface of the Dom of jQuery of
pretty much everything you want to use
in JavaScript and that allows you to
plug it in a type system and then get
feedback at compile time if you want to
check this so we intend to support this
in the future at the moment at least it
doesn't look you know harder to write
salon with interop and javascript then
you would write in javascript itself
right and the HTML let me show you as
well the HTML yes
if something which we assumed would be
available at compile time turns out to
not be available at run time you get
here in an exceptional run time so you
can catch it obviously but how you
recover from it is exactly the same as
how you would recover it in from it in
JavaScript yes well the same as it would
be in JavaScript let me show you the
HTML that is around in the browser it's
going to be easier there you go it's
really not match we have a title we have
a bit of CSS we have we required we have
jquery a required GS the module system
we met two on drive it when we come back
to javascript is they require UJS there
are two modules systems for javascript
as far as I'm aware at least the big
ones require jss one of them and that's
the one we use so we tell it where to
find dependent modules IV SDK at the
moment it's there and then it's a very
standard JavaScript I when the document
is ready then I call require JS to load
my module and when my module is ready
even require will give it give me the
module in in a callback and I register a
call back on the button whenever I could
call it whenever I click the button then
I'm going to call the run function of
the client module and that's the button
underneath so you can see this is really
not much boilerplate alright let's go
back here alright so I've mentioned the
SDK let me explain a bit
where it consists of the first thing to
note is that we have a language module
which is not strictly speaking part of
the SDK when you download the salon
distribution the only module that you
get out of it is the language module so
it's a bit like the equivalent of Java
that Lang the bare minimum that you need
to be able to run a salon module and
there you get the not 3d primitive types
but the base types that are again not
primitives there are objects string
boolean whatever you get interfaces from
set list and map because you know very
useful to have here but not
implementations for them so the
collections is really another module you
get a set of interfaces to define
operator overloading so with support
operator overloading over a limited set
of well-defined operators so you cannot
add new operators but you can override
for instance correspondence which allows
you to use square brackets to access the
value of a princess or as i showed
earlier for json objects summable to
define what happens with plus we have
cocoa which is the type of every
function so every lambda is of type
callable it has type arguments which
define the return type and then the type
of the parameters it gets apply which
allows you to apply a you know call
function it's in every functional
programming languages from the ply and
then a few very specific things like the
runtime the language model the language
version the runtime are now running on
the JVM I'm running on JavaScript and
the metamodel which allows you to as i
said earlier get a list for instance of
all the modules that are running which
packages they have which types they have
get all the types annotated with this
and that
something which is which is really nice
and so this is the bare minimum you have
you get when you get the the salon
distribution the SDK be the entire SDK
is a part is something that you download
whenever you import it and this is very
useful to have it apart from the
distribution because it means that you
can get lots of SDK updates between
releases of the language right we can
release a new version of the language
and then you know the next day the next
week keep on adding features to
collections to math to whatever so we
have a number of modules there it's it's
growing very fast and then most of them
are available on both javascript and the
JVM some are not like the file system
one because there's no file system API
in JavaScript but but there is one in
kno jes so we'll probably add one
anyways now I'm going to talk about the
common line a bit how many people here
used to come on line when they work
right most of you all right so I'm at
least I'm glad I'm not alone the command
line is something that that you spend a
lot of time on like the like VA de and
we spent a lot of time making a great
idea and we also spend a lot of time
making a great common line we base it on
gate because it is pretty good come on
line which means that we have only one
command which is called salon and then
we have many sub comments like compile
run dodge so it's very easy to discover
the commands it's also possible to add
plugins which I will show later on we
have completion which I forgot to set up
in my shell and contextual help so it's
very easy to discover what you can do
with the command line let me show you
this
so I have had the salon come on line
with me clean this up a bit what right
can you read this or should I make this
figure everyone can read all right so
have completion have the salon command
and then I have a number of sub comments
as i said earlier have the compile
compile to JavaScript as well
documentation we have copy which allows
you to copy modules from one repository
to another you can import jars from
maven into into a salon repository you
can create a new project you can run it
you can test it lots of stuff in there
so what you can do here for instance on
this command line is one where am i okay
i'm here i'm going to show you another
project here right another module which
is going to say hello and then it going
to connect to github to the get help api
and get some json out of it and then
iterate the number of repositories that
we have in the salon organization and
then print the number of issues we have
for every everyone so i'm going back to
the command line so what happens here is
usually in salami have convention so
when you get a project you will have the
sources in the source folder have a
number of modules in there so I'm going
to compile it I'm going to say salon
compile if i say salam compiler will
compile every module i'm just going to
tell it to compile this module you can
see the the command line understands
about modules and not just classes and
fouls and it tells me that it created
these things so now I'm going to run it
ah something felt weak intense guessing
my internet is not working at the moment
okay well then what syndrome let's see
if it if it did see if it works better
in the Eclipse now I guess there's
something wrong with a github anyways
you get the idea that you know you want
to have information you can see all the
sub comments there you want to have
information on what run takes you get
everything let's go back here so I'm
going to show you a new project that got
started by the community which is the
build system for salon which can started
by Louis oh sure lets you write your
built-in salon the interesting bit you
know when you as i said earlier when you
start learning in an SDK like learning
the jdk once you know which are pretty
comfortable with it running another sdk
takes more time than learning the
language itself once you're comfortable
with the collections and then be at the
k epsilon on the server and you use it
also in the client it makes sense to
start using it to write your build as
well and not learn another language or
XML or something else to define your
build it's inspired by Gradle we hope in
time to be able to have a greater
plug-in for so long as well where you
would use the build system of Gradle pet
right in and so on that would make sense
as well it's pretty early on but it's
it's interesting to show so let me show
you where we're at here in this project
I have a built folder which is by
convention where we put the build
modules I have a build module which
imports the salon build engine which
contains all the annotations defined for
for declaring tasks and so on and a set
of tasks or function since invoking the
compiler and everything so here
so we have a goal which is compile where
I'm going to just write something on to
the console and say I'm going to compile
this module which is a top level achieve
it and I'm going to call the compiler
let's see what this does in the command
line not much shared means that
decoration is visible outside its
container so in in this context it would
mean it's visible outside the package
but for for a build system it's not very
interesting I think I think the way they
met it with the meta level is that non
shared goals are not documented goals
from the command line so when you get
the list of course for instance in ends
I think if you have a documentation on
the on the task then you get it listed
but if you don't then it's considered
private I hear it's which share which is
the visibility annotation for salon so
salon build a run it it will tell me
that I have two goals so so long bill
compile will compile my module you think
interesting to note here that salon
build is not something that you get out
of the distribution the salon built
module has a plug-in in there that you
can install on your command line so
whenever you want to have want to use
this command you type salon plug-in in
style build and then you get it listed
as and as a sub command and you get
completion that will you know list it
and document it and everything this is
again based on our gate and the fact
that that everything that begins with
salon and the dash then is treated as a
plug-in like blackanese with get it's
pretty good idea that we pick up it here
so i'm going to show you why it makes
sense to have a building salon itself
but for that i mean to make a little
digression by talking about her which is
our module repository it's a it's a web
interface it's a web program that allows
you to publish modules and do them
online so the goal was really to have
something that is usable that it's
pretty that is intuitive that you can
use very very naturally get all the good
ideas from github which you know pretty
much revolutionized code repositories I
don't know if you guys were using sorts
probably before get up right probably
notice the big improvement in usability
between the two systems right so so we
try to do something like that has a REST
API which is what the common line the
IDE and everything is using to query the
list of modules so you get completion
search and everything it supports well
staging repositories were we you upload
your modules and we verify that you know
all the dependencies are present that
you have the right to publish it and
everything you can define teams with
permissions we integrate with the tools
would get herb there's also a social
aspect in it which is interesting that
for instance you can follow what what
modules Emanuel is going to publish and
you get an item feed of all the modules
he's going to publish or you know you
want to follow what new versions of CDI
are out and you can get a feed for this
it's quite interesting let me show you
this the other thing interesting to note
is that what this is not part of the
distribution itself but it is it is free
software it's something we give everyone
so it is the module system that runs a
modules that salon that org so if you go
look for salon modules online you will
see this let me show you here for
instance all the modules of the SDK are
published here it's the same thing we
use on production that you can use
internally you can download it and run
it in Europe in your enterprise in your
private network privately publicly
whatever we have you know we made good
tools we want you to use them and of
course they have to be free so this is
it this is the the module repository you
can browse them so when when we look at
the we have here only one category you
can see which modules are available for
the jvm for javascript you get access to
the list of dependencies they all day
versions that are available you can
browse the documentation directly from
it and we're going to see here I'm going
to show you how to publish module to
this so first thing to do is to log in
and go to your stuff your uploads I'm
going to create a new upload upload is a
new upload so staging repo it tells me
where it sits tells me which come online
i need to use to eat to publish to it or
and if i want to so the interesting
thing to another here is that because
every time you make an upload you get a
new URL where you need to have your
private repo it's not something that you
can really hard code in the build so
whenever we want to or is eclipse here
whenever you want to publish something
then it starts making sense to have a
programming language in your build
because then you can ask the user
questions you can put logic in there and
you can say okay well you know give me
the URL give me your
nan your password i'm going to publish
i'm going to compile directly to this
module repo and documented directly to
this module repo so let's go back to the
command line here i'm going to call
build publish it's going to ask me the
URL which i forgot to copy this have the
most secure password in the history of
Internet ah come on that's this
ah
actually does say that there's a minor
bumps yeah but that's that's pretty
weird okay yes i did not i copied the
URL for the browser or not for the
repository that's a pretty dramatic way
of showing failure but guess i'm going
to have to fix this when i come back
alright this is more like it so it's
combining directly to this repository of
course you could compile locally and
then use copy to copy to it here i'm
just showing you that you can cope out
to a remote repo and documents and run
the documentation tool directly to it so
if i refresh here now we can see a list
of modules i have an error because it's
already being published alright so it's
not good need to read this going back to
eclipse where I was I yes I'm going to
bump the module version shamelessly stop
again so you can see it makes sense to
have a staging repo because we verify a
number of things like has it been
published do you have permission to
publish it our all the dependencies
available in this repo are the modules
documented properly we do a number of
checks not very fresh okay I only have
one warning so it checks that i omit
that the checksum is valid and
everything dependencies are praised
present in the repo I have a warning
because i did not compile it for
javascript I can you know check the
documentation which is not much for this
module you know whatever it's good let's
publish it
and now if I go look for it I can see
that I just published version 1 2 3 2 2
of this thing let's go back here so I'm
going to talk about another piece of the
Salonika system which is Kyra it's kyra
it's a another project started by the
community in this case by shooting of
yet now working for red hat on vertex
and salon integration how many of you
guys know vertex heard of it oh okay
that's more than last time and so these
vertex is a note jas equivalent to the
JVM so it does the same thing as no Jes
except you get a pretty good SDK the JDK
to go there to go with it and lots of
libraries that are written in java and
or in salam consists in a number of
things the first one is a new module in
the sdk which is the promise module
which is an implementation of the APIs
promises so it allows you to write well
not exactly futures but one sort of
future and then we have salon module
that allows you to access vertex for
vertex version 2 and 3 and a web
framework called kyla which is based on
vertex and salon also a model view
viewmodel module which i'm looking to
have time to demo here i'm just going to
show a quick demo of kyra here so this
is using the web framework kinda
okay so the way it works is that you
define a controller which you bind two
paths so here we have the route
annotation it's interesting also to note
that our annotations don't require an @
sign at the beginning so may look like a
keyword or reserved word military
annotation so for this routes then this
controller is going to keep cold and
whatever it gets invoked it's going to
return a promise of a response so
everything is is a synchronous here it's
going to access the vertex running in
the context create a new HTTP client
it's going to connect to the
technologies that the base fact it's
going to get a query so this is really
using the vertex API for doing a sink
HTTP clients then I'm going to return
the response which will be chained with
them something I think this got changed
in the latest version but anyways
whenever I'm ready to send that whenever
I get a response from my HTTP client to
check knowledge database then I'm going
to parse the body going to change the
things that are done at synchronously
with this method here I'm going to make
sure that I do get result which is a
JSON object and that I do get a joke and
then I'm going to return an okay with
this document this document here index
is actually a template it's consists of
HTML head everything here you can see
that the syntax that we have with curly
braces and everything and what we're
trying to do in salam is try to make it
possible to write tree like
representations in the language so
whenever you see something like this
we it really shows us what it is which
is a street if you flattened it out and
you know create an HTML and then said
said head or said title and added
everything one piece at a time and the
whole tree structure would be lost so we
try to make it possible to create trees
like this whether it's in JSON or HTML
or whatever and here all this is not the
dsl ready it's it's a set of method
calls constructor calls here I call the
constructor recalled body the
constructor called Dave and I pass by
Muse by name start last name whatever so
I'm going to create a new HTML document
and I'm going to create put the joke
inside a paragraph return this to the
client the way it bootstraps is that my
run function is going to so the Pharaoh
is for returning only one value rather
than opening braces to to have
statements going to create a Cairo
application and then passing it back
atcha later oh so package literal is
also something that is interesting in
Java you have class literals we have the
type name and then got class in so long
we have rituals for every element of the
metamodel so you have method literals
you have attribute literals you have
package a charles module literals you
can point to anything in the metamodel
so I tell it to scan this package and
whenever it will find something
annotated with route and will pick it up
and say ok this is a controller I'm
going to define it this is something
that is really made easy by the
metamodel if you try to do scanning in
Java then you have to resort to special
third-party tools that will scan the
classpath for jars and you know look at
classes it's it's usually messy in here
everything is included in the metamodel
so i'm going to run this and pray
because i've had mixed results
appreciate rants
this one all right so you can see yeah
well it's checking out a stud space what
happens is really using a synchronous
HTTP and everything a synchronous and
chaining promises together that the
request will start a client to to the
check knowledge database and one ever
get a response then the part that is
Jason then whenever it gets a response
then send it back to the client here
need to talk and the Antelope demos and
we took quickly about the future which
starts by you know rehashing the past we
released version one left here during
devoxx and november 2013 it's been a
year now almost and we are ready to
release version one that one the plan
was to believe that this week but
apparently it's more going to be the end
of the week than the beginning of this
week we've made it it's it's a minor
it's minor ish release we have a lot of
improvements in speed copulation speed
as well as speeding bi de lots of bug
fixes lots of lots of things that are
more polished and powerful than it was a
year ago so this is a much stronger and
much more reliable and powerful version
of salon that you can use the end of the
week very few changes in the language
very few changes in the language module
as well the SDK has continued to grow
but you know this is not a major release
in terms of features unless you consider
speed to be a feature which I do we're
going to release one dot to in 2015 we
have a number of few features that we
want to integrate in the language one of
which sterilization is actually going to
make it in a minor release because it's
all it's ready it needs testing so we're
probably going to release it by the end
of the year sterilization will allow you
to pass objects from a JavaScript vm to
a Java VM transparently it's going to be
a lot easier to communicate between your
salon programs running on both the amps
and then we're going to synchronize
which I've I it as well because they
introduce new things in terms of well
not so much features because we already
had mix-ins and landis but in terms of
performance that we could not do before
that we want to take advantage of and
you know a few details interesting
interesting features as well but that
pretty much concludes my talk so now I
have time for questions and I'm happy
because it's not every time yes well ok
will not per se adding constructors
because we do already have constructors
but what we have here if I go to
definition I think it's pretty clear in
this class at the moment when you define
a class create one here you create a
class and this is how you create a class
you pass the list of parameters directly
in the class definition so for instance
if you want integer integer parameter
aids if I right up there so you can only
have one constructor thing is that with
sterilization
and another things like that we want to
be able to define alternate constructors
and and we have we have pretty good
ideas of how to do this we haven't
needed it so far because we support
optional parameters and deep default
values for so for instance if you want
to have one prime meter or no parameter
then this is how you would say it so
most users of overloading in in in Java
disappear in salon but for some cases of
constructors then you know we're going
to add the possibility to have Outernet
constrictors not constructor essentially
for at least four civilization yes right
if you must verify generics already
wrong yes I'm curious as to impact that
have Java is robbing the digital issues
so the question is about refi genetics
and the what it does with inter up and
and performance right interrupt it's
easy whenever you there's no two ways of
having refi generics it means an extra
set of five meters right because you
need to tell the function you're calling
which types it has four type arguments
there's only one way to do it really
there's different ways to tweak the
implementations so that it costs you at
one point or another but essentially you
still need to pass extra values to date
to the function
look if you take the list of some type D
from the Java library fried fish what
not all right right that doesn't work so
if you get it if you get you have refi
generates in so long you do not have
them in Java so whenever you get a Java
list for instance you do not know the
type of its element unless you look in
there and see what happens but if it's
empty you can't if it's fixed in the
type pyaar ki then you can know it
that's that's how most people do it but
for collections that's rarely the case
so whenever you try to use this for Java
collections in won't work however we do
have our SDK with collections that do
support this so so the problem doesn't
really happen if you care about refi
generates then you have to use something
which supports them it's not really
possible to get them out of Java
collections as for performance the way
we've designed the system is that it's
very cheap to make goals with Rafe I
generics and the the point where you pay
the price is when you access the
generics and you know make a hairy fight
is for instance if you if you have here
a list of tea so the class is primer
dies by T and you get a list and in
there ye do if is list integer L print
whatever if you do use refight instance
of checks then you will pay the price at
the point where you use it because what
essentially you have no choice you have
to pay it somewhere right but the the
calls are very cheap so whenever you
don't really use it then it's cheap how
about classics close
I don't think that has to do I don't
think that that causes anything with
permgen we don't generate new classes
refi generates don't generate new
classes extra classes at least they pass
an extra parameter which is a type
descriptor that's rifle it's a fact it's
a value but it's not a new type doesn't
that mean what perfect like what
primitive is this on the JVM there is no
such thing as a primitive list is there
less right we do and we for our
connections then we can do something
special but for in general there's no
special thing for the JVM right if we
have body parents if we have a double
princess and I was going to be an intern
if we have a list then it's I think it's
going to be boxed at the moment yes but
this it's an implementation detail it's
not something that is you know made
mandatory based system well what are we
looking at it just for fun understanding
here is that refined generics in Sudan
or more a runtime meta data feature that
it is a specialization all time
specialization right yes that's it just
ok which is that true we got a fight on
each
pipeline which right well we could we
could actually do that we just at the
moment don't do it there's nothing
preventing further optimizations to it
any other question yes so this is gold
well I showed you three projects that
came from from the community we have
more and more of those we have you know
we we've crossed the be very interesting
threshold in a in an open source project
or people from the mailing list answer
each other and we don't even have to you
know enter ourselves which is always
very interesting so there are more and
more modules I think by by far most of
the SDK so far has been contributed by
contributors there is there dar one more
people using it all right we're out of
time thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
