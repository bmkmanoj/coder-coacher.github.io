a performance analytics company called
Jay clarity when you performance
analysis and monitoring for java JVM
based systems if you want to find out
about that certainly feel free to come
talk to me afterwards but I'm not going
to talk about performance tuning and
garbage collection and deep dive
technical matters today today I'm going
to talk to you about my background in my
history of running technical teams I run
technical teams at banks an insurance
healthcare and academia open source
projects from teams of two two teams of
you know a couple of hundred and sighs
and over my career I've just realized
how horrific most teams are whatever
they tell you in technology it's always
a people problem problem and a social
problem and still holds true today we do
have a lot better tools i believe to
develop code with i mean a single
developer or small group of developers
can you know build an amazing full stack
application in days or weeks the power
you have to change the world is actually
incredible when it's something that sort
of the forefathers and mothers we had in
technology just weren't able to do the
problem is we just keep screwing it up
how many of you here have you know
recently delivered a software project on
time with the right level of quality and
in budget there's anyone brave enough to
admit it three people in the room have
managed to succeed two people in the
room so out of what I guess 150 or so
and that's about the right sort of
percentage I see in the industry so we
kind of suck and I have worked with a
few teams who have managed to pull off
the Holy trifecta of getting it on time
on budget and having decent quality so
I'm going to share some of the habits
that I've seen those teams have I am
walking around with a special dongle
attached here so if you see me trip up
over stage do you feel free to laugh and
we will start so
who remembers these guys awesome they're
back apparently so yeah sohaib friends
of mine who've got sort of four and five
year old kids and they were telling me
excited about these new these new
teenage mutant ninja turtles and I was
like I can totally relate to the kids
now we had those back in the old days
and yeah sure enough we had a great
argument about pizza you know attacking
reps with katanas and all sorts of fun
stuff the these guys were a highly
effective team and the reason was is
they they had things like a common
culture they had strong leadership
throughout they were empowered
individually to get on and do what they
needed to do which was pretty much eat
pizza and kick butt by the way if you
own the DVD don't be embarrassed I owner
as well some things never go out of
fashion so here are the 99 habits which
I'm going to cover there's sort of a
little known fact that in a talk like
this most people will only ever take
three things away so I wouldn't
recommend trying to like sit there
especially at the end of a Java hun
conference when we're all a little bit
tied some of us might be a little bit
hungover from last night not me I'm a
professional speaker we don't do these
things so you know try and pick two or
three that that sort of resonate work
with you and I certainly hope it can
help you and your team's going forward
so we'll start with the first one social
interactions at the for a software
projects is not about technology okay
it's actually about communication and
social interaction it's the developers
that communicate the best which have a
have the most influence on any software
project and if any of you have ever
watched the OpenJDK mailing list for
Java itself the Linux kernel mailing
list you'll soon realize that quite
often not the best technical solution
always wins it's actually the solution
that's communicated the best to
everybody else on the mailing list and
all the other developers who are going
to be working on this feature for the
next 5 10 15 years that tends to win out
so I'm going to run a little experiment
I would like this
out of the room all pleased to stand up
I'm going to prove a little point here
about how social interactions really
matter on the count of three I want you
to order yell out Java as loudly as you
can one two three not bad please sit
down this side of the room please stand
up now the fun thing about social
interactions is how competitive humans
are team overhead those guys suck yeah
why are you going to do better yeah two
seconds ago you were their friends right
on the key on the count of three one two
three boom apologies to the speakers in
the next room so it's actually amazing
that you know these type of interactions
are where people are most passionate
they have the most fun there's a
vibrancy about the place we're tribal
based creatures which is why you guys
just had that shouting contest it was
you know it took me 0 seconds of
convincing the other study human
psychology at university or beyond you
will realize quite easily how you can
manipulate crowds lots of fun and so
what happens if you lose a social
interaction you lose the the community
that you share within your team you
quickly start descending into a spiral
of doubt blaming each other for bad
codes trying to avoid taking
responsibility saying you know Bob over
there you know he always sits in his
corner and his codes always terrible so
on and so forth when you have a really
vibrant team the team that gets around
the whiteboard the team that laughs and
jokes with each other during the day
they inevitably build better software
I'll go on later about the difference
between distributed teams and teams that
are sort of located in a single office
but this is why traditionally teams that
are co-located in the same office or in
the same open space plan
they have an advantage over remote and
distributed teams it's purely the social
interaction which comes to the fore yeah
you can turn around and throw the
softball at the person who just broke
the build okay you can go up and talk to
Alice at the whiteboard about the latest
security problem that sort of thing so
here are some tips and tricks ok you
need to have lots and lots of
interactions during a day with your
colleagues ok so that's not the single
commit message at the end of the day
it's constantly on instant messenger
email at the whiteboard pair programming
so on and so forth right it's the
interactions it's the ad hoc
interactions which tends to save
software projects right Alice and Bob
might be talking about the latest
heartbleed or shell shock security
vulnerability Chris remembers the paper
he had read two years ago about how to
upgrade a hundred servers instantly
using chef for puppet joins the
conversation saves the team and the
company a whole bunch of time and money
ok if you don't have those sorts of
communications it's usually extremely
hard to deliver software on time that
that's usually the one major benefit you
have don't ever work for a company of
more than 150 people quite seriously I'm
google recently restructured itself
internally to have several units
divisions teams startups almost that are
all at most 150 people because they're
aware of this Dunbar's number the most
work and the greatest social
interactions is around that number and
if you doubt that check out how many
Facebook friends you've got guarantee
that almost everyone in this room
probably has between 120 and 160
Facebook friends it's what you could
hold in your brain as a social graph for
social network number two who here has
the guy called Steve or the lady called
Georgina who sits in the corner and
cones by themselves all day and you
slide pizza under their door
Hollywood would love to say that you
know these people still exist and
dominate our industry but thankfully
this sort of cave troll-like behavior is
slowly being gotten rid of any decent
software that gets built today gets
built collaboratively gets built on a
team there's just simply no other way to
do it software stacks are just far too
complex unless you're writing something
really really small you're always going
to need help from someone else Tiger
teams are another example of this where
you know people like banks etc will grab
people from various different parts of
their organization to solve one
particular problem and they do this
because of the communication aspect so
instead of having the guy from ops the
girl from development the team down down
the hall and hardware they throw them
all together in the same room they force
them to talk to each other because
normally oracle DBA s don't like talking
to people as an example strong
leadership throughout so are there any
Australians or South Africans in the
room one sorry about the rugby I know
I'm in the right I know I'm in the wrong
country here but rugby is a game like a
gridiron over here except we don't have
the pads in the helmets
alright this guy this guy here is Richie
McCaw he's the captain of the New
Zealand rugby team the current world
champions called the All Blacks may have
heard of them commentators and sports
who believe the All Blacks are one of
the sort of greatest sporting teams in
the world just because their consistency
in their win rate and how they
constantly at the last minute always win
awesome that they comment to that Richie
McCaw in particular is a very very good
leader but when you analyze the game
very carefully you actually start to
realize that each individual player in
their own position actually makes the
tactical decision at the time with
complete autonomy so the leadership is
right throughout the team and if you've
ever ever watch a game of rugby you'll
see that all of the action completely
pivots around the person who's currently
carrying the ball it's very very
interesting to watch so a game like
rugby forces you to have leadership
throughout the team and this is
something that you want to have in your
technical teams as well okay you want
your most junior developers to be one
hundred percent responsible for the
piece of work that they're working on
let them make mistakes okay let them
make decisions let them start to think
and reason about the business impact of
what they're building okay if you're
constantly having to tell your
colleagues and especially your junior
colleagues what to do and how to do it
okay you're always going to be piled
with the responsibility you're always
going to be that manager or that
technical team lead at nine o'clock and
evening typing up the TPS reports you
know reading every single commit message
because your people don't have the
leadership throughout to do these things
themselves so save yourself some time
and money and encourage this leadership
can also be summed up with this quote
also no more
so leaders don't equal managers that's
another key key thing most middle
managers I've run across make the worst
leaders I've ever seen because a lot of
them are in that position because
they're good at pushing paper around
they're not not actually good at
inspiring or applying serve what I call
servant leadership enabling their teams
to do better servant leadership for
those who don't know is basically the
term you use for the very few awesome
managers who do absolutely everything to
remove all the crap out of your day to
day jobs so you can focus on what you do
best which is technology architecture
and development okay so a good manager
will do things like let's get rid of the
manual timesheet system let's automate
all of that and I'll even fill in your
timesheets for you it's the manager that
walks in five minutes before the rest of
the team gives everyone a cup of coffee
very small simple things like that all
you have this guy how many people have
this guy is a bus or add had this guy is
about someone like this yeah absolutely
horrible number three we talked about
empowerment versus control a lot of us
work in Sderot set fairly enterprise at
enterprise companies who here sort of as
a vice president or a president or an
associate or a junior lieutenant sub VP
of something or other you guys all have
those sort of crazy titles especially
over here in the States it's I mean the
hierarchies and some of the companies
here are just maddening and the problem
again as I talked about with the
leadership issue is that you're not
empowering people to get on and make
their own decisions and all of a sudden
everything starts getting bottlenecks
with one person who's that was so called
at the top of the food chain I saw a
famous example of this when i first
traveled to India when India was sort of
starting to take off as an offshoring
platform and I went to the one of the
very first sort of warehouses where they
had hundreds
junior developers all sitting in a row
with a keyboard and a monitor each
developer was responsible for developing
one class when they had coded their
class I would stick their hand up and
their team lead would walk pass with a
USB stick click their class take all of
the classes put it on his machine and
put it all together the next person up
would tap him on the shoulder and so on
and so forth now I'm glad very glad to
say that sort of era of software
development certainly doesn't happen
anymore silly than heaven in India or
anywhere else anymore either but this
whole mythical idea that you know you
need to have this really tight control
over your developers is really really
stupid developers make really bad
managers typically so if if someone
wants to promote you to being a manager
really do think twice about it you know
organizations that actually have a
technology career track leading up to
something like a principal architect or
principal engineer chief scientist that
sort of thing much preferable to you've
been a senior software developer for two
years now you can become a project
manager which is a completely separate
set of skills well you need to enable
people to make tactical decisions okay
so for example in my company at Jay
clarity we have a few quotes up on the
whiteboard a few sort of I guess broad
aspects of strategy and vision for the
company things like you know we are sort
of an analytics engine for the
enterprise but we want it to behave like
a consumer app so written up on our
white borders we must be a consumer app
so everything my engineering team does
if they have to go oh how should we
design this UI or what should the
interaction of the UX be like they can
always look up at whiteboard go that's
our strategic vision and I personally
don't get involved and how they
tactically go away and implement that
and it dramatically speeds up our
company okay so have everyone by them to
whatever the strategy is for the company
or the product then let people make your
own tactical decisions to get you there
you'd be surprised you know how much
more empowered and how much more
they will have doing it ivory tower
architects if you have an architect in
your organization who does nothing but
right word documents and makes Visio
diagrams fire them immediately there's a
guy Simon Brown who lectures in London
there's a website called coding the
architecture calm fantastic site he
teaches that all architects should be
developers and all developers should be
architects you cannot architect an
isolation from the code you cannot code
an isolation from the architecture
always carry a whiteboard marker is my
other little tip for that one another
quote the diabolical developer who's
this really famous person at me so the
one thing I've learned recently I was
demoted to being the CEO of my company
thank you mini commiserations my team
don't let me commit code anymore which
is correct but that said yeah I really
do follow this philosophy everybody in
my organization is fast smarter than I
am right there are far better at their
jobs and I could have ever been all of
my engineers are far better developers
and I ever were my ops people are far
better ops people that I ever were so on
and so forth and my job is to simply get
out of their way build an environment
where they can work as rapidly as
possible and every team that you get
involved with no matter what level you
are in that team that's the attitude you
should have as well okay make your
colleagues faster little bit of a story
here friend of mine he's an army he's a
grunt foot soldier would it be whatever
you want to call them and he was out on
exercise and the jungles where New
Zealand soldiers go and train initially
before they go on deployments and they
were true posing through the jungle with
you know the green lieutenant the the
wizened old sergeant and
full of young idiots which are usually
the privates and they lost the
lieutenant just lieutenant went lifts
platoon went right no lieutenant and
they got paralyzed the sergeant was like
well we can't go anywhere because we
need to ask the lieutenant and the cop
was like a hard but we don't have
lieutenant insiders like yes and they
proceeded to sit down in the same spot
for an entire hour until my friend who
is very experienced hiker Bush tracker
you know the age-old wisdom of let's
find a stream which walked down the
stream I'm sure we'll find the
lieutenant somewhere they didn't he was
picked up on a chopper 24 hours later a
lot wiser but this whole concept that
they got paralyzed because they didn't
have empowerment down the chain of
command but the way the New Zealand Army
worked at a time was just far too
rigorous and now they have this attitude
of a few are the lasts if you are the
second-to-last private it was only two
of you you are deemed to be the general
of that platoon and you have the full
responsibility to make tactical
strategic decisions and off you go and
that that's completely changed the way
the New Zealand military works won't
worry about the rescued space diver
shuttle story will go on to number four
highly effective teams have shared goals
and these goals are specific not oh
we're going to build the next social
network that'll take on Facebook because
that's never going to happen and yes we
see that every week in Silicon Valley
it must be miserable okay this is where
sort of some agile methodologies have
helped in terms of counting story items
sprints so on and so forth if you can't
measure your goals how do you ever know
you you succeeded right so you need to
really sit down with your teams and
write down what is the goal for the
Sprint's this product maybe you even
what is the goal for today they have to
be attainable goals okay you can't go
for example and tell your team of 50
developers to all we're going to swap
the codebase to scala by the end of the
week I have seen teams and banks try and
do this it does not work it's not an
attainable goal it must be a relevant
goal to the team it must be time bound
so too many software projects it's kind
of we just need to deliver feature X but
unless you put a really a hard stop on
actually know what we'll do we'll
deliver five stories by the end of the
week you have to have an absolute hard
stop on it you need to have that
discipline in your team's otherwise
software projects tend to drag on the
reason why you need this shared goals is
because all humans have their own
individual goals okay so this is a
Maslow's hierarchy of needs so the first
thing you need is to be able to eat
drink go to the loo quite important for
humans then you want security so you
want to roof over your heads you prefer
to live in a city where there aren't
rights running up and down the streets
which unfortunate happens in some
countries today some of them so forth
and the needs of say Alice who might be
the 21 year old security graduate just
who's just come out of university
wanting to prove yourself in your career
I far different from the personal needs
of say Jim who's the 55 year old oracle
DBA with two children's and dreams of
retiring the Bahamas so given it you're
going to have this set of individuals
all with different goals pulling in
different directions you really need to
set strong goals for the team itself and
have have your team focus on them at
least in the time they are together
cover the smart but the goals that you
have to try and get people passionate
about the goals and sometimes an
enterprise software development that can
be hard who here writes java and
converts up to xml or who converts xml
to java in their day job a lot quite a
few people it's not the most exciting
thing in the world and you actually want
your whole team to agree on the goals so
if you're planning your sprint for the
week or what goals you want for the
product don't you as a manager or don't
have your manager dictate what those
goals are to the team have the team come
up with the goals together okay if you
have shared goals and that your team has
come up with their farm will like you to
actually bother delivering it okay if
not they're not going to stay the extra
hour they're not going to write the
extra tests they're not actually really
going to care and if you stop caring and
a creative industry like programming
then you're doomed to fail at failure so
some giant tech firms we're not going to
name anyone in particular have lot lots
of competing products come within their
own organization and you look at these
Giants supposedly well-run companies and
it's just insane like some of them have
three or four competing products of the
same sector it's just absolute insanity
so if you work for a company like that
or if you find that your company is
competing with itself definitely send a
strong message up the management food
chain or start looking for another job
respect and trust
they say in the software are lots that
we have this concept of meritocracy it's
a nice ideal the idea is that it doesn't
matter what background you come from
what education you have race color creed
gender so on and so forth if you can
deliver good working software and you
can communicate well then you know
you're one of us and you'll be treated
equally and fairly that's clearly not
the case sadly so it is to read this
quote and think think you'll think to
yourselves about this quote so it's one
of my favorites and what we have in
software today in software teams today
and project teams today is actually an
awful lot of lack of respect okay
there's an attitude and a culture and
sides technology teams software teams
that you have to earn respect okay that
you have to write at least you know a
hundred really really good patches
before you deem to be one of us okay you
developers certainly aren't allowed to
touch production servers because we
don't trust you there's an implicit lack
of respect there as well so instead of
working together with you to say hey we
need your developer expertise to help
automate what we do in production
instead you're forced to throw code over
the wall everything is siloed off the
most effective teams that work really
well together and those of you who have
heard of the DevOps movement this is
what the DevOps movement is really about
bringing operations and development
together there's a perfect example of a
team that's going to move much much more
quickly ok so there's instant respect
between the different teams and they
have the attitude of respect and trust
as their first and only if you screw up
do things get taken away ok so little
story about myself I worked on the new
zealand stock exchange when i was 19
years old first year computer science
graduate they gave me access to new
zealand stock exchange for
from servers they gave our whole team
access and for the most part it ran
extremely well ran cheaply because they
had students running up fearless cookies
awesome we got an awful lot of work done
I mean that the pace of acceleration of
change we were able to have for the new
zealand stock market was was you know it
was very high and lots of the businesses
that were listed on stock exchange we're
very happy about that and it worked
really well did I screw up once yes I
took down the entire stock exchange only
for 30 seconds cost the economy about a
million or two million dollars i think
at the time but it bounced back cells
okay and at that point my root
privileges were revoked for a year but
you know that's that said that the trust
was there from the start and for the
most part I think you know that the
value added to the stock exchange that
time was far far increase their you know
the risk of me making it one mistake
seems counterintuitive if you work in a
really sort of type organization like
health care or defense or whatever but
you'd be surprised if you flip it on its
head so what else can I talk about here
I guess the lack of trust and respect
leads to sort of resentments and that
leaves the sort of behaviour of I'm just
going to work on my own personal branch
for two weeks and then I'll show you
guys my code okay when you start seeing
these sorts of behaviors that's when you
know you've got a trust respect and
communications you issue in your team
and it happens more often than then we
would all like
so again people are trusted by defaults
respecters there from the start and
again I go back to the point that has to
be miserable so you do want sort of key
key performance metrics around this you
know did Bob take down the new zealand
stock exchange last week no great tick
in the box will continue to let them
have production access perfect example
of this I've heard that the soccer or
soccer we we can call it football now in
America yes there's still soccer the
quick the queen is going to come back
and take this colony back at some stage
we do promise so the dutch national
soccer team is quite infamous for
imploding every world cup in every
single time despite having you know
outside of the brazilians typically
today they have some of the most
talented individual football or soccer
players on the planet but there's a huge
lack of respect and trust in the
dressing room in the locker room i think
you call it over here and it's usually
between the extremely highly paid
footballers at work that play in the
united and united kingdom in the Premier
League they get paid multi million
pounds a week to play and some of the
other players who play maybe in a Dutch
local league and you know a paid a good
salary and working salary like you know
a good hard-working Java developers and
then sure enough there's always media
reports of why the team just implodes
Judas lack of trust and respect in the
locker room and the same goes for a
world-class technical team does anybody
know who these guys are
Morris Dancers that's right this is the
most weird crazy thing I've ever run
across when I moved to the United
Kingdom I know the British are a little
bit strange but this one this one really
takes the cake and it's really big in
England I mean you can go to one of
these festivals and there's tens of
thousands of people all dancing around
with bells on their knees who knows why
but a common culture is extremely
important in a team and it can be very
very hard in a software team especially
in a society that has a lot of diversity
again you might have for example Joanne
a 35 year old mother who is your java ee
specialist you might have you know Bob
who's the 19 year old graduate in the
same team and you might be working with
Amit and Vladimir who are respectively
in india and russia right so to try and
build a common culture with people who
are of a different age different gender
different generation can be very very
difficult so you need to find you know
common cultures around the technology
around Java around how you build
software about around your product to
get everyone you know motivated and
working together so you have a common
language it's it's not a company motto
does anyone here work for a company who
like has the company motto on the walls
and the cafeteria or something or
motivational posters and things like
that is it it's just creepy isn't it it
really is creepy it's yeah it's just
just horrible it's also not you know
your ping pong table and your football
table if you're in a cool Silicon Valley
startup ok those those types of ideas
where people think that that's the
culture of the company that we're really
hip and cool and we've got bean bags and
food tables there's actually very
exclusive to a lot of people sure bean
bags and foosball tables and you know
table tennis might be great for the
younger generation who've just come out
of college or university may not be so
good for you know the rest of the team
who are over
degeneration and I've seen a lot of
startups actually fail because of this
they work very well for the first year
but then as they're forced to grow up
and they bring on people from different
genders ages ethnicities so on the
culture just implodes that they can't
blend the sales and marketing team with
the developed scene they can't you know
the guy who's running operations gets
into shouting matches with with the two
young guys from you know of college-age
just just doesn't work so you need to
have an inclusive culture okay you want
to have some some shared values so in
Jay clarity for example we have some
shared values like never screw the
customer we want to build a consumer
level application the customers hardware
belongs to them therefore our
applications should never ever hurt it
so on and so forth this is sort some
shared culture ideas we have I like the
google one at the bottom jury is out so
earlier in my career when I thought that
culture was taking people to the pub I
made probably the biggest team mistake
ever weed out sourced a team in
Bangladesh who were vegetarian Muslims
and of course as a young man of 23
running my first large project emails
you know very proud of myself got
promoted very quickly I took them to a
meat eating barbecue with alcohol
needless to say they set awkwardly round
a table sipping their glasses of water
from the bar eating the few nuts that
the bar could provides and I learned a
very valuable lesson that day as a
counterexample to help build a technical
culture of shared culture i highly
recommend tech fridays or brown bag
lunch sessions where you get your
colleagues around you might discuss a
new technology or a new methodology that
you've seen to help build something or
each person in the team presents very
quickly what they've been were
on that week and you'll start to quickly
get a shared culture at the very least
around the technology that you're
building and the product that you're
building because again it can be very
hard to build a culture around say a
sports team or the local pub or whatever
because inevitably you're going to
isolate someone and you know it may not
bite you in the first or second week but
as a sort of months and years roll past
you'll get the split in the team and
it'll all go horribly wrong my next
habit is about automation and tools who
here uses chef or puppet or ansible okay
still not very many of you okay so so
for the people who don't you know the
fact the very fact you have to go away
and install your own developer
environments your test environments your
QA environments it's a waste of your
time as soon as you've done at the
second time think about water mating it
okay maybe do start with some basic
shell scripts and things but really
start looking at this new wave of tools
it's going to save you and your team an
enormous amount of time I'll also add to
automation you know continuous
integration obviously everyone here uses
Jenkins now right everybody still not
teamcity maybe does anyone here is not
using continuous integration because
their team won't let them nobody cool ok
this is really different I mean I asked
this question last year and it's
probably about half half and people were
telling me stories afterwards about how
they had their continuous integration
server on a laptop under their desk
where their manager couldn't see it I
understand
for crazy stories like this that's all
again because of this operations and
development divide that they weren't
allowed to install Jenkins on on a QA
server because operations owns the QA
servers it's just ridiculous so trying
to automate anything that you do
repeatedly in your your work day a trick
for managers is automate away expenses
use Expensify or an internal system if
you have to timesheets automate that
away anything to do with legal
compliance otherwise known as human
resources automate that away okay get
rid of all that stuff so that your
developers can focus on developing code
architect and code so on and so forth do
yep perfect example we actually reached
out to Brian Kurtz when Java raped was
being being built and started taking
over on the mailing list answering
questions on his behalf about lambdas
because he was just getting inundated
with questions because people are
curious right i mean lambdas is going to
be the was the biggest change to java in
10 years but the poor guy was you know
up 24-7 just answering questions on the
mailing list as opposed to you know
finishing lenders so we stepped in as a
Java user group community and help them
out a little bit there and the same sort
of story or the same idea you can have
in your own your own teams DevOps pro I
can't say enough it's not the easiest
thing to get into because puppet chef
and those tools are all built in Ruby
which makes me through set I highly
recommend a talk called wet wwat look it
up on youtube after you leave the
session and you'll roll around the floor
laughing when you realize how bet out 5
55 minutes of your life it's tells you
how bad Ruby is you'll be glad declared
you were still a Java developer so
anything that's not quarter doing
development automate it away user use a
third-party service do anything so in my
startup j clarity we've launched to
global products
we've been around for two years we have
that 50 paying customers all of the
stuff right so you'd think we've got a
really big team I have one core engineer
to part-time engineers that's it right
everything else we use services for so
all that fluff that you typically have
in a company legal accounting so on and
so forth you can get rid of that these
days who hears had to fill out six
minute timesheets look law firm I'm
guessing yeah so I had to do this and
I'd fill in every six minutes and then
once an hour I'd say I just spent a six
minute slot filling in my time sheet it
was just absolutely ridiculous so here I
was a highly paid consultant spending at
least half an hour every day just
filling out timesheets it was just
utterly ridiculous as I said before
we've automating automated the living
daylights out of my startup and anyone
else involved in a start it will tell
you the same thing if you don't automate
it you'll quickly die because you simply
can't afford to hire the people to do
all those you know manual operations
encouraging debates that's what this
one's a tricky one we're all quite
passionate people most of us at least we
were when we left college programming
that we might have been ground down by
the enterprises we work for but
hopefully there's still a spark of
passion and all of you here if you don't
have it I strongly suggest playing with
robots and raspberry PI's and cool new
tech like that the IOT space is really
fun and a lot of us are you know a lot
of us quite smart on average a like us
are probably higher than the average in
society and so we all have you know we
all tend to think where we're kind of
right
especially when it covers the technical
matters and it's incredibly important to
have healthy vigorous debates especially
about technology design decisions in
your teams but to do it in a very
structured and disciplined way so it's
not two people shouting at each other
saying they're wrong because spring and
hibernate is the only way to go because
it just works these types of debates are
just not very helpful so I had some tips
and tricks on how to go about doing this
so debates encouraged arguments are
disruptive and they can bring a team
down very quickly and it's very hard to
repair the damage from a shouting match
so a lot of people fear conflict okay
there are quite a few cultures in
particular that you may be working with
especially in Southeast Asia where
conflicts is seen as a very very bad
thing you never shout at someone
face-to-face you never disagree
face-to-face okay people in some
cultures never say no the word know
right which can be very frustrating if
you come from the United States or the
United Kingdom or other countries where
you know you just want to clear no just
tell me if you can or cannot do it
alright so some of the things you want
to do is always challenge assumptions
just because someone says they have 10
years of experience in Java doesn't
actually mean they're right and I tend
to find a lot of us fall back on this
this fallacy that our experience matters
more than the facts on the table we have
a saying in Jake larity from my CTO
measure don't guess or empirical science
wins it's really important to back up
your arguments in your debates with with
some real numbers I've been caught out
many times myself saying I the Java
garbage clip to click their works like
this because you know that's what I knew
three years ago and of course it hasn't
changed well boy had it changed and I
was you know caught out teaching us in a
training course and the person who would
actually change
it corrected me in front of the rest of
the students and quite rightly so right
I was resting on my laurels and I wasn't
backing up my statements with facts you
want to try and encourage setting a
framework around a debate with your team
and I'm going to show you an example a
little bit on how we go about making
technology choices at j clarity we're
startup we have to move extremely
quickly and we have to make decisions
like what no sequel vinda shall we go
with today still we go with MongoDB
because its web scale it isn't just in
case anybody was wondering or Cassandra
or react or neo4j or whatever Oracle
sales people are telling us to buy off
them this week I cover this lateral so
I'm flip forward here a little bit no we
do get there all right cool try not to
leave anyone behind in the debates quite
often I've seen a lot of white board
discussions happen with a team but it's
always the two most senior people like
duking it out and you know the the more
junior people other people newer to the
company barely get a word in edgewise so
make sure you spend time rotating the
discussion at the whiteboard or rotating
the discussion around the table around
the code let everybody have at least
half a minute of their own say even if
you've got people who are quite quiet or
introverted in your team encourage them
to speak up you will be amazed at how
much a better solution you'll come up
with if you let you know the four or
five people in your team actually have
their say because everybody brings their
own incredibly different perspective on
a problem and generally speaking if you
lump that all together you're going to
have a better solution out of it
especially if you're writing any
concurrency code does anyone here have
to write concurrency code do not ever
ever ever do it by yourself Doug Lee
does not do this by himself Brian goose
does not do this by himself and for a
very very good reason okay you you just
need a second person to double check to
make sure you're not doing anything
insane because you almost always are
who here knows about the demise of
blackberry pretty well documented so the
problem that really happened that
blackberry was that debate was not
encouraged internally right so when
things like the iPhone came out and
touch phones came out and this whole new
smartphone revolution came out the
blackberry executive just said who would
ever want to use those everybody loves
the clicky keyboard and the clicky
keyboard we will keep and anybody else
and inside that organization that tried
to stand up and even have a reasonable
debate about it we're just crushed from
the top well we all know what happened
to blackberry so it's a very valuable
lesson there you contrast that against
some of the debates I've seen people
like Charlie Nutter Brian Gertz and Mark
Reinhold have about the design of
Landers where they're all deeply you
know intelligence well-informed people
who speak very passionately about their
points you know Brian and Mark for
example get on extremely well everyone
everyone knows that but if you see them
debating about a technology point you'll
see they really go for it they really go
at it and all they want to do is get the
very best for the Java platform and it's
I think we can all agree that Java rate
lenses come out pretty nicely because of
it if there had not been debate lambdas
would have come out implemented as
anonymous inner classes right and the
performance would have sucked it would
have sucked really badly and I think you
know Java would have struggled to
recover from it java 7 wasn't an
exciting release so Java 8 really had to
head home and industry otherwise would
all become JavaScript developers
go back to the aforementioned wet talk
he covers JavaScript there as well it is
awesome so a little little bonus section
2 this the most the debate you typically
have is around a technology choice in
your team whether that be what you I
technology we're going to use don't use
JSP probably don't use jsf either just
just kidding so on and so on and so
forth so a guy called Matt rable and I
believe he's here at this conference if
you can ever see his talk on making
technology choices please do go see it
it's absolutely brilliant what he does
is he usually takes 10 or 20 categories
of of the technology of what you want
that technology to achieve for you so in
terms of a UI framework for example is
doesn't support internationalization
does it have a security system in built
or to actually plug one on top is it in
JavaScript or is it in Java does that
matter to your team their books written
on the subject are we easily able to
hire people if we lose a couple of
people in the team so the project can
keep going all these all these types
criteria so there's an example here for
choosing your web development framework
it's a slightly old picture nail that
met rable loaned me which is very kind
of it and they've got these weightings
and these schools across all these
different categories so you see things
like you know is there developer
productivity in this framework is the
quality of documentation the tutorials
good so on and so forth and it usually
takes homeowners team only about half a
day to a day to actually do some very
quick research and put these scores up
on the board and they have a good
healthy debate around it for sure they
then take the two top scoring frameworks
and they go away and they prototype
prototype something in it for about a
week and they pick the hardest part of
the project to prototype with that
technology so the most difficult piece
of functionality that's what they try
and whichever prototype is the most
successful for the team that's the
technology they pick going forwards and
it's
a really really really valuable way to
put a structured debate around making
technology choices for your teams and it
takes a lot of the emotion and the old
wife got experience and ex arguments it
brings you back to some hard numbers
some science and pseudoscience but some
science my last habits of highly
effective teams is is simply about
diversity I have seen so many teams
especially in startups where it's a
group of friends all from the same
literally the same village who live in
the same streets went to college
together so on and so forth they have a
monoculture and monocultures are really
really dangerous because if you don't
check with the outside world as to what
you're building you'll end up doing
things like I'm going to be critical of
Oracle here delivering Java affects you
know two or three years later then the
industry ever needed it okay yes it may
well have a resurgence now but initially
you know it was aimed sort of for the
mobile development space and
unfortunately they were just thinking
internally without checking what the
outside world was doing that they hadn't
come to you guys the developer community
and said well should we even bother
doing this is it going to get to the
market on time or are we too late
obligatory marketing diversity picture
so have a diverse hiring policy I work
in London in the UK and most companies
here have this stupid stupid policy of
you must hire people from a red brick
university with a grade that is a 2 1
i'm not sure what the equivalent is over
here but basically only hire people from
MIT stanford and whatever other top
computer science university here as
mistakes and only hire the top 1% of
those if you're going to do that google
you have a monoculture you start
building lots and lots of products that
your monoculture understands and likes
but the rest of the world scratches
their heads at Google Plus as an example
and and it doesn't resonate with with
the very people that you're trying to
build the software for so you want to
add diversity into your team's you
actually want to have certainly people
who are going to be your users heavily
involved in your teams maybe go and hire
that physics person maybe actually go
higher that English literature person
who knows a little bit of web scripting
who you can teach the skills to ok by
having that sort of diversity in your
team you will be surprised how much
better software you'll actually come out
with as a team certainly software that
your users will be a lot happier using
nokia famously for quite some time head
very much for monoculture this is one of
the reasons why nokia is you know share
price everything just collapse suddenly
again you know this revolution came
through with the smartphone markets etc
but because the nokia execs were all
together same culture from scandinavia
hadn't gone out to the world really
investigated what the heck was going on
they got caught out something chronic
right i believe things are much
different now at nokia in terms of their
diverse hiring policy etc but be warned
this can happen to you and your team as
well get sites like very easily i have
run the london java community and we
have a strict policy of diversity first
above everything else and it's stopped
us from our community from stagnating
because we used to just go to the pub
every month and a bunch of us you know
middle-class white guys age about 35
would sit around drink beer and complain
about java right and the user group was
going to die very quickly so we reached
out to universities other technology
groups etc and you know today we now
have four and a half thousand members
two or three events a week and it's a
wonderful vibrant community to be part
of my bonus habits is technical depth
boy or girl scout whichever way you want
to look at it every piece of code when
you touch it okay so have this habit in
your teams of cleaning up code as you go
if you're going to add a new feature
somewhere in your project go tidy up the
code around to add more tests okay it
only takes you that little 10 15 to 10
extra effort it is going to save you
days weeks months of production support
time air with apps because we've got
five minutes left to go are there any
questions at frontier
okay so the question is how do you meet
really tough deadlines so the way to do
that is to work with the people who are
setting the deadlines and what is it
they're really sitting so usually they
want some minimum functionality if you
work very closely with them and deliver
them functionality that they can play
around with very quickly and so I tend
to build like a prototype screen or even
a storyboard they can work with get that
to them early because they need to get
their hands on some working prototype
software to find out what it is they
really really want and when they find
out what they really really want they
stop actually sitting stupid deadlines
it's quite quite seriously and then you
start building out small pieces of
functionality and you just keep throwing
them small snippets over the wall as
well and that way of working with your
end user is far far more productive and
then the deadlines kind of start going
away which is nice how to change the
culture within your own company this is
a very hard thing to do you start with
yourself and one friend seriously it
always starts with two people and what
you do is you start leading by example
so I was tasked at a japanese investment
bank with overhauling their entire IT
culture it took me three years to do it
from a really old school waterfall every
team was siloed engineering DBA so on
and so forth and I started with one
young graduate the youngest person there
who came out a graduate program he just
wanted to learn how to write tests for
Java let's do TDD together after the
first week let's show the results of TDD
to the rest of the team and show them
that we got zero production support
tickets that week while they were
staying up to nine o'clock at night hmm
the third person joined us in writing
tests and by the fifth person came on
they they started ask that's really
frustrating you keep giving me code on a
USB stick can't we get this all built
together let's try the thing called
Jenkins and it just sort of went through
from there so you have to do it guerilla
warfare style and at some stage you are
gonna have to get high level support but
i would start it as a sort of guerilla
movement
yes if they're distributed so if they're
distributed is a whole bunch of
technologies can use Google Hangouts IRC
channel skype there's a couple of
collaborative IDEs you can now actually
start using the best setup I've ever
seen was at a large investment bank
which had a full wall sized video screen
for each team and it was like there's
like you were looking through a glass a
wall it was seriously cool so that's the
best I've ever seen but yeah oh right so
you've actually got individuals who
don't want to take a take on the day
because that they feel like they're
they're going to do some don't okay so
people fear responsibility for some sort
of reason you need to find out for that
individual person what the reason is do
they fear failure themselves do they
fear getting yelled at by their boss is
there a tick box in their performance
review that if they don't have that tick
they're not going to get their pay
rights there'll be an outside influence
on that person as to why they don't want
to step up and take responsibility if
you can take that away then you'll
usually be okay this is a great question
so how do you get people to stop talking
over each other all the time I've had to
sit down with numerous teams to stop the
sort of behavior and I had to go back to
the old fashioned way of here's a
talking stick in my case it was a
whiteboard marker because I encourage
whiteboard discussions typically but
yeah if they're going to behave like
children then sometimes you have to use
the techniques that my friend who runs a
crash users here is your speaking stick
you get half half a minute and then so
on and so forth usually within about a
week everyone starts behaving themselves
it comes down to the respect exactly
yeah how do you deal with the ivory
tower developer or architect who doesn't
want to be part of the team you make
them come down and sit with you and you
pair program with them and you do it in
a way where you can appeal to their ego
say I've got this really difficult
architectural challenge with my code I'd
love for you to sit down with me for a
whole afternoon we can code on it
together you'll quickly realize that you
know I mean they will actually start to
really enjoy it will really start
feeling part of the team and they'll
stop making stupid decisions like we're
going to put windows forms on top of XML
for your Java so the way to speak to
managers is usually one of two ways your
managers tend to be looking up in their
careers right so they need to be you
need to help them look good in front of
their bosses so what you want to do is
you want to talk to your managers about
the current current performance metrics
that you and that they and your teams
are being measured on and then just ask
can we try one project with you know
some TDD or trying it more
collaboratively and elektra see what the
performance metrics are out of their
project and if they increase the
performance metrics which they almost
certainly will you're going to make your
boss look better in front of his or her
boss the other way to speak to managers
is purely money wise a lot of people are
worried about budgets and so on and so
forth and you can do things like you
know we have a culture where these
production support issues keep causing
outages but no one's really measuring
how much that's costing the company
start putting a dollar value on it put
it in a spreadsheet present it to your
manager and if you start putting it in
terms they understand then then you
hopefully have a chance to change the
culture wasn't and we have to wrap it up
that's the end of it if you have any
further questions I'll be outside
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
