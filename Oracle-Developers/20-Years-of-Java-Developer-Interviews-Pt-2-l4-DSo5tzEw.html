my favorite thing about Java is
absolutely the community all my jobs is
because I was engaged in community
meeting people so they meet them and
they meet me when there knows exactly
what I capable of rather than all my job
is because I was involved with the
community so if you're not in community
I invite you to join one in Java user
groups so we need I'm pretty sure you're
going to be successful my favorite
things about Java is new features for a
Java 8 lambda and the dates time his
service is the best I like so much I
think besides javis being a solid
plataform and having so many solutions
for us so much cases and the community
is very grateful very receptive and they
collaborate with each other it was very
great for the developers my favorite
thing about Java is not a feature and
and and it's not like a language part a
my favorite thing about Java is the
community is the community and the
ecosystem I think that there are a lot
of great programming languages out there
but what really makes Java special is
the community and the ecosystem built
around it so so I think I think the most
important thing about Java is there is a
technology that allows you to do things
that are multi-platform da mucha vendor
that you're not tied to a single company
because this is extremely important to
give us the guarantee that we're going
to have a lot of competition they're
going to have a lot of evolution that
Java will be valid for us for for a long
time to come I think thats for John
became too
continue to be vibrant you know the
platform independence vendor
independence is like a core briefs for
the Java as you have what I what I like
about Java is the java community I owe
much a part of my professional life to
java and i think i wouldn't have been
reach it we're Richards I think it's
very far as much farther than what I
believe it could I could go but thanks
to my friends that I made all the java
community the support they provided all
the events all the talks I think that's
the most valuable thing about Java what
I like about Java is that there's a huge
committee around it so everything you
want to do there's someone
similar so you can it's a very open
community you can always stop to someone
they are going to help you there are
libraries for almost everything so it's
a very vibrant community I think this is
what makes Java successful technology
that with this day before I like about
Java is that the language is really
flexible and
we have a huge community and codes
everywhere it makes quite easy to
develop and learn everything that system
it really well my favorite thing about
Java well Java I i I've been working
with Java for the last 20 years and it
gave me a lot of freedom or actually
because I've been teaching Java for
these 20 years and it because of java i
traveled all over the country i went to
conferences in other parts of the world
i taught hundreds of students and I meet
them everywhere I I wrote a lot of
tutorials people still say oh I learned
java from your tutorial I never so I
have probably have thousands of students
I never met before so I think the best
thing for me about job is something
which is not really directly related
programming but it's the community which
of people who who I met as a teacher as
a programmer as an evangelist I'm
speaking about Java and all the freedom
and this freedom gives me a was very
valuable for me because we were so
interested in Java and I don't need much
to live on so I could like teach 12
courses a year nuts I pay all my
expenses and I could do something else
so I decided to do other things like I
learned Russian I learned Italian i
decided to translate i wrote some i did
some translations I today I still do
illustrations music I was an actor for
10 years and I'm I'm currently making
paleontological sculptures for museums
and that was javis fault because I'm
Java give me da freedom you you're just
writing things and you're creating
something new and it's so creative and
it's amazing I think it's really
satisfying when you're just create
coding in and you just see something new
that you just build like buttons and
stuff and that's just pretty awesome
i've been learning java today in
I like so much the syntax compare it the
another language my favorite thing about
Java is that ok I am able to work on
many different projects that are as wide
as embedded development server side
development java SE development desktop
applications reusing the same language
so it's very flexible I like the mooch
platform characteristic which I can
develop a fire systems in one platform
to run everywhere they may think that a
real of Java is about the community the
community is really wonderful and the
community so large the community has it
around the world so if you are is a
different car looking participated you
can learn about the future when the
travel you can meet nice people you can
have a need wonderful networking you can
learn a lot about other peoples in a lot
another communities using the java
community I like the job syntax because
it was fresh one I learned I was 11 i
really like Java dependency injection
and these core platform of Java batch
processing and these things this is like
but it's really fun for me I really like
to work with that my favorite thing
about Java is the community when I can
talk with others about Java and I can
find a lot material about that
everything about Java
and they openly decay is something that
I'm working right now it's really
amazing to see how this ecosystem can
review but only the community and it's
growing so fast and now with the help of
the community at the Oracle is this we
need the mobilization that is coming
with jigsaw and all the good things that
we are building on I think this is
really what amazes me Angela what I like
more about Java is having choice you can
choose your operational system your IDE
your processor if you are going to run
in a big in a small warden as very small
computer so you can choose anything what
I what I like on Java is the opportunity
I see thousands and thousands of
opportunity first one opportunities I
just met my husband in a Java class
business opportunity I built a company
with him for the last 14 years on top of
Java platform the openness the
opportunity that the openness of the
platform brings that you can make the
difference you can participate on a JSR
I had the opportunity to participate on
the jsf jsr so I see plenty of
opportunity and people can use and and
and grow and learn and share with these
opportunities so I believe that one word
that is very much associated with Java
its opportunity and that would be my
favorite thing about job
