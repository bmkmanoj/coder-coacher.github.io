Groth anzio from Hyderabad no we're from
Bangalore I'd like to much Jim I know
it's just the last two weeks here Oracle
code in Bangalore and I'm here with Alex
key hello you are the product manager
for Vedanta net development teams yeah
database yeah and so actually we first
met actually up in Hyderabad last week
and you gave a talk it was sort of like
a beginners talk maybe like yeah I could
get any started you know talking yeah
exactly we were database helping dotnet
developers get started using Oracle
database on the cloud whether that's
infrastructure as a service or database
cloud service being able to use that
either on-premise or in the cloud as you
know in any way they want just to get
started how to do that quickly okay so
now you're doing another session here as
well yeah same session no no we're doing
completely different it's this one is a
little more advanced now that they all
know the beginner stuff we're gonna go
to a little more advanced stuff which is
some best practices and usually dotnet
with databases it's not necessarily just
with Oracle databases but with databases
in general but there are some tips that
our Oracle specific in there that we've
we put in as well but they can become
useful as you go to the cloud too
because in the cloud you have some
aspects that are very different from
on-premise and you have to think about
things like you know round trips from if
you're doing on-premises to the cloud
you know those round trips become even
longer so you have to think about like
how do you shorten them so we provide
ways for people to think about how how
to do that in our in my session okay so
what are some key things that you're
gonna be talking about we were talking a
little bit earlier about like ease of
use you know for developers it's an
advanced session so does that mean it's
more complex do you need more advanced
people or well the concepts might be a
little more complex but actually the the
features to employ them are very easy to
use I like to say that to make things
easy to use is very hard so we either do
engineering work on our side to make
things easy to use for our developers
or you could do a little less you know
as an engineering team which makes it
hard for your end developers to be able
to use the product but you can get to
the same spot so at least my team we've
been very focused on trying to build as
much ease of use into our performance
aspects and our our high available
aspects and that comes from our history
of serving a lot of you know enterprise
users who really need really good
performance we really need really high
availability but don't have a lot of
time you know they have customers too
they need to be able to turn around
their IT applications and we also find
that with developers now with cloud is
that they want to go to get their
product out there as quickly as possible
and they don't want to have to spend a
lot of time performance tuning they
don't want to spend a lot of time you
know what's the best high availability
strategy they just want to some knobs
turn it on and just go so we're finding
that aspect also very important for the
new types of developers using cloud as
well as our existing Enterprise
developers who are are using Oracle
database on-premise so if these new
tools make it more you know easier on
the developers they can therefore do
other things right I mean they can use
the technology to do other things what
are some examples in other words what's
the result of making it easy you have to
do the engineering on the backend to
make it easy that's hard on your part
yeah it's a little bit easier on their
part okay but so then what's the result
of that well they go to market faster
you know instead of spending time you
know testing retesting figuring out how
it works
tuning 10,000 knobs and getting the
right amount you only have a couple
knobs to tune and then you can just
deploy in fact a lot of our performance
Nha features only have wanted to know
most of them don't require code changes
at all and those that do you know a lot
of them only require you know one to two
things like adding up turning it on in
the connection string turning it on in a
property there's a few features that do
require code changes but those are very
specific to like how you want to use
your commands how do you want to handle
for example failure in a chase scenario
you want to be able to do some
coveri and it might be
application-specific but for the most
part we try to keep it transparent to
you as much as we can so that you don't
have to worry about that you could just
say Oh turn it on I could use this and
then then forget about it really maybe I
can do it yeah yeah I mean the ultimate
goal really is that we want the
developers to focus on their own
application rather than worrying about
the plumbing
you know just worry about what does the
application look like how do you want it
with your end-users to work and focus on
where you add value rather than you know
oh I gotta figure out I gotta build the
database myself or I gotta add these
features to the database and which is a
lot of work which you can do but it's
not productive for you to do we want to
get make you productive that's that's
the ultimate goal
I remember the Hydra bed young
conference at about 800 people or so in
this section we're over a thousand here
Wow so this is this is really a big
event I'm wondering what your reaction
was from Hyderabad versus here in other
words what was some of the what were
some of the comments you know from
developers you know from your session up
there
and have you had any conversations here
as well well I will say it's much
noisier here yes so I can sorry I could
tell there's or Sabella venue is much
much that's true too but you said there
are more people to over a thousand
people and I think just all packed on
this floor it's just quite a quite a few
but I'm interested in how they're
engaging with you yeah you know because
you have a lot of resources and stuff
I'm interested in the conversations that
you have with them in their responses
actually haven't had a chance to talk to
many of developers here yet because my
session is not till this afternoon at
5:15 so I'll let you know after that but
definitely back in Hyderabad they were
very excited about our cloud because
they got the free credit so they can say
oh I can try this for free that's great
and you know those who are using dotnet
you know love that Oracle supporting
them because they always associate
dinette with Microsoft but in fact
Oracle we don't do just Java we do
dotnet we do open source we do a lot of
new technologies as Orca code is showing
with with Oracle FN
and blockchain all these new
technologies that developers are picking
up Oracle also does them as well so you
know we do that net to support the large
number dotnet developer community out
there and so I'm quite interested in
finding out what those here and
Bangalore want to talk to me about when
I have my session okay great now you
mentioned earlier that you know you're
gonna have some demos in your session
later then you'll post those up to
github later on oh yeah yeah yeah so we
have a no TN site OTN oracle.com slash
net that's do TN et and on there you'll
find our github site so after I do my
session this afternoon and I returned
back to the United States I'll upload my
my demos up there so that those who are
watching remotely on YouTube or or
attending here they can go to the github
site download them and then try them out
themselves and see how to use our dotnet
functionality to improve their
performance or improve their high
availability also we have a YouTube site
as well and that accessible from our o
TN r o TN site and there we post videos
about how to use some of the latest
technologies like that net core and also
some beginner videos as well since a lot
of people may not be familiar with how
to connect to Oracle I just did one just
this last week on on using connect
descriptors and connecting the Oracle
database from our Oracle data provider
for dotnet so that's always the videos
are always a great way to to learn I
think nowadays allow developers like
watching videos more than more than
listening to a product man or drone on
about this or that right okay great so
you have many resources from beginners
all the way up through advanced in your
session today is advanced at 5:15 it may
be advanced but you know a lot of the
stuff is easy to use so wait so I like
to tell people advanced concepts but
easy to use features okay it's very
important to remember because I don't
think a lot of times people get scared
advanced oh I can't touch that that
that's gonna be too hard when a lot of
this stuff is actually very easy to use
you just need to understand what is
going on and once you understand it you
just turn a knob or two and you're using
it you're like wow I get I get all these
benefits
you know but you should understand what
you're doing first before you turn it on
that's just my recommendation okay great
all right Alex thank you very much for
Jim thank you for having me and so later
on today is the four or five news at
5:00 5:00 to 5:15 yeah 15 here great
thank you very much everybody we'll be
back again soon with more interviews
thank you bye-bye thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
