first event here in San Francisco and my
guest is a Victor Gama hi hi Lamba thank
you for taking the time to talk to you
it's my pleasure it's my pleasure it's
very cool to be among all those speakers
to kick off this series of awesome event
across the world it's pretty exciting
so you had a session today about his old
cat yes so tell us about that I mean
what is it yeah so hazel cast is
in-memory data grid and as a member that
agreed it might mean a lot of different
things for people but in general I like
to talk about three things it's it's a
caching it's computing and its messaging
so by caching I mean it's a simple key
value use case and when we talk about
key values case will usually talk about
map and why we're talking about map
because it's essential data structure
from Java collections and this why the
people can easy use Scheduled Caste
because they already have previous
knowledge about Java collections so from
the very beginning idea was to provide
familiar API for developers say doesn't
need to spend much time of learning new
things and I guess in we have this kind
of like a notion or we have this like a
motto like at two minutes two minutes
model it meaning that developers these
days they have so many distractions so
like 10 minutes it's a time where we
have their attention if they cannot
accomplish something in 10 minutes
meaning we can lost them so this why
hazel cast made it simple so they can
accomplish at least some some simple
hello world with multiple nodes in the
cluster with with ten minutes and it
just simply works and because we provide
the Java API is that they already know
as I said Java collection distribute at
least map distributed set so they would
use a Java developer would use asel cast
combine it with an application that is
deploy yes online basically on the
server to two ways how it'll cache can
be deployed as because it's a Java
library can be deployed is a part of
application so in this case instance of
application becomes
member of the cluster all the simple
traditional way have a client cluster
come
education where you can scale client
application independently from the back
end where you can also scaled
independently yeah and so so we are at
the cloud event so how does does it work
really with the cloud or with a cloud
application yes I think when we're
talking about scalability and the last
ability to elastically scale back-end
it's we're hazel cast in cloud
environment feels very well so cloud
technology allows to bring more machines
more instances on demand and hazel cast
allows to do elastic scaling of the data
so imagine you have a application that
requires caching capabilities under very
heavy load and on demand you can spin up
more machines that will add capacity to
this cluster but after this load will go
down Hisle cast has the ability to scale
down also elastically like removing some
data that already not relevant because
cache why cache were always talking
about some temporal data not data that
needs to be there however many of the
customers in cloud they use hazel cast
as operational store meaning that the
online transactions goes through the
hazel cast because it provides speed
that in-memory speed that allow them to
perform transactional operations in the
cloud in the network yep so they could
use that with any type of application
and any types of services would that be
connected more like with which part of
it like if you were deploying your an
application on the cloud yeah so hazel
cast designed to be non opinionated
library so you can use it as in the way
how you want to use it so we have
absolutely no desire the desire to
dictate how to use it some people can
use it in embedded mode can use it as a
separate service they can use as like
read through cache so they have some
database storage and they can read
through cache this database so they can
reduce heat on database by bringing data
into the cloud plus
we're talking about micro services we're
talking about clouds these days and when
we're talking about micro services we
first think thinking is is language
independence so we don't have to depend
on one particular technology they want
to write their service in Python for
example we need to make this data
available through the Python client so
in this case unified data store allows
multiple services exchange data plus
having the messaging capabilities I
talked a little bit about caching now
it's time to talk about messaging
capabilities we can support the reactive
use case so in this case when the data
change on the server from one service
another will reactively receive this
update through the listeners they can
listen this updates from from Facebook a
spirit so in your presentation you
combine a little cast with a spark yes
so can you talk a little bit about what
you you covered there yes box yes yes so
this is very interesting use case
because Scheduled Caste
was was used in many big data
applications in plus Scheduled Caste
itself provided like my produced API
that allowed to run MapReduce MapReduce
jobs on in memory data but there are
many general-purpose computing engines
like spark for example that allows you
perform distributed computation so SPARC
first of all it is open source framework
that general-purpose computational
framework meaning that it you don't
depend on on Hadoop even though SPARC
works well with red oak but spark can be
used without hadoop without any
dependency on the Hadoop ecosystem you
can use spark just read files in bright
files so in this case it's just a
computational engine and the what what
what hazel Cass brings to the table it
allows to for for example for data
science tasks to combine data that
stored in operational store or cablecast
with data that available for example
through the end of the day data that
they
collect through the day and after that
we need to sort of run some computation
combine the data see what's the
correlation between them or like do some
joins type of things so hello Cass
brings storage into the play with spark
Plus hazel Cass can be scaled
independently from from from spark as
well so results of the spark computation
can be exposed through casual cast to
different different languages for
example there is no like the no GS API
to spark however if you run the job
you'll run the computation and just need
to simply display it on the web page
through the some node.js frameworks like
Express you can read this information
through the Hilo cast and exposed to its
users so it's another use case where
multiple technologies can be used
together and everything again can run
seamlessly in the cloud
no GS applications is you know very
natural to to to run cloud as well many
providers provide the ways how it can
run and no GS applications did you have
like interesting questions in your what
people are usually what do people ask
yeah yeah it is actually one of the
interesting questions that I have is
that some if everything is is the open
source everything is free like how do
you guys make money and how you guys
make living and yeah it's a good
question and what they usually say not
usually said this is what we do
basically we have a professional
services we have the training in plus
we're providing some enterprise plugins
that we develop and it's part of our
like Enterprise subscription so there's
no secret here so that this is the
standard model for commercial open
source companies like you know you can
use it for free and we find with it we
you know we're not going to chase you
and try to give us your money but if you
need to have a support training or some
additional for example multi datacenter
deployment not everyone needs this right
so and if you can afford like multiple
data centers across there are two
regions
you probably can't afford you know some
some support you have a need for this
and you can get yeah you need to be
trained one yeah exactly yeah you fine
absolutely yes you should definitely do
that yeah okay
excellent so thank you so much thank you
for the explanation and and for coming
in spending a little bit of time with us
because yeah that you're very busy
yes I'm actually looking forward for
next event in Austin and I just realized
that there is a the banners with Oracle
cloud coupons so I can use this for my
live demo so I can deploy spark and
Hazel cast an Oracle cloud in the live
demo the next next event in Austin -
yeah this is the kind of em game thank
you thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
