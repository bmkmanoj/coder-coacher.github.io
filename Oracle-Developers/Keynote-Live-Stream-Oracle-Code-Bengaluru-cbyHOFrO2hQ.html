of the Oracle code events worldwide
we've done these across the u.s. Europe
and now Asia we just finished
Oracle push em which was an awesome
events we're on a motorcycle tour
following that event traveling across
Japan visiting different user groups the
reason my Oracle's reaching out to
developers is the way people buy
software services and products that
really changed now developers have a lot
more control over the technology it's
they use so we want to directly engage
with developers teach them about some
new open-source technologies and then
show them that those technologies were
using run very well on the Oracle cloud
one of the big advantages Oracle has is
having a very large community so by
building on top of our stack you're not
only getting the you know Oracle
products and services which run in our
cloud technology but you're also getting
a lot of community support from folks in
those open source technology commitments
there's over 300 Java user groups
globally Java user groups and the Oracle
user groups they run their own events
they talk about technologies they help
folks get up to speed on how they can
use our cloud technology as a platforms
and you can be part of the community
basically we're traveling across Japan
and stopping at a dozen user groups in
between be a motorcycle so it's a very
efficient way to hit up a bunch of
different communities throughout Japan
it's in the big cities you get large
numbers of developers because there's
large consulting companies a lot of
software development happening
but in the smaller areas of Japan you
get a very local flavor to the
communities and user groups and there's
large user group communities but they
don't always get the attention and the
visibility which they would get normally
if they were in a large public Tokyo on
this tour we have Sebastian - nur who is
a java champion from Germany he's
presenting about cloud native Java
development we have Curtin Pepperdine
who is a internationally known
performance tuning guru and lastly we
have David Della Bosca
who is a Java EE and WebLogic evangelist
for Oracle it's great that we share a
common interest in motorcycling and
we're able to use that to spread a
little bit of our passion about Java to
the global user group
humanity is found to change more in the
next 20 years than in all of human
history we can't predict the changes
every day becomes an invitation to
prepare for the future we want to build
highways without drivers
education without classrooms
Telles care without
two billion jobs will come in though
freeing up talent from any new unknown
burgeoning industries the first

it'll be common to use next-generation

to spread a little bit of our passion
about Java to the global user group
believe every human being is a potential
coder physical mind somebody that likes
to solve puzzles someone who can work
within a team I think I particulars you
have to persevere intelligent enough to
understand the logic of the college have
empathy for their uses the first thing
is patience likes to solve riddles a
good holder is someone who came through
fairly and implement their idea into
home ten years ago we're cutting for
computers but now everything is a
computer a lot of the redundant in the
rudiment which stuff we do as the
developer will be taken over by these
automated processes things like human
brain interfaces and machine learning
and neural networks potentially a new
language that doesn't even exist yet
still believe we have a bright future
despite self-driving cars and the
artificial intelligence interacting with
our keyboard less layoffs I think we're
gonna see a lot more voice interaction
with devices hopefully not computers
coding themselves this would be like how
it's called the singularity right I
could but luckily I code
for me it's like a brain puzzle because
I'm a builder and I I ran out of LEGO
bricks there's a lot of creative juices
that cool when I write code because a
lot making things better coding stuff
it's a fascinating wide open field where
you can do anything then you absolutely
want to do having a problem that you
turn into a solution through code is one
of the most beautiful things in a job
that I can imagine doing
welcome to Oracle code Bangalore my name
is Steven Chen I run the Oracle
developer community group at Oracle of
course very pleased to be able to
announce the second time which we're
running this event here in Bangalore was
anyone fortunate enough to be here last
year okay excellent
thanks very much for coming back again
we have a lot of great content today we
have sessions on machine learning
artificial intelligent chat BOTS AI
block J &amp;amp; databases Java lots of great
technical content for you guys to enjoy
today exciting demos out in the
developer lounge interviews going on all
day today and we also have a special
guest to kick off and introduce the
conference I wanted by he to button up
to the stage she's the chief marketing
officer into you he - welcome Thank You
Steven away good morning to everyone
here
it's existence which is
which is for decades now as a pioneer of
the database and gradual growth across
all pillars layers of technology which
are licensed
which is license or cloud be it size
grass or infrastructure-as-a-service
oracle has been at the helm of
innovation today oracle serves for
30,000 customers in 175 countries closer
home in india we work with 15,000
customers across the public and private
base
additionally oracle globally works with
five million registered members of the
oracle developer community and supports
469 independent user communities in 97
countries so if you look at it this
event designed for developers Oracle
code will provide insights and practices
for tackling development challenges and
opportunities in the cloud
in Greek mythology the torch symbolizes
revolution and human achievement we hope
to inspire the same feeling among the
coding community if code is the light of
the software industry then the developer
community is the torch they go hand in
hand to recognize the community of
developers the people who are the
baseline for everything digital we have
in our lives today we highlight that the
Oracle is a code of friendly company and
to inspire the next generation of
developers let us light the torch today
great thank you very much key to big
round of applause
so today the best way to get information
about the sessions is to use the mobile
application you can download the Oracle
events application go to the Oracle code
Bangalore tab find out the latest
information about when the sessions are
happening we also encourage you to use
Twitter tweet out to hashtag Oracle code
we'll be following this from the at
Oracle devs account so you can also find
the live interview streams on Oracle
code as well and I want to introduce my
special guest here so this is the the
now robot he's an autonomous robot hi
now
hi now hi Steven
how are you doing today very good so
welcome to Oracle code
Wow great to meet you all I am now an
autonomous robot who specializes in
human interaction today I will be in the
developer lounge on Hanson who will
demos to show you that integrate with
the Oracle cloud judgment service please
stop by and have a chat with me can you
tell us about the high team it is great
to see so many women developers enter
lives of women in the audience please
join the women in technology high tea
this afternoon where there will be a
panel of inspirational women developers
can I come
yes you can Steven everyone here at
Oracle code as welcome to come to the
high-g including men women and robots
thanks now thanks for having me and
please enjoy the Oracle code event today
ok so that's now robot you can see him
in the developer lounge later
thank you know
okay without further ado I'd like to
introduce our keynote speaker very glad
to have pratik Patel joining us here on
stage thank thank you very much for
coming out here man
good morning Bangor
thank you can't get started without a
good morning that right there you leave
the robot on Stephen I'll take them with
us check so this morning I'm going to be
talking about service in the Java
ecosystem and before we get started just
want to get an idea of how many people
know what service is okay so a few
people my question to you is are you
sure you know what it is all right so
what we're gonna do in this session is
we're going to talk about service
service architecture and what actually
is service will also do a demo using the
FN project who will talk about where we
currently stand in terms of service
architecture and what it means to
developers
my name is Prateek Patel I run a small
technology startup in the city of
Atlanta
the United States I'm a Java champion
and all these other things so let's jump
right into it and talk about what is
serv list again we'll go over the
architecture we'll also discuss the
ecosystem in some detail so first
question is what actually is service
this is something that is unfortunately
it's a very bad name alright so when we
think of service what is it that we're
actually trying to understand well what
does the 10th term actually mean right
in a lot of ways the the the name is
actually not very good so if you
probably have all seen this movie this
is office space right so it's not so
much about destroying our servers but
there's a guy who's pretty big in in the
Swivl space his name is Kelsey Hightower
and he tweeted this recently he said we
asked ten people to define service when
we got ten thousand different answers
all right so
because service is such a new
architecture a new tack we haven't
defined as a developer community what it
actually means yet right so the the
responses to this tweet were hilarious
actually
so one of the responses was like again
the question is we asked
people who find frivolous and instead of
one line of code we got 10,000
containers right - this is obviously a
joke against micro services in
containers and kubernetes and that the
entire ecosystem and then the answers or
the responses got even weirder right
services geo cities for the enterprise
does anybody remember geo cities from
the late 80s or 90s
some people write few don't remember
this is what it used to look like it was
basically a platform for publishing
stupid web pages or unfortunately
somebody's an archive dude but when we
talk about service yes there are still
servers obviously we have to run our
servers or
locations somewhere
so yes there are servers so it's not
technically serverless right of service
the idea for developers and service is
something that's run in terms of how
much you have to pay your cloud provider
to run your applications but more
importantly for me as a developer it's
about the ease of use and the ease of
deploy
about this a little more detail but this
wave of microservices with lawyers and
kubernetes and
in his Kyo and this entire constellation
of things around Mike returns a bit
overpowering helpful what I want to do
is I want to focus on writing
applications and delivering features and
customers we want to have to worry about
how the poison
you know am i given anything it's cloud
containers is what I want to do
especially this money like mine doesn't
matter if your this vodka a big company
your goal as a developer
build applications employ them as long
as possible and cheaply as possible
right so service is also known as a
couple different things I actually like
these terms much better so a couple of
other terms that people use
interchangeably with surplus it's often
referred to as fast or functions as a
service and sometimes people call them
functions what this means in a few
minutes but again we're trying to define
what service actually means
again there are servers be the overall
kind of metaphor behind services that
and this is why it's called service is
that when we're developing we don't
really think it servers we just think in
terms of applications or functions that
will deploy somewhere
so what we're doing is removing the
metaphor
of the server from our developer and
finds out something push your button and
it gets deployed on that's the idea
that's why deterring the service so
again it's running code without having
to provision servers without having to
think about am i running this in the
docker container and how's it going to
talk and how do I set up the IP
whitelist and other things like that we
don't want to worry about these things
as daughters we just want to write code
build features and deploy them to our
customers
so
the idea behind service
remove the metaphor of the server
and more importantly we remove this
concept of
a DevOps person we just want to be a
developer right
and
behind that somebody else for something
else or something on me
take care
you
it takes care of scalability force takes
care of availability and lots of other
things right so typically when when I
deploy something in a service style I
don't think much about security around
the operating system or the container
that I'm running in and other things
like that I don't care about how I'm
going to configure the network or load
balancers someone else takes care of all
this for me so I can focus on writing my
own code and delivering features to my
customers right but along with this so
service is about two years old or so now
right it was originally started by
Amazon and what's known as Amazon
lambdas okay but since then we've
evolved and the way that we think about
service and an overall architectural
model is also very different so I would
say that service aside from being all
the things I talked about right
push-button deployments and you don't
really worry about all these extraneous
things that developers today have to
worry about it's also a new
architectural model in terms of how we
think of composing our application and
building from a small application to a
medium to a large sized application
that's what we're gonna focus on as we
go through this so one way to think
about this is when the micro computer
came around right people had a IBM PC or
something on their desktop and you would
install some software on it you would
install Excel or Lotus Notes or
something and that's how you would use
or that's how people use computing right
so the shift that we've made over the
last 15 to 20 years in terms of desktop
computing or consumer computing is we
now have software as a service right you
can go to Google sheets for example and
use a spreadsheet directly from a web
browser if your people and your company
use Salesforce they don't install
anything they just open a web browser
they log into salesforce.com and they
have all the things that they may need
to do for marketing and sales management
and CRM and other things like that right
so that's the shift that we've made in
consumer competing over the last 20
years is we've gone from having a micro
computer that has everything installed
on it or you install stuff on it - you
just open a web browser today or your
mobile application on your phone and you
can start using software as a service
similarly when we think of the
enterprise
with what happened with AWS right and
all these other cloud providers is those
were infrastructure as a service
providers and the shift that we're
making today and have been making for
the last couple of years as developers
is we're going from that metaphor of
infrastructure as a service where you
manage servers or virtual servers in the
cloud yourself to going completely
serverless
so this is this jump that we're making
today all right and this is something
that in my opinion is going to be very
big in the next few years especially if
you're developer and especially because
of the things I said it's faster easier
and also cheaper to run a utility in a
service fashion rather than using
infrastructure as a service all right so
if we look at our typical pyramid all
right this is where we are today what we
have is at the bottom we have our
standard infrastructure as a service see
if this works
let me stand over here okay we have our
infrastructure right so this is just
basically your bare metal or virtual
servers running on Oracle cloud IBM
cloud Google cloud whatever it is right
you basically rent a VPS and then you
choose what kind of platform you put on
it typically people put some kind of
Linux or some kind of Linux derivation
on top of that and today where we are
with micro services or this recent surge
in micro services we have our
infrastructure we have our operating
system which is the platform and then we
have containers all right so these are
darker containers and we layer tools on
top using containers right we use docker
and then we might use kubernetes to
scale out hto for composition and other
things like that and then finally at the
very very top this is what we're
concerned with as a developer we're
concerned with the applications that we
have right this is what we normally care
this is what we care about all the time
we care about yes we care about
deployment but we focused most of our
time developing applications right
that's where we spend the majority of
our time thinking about what our
customers need from the requirements and
other things that we get all right so we
build applications that's what things
look like today in the non service world
so what's happened today is right you
can see I've used function as a service
instead of service because I prefer this
term so we still have infrastructure at
the bottom platform and containers but
here right underneath our application we
also have
functions as a service and this is how
we build applications in a service tone
so we sit on top of containers right and
again a lot of this is automated away as
we'll see in a few minutes and we build
our applications by composing functions
right so instead of building small
little bits of code we conceptually
think at a coarser or higher level right
not all the way at the app level but
somewhere in between basic small units
of code and your full application to
construct apps all right so when one
slide too fast
okay so again as a developer I don't
really care about all those things that
are here at the bottom right I don't
care about platforms or infrastructure
or even containers right yes I do care
about them but what I want to focus on
is I just want to focus on these two
things at the top as an application
developer right whether you're building
a web application server side
application java doing machine learning
with python whatever it may be what i
care about are the two things that are
at the top of this pyramid I care about
my applications number one and I build
those applications using functions as a
service or cloud functions and we'll see
what that looks like in just a few
minutes to give you a better idea where
the future is heading and where we're
moving in terms of a developer community
all right
all right so it is a new architecture
what we do is we focus on building
applications and all these
infrastructure things like docker and
kubernetes we don't really care about
these things anymore
all right that's somebody else's job or
maybe it's automated away a lot of this
has been made possible in the service
world by automation right because that's
one of the things that developers are
very good at well good developers are
good at all right good developers what
do they do if they have to do a task
more than once you automated right so
you don't have to keep doing it over and
over manually so we focus on building
applications in a service architecture
we don't worry so much about the
infrastructure stuff that's somebody
else's job or it's something that's
handled by automation okay
so one of the things that we can do as
we're building our own functions as a
service is obviously we'll have to write
our own business logic our own functions
as a service right the code has to come
from somewhere and you have to write
that but as part of this model we also
have the ability to use or reuse
functions that we've created and
functions which are available for
purchase or for free or whatever it may
be and we'll talk about the distinction
between functions as a service and
libraries in just a few minutes we'll
get to that in a sec but let's think
about what this actually means right in
terms of architecture the other core
tenets of service architecture is that
it is an event-driven type of model okay
so what is an event there are all sorts
of different events the events can be
almost anything but it's the conceptual
model around having small units of code
that are triggered or fired by events of
some kind it could be an HTTP call it
could be something coming off a message
queue it could even be some kind of file
system monitor that looks for something
that changes in a file system or trigger
in a database or whatever can be some
kind of event that's the metaphor that
we think about when we think in terms of
service architecture all right so what
are some facets I mentioned something
already right so we have you have a
message queue HTTP call filesystem or
database monitor inbound email or even
saying okay Google or hey Alexa what's
the weather today right anything can be
a trigger for a service function it's
not necessarily something that's very
very constrained right something that
evokes functions so at this point you
might be thinking okay if this sounds
great new architectural model I buy into
this but have we been doing this already
have we've been using servlets style or
service architectural style programming
already and the short answer is you
probably have I know I have so I'll give
you an example so this is a feature in
our application the application is a
mobile app but again in service style
architecture the event can come from
anywhere and the event can be anything
in this case the event or the initial
trigger event is just a restful HTTP
call
right but what we do for this specific
feature in our application if this is
what we call an image translator you
basically I'm in Bangalore
I don't speak or read the language here
I get a receipt that I have to file for
expenses all right so what I can do is I
can take a picture of that and our
application goes into the cloud hits our
functions that we have our service
functions that we have in the cloud or
cloud functions and it does these three
things it orchestrates these three
different things so first it does an
image OCR but so obviously it has to
read this menu or this receipt or
whatever it may be so we do an image OCR
first and then we have to do a
translation from whatever that languages
into English so that the user or me
knows what's going on on that specific
thing and then we have our own business
logic that we've wrapped inside of our
own function as a service so our startup
is pretty good but we're not so good
that we wrote our own image OCR right
because this is I think that's a very
complex problem and would have taken
this a long time to do same thing for
translation all right for the
translating from Hindi into English for
French into English or whatever it may
be we didn't write our own translation
service what we do is we use cloud
functions that already exist to do both
of those things and we weave them
together and we have our own function as
a service that adds our proprietary
business logic to complete this feature
so we actually have been doing this for
years so we rolled out this feature I
think about four or five years ago and
we've been using functions as a service
we didn't even know it right so we use
image OCR basically say here's an image
don't read it for us and tell us what
the results are we take that we feed it
into another pre-existing cloud function
that does translation of that
ocr'd data and then we have our own
function as a service that takes those
results a prize applies a proprietary
algorithm to it to make the results
better than just straight translation
right so we've been doing functions as a
service for a while and we have all this
running in a single instance and it
basically wakes up the event is a HTTP
call
coming in with image data and we get
data out of it that shows the results as
you can see here on the bottom right so
you can see that it's translated ooh
this is going crazy so you can see that
it's translated from whatever the
original language was into English okay
so the short answer is that we probably
you probably have been actually already
doing some kind of service computing or
functions as a service or cloud
functions already okay but now what we
need to do as a developer community is
understand how this fits into an overall
model and how we can build all of our
applications to take advantage of this
easier and cheaper way of deploying and
running applications in the cloud all
right so there are lots of conch shion's
that are already available if you use
Twilio to send an SMS text message
you're using cloud function if you use
stripe or some other payment gateway
like PayPal you say here's a credit card
this is how much I need to charge this
customer you're using a function as a
service already right etc accent image
resize sending emails so all these
things already exist
and we're using them today already all
right so what's the next leap that we
need to take in terms of an
architectural shift what we do today is
when we want to use some functionality
that's not provided for us what do we
typically do we reach for a library
write whatever the library is say we're
parsing CSVs or we need to do an OCR
character recognition on the image what
we'll do in again it doesn't matter if
you're doing this in Java or in Python
or Annette or any other language right
we reach for library and we say okay we
need to do this thing we're going to
include this library in our application
we're going to use the API that the
library provides us and that will give
us the functionality so that we don't
need to write this right as developers
we've got really good at reusing things
and we do reuse today by libraries so
the architectural shift that we're
making now is instead of importing a
library into our application what we
want to do in a servlet style
architecture is we want to think well
maybe we don't need a library to do this
specific thing maybe what we do is we
find a cloud function that already
exists
maybe my teammate over here wrote this
other cloud function for example for
doing authentication right because in
your company not everybody is going to
write an authentication algorithm or
whatever right you you have somebody in
your company right at once and then the
other developers in the company will use
that so that you don't have to reinvent
the wheel hundred times so instead of
including a library to do authentication
all right what a lot of people do today
is they prop up some kind of HTTP
endpoint and they say this is the
endpoint this is what you invoke the
endpoint with and this is how you can
authenticate and get some kind of token
or cookie or oo or whatever it may be
back all right so this is the
architectural shift that we have to make
as developers when we start thinking in
terms of architecting a service
application we don't think ok let's
reach for this authentication library or
for this library to do image recognition
or whatever it may be what we do is we
think let's see if there's a cloud
function that I can use that can pass
the data to that we'll go and run this
thing for me and give me the results all
right so this is our specific
architectural shift that we have to make
as developers so when we think of a
function as a service at what level of
granularity how much code is in a single
function as a service the the basics
around this are kind of vague but when
we think of a function as a service we
think of it as being a small unit of
work it's not something that contains a
whole feature necessarily it contains
one small thing or a couple of small
things which are related right and they
generally should be single purpose when
we write a cloud function because the
idea behind the cloud function is that
aside from being small it should also
execute very quickly it shouldn't take
forever to run and of course when we say
execute very quickly exactly how long
does that mean the answer is it depends
if you're doing image OCR it might take
a second or two but if you're doing
something like authentication it should
be sub-second maybe maybe maybe 100 or
200 milliseconds it should be very fast
we want to weave this together or weave
these cloud functions together to
produce a overall application that may
take much longer to execute so your
functions as a service should be small
and should have a well-defined API also
from short running your function as a
service for your cloud function should
also be stateless alright so this is
where people generally say well I can't
how do you build something if it's
completely stateless it doesn't mean
that your application is stateless it
just means that that specific function
as a service or cloud function is
stateless right but we obviously
obviously need to have state in our
application you have a user that comes
to your website for example and you know
for building something like a shopping
or shopping cart application you you
want to remember what the user has put
into their cart as they navigate from
page to page or look at different items
and then at the end you want to
calculate everything do payments and all
those kinds of things so you do have to
have state but the function itself
shouldn't have state the state should be
external to the function because you
don't necessarily know when the next
call comes in from your user that it's
gonna land on that exact same instance
of your function running in the cloud so
the function can reach into a database
or something like Redis or whatever it
may be whatever you using to store state
right again could be database could be
Redis whatever right so you can reach
into that and say the users come back
here's their token give me all the stuff
that they put in their shopping cart so
far right so it's state is there but
it's external to the function alright so
this is one of the core tenants go grab
state it's there but your function
itself should be stateless right which
is a big difference than how we write
web applications today the other thing
around functions as a service is we
generally model them in two different
ways synchronous and asynchronous
because there are certain cases where
when you're building a function you may
say you know what I don't really want
the result right now I'm gonna go do
these other things for a bit so go and
run this function with this data and
then I'll come back at some point in the
future and get the results and there's
several different reasons for doing that
architectural you may say I just don't
need the data yet or the users doing
something else or it may be that the
function is doing some kind of
long-running task and you don't want to
wait for it and block the user from
moving ahead
okay so functions cloud functions can be
both synchronous and asynchronous
depending on the specific situation in
which you wish to build them how you
wish to architect your specific
application okay so again async is for
long-running code you get back an ID and
using that ID coming can come and get
the results at some point in the future
when you're ready to go and get them
okay so let's do a quick kind of
demonstration of some of the fast
implementations that are available in
the Java space okay and I believe after
this session there's a deep dive into
the FM project so they'll show you like
exactly how some of this comes together
what I want to talk about is convey the
idea the concept of server lists and
what it means architectural okay oh one
thing to remember let me go back to the
slide one thing to remember is that even
though what I'm going to talk about is
fast implementations in Java the client
can be anything the client can be a web
browser right JavaScript or it could be
a Python application running somewhere
it doesn't matter as long as you define
your endpoint in the appropriate way and
you make that public and you know you
have some documentation around it the
person calling it can be anyone it
doesn't have to be Java alright so the
first one I want to talk about is the FN
project alright and this is something
that's sponsored by Oracle it is
completely open source and again
there'll be a longer demonstration after
my talk also what's popular this has
been around for a bit longer something
called open Wisc it's open source and I
believe it's an Apache project or it's
an incubator but one of the nice things
about open wisk as well as FN project is
that you don't have to build your
functions in Java you can also build
them in JavaScript or Python or go or
whatever so almost all these serve those
frameworks support multiple languages
that you can implement the actual
functions with so you're not constrained
with necessarily just writing things in
Java okay so and the third one is Amazon
lambda of course so this is the one that
is the oldest and also it's been around
for a while
supports multiple things but there are
certain things with Amazon lambda as
developers that with developers that
I've talked to don't really like a lot
of the stuff you have to do with lambdas
you have to do in the cloud it's kind of
difficult to do local development and
all the things like that right but
they're working on solving those
problems so let's do a quick flyby of
the FN project so that you're ready for
the deep dive in the next one
so what we do is we do have to have
docker running on our laptop and we fire
up the FN server by doing FN start and
then when we want to create a new
project we say FN in it one time in this
case we pick Java and we give it a name
and then we can just go and immediately
execute it from this command line again
using FN so you have to install the FN
project on your laptop or on your
development machine and you do have to
have docker running it uses darker
underneath the hood but all that stuff
is kind of hidden from you through these
command line utilities and what does the
specific Java implementation actually
look like it's pretty straightforward so
when you're writing and when you're
writing these things in this case you
can see we just have one cloud function
and also generates a test for you but if
we look at the hello function not Java
but this is what it looks like and what
we care about is this specific thing
here all right we say public strengths
or interfaces right here at the top
handle requests and in this case we're
just taking a string as an input and
we're returning a string as an output
all right but that input and out can be
anything you want it doesn't have to be
something as simple as a string give me
an array some kind of JSON data
structure whatever you want write
whatever is appropriate for the specific
application that you're building ok so
once we have this what we can do is we
can do it F and run which does the local
execution for testing or for development
or whatever and just a local execution
but when we want to run it inside of the
F in project server we set up the
registry we tell the FN command line to
deploy that specific application using
this name and then we can go list all
the things that are deployed inside of
that FN project server which is just a
docker container running your code ok so
again the folks coming on after me was
going to do a deep dive of this I don't
want to go too much into this but
how easy it is and this is one of the
great things about service development
in my opinion is that it takes away a
lot of the friction that we encountered
when we want to build a project and we
want to deploy right again as a
developer what I'm interested in is
building great applications building
code getting stuff out to market as
quickly as possible for my customers and
as cheaply as possible as well right so
one of the the one of the other things
that are included in the FN project is
that it does have an embedded database
for persistent storage right remember we
talked about how functions are supposed
to be stateless where do you store that
state in the case of the FN project
actually comes with the database built
in I typically tend to use a Redis store
because it's an in-memory store that I
can cluster very easily behind my
functions but the FN project comes with
the store and also comes with the
message queue so that you can do
serialized
executions of functions as you wish
right so these are all architectural
things that come together that allow you
to build a complete application inside
of the FN project in a server style
right so a couple of other things that
come with the FN project they're
building out something called F and flow
that allows you to orchestrate multiple
function calls cuz if you remember
functions are supposed to do one thing
and not a whole bunch of different
things or a group of related things so
what we typically do as you saw in the
OCR example that I gave is we call this
function we take that data might do
something with it call this other
function call another function to
compose a complete application right so
let's look at the orchestration bit very
quickly all right so hopefully what this
will do is this will give you an idea of
what granularity you should be building
your cloud functions or your service
applications alright this is the
approximate correct level of coarseness
that your functions as a service should
have okay so for example we have
something that we need to book flights
and canceled flights so we'll have a
single service function that does both
booking and cancellation the flights
let's say that we need to book a car or
cancel a car reservation thermally we'll
write a single
servlets function that does that and you
can see we have a couple other things
hotel bookings right and emailing the
the final details to the actual user etc
right but this is the correct level
coarseness that we want to think about
when we think of building stuff in a
service architectural style it's not
super low level right so we're not
saying okay let's take a flight or I
want to book a flight that has these
specific details from these airports and
blah blah blah yes we passed that in but
the verbs that we use here are very
simple we have this function that has
two endpoints booked and canceled and
that's about the level of granularity
that you want to keep things when you're
building stuff in a service
architectural stop okay so for the
effing project you can deploy this on
your own servers or you can deploy it
into the Oracle cloud and to make the
friction even less Oracle is going to be
offering managed instances where you
don't even have to set anything up you
basically just say I want FM project
server running somewhere in the cloud
and as you saw here when we wanted to
deploy this locally we set up this FN
registry right and we said this is where
we want to do the deployment so in the
future what you'll do is you'll
basically just use your registry name
that's provided and you could set this
up on your own currently on any cloud
provider the FN project is open source
so but the Holy Grail is having managed
instances where I can just go to a
website and say I want an FN project
deployment just click a button it's set
up it gives you back a key and that's
all you have to do as a developer you
don't have to worry about setting up
doctor or kubernetes or C or master or
any of that other stuff basically you
write your application push a button or
from the command line you set something
up and it deploys it for you
automatically okay so let's do a quick
comparison matrix between the different
fast implementations which are out there
there's open wisk project F an open fast
cublas service project
there's bunch of these right now so as
you know when tech takes off or when a
new type of tech takes off a lot of
people build implementations and
at this point in the surveillance game
we're still very early on so when we
think of what Amazon offers and what the
f-m project and open whisk and all these
they support multiple platforms right so
if we want to look at a comparison
matrix for this
unfortunately the space is moving so
fast things change very rapidly so for
example if you use Google Cloud Google
cloud currently supports cloud functions
but they only support wanting them in
JavaScript currently they don't support
writing them in any other language AWS
lambdas can be written in Java
JavaScript Go Python and multitude of
other platforms right but my point with
this slide is that we don't really know
where the space is going we have an idea
where it's going but it's moving so
rapidly that things are changing very
quickly that we don't exactly know what
the future holds three or six months
from now yes you can build server
service applications the market is
evolving very quickly currently we have
loads of service applications out there
right now so it's not something that you
have to wait for all right you don't
have to think yourself well we don't
know what the future holds right now but
if you're building something with Java
you can use the FN project or you can
use amadon lambdas but you can't use
Google Cloud functions currently to do
that you will be in the future as my
guess but all these things are evolving
the way we think about orchestration and
security in the cloud is also evolving
very quickly okay but that's one of the
reasons I like service functions is for
me as an app developer I can focus on
exactly what I want to do to get an
application out to my customer as
quickly as possible and I don't have to
worry about security and deployment and
all those other things around it right
and it will just get better over time so
are we at a point where we're ready to
destroy our servers right maybe sold
right now is is this right yes this is
great
currently building stuff using libraries
and we've always spent a lot of time and
resources building out our microservices
architecture and we're starting to
understand what micro services mean and
how we should orchestrate micro services
and how we should split our application
into smaller micro services right and if
you're doing that currently and you like
it by all means continue to do it but
if you want to leapfrog ahead of the
microservices looking into service
architecture and writing stuff in a
service style is probably now's a great
time to do it you can get onboard early
you can start thinking about how you can
structure your project with a service
architecture with some of the things
I've given here and we can get a better
idea of how we build stuff in the future
right so we're not quite ready to
destroy our servers quite yet but one of
the things that I tell folks is that
I've said that yes it is cheaper in
terms of how much money I spend to host
my application in the cloud using a
service infrastructure or service
architectural stuff and the reason for
that is is all of their service
providers specifically we talked about
AWS and Amazon lambdas what they do is
they only bill you for the exact amount
of time that your function actually runs
for other cloud instances so say you go
and just get like a mini or large or
whatever instance on AWS or Oracle cloud
or whatever what do you do you pay for
every second that you own that server
right so you pay monthly fee or weekly
say you fire up the server and you're
using infrastructure as a service you
pay for that five days or that one week
or however much time that you are
actually using and on that server
whereas in the service world again
because we're whittling everything down
to such a small thing you only pay for
the exact amount of time that your app
is actually executing so let's say that
your service function right we'll just
make this a little bit simple let's say
you have one service function that
service function takes 200 milliseconds
to execute every time you call it and
you call it a thousand times a day
you only pay one one thousand times 200
milliseconds of execution time okay so a
classic case study in this space is
there's a online travel portal called
Expedia does Expedia exist here in India
okay so you're familiar with Expedia
they basically took their infrastructure
or their cloud costs from 6 to 7 million
dollars per month to about 500 to 600
thousand dollars by using
serverless architecture right because
again you only pay for that small slice
of time that your function is actually
executing and that's where the cost
savings come in okay but as this slide
says as a developer sometimes the actual
cost of running something in the cloud
doesn't really matter to me that much
right if I'm expedient I'm spending
seven million dollars yes it does right
but for us we maybe spend one hundred to
two hundred dollars per month on servers
in the cloud at my startup
all right so it doesn't really mean a
lot to me what I really care about is
how long does it take me to get a
feature ready out the door and into the
hands of my customers it's the time to
market that I really care about and on
top of that the other thing right
because developers are expensive
everybody in this room gets paid real
money right it's the cost of development
the cost of the actual developer for
myself and the three developers who are
on my team how long does it take us to
build a feature in terms of engineering
time because engineering time is money
right having a developer working on
something is money that cost often is
very large compared to the actual cost
that I'm paying to have a server running
in the cloud somewhere so it's the time
to market that I care about and it's how
long or how much time does it take how
many resources do I have to put into
building out a feature that's the other
main thing to care about yes I care
about how much I pay for infrastructure
costs but that's the least of my
concerns I care about those two other
things more okay so thank you for
listening I have some references here
the slides are available online and I'll
turn it back over to Stephen thanks
everybody
hey thanks so much so I would like to
invite our next presenter on stage we're
gonna have some presentations on
chatbots machine learning some cool
demos that you guys will get to enjoy so
Ravi Pinto please join me oh how are you
doing are you doing I'm gonna steal
something from you oh you don't need
this all right yeah I thought people
might not know me so you're more famous
than you think
hey good morning it's always nice to see
a full house
to talk about some stuff that we are
doing in Oracle and thanks pratik for
for taking us through the that
serverless you know bit that was very
inviting and we will be talking about
some of these several s stuff so let me
just get this on alright so we're going
to do some some stuff but before I do
that I have to tell you that there are
some things that I'm going to talk about
which are going to happen in the future
okay and therefore whenever you are
deciding or taking a technology decision
you must check what exactly you know
what status that particular service for
example is so in this particular case I
will be talking about blockchain which
is not yet available but but that's case
in point so you might be thinking what
exactly is Oracle doing with a developer
event I know that some of you are here
in the last code I did see hands go up
but you know everybody tells us you are
a database company right yes we do build
the best database in the world but we
also do a lot of stuff in the
application development area you may or
may not be aware of it and therefore I
just wanted to give you an idea of the
stuff that we've been doing these are
some of the open source
projects that we support that we sponsor
that we contribute to and we invite you
know developers to join in into these
projects and and you know contribute as
well and you know through all this
through all the interactions that we're
having with customers with developers
with partners worldwide we see certain
trends and we want to share that
information with you get feedback from
you and also tell you what we are
building in these areas which can be
helpful or which you could leverage in
your own application development right
so these are the broad trends you know
that serverless there is the chat bots
how everything is moving to no ops you
know pratik talked a little bit about it
and I'll just give you a bit of more
idea on that blockchain how many of you
have heard about Bitcoin oh yeah I did
expect that I should have actually asked
how many of you have not heard of
Bitcoin so Bitcoin is powered by this
underlying technology or concept called
blockchain and you know people are
looking at how to implement blockchain
in the context of a business application
and will actually be building something
on that so prety talked about this I
won't talk a lot but serverless to me
looks like Cinderella's fairy tale how
many of you do remember Cinderella's
fairy tale oh well we did go to nursery
together right so in Cinderella's fairy
tale you know the the carriage that
Cinderella is going to be taken to is
created out of the pumpkin right and
then when the party is over that
carriage goes away you know just like
you know it becomes goes back into
pumpkin the serverless looks like that
to me right so you want to invoke a
service and boom the server is created
for you on the fly and as soon as that
execution is done
back you know that particular instances
is destroyed that that's like
Cinderella's fairy tale but let's look
at some one other trend what is the
spawning &amp;amp; pratik talked about this this
is actually moving developers who were
all the time had moved into DevOps
to look at something called no ops okay
how many things can be automated or how
things are automated so that you do not
spend time or you know your precious CPU
cycles in doing something that probably
should be taken care by automation right
and therefore if you are looking at
service as one of the paradigms what
you're also looking at is this whole
headache goes away of what we have
instance you should pick up you know how
how to run it whether you should know
Linux or not etc etc right so that's the
other trend that we see open-source is
the is the third trend that we'd want to
talk about and essentially you would
realize that you know all of us are
consumers of open source but there are
projects that we sponsor FN project is
one of them
Oracle jet is another one which is a
javascript you know based library that
that's again open source you can build
your applications using Oracle jet and
if you are looking at what are the other
projects that we do in containers in
kubernetes etc you could go to our
github page look at the projects and if
you're interested you can join in and
contribute over there
FN project is is today one of you know
one of the most contributed to projects
that we are sponsoring ok all right
let's go ahead now that's the trend from
the perspective of building application
and here's another trend which sort of
you know makes me think
have you really progressed when four
thousand years ago Egyptians were
communicating with each other using sign
language
or you know these icons and look what we
are back at I hate we are back into
emojis so however that's not the lighter
note but on a on a more serious note we
do see trend of applications being built
or front-ends actually changing into
chat bots right so you have this channel
like whatsapp messenger WeChat line etc
that people are are more comfortable
conversing with and these are the
channels that then are going and talking
to applications which is a totally
different way of doing things
so generally applications would mean go
to the menu select an item you know a
form comes up enter data and then you go
ahead from there right the server
processes that particular data that
you've submitted but in case of chatbot
and I'll show you a demo of this you are
conversing with the application that's a
very different paradigm that defines or
that requires different skill sets
different way of thinking how you are
going to design application so this is
another trend that you should you know
you should be aware of I talked a little
earlier about this so a lot of
businesses are not really interested in
you know mining bitcoins or or creating
another currency cryptocurrency but as
the as the frontiers of Commerce and and
you know economy increases as more and
more businesses across borders are
talking to each other without really
knowing whom to trust as a central
authority blockchain becomes a very very
important technology for these parties
to trust each other okay and I'll
illustrate this when we actually go into
the demo that we will that we'll talk
about and then of course I cannot but
not talk about AI nml right machine
learning you know it's not that it's new
if you go back and and look at the whole
computing you know whole computing area
ai and ml are something that were
started back in 60s this was one of the
cool research area for a lot of computer
programmers that you and I probably know
of but it's not really it hadn't really
gained traction you know beyond the labs
and the reason for that is a you need a
very large data set to actually train
the the machine learning algorithms that
was not available but today that is we
are generating data like tons of you
know tons or gigabits gigabytes every
day and the other thing was this
computing computing power that you need
so you have lot of data you have an
algorithm that needs to run on that data
so obviously you need a lot of computing
power and with cloud coming in that's
exactly what you have available now so
the ml the machine learning is going to
be a trend that you should be aware of
you should look at and you will see more
and more applications more and more
services using them we have an entire
set of you know services that we are
building which we call autonomous
because one part of that autonomous is
to learn from the way services are being
invoked and how it can be optimized so
in fact in our SAS we have something
called adaptive intelligence you
interact with our SAS application it
learns over a period of time runs
algorithms and then gives you a more
optimized way of interacting with that
particular application so this is an
area that is definitely going to grow in
the coming years so what are we going to
do we are going to take some of these
areas so serverless chatbots and
blockchain in this particular case and
we are going to create or show you a
demo of how to create applications in
the new world it's not actually new
pratik said that he has already been
running serverless for quite some time
so it's not new we are still coding we
are still writing application
but what we are going to show you is a
paradigm a different paradigm of
building applications so what are we
what are we going to do we are going to
do a buy and sell cards application okay
and what does that mean is that we will
show you interaction into this cycle by
using chat BOTS we are going to show you
how this entire thing can be can be
interacted with server lists to get you
some data about the car being bought or
sold and then where do you store all
this data in a non reputable way right
so here is here is someone who wants to
sell a car and obviously he does not
have time to you know go into a website
and and start doing finding out you know
what's the what's a good value for his
car so what he is doing here is he is
accessing the the dealership why are a
chat bot okay
so he's not going into website typing
URL or doing Google for a dealership a
car dealership he's just using the chat
bot interface to say that he is
interested in selling a car now this is
the second part and the second part is
that here is a developer who is using or
who's created this chat bot interface
for buying and selling cars right and
that that whole development is not
really coding okay so we will talk about
how this particular chat bot is being
built and then this particular chat bot
when you are interacting with it it's
going to make calls into the functions
to find out information about the car is
the car you know what the value of the
car is right so there is a rating agency
is the car involved in some criminal you
know criminal case which you know sort
of brings the value down for the car so
that's that's what the cloud function is
going to do and then all the information
about
actual trading would go into the
blockchain because here there are two
dealerships
which are interacting with each other
there is no central authority that will
say oh yeah this transaction is okay so
they are trusting the technology okay
when you sell the car that's going to
make an entry into blockchain and when
someone buys the car that's going to
make another entry into blockchain and
these will be non reputable because the
system ensures that the records cannot
be tampered with okay all right so
having said that this is an overall view
okay and what we are going to do is show
you the the chat interface remember this
interface is very different than the UI
interface that you usually use that's
going to do some stuff so I'll show you
in that demo and then we have a cloud
function that makes a call and finds out
the rating the information about the car
and if the person is interested it goes
makes an entry into the blockchain and
then the same data is leveraged by the
cell function so with that I will now
you know switch over to to the demo okay
so I'm going to you know change the
cable here give me a second I'm going to
hook up my phone and I also hope that
the you know the demo gods are favorable
to me yeah I should probably say a
prayer you know so this is facebook
Messenger how many of you are not using
facebook Messenger Wow okay man so what
do you use whatsapp only interesting
because if you're building BOTS whatsapp
does not really allow you to you know
make a bot available it's against their
business or terms of you know terms and
conditions so what we are going to do
here is I've got you know I've already
been chatting trying to sell my cart you
can see that so this is Bob's dealership
and this is the chat interface so
obviously I'm going to be very very
polite and say hi okay and well I hope
you I hope they're not okay they're
online well it's always online 24 by 7
so what do I want to do I want to sell a
car okay well obviously they're happy
because you know NAB Accra and I since
they are looking for my number plate I'm
going to yeah you can say that I've been
clicking a lot of photos oh yeah they're
so send this particular you know license
plate yeah it's it's a California
license plate I do have you know like
moonlighting that I do in the US can you
upload recent picture of your car yes I
can you know I just snagged it from
somewhere one tell where okay that gets
uploaded so if you remember protects you
know presentation he talked about OCR
you know you you upload an image and OCR
happens as a cloud function so that's
that's something that's happening over
here as well so what you see here is
already information about the card which
says it's a Lexus so-and-so and I'm
going to go into yes I want some more
detail at this point in time there's
another cloud function that's being
invoked and that is essentially giving
me some details about the car is this
correct yes it is correct and what's the
mileage on the car so I'm going to give
a pretty small number because this is a
new car 1100 well so here is the
information against being being pulled
using a function which says here is what
you know a particular rating agency is
telling that the fair value of the car
is but you know what will give you you
know ten thousand dollars more because
it's a new cards not really used much
and do you want to sell it I'm obviously
yes
that's how a chadam will why not so okay
so they're happy and they're saying that
you know they'll start off the
documentation so let's now go back okay
so how exactly did we create this
particular interface and if you're
thinking that you know we wrote a lot of
code well you are wrong we did not write
a lot of code okay what we did do was we
defined what is called as an intent so a
chatbot is always going to do a certain
set of activities which are called
intents and those intents if you see
over here is written as cell car and by
car
those are the intents those are the
things that the bot will understand will
process for you right now when you when
someone says or someone has the
intention of selling car what is the
conversation that they are going to do
with the bot that is what you see in the
examples okay there are certain
utterances that this is what the user is
going to say and by the way we also
support an LP right natural language or
natural language processing which means
that even if you were to give you know
sort of different you know like
different values so instead of cell car
you are saying cell Lexus or by Lexus
Alois it will understand that you
essentially want to sell you know a
Lexus car so that is what's being
written over here and what you see on my
left hand side your right hand side is a
testing panel that allows you to find
out given a conversation is the
intention being correctly found out
right is the BOD able to figure out what
the intention
nay's so there is I want to make dollars
of my Lexus now the board is confused
okay the bot is not sure whether you
want to sell or you want to buy and what
you can do at this point in time is out
of the two intents that are there which
is showing almost same confidence level
you can select one of them and say add
example and that will become you know
something that the bot learns you know
using the trainer's that we have within
this particular bot framework okay so
essentially then whenever you say I want
to make dollars from from my Lexus or
off my Lexus it's going to understand
that you want to sell a car okay so
we've seen the chat bot interaction what
we'll do now is look at the serverless
part and for this I will call upon Shiva
to come and talk about the serval aspect
Shiva thank you
thank you to me welcome so bunch of
tanks to pratik for reducing majority of
the introduction part so FN project as I
mentioned put it back
FN project is a open source project
Apache 2.0 license and it is completely
baseline on docker containers and one
good part is you can run on your laptops
you can run on any cloud or any of your
servers and on-premises and another
important thing is working independently
monitors this but we have a
representation in cloud native computing
foundation for a f'n project what is a
function before the protec introduced
functions as a service and server less
computing both so less computing I don't
want to give 10,000 definitions as you
mentioned there are a category of cloud
services that abstracts much of the
operations things infrastructure
operations things deploying the server
provisioning of the servers killing of
the server patching of the server
etcetera so probably from the ops do no
ops whatever he was mentioning it what
of it
and functions as a service ease
especially the compute portion in the
infrastructure within the service
architecture and function typically in a
mathematical term right we where is a
piece of code which accepts multiple
inputs and which can give multiple
outputs probably with a disclaimer over
there that one input at any point in
time maps to one of the outputs now in
FN project couple of components what he
introduced with e typically there will
be a server component F in server which
typically process all the function cards
and within the architecture you could
see multiple other components as well
there will be a queue if you want to
invoke functions in a synchronous fire
all the function requests will be
uploaded to the queue and there will be
a repository which builds here link
between the function versus where the
function curve based or an image is
available as a repository and a registry
where your actual images of your doctor
are going to lie there are other
components probably we can dig more and
one of the component that introduced was
F inflow okay we have multiple functions
defined but to build applications out of
the functions we need a different
programming model all together that can
stitch each of these functions and
deliver an application to that so when
he showed a travel application right we
have a booking a car booking a flight
booking a hotel etcetera everything so
indicate any individual functions they
are self sufficient functions now I want
you to need each other to give you a
feel of an application so that is where
F and flow is giving us a opportunity to
do the composition of individual
functions and delivering an application
for that right in this particular use
case you can look at my chart bot
interface he is going to invoke a
function to sell a card so that is going
to be one of the one of the top-level
functions that chatbot is going to in
work but my composition is something
like that before invoking the blockchain
blockchain service my composition is
splitted with a function flow
architecture in multi dimension here the
initially my root function is going to
call carfax to get more details about
the car if I have multiple cars it has
to image the details for multiple cars
then I wanted to do individual criminal
lookup functions means whether this
particular car has any background of
accidents or any kind of illegal
activities that got involved over here
so FBI lookup and international lookup
two different functions are there now F
and flow
is completely developed with the Java
API and in especially in Java 8 onwards
we have a complete stage API we can
leverage that FN flow architecture
leverages that come complicities api to
give a CLI as big a programming
interface for developers so you can see
the invoke function where the future
flow is the route flow is going to be
invoked with a particular thing and that
composes multiple things again it
composes carfax report and criminal luca
lookup and which has a combination of
fpn into international luca functions
when it completes it goes to blockchain
these are all putting under one code
base you can see the code base here I am
just defining a flow initially that flow
is going to invoke a function called
process a car if I have multiple cars I
am going to process individual cross
means I leverage Java threads over there
then I want you to compose carfax and
criminal luca and criminal look up again
it has two different function
international and FBI once everything is
done i'm going to finish the flow or
invoke the other component so i'm going
to give a small demonstration of a
simple hello world function that pratik
has shown in the PowerPoint and later I
will show the demonstration of F and
flow as well okay again small prayer
goes to the Democrats so I just started
F ends over here
I just pressed I just pre-populated a
couple of things to save the time here
so I just pre-populated the service
start part here F in start then
typically what I do here is create a
small function here I'm going to
initiate with a runtime of any
programming language I can go
I can use go language or Java language
or no language or anything I'm going to
give a name for this person function
Oracle code Bangalore function now you
can see it has created a folder called
Oracle code bangla function with a
runtime Java and a complete boilerplate
template has been created now so I'm
going to just going getting into the
folder over here just see this it has a
function ml file and a pom dot XML file
especially for Java if I need to package
something I'm going to leverage here the
maven package manager so firm dat XML
file is been created here by default and
a structure of your unit test cases with
a J unit and a code base with a simple
hello function has been created now if
you want to see what is mentioned in
this code base now you can just see here
what is it mentioned
hello function which has a mother curved
handle request which is taking this
particular method is going to be called
when a function is going to invert and I
need to mention about this in the
descriptive file
so whenever a function call comes invoke
this particular function if there is no
input I just get hello world otherwise
I'll get whatever the parameter I am
going to give it and please
previously mentioned that function
retrieves
expects the input in a typical STD in
format and I can pipe any of the ester
dean to call the functions and it emits
a CD out and any errors that goes to a
steady error now another thing is ml
file just see the ml file what it is
mentioned is my function name version
runtime is this command is invoke handle
request here this is what is going to be
invoked every time I have two different
images here build image and run image
typically when you compile your code
base BT any language Java or go or any
language right you need with a complete
set of libraries but during the runtime
you can skim it down to a few libraries
so typically we also follow during the
build of this particular function we use
a different image but when you run it we
load a different image now to run this
function typically I can use F and run
so it is going to build an image and
invoke a function now you can see I got
the response here all over I'm just in
working locally now if I want to give an
input to this so I can do a simple
piping here manglu F and run
he's going to create the image again and
given the response
hello Anglo so what if I want to reach
the dysfunction with my offense over so
that the external component my
chalkboard can talk to this this pretty
simple a friend deploying I need to map
this function and nest a particular name
one one application can hold multiple
functions together I'm going to give a
respective context path when I'm
invoking it I'm going to give verbal
code Bangalore application and where do
I want to register this I'm running my
offense over locally here so I just keep
local here just to save the time now my
my function image is being mapped and an
entry is created in my repository
whenever I make a call to this I'm going
to get an entry from my repository and
that shows the link to the registry
where my docker image is available okay
typically if you want to see how this
particular docker image is being created
I can run this with a verbose you can
see here it is kicking starting the
creation of the darker and invoking the
function and my daugher goes down
immediately similarly now I have
registered I can call this with my CLI
directly working code dangler
application and with the context Proteus
Oracle code Bangalore function I can
directly cook this I'm getting the
response so similarly piping under the
setter I can do it but if my chart but
wanted to do the invocation typically it
expects a REST API it may not use the
CLI I don't I don't need to install the
CLI or there so in that case I can I can
typically do a curling HTTP colon
localhost this where I have registered
and my FN server is running at a tea a
teapot
and working code bang do application
slash bang function I can just make a
problem I can get the response this is
how our body is going to get integrated
with my functions here now let me move
to another area and the where I wanted
to show you a bigger picture of
composing multiple functions and calling
this in our use case I have a code base
here you can see it I have a carfax
function I have get our function
probably multiple cars are there for
selling I can fetch it multiple cars and
find CARFAX report for individual
functions right and have a criminal look
up for multiple cause individually so I
can do that hi how I have a flow
component another function which is
going to be my entry point extorting
this this flow component is going to
fetch all the cars and initially execute
getting the power facts report and
criminal lookups etcetera okay now what
I have done is I just started this
within my start script I just started
already all four different functions are
running already here what is there in
this start if you want to have a look at
yes
I'm starting individual components
docker images I'm just running it once
all these applications are running now
I'm deploying all the applications each
and every application is nothing but a
function or here it is deployed and an
API is exposed out you can see by car is
a function Carfax is a function of
criminal a cop is a function and a flow
component is another function this
function is going to call these rest of
the three functions okay just to save
the time I just pre-populated hit OK now
if you want to really see all the
functions are running you can see here
my FN server is running I have a flow
server and these particular functions
are being already registered now I can
call them I'm going to call a function
call
I wrapped all these functions under one
application name work occurred now the
flow is the function that is going to
kick-start rest of the functions now
while kicking this right I have a user
interface here that depicts the
invocation of this and we can see get
cars in get cars I'm going to get
multiple cars so two cars are there the
four and seven this is what Java threads
you can see it for individual function
calls in new thread is coming to cross
or cars are there so individual cars are
being processed now the first car I am
getting the Carfax and criminal look up
second car for Carfax and criminal look
up you can see it so at the end once it
is done it is going to invoke it's going
to combine all the reports together and
invoke the appropriate blockchain API
now I wanted to see what happened when I
invoked it let me just zoom down so that
I can see it get cause when I invoke it
cause it written me two different okay
it is Jim I hope you can see it two
different license plate numbers two cars
are there for selling okay and it's
going to this this has been invoked from
a main call now I'll just go up pick up
one of the one of the cars that are
being processed and carfax report of the
rest respective one now you can see the
flow here
how these complete stays API is being
called the main call get cars for the
first car then applied then compose I'm
getting into the processing the car this
particular one
okay then compose and generating a
carfax report for this one these are the
functions are being called by FN flow
API okay and respective execution times
etc everything can be seen here this is
pretty much event low so this resembles
you were one of the design patterns in
microservices world called saga pattern
you could correlate with the same thing
wherever you can't make a two-phase
commit approach we need within a
transaction right I wanted to book a car
hotel and flight all together if
something goes wrong I want you to
cancel entire itinerary so for that I I
have to define my rollback mechanism
area compensation api's so book or
cancel car book Hotel cancel hotel so
because I can't I can't do a database
transaction of two-phase commit over
there so this saga pattern cause the
respective thing in exceptional cases is
what we are going to do okay so if you
want to see the code base of the the
flow you can see here flow function yes
this is what whatever it is being
depicted in the slides get cars then
iterate over each car and run the
process car so for each car I'm going to
invoke the function here you can see
process car sorry cause this car for
each car ok these are this hope this is
useful or do you really thank Shiva
thanks for that alright so what we'll do
now is look at you know now that the
server lists has been shown to you what
we are going to see is how this entire
information about transactions is being
managed in the blockchain right so and
we are specifically calling this as
permissioned blockchain because this is
not like Bitcoin where anybody and
everybody who knows how to access you
know the Bitcoin API or used a Bitcoin
API via wallets etc can go and look at
all the records right so businesses do
not want other people to come and look
at the records of the transaction they
want to give access to specific people
who can look at these transactions and
then say ok we want to do a next
transaction so that's where the entire
blockchain bit comes in and what
specifically blockchain is all about if
I go next is there are three things that
I wanted to sort of understand first of
all every participant in a blockchain so
you set up a blockchain network where
there are participants every
participants keeps what is called as
their view of the world which is a
ledger and that ledger has all the
transactions right encoded the other
thing is these records are you know
copied over to every ledger in
near-real-time
ok and there is a consensus
mechanism by which you order the
transactions okay so there is no you
know proof of work like in Bitcoin which
is done which is why we talk about
Bitcoin mining and you know a lot of
computing being put to just achieve that
just achieve the ordering but here what
we do is we use different consensus
mechanisms to get into D to get the
record ordered into the ledger as
quickly as possible and the most
important part that I have been you know
I want to again emphasize on is when
you're building applications which has
parties that do not really trust each
other
you know or do not have a central
authority which they can go to so for
example what I mean what I mean by that
you look at the banks in India right the
banks in India have Reserve Bank of
India as a central authority which you
know lays down all the rules regulations
and also enables the banks to trust each
other but let's say you know there is a
shipping company in US and a shipping
company in India how do they trust what
what do they go to yes there is an
International Maritime Organization but
do they really manage you know what's
the reputation of the shipper in India
versus what's the reputation of shipper
in the US so what you do is you set up
as a logistics company you can set up a
blockchain a business network where
these parties can then do transaction so
we are seeing a lot of use cases and you
might have heard you know of of
blockchain earlier being proof of
concept you know concept that hasn't
really got off the ground but we are
seeing a lot interest now more serious
interest people collaborating and coming
together to build you know various
blockchain networks we are actually
doing some pocs here in India as well
and what exactly are we going to launch
when we launch the blockchain service so
the blockchain service is based on hyper
ledger fabric okay we have joined the
Linux Foundation and specific
the hyper ledger fabric project as a
contributor and what we are going to do
when you have the service the managed
service is each of the participants is
essentially called a node and these
nodes are going to have the view of the
world their view of the world which is
the distributed ledger and you will have
an ability to define something called as
the smart contract or chain code now
this is the code that you write to you
know enforce certain rules and
regulations so to say just as RBI does
it for the banks in India you would use
the smart contract to enforce certain
business rules on the transactions that
are happening and then we have the
ordering service like I talked about
earlier to decide you know how the
records are to be ordered and then we
have an onboarding service so when you
get the participants a membership
service when we you get the participants
now these participants need to have
certain you know security credentials
right at least they need to give us or
give wherever the block the business
network is being set up their digital
certificate so that you know that that
sort of trust can be set up so there is
a membership service to onboard
participants and then there is a rest
proxy so you saw the cloud function in
Woking blockchain that is why are the
rest proxy that's been made available if
you currently look at hyper ledger
fabric it allows you to interact by a G
RPC so you have to write code which is
you know G RPC compliant but the other
way to do is use the rest proxy so you
can write code in any language that
supports rest you know as as a paradigm
and interact with the blockchain and
then there is an admin console which
gives you an overall view of what
transaction what is the business network
who are the peers who are interacting
with whom etc
okay so let me quickly now jump into so
this is just to tell you you know as a
developer what you would what you would
do which is essentially called the smart
code and this is how the smart code sort
of looks like I won't go into detail
this is golang that is being shown over
here that hyper laser fabric supports
recently hyper laser 1.1 has been
released that supports nodejs
as the smart contract language as well
right so so you will have that option I
will quickly show you the you know okay
I need to go off and switch over to the
browser
all right
okay so here is the browser and
essentially I'm looking at the admin
console and I also have to look like
this because I can't really see it over
here right now but if you look at the
dashboard it essentially tells you that
there are three organizations which are
part of this network there are two peers
which are the two dealerships that are
interacting in buying and selling cards
one order there are channel set up so
channels is how interactions between the
parties happen and what I can do is go
into some of those details so I can show
you the network over here and this is
how the network is those are the three
peers or three you know transacting
companies here are the peers that are
working on behalf of that and we can
also see a list of of those okay
these are the lists right so these are
the dealers and this is the auto company
we can specifically go into channels or
rather into chain code so there is one
chain code that's been installed and
that chain code is essentially running
on over here on the peers so sorry
here's the version and you can see on
what it has been you know it's been
installed on a channel it's also been
installed on the two peers which are
interacting in this particular
blockchain just to show you let's not go
here but here so we've been talking
about you know these cards that are
being bought and sold so here is an
example which is essentially saying that
if you want to trace a record for a
particular card you can just go in so
this is using the rest proxy to invoke
details about transactions what you see
over here is the detail that you saw in
the chat bot when we asked for more
details about the car and what you see
on over here is the detail
of what transactions could have happened
so if I just scroll to this side which
is today you can see there is a transfer
that has happened right so I can also go
so this is right now
five bar or six bar 1 2 3 right no 5 bar
1 2 3 let me just copy that and what I'm
going to do it's currently with John's
dealership I am going to transfer it so
we login as John's dealership ok I hope
I've got that correct yeah ok so what we
are going to do oh no that's wrong
see this application is pretty finicky
so I have to get that just right so J oh
ok so we are going to put that in over
here and the new owner is Bob's
dealership ok and we transfer the
vehicle right so it shows return code as
success let's go back to trace and do
the query again yeah so you see the
owner is now Bob's dealership and if I
go and scroll this up I can come right
at the end of this and you will see that
there are two transfers now right so
this is essentially the two records of
the transfer that has been initiated ok
so let's just go back
all right so what you saw is essentially
the blockchain being used for keeping
track of these transactions and you know
how you could have parties which are not
really trusting each other to still do
transactions now this what you saw today
the chat bot you know the the serverless
and the blockchain is all part of the
application development stack that we
have in the Oracle cloud and there are a
lot of other services that you can
leverage to build your application or to
have your application integrate with
other applications or other services and
you can see whether it's the data
management services or the applications
that you want to build host it on
WebLogic in the cloud or run plain Java
PHP Ruby Python etc we have the hosting
platform for all these we can run docker
for you we are coming up with a managed
talker and kubernetes service that will
be soon available you saw the FN fun
event project we will have a managed
service around FN as well that's coming
out soon as well right so we have been
if you've not heard about Oracle cloud
we have been getting or focused on
customers who have already been our
customers on on Prem and want to move
over to cloud but we are also working
with a lot of startups and you can you
know may sort of meet these startup
accelerator folks that we we have here
and with that I sort of bring close to
this presentation except one thing I did
sell the card right so I'm going to show
you the buying of the card using the
chat bot again and you are going to
discover something that is very
interesting so give me a couple of
minutes more
okay yeah so you remember this number
right 385 K right that's what the
dealership told me it will give me and
actually what I'm going to do now is so
I want to buy the car okay so welcome
yeah I want to buy car right so well
there are some cars available here
there's an audit as a Cadillac there's a
BMW well I'm not interested in any one
of these I want to buy a Lexus so
remember you know the bot builder right
so now what it's doing here
interestingly is it's telling me that
there are no Lexus's that they have okay
but they will check in the dealer
network and essentially going into the
blockchain and querying why the
functions if there are cars available
which is the Lexus and well they do find
one which I had sold earlier so they
show me this Lexus and yes I'm
interested in more details and the same
details are over here so would you like
to purchase yes I'm interested in
purchasing well tell you what you did
see the number right how to you know
parties who are not trusting each other
still come up with a number right I hope
you enjoyed this thank you very much for
being a wonderful audience thanks
Stephen thank you thanks so much revi
okay so hopefully you guys enjoyed some
of the presentations I'm going to
describe some of the activities going on
here today
first of all we invite you to attend the
zip labs these are hands-on workshops
we're gonna be giving out a prize to the
person who completes the most zip lab
successfully first for the day you can
find those in the back of the developer
lounge so just go through the glass
doors also we are very happy to have
engagement as you heard from now earlier
on women in technology so early later
today in the schedule we have a woman's
high tea this is open to all attendees
women allies of women robots so everyone
is welcome to join we have a great
Technology panel that's being run and
some also some great speakers and I also
highlighted some of the women's speakers
on the agenda here also we want to thank
all of our Oracle code 2018 sponsors
they're the folks who have made this
possible so very glad to have different
companies sponsoring us from around the
world and as you guys know Java 10 was
released at Oracle code we actually made
the announcement at Oracle code Chicago
so if you haven't already download Java
10 check it out the developer portal

I've been travelling around to a bunch
of the Oracle code events worldwide
we've done these across the u.s. Europe
and now Asia he just finished Oracle
code Japan which was an awesome events
we're on a motorcycle tour following
that event traveling across Japan
visiting different user groups the
reason why Oracle is reaching out to
developers is the way people buy
software services and products has
really changed now developers have a lot
more control over the technology it's
they use so we want to directly engage
with developers teach them about some
new open-source technologies and then
show them that those technologies were
using run very well in the Oracle cloud
one of the big advantages Oracle has is
having a very large community so by
building on top of our stack you're not
only getting the you know Oracle
products and services which we wrote on
our cloud technology but you're also
getting a lot of community support from
folks and those open source technology
commitments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
