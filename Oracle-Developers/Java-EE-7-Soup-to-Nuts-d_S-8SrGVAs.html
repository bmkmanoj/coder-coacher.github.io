Erin Gupta I work for red hat I've been
with java ee pretty much all my life now
so this is a java ee 7 soup to nuts
tutorial what I intend to cover in this
is give you a very quick overview of
java ee 7 how many of you are using java
ee 7 today in any shape or form very
neat job ie6 all right pretty cool so I
think you'll hopefully learn something
from this I've tried to make this as
inclusive as i can so i will start with
a quick introduction of java ee 7 you
guys probably see in this slide this is
from last year's keynote where we are
talking about the three key themes of
java ee 7 developer productivity you
know we really kick-started that with
java ee five then six we'd beat up made
a big change and then in seven of course
it took it to the next level and java ee
eight again as you saw in the keynote
the strategy keynote that yeah there is
still continued emphasis focus on ease
of development that's really big big
part of it so what that means is less
boilerplate code more annotated
inversion of control dependency
injection all that fun stuff the second
big theme for java ee 7 is about html5
so we're looking at really websockets
you know servlet 3 dot 1 niño how you
can build scalable applications you know
how you can do a think i owe on your
java ee applications how provide rest
client api you know JS on processing
which is a lingua franca of the web so
that was sort of the second big theme of
html5 third one was where we were
looking at you know which is where java
ee is actually much much strong how do
we meet enterprise demands so we
actually introduced jsr 352 which added
support for batch applications added
support for concurrency where users can
spin up their own threads and do their
own show over there with the full
context and then we simplified JMS
extremely so that was very pleasant and
all literally cutting down from 20 lines
to one line i mean i was talking to
somebody yesterday they're saying hey we
are refactoring from java ee 6 to 7 is
all about how many lines we can cut how
many files we can cut that sort of your
e62 e7 refactoring
without giving too much details about EE
7 you have heard about it for over a
year now I'll cover top 10 features
WebSocket client and server endpoints so
on a pojo you can put at server endpoint
at client endpoint and that is your web
socket endpoint we added support for
batch applications there is support for
read process and right you know in a
chunk style you know container manage
transaction all that goodness hey this
was heavily leveraged from spring batch
so that's that's a classic example where
lot of innovation happen in open not a
standard way but a defacto way and then
we say okay now let's take it and
standardize it so fortunately for the
first time we were actually collaborated
in JCP instead of just taking code away
all the time added support for json
processing so low level JS on processing
more like Jax p but at least you can
read process generate all those things
you know with J's on itself JS on
binding which is a JAX be style API is
coming in java e8 as i talked about we
added support for managed executor
manage schedule executor manage thread
factory so all of these design patterns
which we are aware of in jdk we added a
managed to version of them so you can
spin up your own threads and run them in
the container context security class
loading and jndi context so those are
all available to you and then you run as
if you are you or the container
extremely simplified JMS api we added
support for transactions in pojo so if
you want to do container manage
transactions you don't have to do
stateless ejbs you know you can just say
oh it is a POJO on a POJO i'm going to
put a ad transactional annotation and
then that pojo will all the methods
would be inherently transactional or I
just want a single method of the pojo to
be transactional then i'll put that
annotation on the method so just that
method becomes transactional you could
do that earlier but that was user
managed transaction now this is
container manage transaction implemented
using CDI interceptor bindings added a
brand-new jax-rs client API it was Prior
focus was all server-side API
now we added a client api which you can
use to invoke any rest endpoint i added
some default resources again loading the
bar for you know people who are getting
new into the platform if you're building
a java ee application in all likelihood
you need you know some sort of a JDBC
resource some sir for JMS resource why
do you have to kind of figure out in an
app server specific way how do i create
it so there you have your default
resources you create it and you use it I
mean it's already created for you lot
more annotated pojos heavy emphasis on
annotations and we NJ self we also added
support for faces flow so this is again
you know where innovation has happened
like in ADF apache my faces and took it
and then standardized it as part of the
java ee standard alright so that was my
quick hello 30,000 feet overview of java
ee 7 now we're gonna start digging into
details and get dirty there are three
compliant application servers as of
today when i say compliant that means
these application servers have gone
through ran their ran the tck or cts
rather compatibility test suite and pass
the branding so if you go to java ee
compatibility page you will see these
throw three servers listed so glassfish
for dot x i'm saying for dot X in
general because there's 40 and 41 we
talked about it of course while fly so
glassfish is from Oracle wildfly is from
Red Hat this is what used to be jboss
application server juice 8 this is by T
Mac sauce will dig into each of these
three servers one by one now can I show
what does it where do you download how
do you get started things like that and
there are a few on the way that I'm
constantly hearing so for example jboss
EAP which is the commercial version of
wildfly is going to be available
sometime next year so we're going to
take wildfly you know cut it into jboss
EAP and you can actually buy commercial
support on it similarly weblogic you
know weblogic is so glassfish is the
open-source reference implementation
weblogic is the commercial product of
oracle and that hopefully will be
available next year as well what we hear
is currently calendar year similarly
Liberty profile has been releasing betas
every month that's a pretty quick cycle
I love that agility an idea
finally so they've been releasing Vedas
you know there was a one that was
released a few days ago when I tried
last time in August or so it wasn't very
good they were not able to even par
simple deployment descriptors but I've
heard that changed so which is a good
sign so answering the question that we
were talking earlier that nope there are
big vendors behind it so you can see for
example Oracle red hat IBM they're all
there I was also talking to David
Blevins you know who's responsible for
Tommy they're also looking at you know
how do you make a java ee 7 compliant
there are seats in the front folks if
you want to sit so this is the java ee 7
compliance page you can go take a look
you know this is the official page or
just google for java ee compliant app
servers and it will show you the list
over there all right let us get started
with glassfish now this is as we know is
a reference implementation of java ee
that is a requirement as per the java
community process that means you need to
have a paper where which is the spec you
need to have that api or Java Docs which
stays basically what the paper is going
to do then you need to have a reference
implementation and we'll talk about the
word reference in a second but then you
also need to have a TCK which is what
other vendors could run in order to
claim claim compliance so those are some
of the key components any time there is
a JSR in the java community process now
oracle pull commercial support for glass
fish and they are encouraging users to
move to weblogic okay make sense from
oracle perspective but article is no
longer offering support but large on and
see to be to consulting you know one
base or Belgium the other one based out
of London they are offering commercial
support so there is a third-party
commercial support available as well now
you can rely upon them or you can read
this report by zero turn around which we
agree with that such where it says if
you are moving from glassfish to any
other to weblogic for example it's
literally moving from gloss fish to any
other application server you know yeah
the java ee 7 implementations might be
shared but in terms of you know your
command line your administration your
manager
you are monitoring your scripts all
those are completely different you know
so that's where your effort goes
resource creation all of that is very
different so look at it moving from
glassfish to weblogic as not as seamless
you should read the report over here now
for dot o was released jun 12 of 2013
full dot one was recently released over
thousand plus bug fixes so it's good to
know that finally you know they're
actually bringing the cadence back
you're a long gap for a dot releases
little too slow in my taste but at least
is there alright and then for java e8
which is the next version of enterprise
java the goal is that will be glassfish
five dot oh we have not heard any plans
maybe i'm not aware of it and come up if
there is a Ford or two or some other
version coming in between but the
official party line that I here is five
dot o is coming with Java e8 which is
scheduled for sometime 2016 2017 now of
course is done in open source so you can
check out the bill and play around with
it all right let's take a look at it
so here I have a glass fish for dot one
dot zip okay so what you can do is you
can go to class phys.org you can click
on download and it allows you to
download the web profile which we talked
about earlier or four dot one you can
download either of those versions so
it's a very simple download all you do
is you say glassfish unzip it unzips
pretty simple nothing fancy here so go
to glassfish for directory that's what
it is so this is for dot one with the
version is still the major version which
is glassfish for so remember that folks
there are seats up in the front if you
want to come up here now if I want to
fire up my domain is pretty
straightforward to start there is a
utility called as AAS admin so I say as
admin let me actually move it up so that
people in the back and see
here we go I wish there are debauch
style seating here at javaone will be so
nice then everybody can see the slides
nicely so anyway I'm going to fire up
been a sad minced our domain by default
it starts up you know it puts the log in
the background you can just say dash V
and it's going to start printing the log
on the console okay so i go here then i
say localhost colon 8080 that is my
default page it says glassfish server is
running that's cool or I can go to 48 48
which is my admin console which starts
up on demand here so it's basically
loading the osgi modules is all modular
eyes in that sense so my glassfish admin
console which is pretty nice actually
very simple very easy to use fires up
okay now if I were to deploy an
application here so i have this simple
application which i'm going to deploy so
i'm going to say glassfish for bin is
admin i'm going to deploy and i'm going
to pick a java ee 7 simple sample target
then let's see what's my war file name
here okay i guess i need to regenerate
my war file so give me a second here so
i go here so I package my war file here
simple very trivial sample no database
connectivity nothing here but once I do
that sorry so now I can go back here I
can copy this command here and I can say
that's my target and now he's showing me
hello world war file so very simple
deployment process nothing fancy over
there which is good we like our
deployments to be boring how many of you
like adventurous deployments on a
Saturday night
yeah haha so this is a very trivial java
ee 7 application yeah yeah there are
there are switches for all of that so
there is a it's a fantastic help a sad
man command help it gives you all those
things over there yeah so this is a very
simple java ee application i say show me
all the persons it just returns me a
list of names over there so nothing
fancy ok so the format that i'm adopting
today for different technologies that
i'm presenting I intend to give a SWOT
analysis which is strength weakness
opportunity and threat that's how I
really look at a technology and you know
why should i look at it or why should I
not look at it here we go so strengths
of glass fashion oh you see big s on the
bottom right corner always on the
bleeding edge just by the virtue because
this reference implementation now
remember Oracle pull the commercial
supports is only for reference in that
sense very powerful CLI we talked about
in a how command-line options work very
well rest api to manage monitor all of
that is osg are using osgi for
modularization very lightweight very
fast so definitely very nice in that
sense it also has this concept of module
versioning so you can say i'm going to
deploy hello world war one or two or
three have multiple modules deployed
have one of them being enabled which is
a nice feature you can fall back that ok
RC 1 2 RC 2 or RC 2 to rc1 that
capability is there it also has support
for some enterprise osgi as well so you
can deploy what you call as Bob or web
application bundle where you are saying
here is my war file and I'm going to
expose some osgi services from it I'm
not sure how many people are really
using osgi that actively but it does
have that support at least and the good
thing is if you download netbeans it
comes as a co bundle which really
provides a seamless out-of-the-box
experience the download netbeans you
basically ready to go weaknesses so
there is really a oracle is the only
pretty much committer that I'm aware of
maybe there are other
one or two but there is really no real
OSS community around it it's all put
backs are by Oracle for dot one it has
clustering support but is untested you
know in terms of you know it's not
supported when you look at the docs it
says this clustering support is not
tested so i'm not sure if you use it or
not use it I don't know what is untested
really mean there is really no
commercial support i was on a for
country tour about two and a half weeks
back and pretty much everywhere i'm
going people are jumping away from
glassfish to either wildfly because they
know there is a commercial support
coming in or you know they have been
migrated to weblogic so in terms of
commercial support going away that's a
big big factor you know and that's going
to cut down the adoption a little bit
there is really no clear upgrade path so
article says yeah you should migrate
from glassfish to weblogic and how do i
do that Oh be me money of course as I
said earlier for dot 0 was june four dot
one is about now so it's almost a year
gap for a dart release wonder if it's
magic numbering or it was intentional
but i think that's a little too slow
cadence for my release for open source
project there is really no pass offering
for glass fish so you have to download
it you have to run it yourself oracle
public cloud as we all know is weblogic
so there is no glassfish offering over
there j elastic used to have support for
glass fish but that's again older
version opportunity glassfish to me is a
showcase for java ee development i
really want to see a blueprint which
says hey this is how you should do java
ee development there's carbo tracker but
that's more like know how do you do BDD
in java ee I'm not really seeing the
design patterns over there to me design
patterns are why should I use web socket
here why not rest you know and how do I
use SSC and those kind of design
constraints I want to see so that's sort
of big opportunity for a glassfish which
could really help it i'm not sure if
oracle is not willing to monetize or
that is not much to monetize over there
by the way for all an honor honesty i've
been out of oracle for a year so i don't
know any of these details this is based
upon my public perception log on and see
to be to these smaller vendors
definitely have come up and presided
providing commercial support for it
which is very good so big applaud for
them in terms of threat there is really
no vision beyond our I so just you know
yeah JCP requires it speculate delivered
the job and get done with it is the AP
a-- is the CLI gonna stay that powerful
is the rest api gonna stay that powerful
we don't know yet definitely while fly j
bars EAP are the sort of two but one one
of the same basically imminent threat
tommy is there tomcat spring is of
course a big threat that's broader java
ee in that sense and liberty profile
those are sort of the few threats
potentially to glassfish where i see
people migrating to all right jump on to
val fly so in terms of wild fly while
fly is what used to be jboss application
server this is before well two years
back think about this in red hat
anything that has a cool name is a
community project anything anything
which is red haired blah blah is a
commercial product amex money so what
was missing from jboss was jboss
application server its jboss application
server jboss is everything Jay bus so
Jay bus is a much bigger umbrella so we
saw it's good to give wildfly which is
application server component of it it's
his own life cycle so that's where
wildfly name was suggested by the
community I won't go into what all names
were suggested you can think jboss ass
Shabazz as all sorts of names were
created but wildfly wasn't chosen name
so now you snow that code is pretty much
copied over well is actually moved over
from jboss as application server to wild
fly and of course lot of things have
been rewritten to improvise but the
compliance for wildfly was achieved in
February this year there is commercial
support that is coming in terms of J bar
CA p one of the unique advantages that
Val fly provides is the code similarity
between the open-source version and the
marshall version is pretty much
ninety-nine point nine percent because
the way the model works is you take
wildfly a dot I mean right now is eight
dot 19 not 0 is planned for later this
year at a given point of time will say
okay let's pick 91 or 92 and we're going
to cut it into jboss EAP and cut it
means really run just jelly Kay
certification database certification
operating system certification and
things like that there are no new
features that are being added to EAP
personally I mean it's all features are
added into Val fly and then they are
actually moved over its a typical red
hat way I know you add a feature in open
source and then you commercialize it so
EAP 7 is planned for next year so you
can the advantage being you can start
with java ee 7 today if you want to
build your application on royal fly and
then move over to EAP 7 when the time
comes just literally turn the switch all
right let's take a look at how do we get
started with wild fly
so this is how I stopped running
glassfish server so you see is pretty
fast that way or not least you can test
out if you want to be on the bleeding
edge then class fish is your choice it
takes some time for us to take the
reference implementation from glass fish
and integrate into a wild fly and I'll
show which component is coming from
which particular library ok so now here
I am in wildfly well ok let's talk about
this first so I go to while fly toward
you click on downloads again very simple
you know you're just download this is
nine dot 0 alpha 1 which is available or
you can download a dot 1 which is again
a simple zip bundle I have it pre-dawn
loaded here so all I'm gonna do is I'm
going to say downloads well fly it dot
one final dot zip ok again very simple
just download unzip and ready to go so I
go into al fly a dot one there is a bin
there is a standalone directory or
there's a clustering domain directory
there are two different modes in which
you can run wild fly I just want to run
in a standalone mode for simple
development so I'm going to go to bin
i'm going to say standalone dot sure and
I fired that command and that basically
starts up my wild flame so you can see
you know it literally started in about
two seconds so not bad so it's pretty
fast that way we of course use instead
of osgi we use jboss modules hopefully
modularity will be delivered in jdk 11
and then we will build modularity on top
of that so yeah yes yes there is a there
is I believe a script which can actually
allow you to run wild fly as a windows
service for example yeah so I started it
now I'm going to put it in the
background
separate session so i unzipped Val fly
started while fly so let's take a look
at it so here we go say localhost 8080
my and it's still thinking is running
glassfish very good I know they are Java
is seven compliant application server so
let's see maybe glassfish didn't shut
down actually it did shut down maybe
some browser cache issue okay there you
go yeah how cool it is yeah you refresh
well glassfish and it becomes wildfly so
anyway this is where you have your stuff
deployed all right well I mean the basic
server is running and then you can say
show me my admin console well fly is the
secure server so by default it does not
let you access admin console it says oh
you need to add a user to management
rial so it kind of gives you
instructions on how do you add a manage
user in management real i know it's a
little bit geeky are we trying to
simplify the whole process but in the
meanwhile so what i can do is i can run
the script add user is saying okay this
is fri jelly Kay so you want to add a
user in management real so I'm going to
say a yeah i'm going to add the user
admin is easy to guess i don't care
right now it's giving me some
instructions on how the password should
look like i'm just going to add a simple
password admin it says password must not
be equal to admin i want to use the
password yes but it doesn't know i'm in
a demo mode which would be a while
flight demo mode as well okay i entered
the password you can have this user
belong to a particular group so while
fly has support for rollbacks role-based
access control or called as our back so
for now we don't worry about that we
ready to add the user yes and no remote
connection for this user if you are
setting up in a multiple instance mode
you can have wildfly connect from one
node to another node for deployments
alright so let's go back here
it's going to ask me my username
password and there you go so this is a
wild fly admin console you have
configuration you know you could run
time and administration so you can see
is pretty snappy that way this is in the
process of getting fixes like shouting
back at me I've not done anything wrong
so anyway you can look at all these
details here so now here if I want to
deploy an application the multiple ways
of deployment the simplest one as i will
copy something from here is over here
yeah so i'm going to say VIN there is
something called as jboss clay which is
jboss command-line interface this name
would be familiar to people coming from
jboss application server i'm going to
say connect i'm going to say command and
i'm going to say deploy and i'm going to
give it the URL or the location of where
the war file is so this in our case is
work spaces java ee 7 simple sample
target hello world war ok so the
application is now deployed so i go back
to this page and I say refresh it well
let's make sure let's refresh so now i'm
going to say show all the persons and
the same list is visible to me so very
trivial application simple rest back and
HTML front and pulling the data and
responding it guys there are some seats
out in the front if you want to set up
in the front over here there are some
seats over here as well feel free to
walk up I don't bite ok so that's again
a very simple way on how you can deploy
the application while fly provides all
sorts of utilities one going to that so
let's go to the SWOT analysis of all fly
then so strengths I think the first and
the foremost strength is is commercially
backed by Red Hat so you can start your
development with Val fly today and
seamlessly you know switch back to EAP
so is there any plan to make the EAP
version follow the wildfly the
open-source version more closely so I
know there was a to be honest there was
a goof of that happen around seven dot
one time frame hopefully that won't be
the case going forward so right now EAP
seven the timelines are next year you
will clearly no I mean the entire source
code is on github you will clearly know
this is EAP seven and this is cut from
I'm just picking a number nine dot 4
door to which would be tagged on github
so that you know that it is a calendar
year next year that's all I can say at
this point we all know the dates and how
they are being released so that's all
right so it's commercially backed by Red
Hat JBoss EAP is going to be the
commercial version EAP 7 specifically
very clear defined process there are
lots of contributors who are committing
to wildfly everything is on github you
can clone it for kit you know send a
pull request we love that lots of pull
requests for Wirefly all the goodness
that glassfish has in terms of modular
light weight fast we saw how rapidly it
started very powerful CLI you know if we
just showed you a very tiny sample of J
bar CLI as such but this is what our
admins love I know who are using J bus
or it give us EAP specifically they
automated the script the whole thing and
then they're on the whole show that way
there's a REST API there's a Java API
there's a pearl API there's a PHP Ruby
I've seen deployments using all these
different ways very active community
member lots of dogs third-party books
which is basically how you assess the
health of an application server or an
open source project very high
performance web container specifically
in wildfly the web container was
completely rewritten his name is
undertow in jboss application server
jboss as7 it was based on tomcat so in
wild fly under two was written we were
sort of not pleasantly surprised but it
was good to validate our thought that
hey to take empower is a website which
runs benchmarks again different
frameworks take empower com if you go
look over there round nine numbers show
basically
performance benchmarks for tomcat jetty
Nettie undertow all of these different
containers so to say undertow was able
to do a million J's on transactions in a
second and that over a period of 30
seconds non-stop so did they ran the
test for 30 seconds they did about 31
million transactions for JSON now that's
only four J's on if you do text based
transactions extending text data getting
text data back they were able to do four
million transactions per second so i
think the efforts for rewriting our web
server really paid off so i think that's
a very powerful component because that
is anyway your first point of contact
with an application server now in terms
of the switch between while fly to EAP
they are similar code they are like
ninety-nine point nine percent similar
as i said earlier but you still there
are two different builds so there is a
bit of a process involved there are
scripts available for that but sometimes
I've seen people getting frustrated
about it that oh I can't do the
migration very seamlessly so if you see
any issue like that will happen to take
care of it I've also seen some
complaints where people are migrating
their applications from app server 72
while fly some binary compatibility
issues or no or a s7 work really well
with this and not anymore was it a
stretch or a question stretch all right
in terms of opportunities what we see is
the admin console right now is very
closely tied to the internal model as
somebody says there are lot more
developers in the world you know who
like simplified things you know I mean
people like us we're in this room you
know we can hack stuff we don't need
admin console but guess what CX owes who
pay money they like simple stuff they
like dumb down stuff so this needs to be
dumb down and dealing from our internal
model give a user representation of it
our customers have been asking for
integrated new SQL support so we are
looking at that a co bundle with
netbeans or eclipse would be nice
because that will allow again provide a
more seamless integration or there are
plugins available intelligent management
is something we are looking at
you know how it could be a self-healing
server and it can automatically manage
itself in terms of threats of these are
the key components that we are looking
at it so websphere ND weblogic server
and tomcat plus spring those are the
stacks that we see are the imminent or
sort of where there is a threat possibly
you know we see people going back and
forth all the way I wouldn't say one way
but both the ways all right by the way
all of these slides I'm going to share
them at Red Hat we believe in sharing so
I'm going to share all these slides on
my twitter handle all right my third
server for the day is which is the java
ee 7 compliant server is juice so let's
take a look at it juice is done by this
company in korea called as t max soft so
they're developer preview is available
unfortunately their Developer Preview
gun does not run on a developer machine
which is a Mac it requires like linux
and windows so all sorts of machines but
yeah i can say that no well i can say
that loud now that Microsoft has
acquired mojang so there's a Developer
Preview available you can go to their
website it's a little tricky website to
figure out where the developer preview
is available but once you download it
and i'll talk about a little bit more
it's not easy to get started by the way
the final it still says coming in 2014
and just like I throw some dates I
talked to the guys the app some time in
sometimes this year maybe next year so
we don't know what the roadmap really is
okay so let's let's take a look at it
where we are on this ok so what I did is
I installed fedora on my machine are
after almost 35 email exchanges at their
support forum I still could not start
the Jews server little it was a
Developer Preview they give me the
Developer Preview then in those email
exchanges they were sending me web xml
files common dot XML file or replace
this or this may not be working I was
editing their configuration files I
could not start the application server
the last email exchange this is going
for about past six months
I'm sure they have done a good job it's
just that I'm dumb and I'm not able to
understand it but I like simple things I
like things which are simple I couldn't
find the docs the forum support was
little rather sketchy it was just one
guy responding so he had the tmaxx off
domain so I don't know where is it
coming from but I could not start the
server I'm sorry about it but I could
not start the server I could not deploy
an application there is an admin console
apparently they have so if i show you
hear in the background so i try to run
the server so here is showing his server
might be already running when i try to
access port 8080 it says the server is
not running so i just could not figure
it out so to me it was quite a challenge
and i think i know a few things about
java ee so i could start it but i could
not run I apologize for that alright so
let's take a look at it you know there
are SWOT analysis again so java ee 7
compliance yeah of course they are java
ee 7 compliant they are strong in korea
as I here but I have not encountered
anybody who's using Jews in production
or even for development now I've never
been to Korea so maybe in Korea so
anybody has seen any production
deployments of juice okay that's my
failing to now I could not install as I
said developer preview on Mac OS X so
that to me was like no no no that
doesn't work that way and they had like
seven different installer bundles one
for windows 32 15 min to 64 that seems
like more jdk kind of bundles to me why
can't he just have a zip and say you
know what this download it is platform
independent so that was not very clean
there is no IDE integration so t max off
confirm there is no idea integration for
juice so you have to do all the stuff i
don't know if there's a maven plugin for
example i should have thought about that
the CLI tools are pretty verbose so if i
switch here for a second
so this is the command for example I was
giving to start my server well you knew
my password now because it's specified
clear line clear text on the line so
that's a simple command to start the
server you know you literally have to
specify administrator password I
couldn't figure out a mechanism and how
I can store these passwords so that I
don't have to specify every time so even
deploying an application required like
three command-line arguments so I was a
little too much I'm a lazy guy I just
want simpler command lines as I said
very limited forum support that one guy
was fantastic but you know he would like
pop in and pop out so no I would send a
mail and then I will get a mail from
sometimes 6am sometimes 9 p.m. pacific
time so i don't know where is he based
very poor dogs rather no docs I couldn't
find there's a strong opportunity for
Team X soft in my opinion because the
fun of the first ones to achieve java ee
compliance so if they do the job well
there is definitely a lot of opportunity
for them to grab the market share here
specifically now that Oracle has pulled
commercial support the imminent threats
of course are wildfly NJ bus EAP and
Tommy those are the servers that I see
which is going to take over the juice
market now this is a excellent blog
written by Arjun Tim's who's a wonderful
very vibrant hawaii community member and
he talked about so these are the
different java ee 7 components these are
the different Jase ours over here these
are the three application server so you
can see glassfish Val flight juice and
of course everything here lot of the
components over here are our ISO a
reference implementation so you can say
for example Java API for web socket this
is our I the name is Tyra's Val fly has
WebSocket support an undertow juice has
this internal thing that's nothing
that's shared per se so similarly you
can read through the column here so here
it says java api for Joyce on processing
RI is from glassfish wildfly uses the
same RI I don't know what's the name or
is it internal or something like that so
that way you can read this so you can
see for example concurrency again while
fly is borrowing the RI from glassware
here this is our eye in batch
application and Jai Bharat is our
implementation that is available stand
alone once again on github they are
gained copying though here of course
they are copying large components from
our eye which is which is okay to do
then you can add fixes and value-add on
that which is a very normal process in
the GC peel and i won't go into the
details of each one of these but since
the slides would be available so you can
literally go here and on this blog well
I'm what I am highlighting is three
application servers which are java ee 7
compliant but Arjun has done an
excellent job of providing a
comprehensive list on how different
application servers where they're
picking components from all right that
kind of concludes in about 40 minutes my
quick overview of application servers
any questions on application servers
before i move to ids sighs so at the
bottom you mean like so glassfish 108 mb
while fly 124 mb OIC oh oh yeah yeah
yeah so um I I don't know if glassfish
for is really in production production
per se in the keynote they were talking
about UNHCR United Nations for Refugees
so they're using it but I was talking to
Mohammed they have already pitched to
them to move to a commercially supported
application server or at least that'll
be potentially commercially supported in
terms of wild fly I know several people
who are using it in production in the
hope that they will actually switch to
like EAP 7 when it becomes commercially
supported because then they can do quick
proof of concept in jboss EAP my classic
example is Nasdaq so Nasdaq runs on gave
us EAP
not necessary if you are building a true
Java EE the question was moving from
glassfish to wildfly would it require to
move my Eclipse link modules to right
right right so I have seen some samples
where people have been able to install
eclipse link on wildfly I think Google
is going to be my friend there I've not
personally played with it myself so I
can say that but if those are actually
eclipselink modules then yes you would
need to install eclipse link but if it's
a true java ee 7 application then it's
literally the matter of changing the
persistence provider in your persistence
or XML no it's not also it is a
proprietary application
sure so what I would HIGHLY encourage in
that case is if you find the issues in
the persistence provider it could be
because of several reasons either the
implementations are not compliant to jpa
or maybe the spec is not clearly
specifying the requirement so lets us
work offline on this and see how we can
file an issue in the JPA spec because
end of the day there should be no this
the switch should be seamless and I've
heard those painful stories of migrating
to let's identify what those issues
could be and file aspect issue yeah
specifically this is a good time that
now that java ee it is bootstrapping all
right yeah we don't publish benchmarks
on app server never see a p.m. in
benchmarks are always a tricky one you
know I mean you show a benchmark and ice
like mine is better than yours mine is
bigger than yours bigger does not
necessarily mean better you can see any
benchmark in my opinion how many times
it happens you know you see your ad in
the paper macys face brand new shirt you
still go to Macy's and check it out oh
you know what is going to fit me or not
right so I see a benchmark okay that you
got my first I but I'm going to still
try it in my situation see if it fits my
needs or not that's how i see so
benchmarks are more like a brag rights
to me know so well one of the things and
that was just to kind of because see
this was so if we go here for example so
here i mean i just found it out no I'm
because we didn't do this as such we
were not involved with this so here you
can see for example this is with text so
if i look at say plain text here okay so
this is undertow this is literally at a
little bit lower than C++ so this is 4
million transactions per second I just
found it out you know somebody ping me
hey Aaron we ran this benchmark such as
that's pretty cool so we don't do
benchmarking
our selves but if somebody else does it
we're happy to kind of take a look at it
yeah yeah so a Liberty profile as I
mentioned earlier is releasing monthly
bills their September beta has support
for web sockets batch some of the java
ee 7 technologies when I talk to people
at IBM just like Oracle and red haired
they said yep next year so the dates
what the public dates are next year
Liberty profile is is frankly I don't
know the exact relationship between
Liberty profile and there is Kevin sir
or sitting at the back of the room so
you can talk to him about that but the
idea is Liberty profile is sort of what
is the open-source version lightweight
version websphere network deployment is
sort of the big monster where to make
more money all right netbeans so in
terms of the Ides there are really three
IDEs for java ee 7 NetBeans Eclipse and
IntelliJ so what I'm going to do is I'm
not going to show the Ides here i'm
going to show you sort of do their SWOT
analysis that way you get a feel for it
because if i start showing ID is you
know then somebody will say oh you
didn't show that feature that's powerful
this stay out of the battle netbeans in
my experience provides the most pleasant
experience out of the box and I've been
a big time NetBeans fans I continue to
be NetBeans fan I get a heat for it now
being at Red Hat no no you should be
using Eclipse and this is my is my thing
you know I like NetBeans that's what I
like it provides support for of course
java being coming from oracle so
provides the one of the best support for
java jdk 8 was the first one to come in
netbeans it provides support for html5
PHP c++ then used to be support for
other languages but that's sort of now
delegated to the community so let them
figure it out how they're going to add
support for that it definitely has the
most comprehensive java ee 7 support in
terms of you know how easy it is to get
started with java ee 7 it provides
support for both glass fish and wild fly
so you can say
going to start money build my java ee 7
application using NetBeans now I'm
deploying on glassfish now I can switch
my server to wildfly this very seamless
very slick in that sense I've used it
several times glassfish support was
added by oracle and wildfly support was
contributed by a committed from Red Hat
so he works in the wild flight team and
he contributed the plugin so we maintain
it that way so that's a good
relationship asset between oracle and
red hat although i said i won't show it
but hey why not and you can see i have
all three IDs install right here
minecraft of course so here you can see
you know you can install why the
starting well fly automatically that's
fun oh because it already started is
just showing the log here ok so here is
glassfish server his wildfly application
server you can easily take a look at
them you can manage the application
servers over there start stop deploy the
application so here you know for example
you can create a new project you can say
I want a job or web application web
application click on it next you can say
hello java one is showing you java ee 7
web you can choose your different
application servers over here so i
choose wildfly i don't care about these
frameworks for now click on finish so
that gives you your very basic template
web application in the sense in there is
no WebEx there is no web.xml that is
required you know you can always add it
there is a simple index dot HTML so by
pleasant experience i mean is if i click
on the play button here it's going to go
and deploy the application and show me
the page so you are ready to go out of
the box that's what I like about
NetBeans
let's get into the SWOT analysis as I
said in terms of strengths very pleasant
experience out of the box I am to be
probably blamed for some of it because
I've been using it for long for almost
10 years and I've filed few hundred bugs
on netbeans I've used to there was a
time when I was pretty much filing to 24
bugs every day on NetBeans you know too
okay hey I want this fixed I want this
simple i want this easy to me you know
i'm like as much as we can delegate now
to machine why not you know it's like
how many I've seen the movie of matrix
is enough that's what machines are good
for why should we use humans for that
job when machines can do it typically
I've seen people sticking around with
netbeans because of his excellent maven
support and a lot of people come to
maven and you will you will feel it all
the more specifically if you are coming
from eclipse I'll there are wizards for
now specifically for newbie beginners
there are results for all different
technologies most of the different
technologies so you can create a simple
web socket endpoint jax-rs endpoint jpac
da you can say here is my jdbc resource
take the jdbc resource generate my JP
entity from that take my JP entity
generate my jax-rs resource from that
take that jax-rs resource generate my
angularjs front end or jsf front end
it's a good demo where and it's a good I
know sort of a prototype code that you
can quickly create and through it every
customer and then start manipulating it
so allows you to generate a lot of
boilerplate code very easy one of the
good things about netbeans again is no
plugin hunting you know it comes
everything out of the box tight
integration works very well with
glassfish and other application servers
to so in terms of commitment in terms of
weaknesses we have seen by concerns
around commitment from oracle you know i
mean there was a big thread last year i
won't say where it was with a private
thread actually so but there were big
concerns around that is oracle committed
to NetBeans yeah we are committed we're
going to do something but when we going
to do something that's not clear so
apparently netbeans eight dot one is
still planned next year i'm not seeing
anything
I ate is too early so we don't know
where it's going to go effectively and
the reason for concern was very right
because Oracle has three application
three ides there is a jdeveloper how
many of you use your developer don't be
shy yeah one to two hands yeah I'm sure
you're using fusion confusion middleware
so you go to use multiple the jdeveloper
I have not seen very little usage of
jdeveloper specifically if you using
confusion I'm solution then you use
jdeveloper but otherwise there is a PE
or Oracle Enterprise pack from eclipse
one from Oracle then there is NetBeans
and then there's jdeveloper so the
concern is right you know are you going
to support three IDs all over so and
then in general netbeans is a great idea
I personally love it that's my primary
ide but my pet peeve is have steadily
seen very low usage of NetBeans in the
range of ten to fifteen to add the max
twenty percent in terms of opportunity
yeah they work of course with the
GlassFish team so they provide the best
experience they have a cool feature by
which you know you make a change and it
pushed the changes to the browser
automatically so it allows you to do
html5 application development very
easily but they definitely have a scope
for doing it not just with chrome but
mozilla I Safari another browsers as
well and of course the imminent threat
is intelligent and eclipse you know and
we'll talk about those IDEs next so what
is j bar stools now j bar stools is a
eclipse plug-ins for jboss technologies
and remember i said anything cool at Red
Hat is a project these are some of the
cool projects which actually gets a logo
the Red Hat JBoss blah blah those are
boring ones they don't get a logo only
the project get a logo so for example
aero gear is my mouse okay no mine so
aero gear allows you to do push
notification to your Google and Apple
services there is arquillian which we'll
talk about today the rest easy which
gives you jax-rs implementation and a
lot more there is ability to do cell
phone emulator for your web application
to me you know how the application would
look like on a cell phone upper support
for camel openshift hibernate people you
know business process modeling all of
that are part of the jboss technology
now if you download eclipse by itself
little bit more daunting then you have
to well I mean you can still install
jboss plugins in there or jeebus tools
plugin or you can download just jboss
developer studio which is like a
seamless experience go bundle everything
but it comes with EAP not with Val fly
let's take a look so this is my jboss
developer studio i'm going to minimize
this for now so this is how it looks
like this is my jboss developer studio a
very classic Eclipse feel because it is
on Eclipse so you can say je passe
developer studio about it tells you a
dot OC or one so this full branding we
are actually part of the Eclipse board
as well so we work very closely with
them to influence the direction as much
as we can simplify the whole process but
now again using very classic Eclipse way
you can create a brand new java ee 7
application so let's take a look at the
SWOT analysis so in terms of the
strengths typically wherever I go if
people are using Java EE they are
heavily using eclipse I've seen
generally that that has a trend and all
my developer audiences the pain point
typically for Eclipse users is you know
I go to assemble all these plugins and
when I assemble them it doesn't work so
that's the pain point we try to solve
with j buzz developer studio at hey you
know what all these plugins that are
known to work with each other they are
available and if you actually want to
buy developer support on that you can do
that from Red Hat so that that option is
available to you in terms of java ee 7
there are quite a few technologies that
are already supported so into you can
see there is jax RS JC a jsf CDI but
this is a usual you know code completion
navigation content assist or
that support that is part of usual
eclipse anyway wide range of application
server so of course glassfish wildfly
tom cat named it all those application
servers you can install the standard
Eclipse plugins in jboss developer
studio as well it also provides a fast
and incremental server deployment and by
incremental I mean if your HTML file
change if you're any of your static
files change just that file is deployed
to the server and you can automatically
get a quick refresh and one of the cool
features here is live reload so like
NetBeans provide now you you can make a
change the application goes live to
Chrome right away that is only chrome
specific live reload is browser agnostic
so you say I want to watch this file
using my default browser anytime the
file changes there is no need to do f5
eclipse or J bar stools pushes the
changes to the browser whether it is
chrome firefox safari that's pretty cool
you know the model is edit save look at
the browser and it's safe look at the
browser so very quick rapid prototyping
that allows you to do that now that's
only for static files if you are doing a
class changes recompiling then of course
the module needs to be restarted some of
the pain points of eclipses which are
issues within basic lips itself so for
example if you see the Eclipse console
at the bottom the word wrap support you
know this is like so 20 years ago that
was added about a few weeks ago only in
Eclipse so you can do word wrap in the
latest version of eclipse that is
publicly available if you download the
bleeding edge then you can do that so
those are some basic issues that needs
to be you know added in there which kind
of makes you feel restricted you tend to
work around those but just to be aware
maven support is just horrible I know MP
eclipse plugin I don't know who wrote it
when wrote it and what shape did they
write it but I think it's just terrible
and I mean I just don't like it a nice
thick I've always seen big concerns i
see loss of nods in the audience and
that's generally what I've seen the
workspace and preferences are not easily
shareable so you can say hey this is my
work space and preferences
I'm going to work across the team can I
share it there is no clear way because
this is specific to your desktop so
things like those are pain points in
terms of opportunities definitely expand
java ee 6 and 7 integration provide a
lot better integration with different
applications well application servers
are good but support for technology
itself is required so that's important
hopefully have integration with eclipse
or ion know so I have some other modules
from there and hopefully provide a clip
a while flacco bundle so I mean that's
one seamless integration for you in
terms of threats of course netbeans and
IntelliJ are the two primary IDs you can
move to biue max as well but not very
user-friendly one of the big reasons one
of the big threats to eclipse is again
lack of OSS contribution so there are
companies like red hat IBM which are big
behind eclipse but we need more people
and I mean in general OSS to thrive you
know just don't use it ok let me ask a
question how many of you use open source
keep your hands up how many of you
contribute to open source I see like
what not even five percent of their
hands that's what I'm talking about so
eclipse I know you use all of it how
many times and see contribution to open
source is not just committing code a doc
a bug fix you know complaining about it
grunting about all of those are
contributions because who knows which
grunt is going to convert into a JIRA
and eventually becomes another feature
in an IDE I'll take Murray yeah right
now so actually if you go to eclipse.org
if you download ide there is a program
by eclipse called as friends of eclipse
so you can absolutely donate money to
them yeah because end of the day is a
time versus money so if you don't have
time you say here is good it is good
money and then by the time for that
excellent no absolutely and I'm sure en
Skerritt and Mike Milankovitch are at
the conference there on the Eclipse
Foundation will be happy to talk to you
and as many zeros as you can add to it
they would love it
alright switching gears to my last ide
which is IntelliJ I love their tagline
developed with pleasure and that is
indeed the case just as a example pretty
much all of the wildfly team uses
IntelliJ internally they love it and I
mean it's like and well fly is a big
project they all just love IntelliJ
absolutely they're like quickly hacking
very very quickly very rapidly all of
that intelligence is a polyglot ide Java
scholar groovy whole bunch of languages
and if you up level from IntelliJ the
company's jetbrains which has support
for you know PHP Ruby and all those
things as well but there's a separate
IDE those are not intelligent it's like
ruby mine and PHP mine and so on with
IntelliJ java ee 7 support comes in 13.1
version but that's only in commercial so
there is a community edition of IntelliJ
and there is a commercial edition so you
have to download the commercial edition
which is available for 30-day evaluation
version and then after which you need to
pay money money is important or you can
try it out for 30 days or if you are
open source project no they give it to
you now you just display their logo on
their website and then they give you a
community the commercial edition as well
their support for different build tools
so Android Gradle maven and the best
part that I've seen where intelligence
is the java coding now i mean if you are
just building a simple maven project
writing a java application it's just
beautiful it's just lovely experience
why not show IntelliJ also so here is my
IntelliJ IDEA 13 you can see it's
licensed to jboss application server so
if you are an open source project you
can apply to the open source program of
IntelliJ or reach out to me and I'll
connect you with your product team and
we'll see what works out
so here is a how many of you are aware
of the java ee 7 samples on github
project some of you okay so let me flash
it for a second so this is a list of
about 200 plus samples this is in my
opinion one of the best resources for
learning java ee 7 I originally started
it when i started authoring my book how
do I learn the technology hold the
technology by the gut so I started
writing simple hello world samples these
are all hello world samples as you can
see there are over a period of time
there are 36 contributors so I just
barely started the world but a lot of
people who are actively contributing to
it so many tanks to them but these are
200 plus samples and tests that runs
against glass fish and wild fly so now
I've been working with IBM so like as
Liberty profile is improving as Liberty
profile is improving they will start
running these tests against Liberty
profile as well so they are out on
github take a look at it now fork it
store it there are lots of folks for it
lots of stars for it by all means use
them anyway share it so a bunch of maven
projects so all I've done is I've opened
up all the java ee 7 samples here you
can see you know expression language ejb
concurrency jax-ws JCAP aj's on servlet
all of those technologies are clearly
listed over here and you can look at
them and then so if you want to learn
about web socket for example here we go
you got about 30 plus samples just on
WebSocket all different tiny concepts
how do i D programmatic and a WebSocket
endpoint annotated endpoint asynchronous
endpoint you know how do i receive
messages in chunk all of those concepts
are explained here again we talked about
contribution earlier think about it if
you see something is missing send me a
pull request send us a pull request will
happy happy to approve it filer issue
and I'll say hey Arun this feature is
missing or this sample is missing so
don't think of contribution as only
sending a pull request in terms of
contributing a code dark0 anything is
contribution so let's take a look at it
in terms of intelligence water analysis
there is very good Java EE support in
IntelliJ they provide for example
refactoring of your JP q l which is java
persistence query language so in a JP a
module if you are writing j PQ el you
can if you refactor your entity eur j PQ
el is modified and vice versa if you
modify your j PQ el your entity class
accordingly is updated they've got a
sophisticated job xml a thing so which
is required to kick-start your back jobs
in a bad job you can say here is my job
xml here is my reader processor and
writer and then you can start authoring
those jobs automatically code doing code
completion what reader processor writers
are existing and pull them into the
batch job XML the JSF 22 contracts and
flows a new feature of java ee 7 and
that support is already there in
IntelliJ they also provide navigation
through different CDI beans so you know
in a beans or XML you can specify the
bean name and it will tell you whether
it's an alternative it will start giving
you suggestions oh this beam is
specified in beans or XML but it should
be marked as an alternative in the
actual class so it's sort of intelligent
in that sense and that's the name
IntelliJ they've got very good maven
integration support of course provides
support for glassfish wildfly the two
java ee 7 juice is not available in any
application any IDE as I'm aware of and
a very good community around it I mean
the IntelliJ folks have been working
with them for many years now and they
are very proactive very responsive to
all the requests and in general
answering on their forums and stack
overflow weaknesses Hawaii features are
only in paid ultimate edition so you
have to pay the money or your open
source project in which case you
download the ultimate edition and then
you play with it however a few days ago
they announced that if you are an
academia like a student or a professor
so send them an email via edu address
and they will give you an ultimate
edition for free so which is pretty cool
they can actually do I don't know why I
did that so at this point it's already
say supports most observers so what is
the opportunity for IntelliJ IDEA I have
to come back on that I have seen people
moving from IntelliJ to NetBeans or
eclipse this is generally not a personal
decision this is mostly a corporate
decision oh no no this is a corporate
mandates you got to use this but then
you know behind the scenes 926 the work
on intelligent on Eclipse and six to
nine they work on intelligent on their
favorite project all right so that's my
quick overview of IDEs any question on
AI de so far I don't think so I don't
think so
now a good segue is eclipse doesn't have
that tool but what we're going to talk
about next allows you to generate
angularjs crud on top of JP entities and
I'll show that in a second yes sir right
right right to they also offer Ultimate
Edition to Java user group members as
well so they are very active in the
community in that sense all right so
what is Forge how many of you have heard
of jboss Forge all right ok so I'll give
a quick introduction to jboss Forge and
then show maybe a quick demo as well now
jeebus Forge is were I or what we say
write once run in any IDE so what it
allows you to do is generate well it
allows you to generate a java ee
application based on maven so now it
relies heavily upon maven dependencies
you can easily generate a java ee
application and because it's a maven
application you can open up in any ide
weather is NetBeans eclipse or IntelliJ
you can open up in any IDE and that's
the concept of write once run in any IDE
it could be scripted so for example you
could say hey you know what we're
starting a new project how should our
boiler plate java ee 6 projects should
look like so you define you know is a
command line tool so you define your
command line script and you say what run
this script and it's automatically
generate the project for you which is
your boiler plate and you can customize
the way you want to so it really aids in
automation of repetitive tasks so you
want to generate entities you know you
can start parameterizing them
boilerplate code there is in build
support for java ee 6 that's where it
started and java ee 7 support is now
coming in very extensible by design so
you know the concept is it's a JBoss
Forge has a core module anything and
everything could be added there as an
extension so I'll show you an example of
an extension that I built you know
working with the forge team to add java
ee 7 support their heavy focus on
test-driven development some within the
forge you are creating your project and
you can say oh by the way create my
tests as well they will create your test
run your test report the results so
internal it encourages good coding
practices okay and it offers
productivity to beginners so the
advantage is if you use netbeans if you
are generating your jacks are as jpa and
stuff like that you need to know some of
the technical terms over here here for
talks in terms of domain language oh I'm
starting a new project I don't know what
to do so you hit tab well you know what
let's take a look at it I'm going to
stop my virtual box instance here
hopefully I'll be able to start it one
day all right so all I'm going to do is
go to jboss forge not forget jeebus
forge I go here I say download jeebus
forge and it gives me different
platforms just a simple zip bundle you
download it unzip it and you ready to go
okay I've already unlit I mean I this is
about a week old bundle but what you do
is you say you start fours like this and
I'm starting from the CLI here now I
don't know what to do here so I hit tab
so what it shows me what all can be done
here so you can look at it the one that
I could start with now if I look at the
list of commands it says project so i
just type pro8 tab it automatically does
code completion for me and now i have a
project new so if i cancel it here for
example and i can say project new and I
hit tab again so it shows me color
coding that hey by the way this is a
required parameter so I say okay I get
it so named again I type n hit tab
command completion and I can say java
one and let's say I wanna provide a
top-level package and I can say org dot
java wound or sample and that's it if I
do this it
automatically generates the project for
me now here itself some of the commands
from the shell are available so i can
say show me my pom.xml very usual stuff
here nothing you know it's just a simple
project you haven't really enabled java
ee yet so all you're going to say is
java ee i want to do a java ee setup so
okay make this project java ee aware
then you say what java ee version you
want when that was only one argument you
could specify here so you specify the
java ee version and you hit tab again
what do I say do I see java ee 7 do i
say 7 dot 0 or how do i specify this
what gives you the different options so
i say seven okay now once again i look
at palm dot XML and see this dependency
is now automatically added so the key
part that I was saying about jeebus
forges it allows you to generate that
boilerplate code very easily you don't
have to stack overflow or google it and
comes of what those dependencies are now
you just look at your domain knowledge I
want to generate a java ee project setup
java ee 7 go figure out what those
dependencies are and generate them for
me so that allows you to really automate
the whole thing now here I'm going to
say I'm going to do JP a setup so this
is only simple java ee now so i'm going
to say what do we wanted a i want to set
up GPA version for example and the
reason i'm specifically setting jpa
version is because between java ee 6 and
7 the persistence thought xml deployment
descriptor has changed the name space
are different so okay what version do I
want so it says 2.1 so i do this and
here you go so now i have you know
persistence jpa installed okay so now if
i look at the list here here we go I
mean persistence dot XML so if i say
more persistence door XML you can see
this is taking xmlns DCP dot org
persistence to one is using hibernate
properties for now because by default is
using hibernate as the persistence
provider but when i was setting up JP I
could have said oh by the way don't you
hibernate use a different persistence
provider but then you are responsible
for putting that persistence provider as
part of your runtime okay another
functionality that I can do here is for
example to remember the command here
yeah so if I hit be it shows me all the
commands with B now here I want to
generate a new batch job okay so this is
the java ee 7 exclusive functionality so
i want to generate a new batch job it
shows me what all commands are required
so if I say Joe of XML and i'm going to
say my job xml okay in the job xml
reader and writer are required processor
is optional so you can see reader and
writer are in dark blue or over that
funky green color so I say reader the
way this particular command works is if
there is a reader it will recognize the
reader for you if I hit tab here is not
showing me anything that means there is
no reader that is already defined in the
project if it is it will pick it and let
you specify it but there is since there
is none so I'm going to say or Java one
sample my reader i added a reader here
and now i'm going to say writer okay so
same thing or java one sample my writer
so I got my writer here and hit enter
alright so it created job xml so let's
take a look at it where are we okay so
we are still in persistence dot XML so
we look at it so here we go go to
resources and in resources this is mara
and directory this is batch jobs and in
that my job dot XML is automatically
created so it's using the xmlns jcp.com
space my step it defines automatically
takes a default item count reader and
writer again it's a boilerplate code
that allows you to get started rather
rapidly if I can go back here so I'm
still here now if I look at source main
job
if I look at for example my reader now
okay this is just again a dummy reader
we have generated so that you don't
worry about import extend and all those
things we already put open and read item
methods that you can start overriding
then so that's the idea of it now I have
forged integration in jboss developer
studio which I'm going to show in a
little bit but that works very well as
well so let's do a swot analysis all
right so it's CLI driven there is IDE
integration available in jboss developer
studio as I talked about it it provides
support for java ee 6 and 7 extensible
so i mean i wrote a module the
documentation is not very good right now
but that's what we are working on so
once that improves you should be able to
write you know a WebSocket module for
example if you want to see a particular
way the web sockets or your your jaw
should be generated and you can keep
those add-ons up to yourself on your
github or you can say put them into the
standard Forge repo to share with others
the disorder for app store model as well
can be scripted automated automate
repetitive task test driven development
there's Eclipse and IntelliJ plugin one
of the things that is definitely missing
with documentation for adding plugins
when I started adding it was quite a
painful experience but what we have done
is in over 6 series of videos I work
with the jboss Forge team and those
videos are available for anybody you
know they're all on my blog take a look
at those which basically walks you
through how to add a plug-in and it's an
interactive hackathon kind of thing why
do I do this why not i do do this things
like that so hopefully you'll pick up a
few things from there there is no
NetBeans plugin in terms of opportunity
so that's definitely one place for
integration available netbeans wizards
right now they are based upon
proprietary NetBeans that could possibly
be based upon forge so that will sort of
allow force to be used in all three IDs
in a consistent way in terms of threats
typically developers create the first
add on and then they forget about it so
you need to do maintenance if things
change and stuff like that
well Forge right now is very specialized
for java ee it could possibly expand to
other languages other frameworks is
extensible so that's definitely possible
but right now that's not the focus at
this point of time and in terms of
investment is this another lack of
investment in creating new add-ons so
like market is saying hey we want you
know spring add on over here help us out
all right now when I started creating
the slides at that time there were two
vendors which were offering java ee 7
support in pass so i was listening you
know i'll talk about pass and i'll talk
about the two vendors but since then
cloudbees the other vendor they have
shut down their past business and they
are completely focusing on counter prior
continuous devops basically using
Jenkins so Jenkins enterprise
development so at this point of time
open shift which is red hat's open
source pastore is the only option for
java ee 7 pass take a look in a classic
red hat way open shift comes in origin
online and enterprise so origin is where
all the work first goes in which is open
source version you can clone it you can
fork it you can run it in your own
environment online is the public pass
and enterprise is the private pass when
you go to online you sign up for an open
shift prior plan it gives you three
gears each gear so to say is half a gig
memory and one gig of disk space so you
get three of those free no time bomb no
credit card required which is pretty
cool on each gear you can install
multiple cartridges those cartridges are
very pluggable so there are a bunch of
cartridges that are available on
openshift but you can write your own
cartridge for example i'm known to be a
minecraft fan my son wanted to run a
minecraft server so we quickly you know
create the minecraft server hosted on
openshift and we had a minecraft hosting
party on mine on openshift with his
friends connecting from all over the
place
is just no that's how the extensible the
cartridges are open shift allows support
for multiple languages databases
application servers so glassfish is
available as a pluggable cartridge
Liberty profile is available as a
pluggable cartridge on open shift gears
up three different sizes small medium
large so their disk size their memory
size very talked about the free account
and it's implemented using as too much
details all right let's take a look at
openshift so here i am at openshift you
can sign up here go to sign up you know
create a new account there's no credit
card required I already have an account
so I'm going to go I'm going to go back
here and say login okay once I login I
have a few applications deployed over
there already but effectively you see
this as an empty tab you can say add an
application and they're a bunch of
cartridges these are each of the white
box is so to say a cartridge so you can
say on my gear run this cartridge so
that means it's going to install that
application and have it ready for you
okay so go here Jenkins is there these
are all jboss supported products
application server tomcat vertex wildfly
so i click on wild fly here and I'm
going to say Joe 114 okay this is my
domain this is the fixed rh cloud com if
my source code that needs to be deployed
in this wild fly instance is available i
can provide a pointer to that source
code there are three different gears i'm
just going to run on small small is good
enough for wildfly you can also set it
up in a scaling mode where you say oh by
the way as CPU utilization increases for
wildfly automatically spin up a new
instance and it will front end with the
etch a proxy load balancer as well
literally as of last week we have
support not just in us so you can choose
the data center that I want this to be
deployed in US or in Europe so this
provides lot lower latency for our US
based or Europe best customers
so it doesn't matter for now just create
an application so what's happening
behind the scenes now is is going you
know provisioning my gear which is using
Linux control groups so it's a big rell
server somewhere sitting in the
background on that is say is hey using
this Linux control group give me one gig
of disk space half gig of memory
provision that for me then it says oh
you said to create a while fly a platoon
I'm going to install the wildfly
cartridge over there did you give me a
github or git repo over there so let me
pull that build it and run it for you so
all that happens in the background now
if I go back if I look a log in again
see my application is already created so
that is really quick what takes the
longest amount of time is a dns name
propagation because you got to say java
114 dash miles to go dot or its cloud
com that should be accessible from
wherever you are creating the
application so the provisioning of gear
deployment of cartridge all of that is
rather quick is the dns name
provisioning which takes a little bit of
longer time so if i go back here let's
see if this is done we can come back to
this in the meanwhile yeah
so a great question yeah so if it you
specify a good repo then basically it
pulls the source code from that git repo
into its local git repo and then going
forward you have to use that git repo
for all your build environment or
alternatively what I like to do is I say
don't worry about it create a local good
repo I check out that git repo and irie
parent it to my github project and say
this is my remote and just go pull the
code from there and keep it in sync but
effectively everything is done from the
git repo from open shift oh yeah yeah
you can shell access you know you get
you know you can clone the repo and all
those things let's see if the thing is
ready so no there you go so it's cool
just here now so if I go back to my
applications here if I look at Java 114
so here it says this is my source code
so I'm going to say git clone so it's a
new server saying okay add it there you
go so now i am here okay so i'm in java
114 if I open this page not a new window
so just a page that shows me and if
anybody excesses this page this is what
they will see is not specific to my
machine it talks about how do you get
started and the model is pretty simple
actually so if I am looking at a Java
114 if I look at it it just has a bunch
of openshift hooks and my git repo of
course and then it's got some pages here
so all I can do is source main web app
index dot HTML or rather I could open it
here as well so if i go here i can say
import so i can import an existing maven
project i go to j bars or desktop
javaone java 114 I open it here ok so
now if I look at my web ex or index dot
HTML this is how it looks like a lot of
style elements so comment them for now
if you say welcome to your wildfly 8
application on openshift and that's what
it says over here so here all I can do
is add some stuff here ok the on
openshift the programming model is any
change that you make here so for example
here I could say I want to add a simple
servlet ok so I'm going to say or Java
one sample hello servlet okay just
finish it here so i added a simple
servlet here ok now in here i could say
this response dot get output stream dot
print i can say hello world ok i can say
hello java 11
like that all right so I'm going to go
here so I'm going to add this to index
so I say add to index here and then here
I'm going to say I'm going to commit it
so it's somehow add it up updated my
web.xml as well so that's kind of a bug
so I am saying iodine files from Java
one and i'm going to say commit and push
it i would rather not do it from here
because that's again a bug in jb d s so
i go back here and in my git repo i'm
going to say git status so it shows
these two files are there and it says
this is a new one so i'm going to say
add for now doesn't matter add the whole
thing ok so everything is added there
ideally you would add get ignore and all
those things but for now i'll say get
adding files and when i say get push as
soon as i did push it pushes all the
changes to my git repo the open shift
good Reaper and it automatically
redeploys my application so you will see
you know how the changes are happening
here we're saying oh you know what I got
it so it's building my application is
going to download the internet for me as
part of maven build because this is a
log coming from the server remember this
is a brand new server so on that server
is downloading all the maven
dependencies and is redirecting the log
on my local local console here so in a
few minutes you know once it's done so
well the application is already built
now it's deploying and it's starting my
wildfly cartridge that is the default
behavior that can of course be updated
that nope don't restart wildfly just
redeploy the application and things like
that so if i go back here it just shows
me the standard val fly 80 80 page and
now is the wirefly cartridge has started
is showing me the ports this is the HTTP
port this is the admin port well we'll
visit it in a second oh there you go
this done
so if i refresh it so my exclamation
marks are here and here i can say hello
servlet and there you go so literally
you know in a very integrated manner you
said git commit push and the change is
available to you instantly and that's
what I'm going to leverage you know in
my presentation for the rest half an
hour for a continuous integration so
let's take a look at that so in terms of
open shift you know in terms of
strengths is polyglot so provides lots
of languages lots of data stores loss of
application servers this is the only
java ee 7 offering in terms of pass
today it provides community which is
jboss application server or wild fly and
commercial both of them is provided
cartridges are pluggable so you can
write your custom cartridge a very cool
website i like websites which are clean
and gives me that point to information
there's an auto scaling available in
free plan it's not like you know we are
chopping your limbs and giving you a
free plan whatever you can do over there
it's just that the amount of gears are
less and it certainly provides you
hybrid solution where you can say public
cloud is there but I can also have a
private cloud which is openshift
enterprise so those solutions are
available one of the weaknesses of open
shapes were to say is ecosystem you know
on the number of partners that we would
like to work with us so that's something
we are actively working on and hopefully
that will improve over a period of time
one of the opportunities is java ee 7 is
good but that's typically not the only
piece of the solution what you look what
you are looking for is maybe business
process modeling you need a portal or
you need you know a full-blown security
solution a mobile solution and things
like that so that's what we call as not
just a pass which is application
platform as a service but you know your
portal as a service your mobile backend
as a service your integration platform
as a service so combining all those
paths
call that as X pass so that's a big
opportunity I think for open shift and
we're going to share some more details
around that at devoxx this year the
perceived lack of past leadership I
think and it's again it's a perceived
one but we have really good offerings
over there I think is one of the issues
over there and the threats are of course
Beanstalk and cloud foundry because
people move over there although none of
them really offer sorry for java ee 7
offering okay we saw the application so
let's keep going how many of you use or
Killian okay so let me give a quick
introduction to our Killian in that case
that's sort of the missing piece on how
you do hawaii enterprise testing so our
Killian you know short is a highly
extensible testing platform so it's okay
to start with j unit writing your j unit
tests but that's only unit tests if you
want to do integration tests and I
across the different layers you know how
do I say a JSF page with the JPA back
and with you know a Egypt B middle t or
how do I test all of those layers
together how do i test that on multiple
application servers multiple browsers
that's exactly the gap or killian fills
in it basically allows you to create
automated tests so the way it starts is
you write your j unit test then you pick
a container you know i can deploy on
glassfish i can deploy on wildfly i can
deploy an open shift those are
essentially all containers or adapters
in terms of our client then you say okay
these are different containers I'm going
to connect to a container so let's say i
pick wildfly i'm going to run my test
against wall slide so whatever your
tests are or Killian will package those
tests and deploy to container and as
part of that it's going to provide you
some dependency injection services that
oh you're going to run the test inside
the container or you're going to run the
test from outside the container so for
example if you are doing a rest endpoint
you don't want your client to be within
the container you want the client to be
outside the container so it gives those
different modes which you can easily
configure so yeah you can run
test in container or out of container
eventually once the tests are run then
you capture the results and in a very j
unit friendly style and provide your
reports and then you can say undeploy
the test archive and stop or disconnect
from container there are different modes
you can say run in a managed mode where
r Killian downloads the container for
you starts up the container stops the
container deploys all that stuff or you
can say run it in a remote mode where
somebody else is running the container
and I'm in a quick testing mode just run
the test under deploy the archives don't
start and stop the container every time
so this is a simple way by which you can
get started with java ee 7 you know this
is a very standard maven archetype
you're using batch mode to generate a
java ee 7 project but that only gives
you basically a pound or XML and some
java ee dependencies over there what we
created is a new archetype which allows
you to get started with java ee 7 plus
our Killian this is what we call as
test-driven development with java ee 7
so you can use this archetype using this
archetype you can easily create a java
ee 7 application which will have all the
arquillian dependencies available for
you now this is good if you are doing a
greenfield development where you're
creating a brand new product very
creating a brand new project yeah I can
start how about how many times you have
the luxury really to do a greenfield
development what's important is you are
doing a brownfield development you have
an existing project where you want to
enable arquillian for example but before
that that project really generates 4
profiles yes I'm going to show that
exactly
when I do the greenfield development it
basically allows me to generate project
with our Killian dependencies again
green field it generates these four know
what let's do it I can copy it here okay
so copy this and run it excellent okay
you know what I'm going to go back to my
blog let's do it life arquillian to go
here we go okay testable java ee 7
archetype using art ilion so i'm gonna
copy this code here and paste it here
okay that what all right so it generates
the code for me here i'm going to close
this here for now and i'm going to
import that project
where'd it go just OH javaone hmm Hawaii
7i think no Joey 7-foot java ee 7 sample
okay so it generates the project for me
okay worry about it later so here is my
palm lore xml in the palme d'or xml for
example it has my java ee web dependency
my maven compilers and something got
messy here
you know what i use the rank long
archetype i use a simple one sorry so
that's seven sample before that close it
and get rid of this here and here and
then generate it and then say so now
this is the right one right yeah
okay so now if I say imported desktop
javaone this is the correct one okay
this is all clear now know about it so
here this is my palm dot XML now if I
look at my pom.xml so it's got all those
dependencies that are required for our
killian it's got the our Killian bomb
java ee api j unit the j unit container
from our Killian and it's got all those
different profiles so if I show you here
there is a wild fly managed profile
where it's going to download the wildfly
for you
or get a while fly remote profile where
the wildfly is already running for you
and you can run the test against that or
it's got a glassfish embedded profile
whether it's runs glass efficient and
embedded way and it's got a glassfish
remote profile so you know all of those
profiles are available to you so you can
easily run your tests literally this
exact same thing you can run the raw the
project that is generated for you you
can run it as is against wall fly or
glass fish out of the box so if i go
here I'm firing up my wall fly there and
I go to the Arcadian directory and I say
may one test p while fly remote or
Killian okay so this is my while fly and
it's not happy because seems something
is running let's take a look at it for a
second
yeah well fly is running already that's
not bad okay or we put it in the
background mode that's right not here
here not here okay here where are you
yeah not here okay well I guess it's
running somewhere so i can just try to
run it here while fly remote or Killian
so it's going to run it and it says you
know what I ran six test it's good to
know wildfly is running and we don't
know where is running so I just ran the
tests and reported and I could run the
same thing against glass fish and an
embedded profile or a remote profile
profile just a new profile basically if
you want to move from wildfly to EAP all
you're doing is basically add a new
profile and there are tools in jboss
Forge I will show that in a second when
you are arquillian enabling an existing
project is allows you to choose a
profile or a container to connect to and
it will automatically generate that
profile for you so these are the 4
profiles you can download while fly
eight dot one run it there or testing on
glassfish now one of the questions and
the big thing is okay i am doing i
already have an existing project and i
want to our Killian unable it so there
is a arquillian forge plugin that is
available to you okay so you can
literally add do install from get so
this is the project this is the github
repo in the first bullet where it
specifies it you give that command and
it's going to install or killian plugin
in forge okay so you need forge install
the plugin and then you do the
arquillians setup ok so if I walk you
through that so not here but Java 114 ok
so let's go here now here I'm going to
say to
food distribution ok I'm going to run
Forge here so this is the project that
we exported or cloned from openshift so
there is no arquillian dependency here
let's arquillian enable it ok so all we
gonna say is so we hit tab here again
mrs. display no possible not not all
possibilities so show me our Killian
possibilities that are available so i
say AR it says arquillian set up i can
say set up ok like that so i'm going to
set up arquillian here and we're going
to show me what need to be done it can
run with a unit or test ng so it gives
me those values because it needs to
specify the exact container that you
know should i render your test as j unit
or test energy and going back to the
question that was asked earlier there
are a whole bunch of containers that are
available you know glass phase jboss a s
Jerry tomcat web as well while fly all
of these containers are available you
pick the container that you want to
connect to so remote manage different
modes are available so in this case all
I'm going to say is wildfly remote so
i'm going to say 35 all I say 35 and
that's it it's going to automatically
add those dependencies to my web
application and those dependencies goes
in there and that's it that's all you
need now your test is ready you can fire
it on Val fly of course you need to have
a test we do not have a test in here but
this plug-in will also allow you to
create a test so you can say create a
new test and it will get you going on
that no no well you have to a stack
overflow with google it go to a website
this is a easier way which automatically
generates the boilerplate code for you
additional what
absolutely yeah it's a fully extensible
mechanism so you can write a new plug-in
say no let's say you're working with a
specific yeah yeah in the same project
you can add multiple profiles very
easily and then you can say at a given
time when I'm running my test product it
here or target that and that's the
beauty of it you know you don't release
a dash p target to that profile and its
life so let's talk about continuous
integration you know based upon what we
learned today how we do sir for java ee
7 continuous integration and how these
pieces really fit together and i'll
maybe show a demo of that as well so
let's say you are doing your development
now in terms of development you got your
environment setup you know you start
with j buzz developer studio while fly
you know it's on your local machine
you're happily you know building your
application you start creating your
application then you say i'm going to
add unit tests so you add j unit based
tests and then you say you know what i'm
going to go for integration tests on my
environment i'm going to go with or
killian tests so we start some basic
testing you're running it manually you
know for the first few days but you see
that's not going to scale as I'm adding
more tests I want this to be a lot more
automated process so you bring Jenkins
in the picture so Jenkins is a CI server
continuous integration server which you
can hook in and you can run Jenkins and
the reason I'm showing a little tiny
openshift logo on the bottom right of
Jenkins's you can run Jenkins anywhere
you want but on the java ee 7 project
that we created on wildfly i can say or
open shift i can say enable jenkins
instance so it automatically makes sure
the nasty SSH key exchange and all those
things would automatically be taken care
of you that if there is something needs
to be pushed or pulled all of the
artists seamless for you on I'll show
that to you in a second so what happens
is as soon as you push the code you know
you say git commit push you have enabled
Jenkins on your wildfly cartridge
running
on openshift it Jenkins kicks in by
literally by good push it says okay you
know what you can set up another node
now you don't want to run tests against
your production note because ask your
production node so you set up another
wildfly instance on openshift so this is
my test node you configure your Jenkins
to run your tests on the test node which
is basically a mimic of what you have in
terms of the production and that's the
beauty of open chef because all the
configuration as I showed you was in the
open shift configuration files so you
can literally put them in a central repo
and clone it and then start mimicking
your wild flag configurations so
whatever your production environment is
you mimic it ooh sorry you mimic it in
the test environment you run the test
Jenkins will then check the status if
the tests are passing it will deploy the
application if the tests are failing it
won't deploy the application okay so
once again on the left is what you have
your development environment once you
make the changes you push it to git repo
Jenkins figures out the changes runs the
test on a test environment guess the
results if the tests are passing
application is deployed to production if
the tests are failing the it's not
deployed to production okay so let's
take a look at that demo I'm not going
to lie can create it it's going to take
a little bit longer but I have the
application pre-created I will show you
the hook points and then the actual demo
so this is my palm d'or xml of the java
ee 7 project the bunch of repositories
and all those things this is all
boilerplate code automatically generated
for you using the forge plugin so this
is my first plug-in or first profile
rather which is open shift profile and
here all I'm saying is when I'm
referring to this profile I want to
deploy to open shift instance okay it
gives the war file name and what
directory where is going to apply to so
that's that's what kicks in
automatically in this profile okay i'm
specifying arquillian container remote
and it's going to use that container to
deploy it to that environment then i
have our killian wildfly remote which is
where i don't want this property here
all I'm saying is this is our Killian
container remote and it's going to
deploy to my local environment here
because I'm not specific any war file by
default it looks at port 8080 and 9990
well 9990 rather for administration it
uses the API to deploy the project
automatically for you and then there is
a arquillian wildfly openshift where now
is using the arquillian openshift
container which is what is going to use
to run the test on a wild fly instance
running on openshift so there are three
kinds of profiles and one is for
deployment one is for running the test
and one is for running the test against
local while fly running on your
environment okay and this is for Jenkins
so you need a profile separate one for
running on Jenkins okay so these are
different profiles that are
automatically created for you now some
of the things may not be very clear at
the very first moment stay tuned I'm
going to release all of this source code
in a screencast how you can create this
entire set up in your own environment so
I'm all for sharing so once you have the
4 profiles now here what we are saying
is when I'm running in the Jenkins
environment I'm saying there is a system
property variable called as Jenkins
openshift okay so if i go here now
so this is my Jenkins openshift profile
it says oh by the way this is where the
properties are going to be so if you are
using the Jenkins openshift profile that
is the qualifier that means arquillian
container read it from our Killian dot
XML which is your standard resource file
and these are the properties i want you
to read and i'm here i'm specifying
again I'm parameterizing it I'm not
really hard coding the values here I
could have done parameterization of
these as well but it's my application
domain my application name not here
application name SSH username and this
is for running now remember there is a
wildflower instance running on openshift
what I could do is I could fire the test
from my machine to that Val fly instance
or I can ask the Jenkins which is on
openshift to run it to the wildfly
instance when I'm firing from my machine
to Jenkins or two to four in my my
machine to the test instance I need to
specify these values when Jenkins is
firing to the test instance you can
actually use these values because they
are all running in the open shift
environment they can leverage those
system variables over there so what I
want to show you here is
I have a simple test here okay this is
automatically generated test so the
names are not very friendly but let me
show you the source code of the servlet
first
so in the servlet here for example is
just a simple do get I check if there's
a parameter test if it says past you say
pass if it doesn't say pass you say fail
or otherwise it just prints my get so
very simple very trivial nothing fancy
there so if i go back in my servlet here
I'm saying okay just try to access the
base URL you get my get then you send
pass and you get past okay so these are
two tests that are passing let me make
this test fail ok so I'm going to fail
the test here so if i look at my minus
to go page here it's with the two
exclamation marks ok so let's make sure
this is running on openshift yeah that's
good so now the test is failing so what
I'm going to do here is I am going to
change my index dot HTML file here it is
my ok so I'm going to say with failed
test alright so here you go so I'm going
to get out of here and I'm going to go
to java ee 7 and i'm going to say show
me the status it says you have changed
index dot HTML and you change your test
to fail so i'm going to say
failing test okay here we go now i'm
going to push it once i push it from the
command line i can actually go to my is
going to give me the URL here they say
is track your build at so-and-so but if
i go to my jenkins here okay so now it's
automatically saying waiting for next
available executor now sometimes this
could take a little bit of time but i
can enable auto fresh here so whenever
the executor is available is going to
schedule the job is going to run the
test and i was going to check out the
workspace run the test and if the test
does pass all the tests pass then is
going to deploy the application if the
tests fail is going to stop the
application yes still waiting for the
bill to schedule it sometimes I've taken
up to a few minutes to schedule the
executor now if I go back here and here
if i change the tests again make them
pass and i make the changes to index the
HTML again those changes would be
actually deployed because this time the
tests are going to be passing and not
failing instead let's take a look at it
here so we can come back to this but we
have a few minutes so any questions in
the meanwhile
yeah so json api in java ee 7 is very
low-level API like Jack's p j's on
binding in java e8 is gonee more like
jack's b which is like you know higher
level API you put like a add JSON API
annotation and there will automatically
figure out you know hey this is the
object and what is going to map to in
terms of the JSON binding so the J's on
mapping back and forth would be
automatically defined you don't have to
go through the lower level parsing
processing of J's on it works with get
only at this point of time yeah now we
are just about out of time make sure to
evaluate the session if you like it read
it accordingly you know I was rock Stan
last year hopefully will be a rock star
this year as well always welcome you
know catch me in the hallway I'm here
until Thursday catch me anywhere my-my
open shift is still waiting for the
executor to go but again I am going to
share all the slides I'm going to create
a detailed screencast on how you can set
up this CI environment in your own
environment and all the code all the
slides will be available thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
