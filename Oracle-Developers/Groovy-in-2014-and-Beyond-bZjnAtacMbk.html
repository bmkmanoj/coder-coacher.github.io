session about the groovy language in
2014 and beyond so the features we've
been working on what we are going to
deliver in the next major version and
what we have for you know the longer
term plan so this is a I wanted to
illustrate the first slide with some
something you know related to the area
and I found that one specific picture
with this pretty agile guy working on
walking the the cable and the Golden
Gate Bridge enough of that I you know
really the kind of a kind of fun Nigel
engage so that's how i illustrate my
preferred language so a few time gilma
for i'm working for pivotal and I've
been working on the great project for
the past 10 years I'm leading the other
projects in sir well close to the
beginning and there's something I wanted
to mention it's the GUI weekly
newsletter it's something that I studied
at the end of last year every Tuesday
I'm collecting all the interesting use
of the articles presentations blog post
tweets etc about the groovy ecosystem so
not just about the groovy language but
also projects like groovy Gradle Grails
Griffin rat pack etc and if you want to
get that directly in your mayor in your
email you can subscribe by going to that
thing there I also post that on my blog
post I usually retweet that on twitter
as well so if you want to follow you
know the latest developments around the
groovy language that's groovy a custom
that's where you can get the latest news
all right well first of all is a groovy
user ok pretty much the good chunk let's
say
recorder of the audience science and
who's aware of brewery booty okay at
that so I need to do a bit more you know
spreading the word about it right so the
Ruby won't roadmap so just to give you a
whole bit of you know background history
etc so we released greed to dot 3 yeah
one was that actually I don't remember
the exact date women the june or touch
remember now anymore reach it up 3 which
is out turns a stable version so we're
currently at 237 the latest stable
version and we're also working at the
same time on three to four we released
three beat at 424 perhaps at some point
we might introduce a groovy 25 but it's
not yet certain that's why there's a
question mark there and as a longer-term
on we have Louie three which will speak
about at the end of the presentation but
there's no real target date yet surgery
our what we have in mind for the future
of grieve without really having a
specific date in mind and grandeur yeah
one last word and gree 24 might be
released let's say at the earliest end
of this year or more probably beginning
of next year let's say q1 or something
like that so well cover especially to
three to four words coming up and a few
words and concrete well it right before
the conclusion about 30 so first of all
Rory 23 on the paps will break down
who's already using the very latest and
greatest with 24 with the very latest
beat ass are there already some guys
using that version okay so pretty much
everybody is on 23 I guess 23 yeah okay
that's the majority so in two three we
worked on the JDK 8 supports I say jdk
and
not silica and I am NOT Java 8 language
support so when I say dedicate its
support what I have in mind is for
instance I mean all those nice at you p
eyes which are able to use java 8 lambda
expressions so these are two examples of
using lambdas so here you create an
insurance so this is Java right so we
create an inch wrench and for each we
print the number or you can get the all
the lines of a file transforming the
lines in uppercase and again print that
wherever you are using lambda
expressions you can actually pass
quarters which is quite important
because we don't necessarily need to
support the lambda syntax but you can
already use groovy closures where you
would use Java 8 lambda expressions but
what's interesting as well is that you
don't need to be on jdk 8 to have that
so if your AP eyes are already
functional interface style with an
interface with one single method to
implement but for for greet actual
actually also work with abstract classes
with one single method which is
something that's not supported by a
lambda expressions so you can do that
already and use quarters where I would
use a functional interface even if
you're not on J decade but at least on
JDK 8 you can already liberate you know
the nice stream API etc thanks to groovy
closures so you can put your clothes in
place of lambda expressions the big
feature of traits is traits so angry 23
by the way trait in our in French also
means you know line that you drew so
that's why this is this the old guy
drawing a line so I'm not going to
switch to French for this part of the
presentation don't worry I can fake is a
French accent issue with four
this specification section it's a
possibility so which do you prefer
British Africa liar Fred Fred okay let's
do the French accent but it's very
typical you know like when a French
person think about something we usually
sink your way we are in a drawing room
so I think therefore I I draw or
something like well whatever so trades
that's like interfaces but with method
bodies so you can have methods with
their bodies in your interfaces where
proof great rates so it's a bit similar
to the default methods in Java 8
interfaces but Java 8 interface
different methods are not really
supposed to be used as straight really
but so it's the closest comparison like
I could make with good job especially
tight what's interesting with with
traits is how we can compose behavior
and as we shall see in the example you
can really get off open all concepts
composed together thanks to traits
without having you know it's a to
implement an interface and have a some
kind of helper class you weave in and
delegate to within the class which is
implementing the interface etc which is
perhaps less elegant although it works
and our traits are also stateful so you
can have properties like the normal
brewery properties which are then
inherited when you implement a trade the
trades also friendly with our static
compilation and static type checking
features so it's not anything
particularly you know dynamic over
brewery is a dynamic language with
static features it's not dynamic
specific but i'll show you that we have
real-time traits which is more dynamic
in that sense
and you can well implement rates a
torrent and that's what are just
mentioning here so let's start with the
first example you have a trait which is
a nebula T of flying ability so you have
one method with a method body and we
introduced a new keyword the trait
keyword here that's what a few years I
think since we last introduced a new
syntax element in the language but we
thought that trade was really you know
an important feature that it really
deserved to have its own keyword we
could have used an ast transformation
you know with the annotation like at
trait or something like that but we have
that it really deserved to be at the
same level as you know class interface
in an abstract classes etc so we have
this new trade keyword then my little
bird class is implementing that trait so
it gets the behavior coming from the
trait so when i call the fly method it's
really there i mean even in terms of
byte codes when you use that class that
bird class from java the fly method is
really really there right so it's not
just a pure vision of the the groovy
runtime 3 something that's available at
the bytecode level so that's a way of up
injecting the Sun behavior into the
class so that's the first simple example
next I mentioned the fact that trait
also stateful so here or you see that
string name property just looks like
noble brewery properties and then my
bird implements the trait so the brewery
property I implement the trade and
noticed that i can use the named
argument constructor of groovy just as
if we have that property directly on the
bird class which is kind of the case
because it's inherited from the trait
and then of course we can also use the
usual property notation to retrieve the
content of the property or our
set a new value for the property Corey
Bri by the way in French that's the name
of the human bird let's go a bit behind
we can have trade inheriting from all
the trades so here I mix kind of like
that the two traits we with we so before
so we have the name trade again with a
string name property we have a flying
ability and notice how this flying
ability extends the named trait why not
and in that g-string expression hand
that interpolated string it's more
politically correct to interpolated
string I think name is of course coming
from the property from that name trait
and then my bird again influenced that
flying ability trait again you can use
should show the little bubbles then you
can use again the name constructor
access the property and have up the fly
method a slightly more well not
challenging but something to consider is
what happens when you inherit from two
traits which have the same method
because here you notice that the kite
surfer of the web server both have a
soft method so what's happening if we
define a hipster class which extends
person and also something i want to
mention here notice that i'm extending a
class but also implementing those two
traits which means i can really inherit
the behavior from a class and from
trades at the same time or instead of
you know just implementing interfaces
delegating to something else so what's
happening here it's well convention rule
if you will that the last declared trade
winds so the web surfers surf method is
the one which is chosen that if you want
to have served returning kite you can
just reverse the order all right but if
you want things to be a bit more
a predictable or more obvious you can
also be explicit and say okay I'm going
to override the surf method in my
hipster class and then call kite surfer
dot super so we it will tell Ruby that
ok it's the surf method from the kite
surfer traits that i want to use Naga
one from the web server so that way you
can also be explicit this notation were
also used I think by you in Java 84 in
combination with the photos etc so we
reuse the same syntax so that's what
happening what's happening when you have
conflicts so you your explicit and you
can overwrite and choose which one you
you prefer ha and yeah the last bubble
mentions that the the surf method from
the actual class is always taking
precedence over the ones from the
inherited traits traits can be
implemented at runtime as well so this
one is not yet done at runtime but I
want to illustrate something with that
first example so here again we have the
trait named here we've got an animal but
for just the handful of animals we may
want to have named animals or like your
pets for exact for example might have a
certain name but somehow it can be a bit
artificial to just create an
intermediary class just to have named
animals because otherwise I mean you see
the body of that class is empty there's
nothing in it so it's kind of artificial
turn out to have just dedicated class
for that so in something we can do is
rent I'm traits so we reuse the ass
operator which serves for a coercion in
two different types in groovy and that's
how we can make
the animal implement that named trait so
I can then access the name property set
set the value and access the property
and it's done at real time something to
be aware of is that the the instance
that you have here so it gets all the
methods from animal from the trade etc
it's even instance of named because
named under the hood how we compile that
there's a real interface another hood
the it's not an instance of animal for
various reasons technical limitations
that that's how its implemented so got
something to be aware of that runtime
implementation of traits is not the same
of course as compile time so the this
animal here we're not extending animal
so it's not instance of animal so it
says a little goat I wanted to mention
in the previous example we implemented
one trade at runtime but if you want to
implement too we also added a new method
on all objects which is with traits
which takes two or more traits because
the ass portion mechanism you can just
put one class after us or perhaps we
would have to you know define a new way
of allowing us to support two classes at
the same time it it's not supported at
this syntax level so we added a
dedicating method for implementing two
traits at runtime okay that's I think
that's it for traits yeah so one
question of that
so does trade do trait work only on the
groovy side of things or as well in the
Java side of the world so one remark I
made earlier is that the methods that
are implemented through the traits are
real methods so I mean if you let's say
extend my animal or let's say this named
animal or the this hipster it set rather
soft methods are really there and Java
itself will see those methods so they
are really available there and you can't
really define traits in Java because
jared has an apt rate of course but all
the wise in terms of interpret
interoperability with Jarrah it works
pretty mature transparently that answers
your question yeah no more question on
traits before I move on okay good so a
let's go yeah to base t transformations
we have you know always some refinements
to existing transformations and we also
introduced at least two new ones
tail-recursive which is a which
transform recursively recursive
algorithms or methods here into tail
recursive implementations so that we
don't blow the stack with some ugly
Stack Overflow yours instead of you know
having factorial whole factorial call
factorial etc we kind of serialized the
code so that we don't grow the stack and
that's what the rewriting is being done
i mean in that tasty transformation so
the perhaps so also 110 downsides though
is that you might have to rewrite the
algorithm slightly in the sense that
factorial if you write it the knave way
you would have said
else n times factorial but then it's not
tail-recursive in the sense that the
last instruction of that method is not
the records if co 2 factorial but it's
the multiplication of n by factorial n
minus 1 so that's why this factorial
implementation has been slightly reword
to use an accumulator instead so that
it's able to be transformed to be a tail
recursive so sometimes so I mean the
tail recursive transformation who works
with functions which are retail
recursive which means that it's the last
expression is the recursive code so you
have to rewrite your algorithms that way
but that way I mean do factorial 1000 in
in Java and it'll blow quite rapidly in
perhaps with a factor of a hundred or
two hundred I don't remember the limit
but you can write 1000 and factory 1000
in green it will happily compute the
results the other transformation is
actually know there are history there's
another one after that one we've got an
apt soluble transformation so you just
annotate with apps or table and then it
adds it make you it makes your person
class implement comparable and provides
new methods whose name I never
remembered compare the rates compared it
compared by or comparator by last name
comparator by first name so you can
retrieve comparators for last name for
first name but the compareto method
which is implemented by the
transformation is delegating to those
comparators so what it's doing is that
it's making the class comparable with
compare two methods and we also wanted
to mention and so when you use let's say
you know swing you I've got a list of
components of persons being displayed
they will be properly sorted so that's
me and it
we been inspired by a transform
developed in the Griffin application
framework for building which desktop
applications we were inspired by this
implementation we decided to bring it
bring it into groovy so this is so table
and yeah that's now I remember and he's
going to compare by last name first then
first name then H following the order
that you've put the unique properties in
your class there are also some not
parameters like includes and excludes so
that you want perhaps just to include a
last name and first name or it could
exclude the age of that kind of control
you may have on this transformation so
this one is not a new transformation
that refinement of an existing one
groovy script are actually real classes
there I mean in terms of ID code or it's
really weird reimplemented or extending
an abstract class in this case that's
groovy lang script and you can define a
base script class for your script so you
can provide additional properties on
methods in all the scripts you are
compiling for instance when you use you
have may have a java application that
invades groovy using group will GU
Rochelle booty class loader or some
other mechanism and you can use it can
specify a base script for instance if
you want to provide here property to all
those scripts you are compiling so I can
say okay I can save a script my custom
base script class and I can put the add
bay script annotation on an import or on
the package as well and before so that's
the the refinement but before we also
support it and still support you could
say I
bay script custom bass and script like
defining a local variable of that type
net donate annotating it with at bay
script but now we also support putting
that annotation at the package level or
the import level and he also if you use
a AST customizers all those who know
that you can also even hide the usage of
that ad base crypto you could just have
a cert meaning of logic of write equals
42 and totally hide this Bay script
information if you really want to so
it's so handy for when you integrate
gruene want to have common behavior
completely etc ha another refinement so
the groovy lang script class has gotta
run method which is abstract and the
groovy compiler when it compiles a
script it's going to put the I mean all
the statements in your script which are
not in all the methods the freestanding
statements which make which make a
scrupulous with basically are actually
put and compiled if you were in a inside
the realm method that's sometimes you
won't have a kind of life cycle so being
able to do something before or doing
something after the realm method like
handling more resources closing stuff
appropriately etc so what we did here is
we and so if i want to show you that
here i'm using the previous feature
which is base crypt so in this case i'm
using the notation where that i
mentioned which is at base with custom
base script it's a local viable and in
this case what's going to happen is that
the groovy compiler will actually use
internal realm to put all the
freestanding statements so print in hell
will be actually put inside the
implementation of the internal run
method and then when you call a serial
from a embedding embedding point of view
when you pull the run method it will
call the before your internal ram method
and you're after afterwards so which is
handy for implementing some kind of
light lifecycle staff or even just to
make a parallel with your J unit tests
where you can add after before set up
teardown or before after class etc so
that's ND for those who are embedding
agree on one control over life cycle we
worked on the new I yo on a new UI 02
module so perhaps there will be a new
you you I you 3 and someone but so since
jdk 7 so it's not specific to dedicate
although there are some refinements in
the new I yo area in the JDK something
that was missing noise so we've got over
nice methods like with riederer each
line etc or bytes know the left shift
operator etc we have those methods on
file java.io.file but the now the
recommended way of n-linked files is
actually through the path from java dot
niÃ±o so we wanted to have the same kind
of methods that you are familiar with
but also available on the the path class
there's also feature request to add the
universe files java.io.file files class
there are many very useful utility
methods to handle path and they follow
the same convention if you will as the
groovy extension method or uri
categories which is having static
methods which takes
which take as first parameter the path
and then the rest of the parameters so
we can actually use the Wi-Fi at files
class as a category or as an extension
method mechanism from the rear extension
mechanism so that we can add
automatically all the methods from files
on path so that's so going to make you
know instead of using files dot whatever
method in files and then you apply to a
path you'll be able to use it as if it
worse method which is really part of the
path class so there are certainly some
level refinements we can do for 3 to 4
and beyond tisn't not that just the the
one with close to javascript you know so
in route 23 we totally be implemented
the parser and the other especially for
speed and efficiency there's a guy
called Rick Hightower who created
created a new parser in the booming
project so Boone is not very well but
he's doing some cool stuff in there and
he was happy to contribute the
implementation and tailor it so that it
fits the the existing Jason support that
we had so another hood it's using the
same code as Boone and what's nice is
well the URL is pretty long but if you
if you have a look at this you also put
the slides online on speaker deck com /g
deforge after my presentation and this
present is not presentation is more post
that erodes he did also some comparisons
comparing so here it's labeled boon if
you see it but that's the same reasons
with the gooery class so consider it as
if it fits were written groovy or
bullets the same thing and he compared
to the the fastest available Jason
library
is a jackson and the on most benchmarks
the gain was usually between 3x and 4x
performance improvement compared to
jackson so it's really super super fast
there are some refinements with so don't
bother with the gory details of that
slide which God which has got too many
bullets there are different modes as
well that you can use for the parsing so
there's one mode which is nice for super
big payloads more than too big a bite or
ones which are you you know small jason
bay loads which parts actually a little
faster with the index over labor well
nevermind the details you've got some
different parts in notes that you may be
able to use depending on your use case
that this the one i want to mention
which is lux like relaxed this one until
groovy to dub three and i was the one
who did the initial implementation of
the jason support and i was happy
because rick Hightower was telling was
telling me you know the Jason support yo
code is very beautiful awesome could but
of course what he he was you know very
nice and fair with me but he didn't say
that it was down slow and again code but
well that bird huh so it really worked
on that but the the the other thing was
that I was pretty strict with the Jason
specification so you cannot use
different kind of codes or if you have
training commas and things like that
that isn't specification is pretty
strict but a very often i got the
request from folks who wanted to use
Jason as a configuration file so the guy
wanted to have comments or even
different style of comments being able
to emit commas or put a training come on
that kind of stuff so this mode so when
you do up Jason slippers that type relax
ode allows you to support that kind of
notation for your JSON files so it's
more to Aaron so you have you can use
single quotes also like environment here
it's not coded you so you can drop
quotes and the panel style comment and
missing commas intro and commas we've
got a new template engine of the market
template engine so it's inspired also by
the market builder it's very efficient
it's combined statically for very very
fast and fight rendering it also
supports internationalization and you
can define so I mentioned already a base
script class it's got also pays template
classes so your templates can share can
share the you know common methods and
yeah it's a it's been included in spring
boot pretty recently so the idea whether
you have this little template so it's
just like the brewery market builder so
you've got a car's note that you iterate
over the cars from a collection then you
want to output a car so up which which
is going to look like that basically so
you want to produce that and the model
that you pass to your template so here
I've got two cars of different makes etc
and that's basically what you want to
achieve here and to do that so you
defined the you instantiate the new
mock-up template engine so I used a
simpler example here for conciseness so
you create a template then you also
create the model and then when you make
the template it's going to replace the
model so you can say name or model model
name both work and
so it's pretty fast it's also able to
use to provide includes so you can
include / template you can decide if
what you what you're including is
escaped for you know things like less
than or understand et cetera you can
escape on out those things plus some
other methods i want to mention also the
other thing i want to mention is that
you can also make your template more
safe by using this new method create
object model template it's a bit of a
mouthful but it allows you to get
preparation errors when you compile your
templates so if your variable is not
available it's going to throw a
compilation error if you make typos etc
and there are two approaches so either
you use that wrong method but if you you
have to define the also the types of the
stuff part of the model that you pass so
the thing like which is less noisy with
this approach is that the type is inside
a string so it might be a bit brittle
but since there's type eurasia etc we
didn't have much choice here but there's
also another approach which is to define
the model types inside the template
itself and in that case since we use
that closure notation kind of local
variables we are really able to use the
proper type with the proper generics
information and in that case what's
interesting is that you can just use the
normal create template method we worked
on the documentation in terms of style
as well so the groovy dog if you do
redock you will also get the nice style
here we have the new 3g DK documentation
so all the methods that groovy
adds to you know java.io.file that kind
of things it also received the same
facelift so that looks like our new
groovy duck documentation and also not
not to be forward under brand new
documentation so it's not leak not
totally complete there's still work to
be done to complete the whole
documentation but we're using ask a
doctor for the new documentation and
what's nice with the new documentation
effort is that all the examples / code
snippets that you find in the
documentation we are actually becoming
from unit tests so we know that the
documentation that you will get will
always be in sync with the actual code
base and if ever we change something in
the implementation of movie we won't
even be able to build the documentation
anymore because it's going to break a
test at some point so we have so we're
always aware that if we change something
in GUI or what we really want to have AI
mean the state of the documentation we
really want the documentation to be
up-to-date complete and accurate so
that's why we went with this what I call
executable a specification approach
executive all documentation because we
really inject the code snippets inside
the documentation and those code
snippets are actual unit tests which are
executed whenever we be worried along
with the upcoming GUI tool for release
we will also be launching the new groovy
Lang website which will also feature
that new documentation and so we've got
a new you know new new loop new scheme
so you can go to be taught or groovy
lender or and also notice that on the
the page of the pages of that website
there's a two bit small but there's a
improve this doc think so
can even help us improve the website you
just click on that and it's going to
direct you to the github project for the
website and you'll be able to you know
edit live and get herb and send a pull
request in just a matter of a couple of
clicks so don't hesitate to help us even
if it's just for fixing typos zero so
it's a lovely welcome contributions in
movie 24 so part will be you know adding
new features in grateful for the the
exact coverage and feature list is not
you know set in stone yet but one of the
things we worked on is the ability to
use groovy for developing android
applications so there were some
experiments with older versions of
worried but it's really just now with
three to four that we're really able to
write applications in GUI for android
and interestingly just this summer the
the New York Times just announced that
they decided to use groovy and RX Java
to build the next version of the the New
York Times under android application so
it's a reckoning our work in this area
so it's very nice and there's also some
sample applications if you want to look
at what would it looks like to develop
Android applications in groovy something
we're interested in it's gooey macros so
there's a a guy named Sergei ago who
contributed who made a pull request and
created also project that you can
actually use on his a d-type account to
play with that feature so it's a new way
of helping with offering HD
transformations so if you write EST
transformations even in rubic slightly
more concise but still you have to know
the API of the AST the abstract syntax
tree pretty
so even for something so what is it
doing so it's a new some cool class
which takes some variable as an argument
okay so it's not very obvious when you
look at the code you really have to
parse it mentally you know to be able to
figure out what kind of expression we
are really trying to be so the idea of
groovy macros is to have you know big
like quotation Kwazii quotation in other
languages of the lisp kind so here it's
showing actually to macros so you define
new subclass and it's embedding the
value coming up from some other macro so
this is how you could do that so it's
more readable because you see you know
compared to that you see that you really
create a new instance of some poor class
and pass some argument to the
constructor so it's not yet setting
store on its etc how it will look like
how we will integrate that but that's
really something we're interested in
integrating into buoy and next ruby
three so it's always the the usual
suspects the stuff that the big tasks
for this mythical release of the new
meat object protocol is the the runtime
heart algerie so in groovy too yeah me
too we added the support for invoke
dynamic so there's a special jar and a
special flag to liberate the web dynamic
instruction from jdk 7 but also we I
mean we notice that you know over time
as we add new dynamic features to the
language etc we've got a kind of
sedimentation of various features
sometimes with inconsistencies in
behavior so we'd really like to to start
a new
and cleaner meet object protocol so
notice that so it's really groovy free
because it's going to be really major
major version so it might very well
break some of your code using dynamic
stuff and also the thing we had in mind
was this notion of Rihanna which is the
idea of shielding uses for from things
like monkey patching so let's say you
depend on a specific method but someone
else is doing I'd say changes the
behavior of the size method of the
string class you would say string dot
media class dot size and return 42 all
the time and then your your library is
affected by that but because someone
wreak havoc in your code because he the
guy changed the behavior of something
which is used in your library so for
that we could always use a static
compilation which doesn't go through the
brewery runtime but we are also thinking
about a cavalry um concept which
segregate or put things in more discreet
separate modules so that we don't step
on each other toes when using dynamic
features there's also the sol sana say
it's a burg some say it's a feature the
the fact that groovy can access private
stuff easily so we just say food bar and
if Mars private we won't complain so
it's something we also want to address
through that new meat objector com the
other thing it's the the grammar of the
language so we are not going to change
the syntax of the language but it's
about the implementation of the language
or the implementation of the parsing of
the language so we were using we're
wrong we are still using on tour v2
which is a very old version of antler
now there's Russian form which is a
which has been out for six months or
more because it's a much better version
of antler which make it which make
things easier in terms of
avoiding ambiguities between production
rules etc and it's a good time to do
that now especially with the upcoming
support of certain of the Java 8 syntax
construct that we were interested in so
from your perspective as brewery user
its transparent you don't have to worry
about that but it's a it's going to be a
bit of work on our side and we also had
a google Summer of Code stewed worked on
that during the summer so there's a big
chunk of that work which is already done
and so as I mentioned the syntax so Java
8 provides through the JDK this provides
new API is like the stream API the new
datetime AP is although thing can be
used from groovy not necessarily groovy
3 but it's also available from 24 even
before so you can liberate those eggs no
problem but it's especially especially
regarding the the new syntax stuff like
lambda expressions but we have brewery
quarters like default methods in
interfaces or annotations on types
everywhere you have types you'll be able
to put annotations and also repeating I
think it's going to be eating a notation
not repeated annotations repeating
annotations the ability to repeat the
same annotation so gooey has some things
like we've got our own method pointers
which are like method references but
slightly different so we'll have to
figure out exactly what we want to
support for instance as you can use
Greek orders instead of lambda is pretty
much everywhere pump we don't need to
support the lambda syntax but things
like default methods we have traits but
it's a different concept so for
developing your IP eyes I think would be
nice to support default methods new
interfaces etc so things like
annotations on types it's going to be
pretty cool or AC transformation to be
able to have a fine grain wage say okay
want to apply
this transformation to this stuff which
has been annotated so it gives us some
interest in perspectives for AST
transformation so the the decisions
aren't all being made for those new
syntax features and also your feedback
is important by the way because at the
previous conference for instance when I
asked about method references hopes were
where artists a couple vocal folks were
very much in favor of supporting the new
method reference in tax from Jarrah even
deprecating the existing a person's dot
notation from guru it's a possibility or
we could support both but then we have
to explain users okay use this one when
and use these all 11 blah blah blah so
it's a better to avoid confusion if we
only really support one thing but not
all decisions have been made so I've got
a very brief summary which is that
groovy rocks the JVM since 2003 and
we're always trying to provide you
notice this great interoperability with
the Java which is in my opinion the
language providing the best into a
permeability and integration of all
alternative languages and we are often
also trying to go slightly beyond what
Java provides for instance when we use
closure a portion to functional
interfaces will also make it work for
struct classes etc so we always try to
go a little bit beyond what Java
provides so that's that's it I'm happy
to take I don't know if I have much time
for questions perhaps a couple of
questions yes here
so somewhere somehow contributing back
to Java coming from Ruby I think
actually the the fact that so not it's
not just worried but uh you know other
languages as well like pushing so much
around quarters functions etc I think we
really you know influenced Java as well
because perhaps wouldn't have had long
as if we hadn't had for her since 2003
well you know corazon is an old concept
it's not really something new anyway we
didn't invent closures of course and
also if you look beyond Java itself the
safe reference the safe navigation
operator you know when you do a question
mark dot in rue it it's actually been
adopted by CoffeeScript then C sharp I
don't know it's a the 6th version of the
fifths never remember the the upcoming
version of C shop board that syntax and
up Apple Swift the new language also to
that feature there's this feature and
what's the other one there's not one
which is used by Swift what's the other
one swift also aboard another feature
from groovy the only operator no that's
not Elvis well there I mean we really
noticed that all the languages are
paying attention to what we're is doing
so it shows that we're doing some cool
stuff let's say although question on and
LeBron use the tail recursion yeah tail
recursion this does it force you to
write it yeah because so that when you
use the photo recording when you use at
tail recursive transformation method is
tail recursive only the last expression
is really the tail call so
otherwise I it's a compact problem to
really figure out how to rewrite an
algorithm to make it tail recursive so
that's why it's the developers job to do
it right what I'm asked is if beautiful
as all the other person oh yeah yeah
yeah it should be complaining I actually
didn't try and double check what it's
doing but it should be compiling because
it should notice that it's not it's not
tail recursive yeah okay no more
question nope so oh yeah well last so
for comprehension sand destructuring
like you also have in languages like
scar for instance destructuring we also
have form of destruction with the
multiple assignment Murray so there's a
convention which allows you to let's say
you say def and parents X comma Y and if
the let's say the f x y equals some
object and if the object has got a
special for the special convention which
is to have a get ads method which
defines the index of the property to get
so you can actually deserialize
destructor the x and y coming from the
deaf well equals new point and put that
into the X&amp;amp;Y viable so it's a way of
doing this structuring on assignment at
least two limited form but you have four
comprehensions with all the Map Reduce
kind of stuff grees always been
providing there is not such a strong
argument for rly supporting them but the
there's a feature request for that which
is one of the oldest feature requests in
our bug tracker actually about for
comprehension so I wouldn't be against
having that in the long wait at some
point but they are perhaps odd enough
vocal
persons claiming a mod for comprehension
i want for conferences so I'd be happy
to have that litter yeah we don't have
that yet okay so thanks so much for your
attention thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
