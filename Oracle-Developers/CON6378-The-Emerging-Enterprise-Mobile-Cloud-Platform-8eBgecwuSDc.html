like 80 or 90 people registered for this
but it appears that Jason that I can't
compete with free beer at Dukes cafe so
here you see so we can all cancel this
thing and just go to dukes maybe that's
the better approach but so we're going
to talk a little bit about the mobile
platform and I think there's a keyword
in here that I that I probably should
mention in front of mobile platform and
that is enterprise how many people here
work for a company that's larger than
100 people yeah okay so you're all in
the right place how many people here are
mobile developers writing apps for
mobile devices only one or two of you
that means that only two of you are in
the wrong place so lock the doors now
don't let them out we're going to talk a
little bit about the server side really
that hosts mobile apps if you will and
you'll understand a little bit more
about what that what that means third
question not necessarily my last how
many people here have heard about em
baaz AA you see you're at the perfect
talk this is what we're talking about
and your n bass is stands from mobile
backend as a service mobile backend so
we'll be talking about mobile backends
who knew that Mobile's had backends I
know so to start off with we'd like to
kind of motivate this a little bit at
the beginning by saying that mobile
devices are ubiquitous I don't know that
I'd have too much argument from any one
of you about that fact as I earlier on
in my life as I saw some of these
devices start to emerge I always told
people that I was going to wait for the
device to do everything I didn't like
having a device a phone that did some
things and then having another laptop
that did other things and a planner back
then there was Easton's called Palm
Pilots does anybody remember Palm Pilots
yeah that was the organizer that was the
electronic organizer I'm like I don't
want to buy a Palm Pilot I want my phone
to do all that stuff
I want my laptop to do a lot so I was
holding out for the the one device to
rule them all well I was partially right
there was some aggregation happening you
know phones can do a lot more laptops or
good but you know I was wrong really
when it comes down to one device to rule
them all there isn't there are devices
their special purpose and we all pretty
much except that most of us well when I
it's very let me say that as we hang out
with geeks it's not uncommon for us to
go to a meeting and have people lay down
their laptop their tablet and their
phone and maybe their watch or whatever
else that they have beside them and kind
of have this array of devices before
them and then of course the problem
becomes how do I synchronize and blah
blah blah but the fact is that we expect
to use certain devices for certain
things and devices have become a little
bit more specialized especially as we
look at wearables and and what they're
supposed to be doing we have these
fitbit's and other kinds of devices that
kind of do specific things and we accept
that not only we accept it but we expect
it to have an experience to match its
purpose we expect the device to support
us in a way that is appropriate for what
we bought it for and chances are we
spend a hunk of money to buy it we
wanted to do it to do it well to feel
natural so the two things then we're
getting out of this after this the slide
here is one devices are everywhere and
of all kinds ubiquitous secondly that
there's a whole bunch of context
associated with each of these devices
and the context is device specific with
that in mind let's move on just past
that to the challenges that exist right
now in having an enterprise mobile
strategy what is an enterprise mobile
strategy well that is enterprises
attempting to host a lot of their
applications on mobile devices of
various sorts and the challenge is well
they start with how do i integrate the
applications with all the different
backends that I have as a company I have
lots of data it may exist in some legacy
type of really hard to get place it may
be a relational database that is
relatively easy to get to or maybe some
sort of you know erp sit there all serve
various types and flavors of how
enterprises store their data but in the
end that's what the applications have to
access so trying to integrate all the
various applications that they want to
sit on the mobile devices to these
different types of backends can be quite
challenging and and not to mention
repetitive you know if you have to do
the same amount of integration work with
all of the different mobile applications
as well as the different back-end data
sources it turns out that the biggest
concern that most IT organizations have
and most corporations have with mobile
strategies is security who'd have thunk
it right i mean this is this is the
biggest asset is their data and they're
very very worried about that data
getting out it's a lot it's easier to
protect the data when it's sitting in a
lab on a server with a bunch of fans
burning around it and the door with five
locks on it and only people with gray
hair and beards able to get into that
room but it becomes a little scarier
when your data is accessible by any
mobile device that someone might happen
leave at security counter going through
an airport or that somebody you know may
have left on a tablet that they put down
in a park bench and walked away from so
this is this is sort of part of what
really worries IT people in the
corporation is this notion of security
and that exists at multiple channels
these things called mobile application
management mobile device management
we'll talk about those later on and then
of course there exists the the
decision-making process of well what
kind of devices do we need to support
how do we write these apps if we're
writing for a phone do we have to then
write this app for iOS as well as
Android and perhaps even windows and and
who knows what else well the kind of
decisions then start to propagate onto
themselves and you end up with the
morass
problems and to kind of add to those
problems you have the pull problem of
process management and be it the problem
is that most of us as soon as we get
going in a certain process then we're
comfortable with that process we don't
want to change we'd rather not change
and when you have a large corporation
you not only have a bunch of people that
have using some of the same processes
for a long time but you have lots and
lots and lots of those people doing that
same thing and it's very difficult
sometimes to get that to change and we
work for Oracle which is a pretty large
corporation and has a whole bunch of
processes in place it was pretty
difficult for us at the very beginning
when we went to suddenly go from
packaged applications that we put on CDs
and give to customers to cloud-based
applications that we have to host in
cloud services and in on virtual
machines and data centers this is quite
substantially different and the release
process was substantially different as
well going from releasing to a product
once every two or two or so years to
perhaps every month so this is this was
huge for us and and then everybody
always wants it to happen yesterday it
has to be very very fast in terms of
development cycles the mobile apps have
to be updated quickly the maintenance
has to happen right away everybody's
expecting things to happen now right
away so this has to be incorporated and
this all makes mobile a little difficult
for people they're just getting on board
take a quick look here at a fairly
straightforward client application that
I'm sure a lot of you apply seeing
something very similar typical HR
application you've got some some your
employee info information will be their
last evaluation where the office is
stuff like that there are a lot of
different pieces that make it up it
looks pretty straightforward no pretty
simple when you take a look at it and
start looking at where all that data is
actually coming from it's not coming
from a single location there are a lot
of places where this is potentially
being stored you might have some storage
in the cloud where the profiles are
being kept
the HR information might be on premise
in your core HRM system all the social
media stuff that's all out on the web
you have to go and reach out to get that
that information the evaluations I
talked about do last evaluation you
might have talent management you might
have purchased a cloud service where
that's coming from google that's out on
the web all these pieces are all from
different back-end systems so all of a
sudden this simple app you know thinking
to herself yeah you know that's pretty
straightforward I could write that
normal the clock the GUI isn't too
complicated a bit of data on there I can
handle that it gets complicated really
quickly when you look at where all the
information is coming from and you
really want to voice that problem on
your mobile application developers
there's a couple of guys in here that
said they did the mobile app development
I don't think they want to deal with all
those problems trying to integrate with
all those systems it's bad enough they
have to worry about their client
devtools you know what am I going to use
to write my application you know what
type of application of my writing you
don't want them worrying about all the
other details mobile services when
they're doing push notifications you
want them to worry about when they're
doing it with Apple versus Android no
two different systems you want them to
have to know all the details of all the
different providers skip over to the
integration who might talked about that
all these back-end systems using
different protocols no there's secure
different ways some are using OAuth
somewhere using key client certs stuff
like that and then on top of that you
want to be able to monitor and analyze
your system if you've got your client
device talking directly to these
back-end systems there's no real way of
doing that you can't store the data on
the device call everybody up you know
you want to do some analysis it can I
can i download that data off your phone
you can't do that you can't store the
data on the phone you can't store all
this analytics information and all these
different back-end systems then you have
to write yet another solution to go into
all these systems try and aggregate all
that data to actually perform proper
analysis of everything that's where the
platform the the mobile platform comes
into play is to simplify this stuff
simplify your route from A to B from the
client device to those back-end systems
you want to simplify the experience
for that mobile application developer
with a quick look at a couple of
different application types so there's
be it is and and this isn't really it no
the focus is on mobile because there's
mobile features in a mobile platform but
right it's not limited to it there's a
lot of benefits to all sorts of
platforms to be mobile devices you can
do web development html5 sites you know
a lot of that comes into play here as
well so different application types
there's B to C vs b to e business a
consumer business to employee the
example we just saw was business to
employee business consumers basically
you're angry birds application you're
reaching out to the to the mass is out
there there's lots and lots of users
they're essentially untrusted because
they don't know anything about them
basically no control over the device you
don't know what OS they might be running
you're trying to reach out to the masses
so it could be Android could be windows
could be iOS who knows you have no idea
what version they're running you don't
know what other apps they might have
what other configuration they have
you're trying to reach is broad an
audience as possible so you don't want
to restrict it to too much and in most
cases are going to be anonymous like I
said before you don't know anything
about them and when they're accessing
your system you may not have a whole lot
of profile information if any often we
will have self registrations that you
can have at least a very basic amount
just the by virtue of them downloading
and lock launching the application
you'll have basic information if
anything you'll know a little bit about
the device but maybe not much more b2e
your business went to employee type
applications like we saw the HR appt
somewhat different much smaller number
of users typically you trust them for
the most part you know these people work
for you so you you hopefully have a
certain level of trust with them you'll
have a full profile that information is
in IDM you still don't have full control
over the device I mean with large
companies you can't afford to buy every
single employee the exact same device so
bring your BYOD bring your own device
ace is a reality so you're still have to
deal with all sorts of devices but
because the in a BTE type scenario
you're able to add a few more
constraints to it so you know you've got
these applications available for
employees to use and you're encouraging
them to use them you can play some
restrictions on being on to a minimum OS
version having a particular
configuration on the phone things like
that and that tends to be acceptable on
the flip side because this is a BYO
device you have to remember we're
talking about corporate information
there could be very sensitive data here
so you have to be very careful about how
that is stored and what you do in case
the device is compromised like Mike said
you know who might leave your forget
your phone at airport security or
something how do you deal with that
that's where the M am and MDM come into
play mobile application management
mobile device management in a nutshell
you know if you lose the device you have
the ability to possibly wipe it remotely
or at least keep the data safely
encrypted on device on the device so if
it gets lost its not easily accessible
I'll move on and talk a little bit more
about the platform itself will start at
a high level and we'll get down to the
features as we go but the high level
what does it look like so on the left
you've got your device's this is the
client-side environment like we said any
types of devices you don't really know
what what you're dealing with
sorry Frank crap complete break it I
said your triangle from A to B you want
simplify the the life your application
developer that part is completely
decoupled from the platform they're free
to use whatever tools they want that
doesn't impact the cloud service or the
platform at all move up the top this is
sort of your management layer the
management view on the platform so we do
configuration administration monitoring
what's important to note about that is
depending on the role that you play in
the organization or in the mobile space
your view on the platform is potentially
different if you're the web app
developer and you log into that you want
to essentially be able to browse and see
a list of all the api's that are
available to you to code against if you
are say the system administrator you
want to log in and you'll see how the
system is performing if there's any
outages what kind of through pitter
throughput are you getting on the system
on the far side or the external systems
that we've talked about a few times now
already it could be any type of protocol
that you're talking to that's why the
platforms in the middle you don't want
your device having to deal with all the
differences there and that's where the
platform me that's why it's there it's
tying everything together really
simplifying things for you so typically
you're going to have both your top layer
and your your application your mobile
application developed when they're
talking to the platform in a consistent
way so the standard these days tends to
be rest so when your web app developer
is writing their applications the
platform is going to a consistent view
everything's rest you'll tend to give
them the same style of api's you'll
write them that way whether they're
custom api's or built-in ap is it's a
consistent view and that's for the one
application if you're talking hundreds
of application even of applications in
your corporation even better every one
of those apps is going to be consistent
so when you're switching from one
project to the next you don't have to
relearn everything you're all going to
have a consistent view when you're
accessing those AP is
maybe I management all right how many
people here have heard of API management
okay um roughly half of you API
management is kind of a newer thing um
it was some slightly different packaging
just like everything else in computer
science right we wrap something up a
little differently and give it a new
name and it's cool again well API
management is kind of like just taking
the notion that you want to separate
interface or API from implementation and
API managers and there are a number of
them out there that are starting to get
big and you probably saw some of them at
the demo grounds they essentially do
that very thing but they add some
features on top they've separated the
API by allowing you to define through
some API definition language and because
it's pretty much exclusively rasped
based going into the API manager then
you define it through a restful api
definition language r Amalur RS dl or
rattle or whatever you like and and they
support different ones of these and then
you upload these to the API manager and
the API manager then allows you to
upload an implementation to fit into
that API and so that the the API
management layer hosts the
implementation it allows it to kind of
it gives a run time in which to run it
allows any client whatever to call in to
that API so this provides the
multi-channel pneus that you want for
API managers to support any any sort of
device or channel that you want to
access that API can do so and meanwhile
the API manager supports the
authentication and sometimes
authorization of that API so you can
choose typically what kind of security
model you want but the API management
layer takes care of it for you and then
furthermore gives you kind of a catalog
that you can browse to see what EP is
can I call and what do the api's do and
you know gives you this kind of book of
API is that
you can use to program your application
and the nice part about epi management
layers is that they allow you a view to
how and who is calling your AP is that
might be called by a given a demographic
of device they might be called at a
certain time of day or whatever and
these API management layers can kind of
help you keep track of these and monitor
and measure what's going on as your
api's get invoked so API managers have
become a little bit big right now and I
think for good reason they're kind of a
nice neat way of defining all of your
api's and they provide kind of this
gateway that you can go through and
centralizes some of the logic that you
can use by numerous applications so it
promotes sharing as well why am I
talking about this well because M Baz is
kind of like API management but on
mobile steroids it's essentially taking
the API management model producing
something that does API management but
that also provides the mobile features
that devices like mobile phones and
tablets and things typically need and
use so M Baz is like the follow-on API
management it starts with API management
and it adds more to it full mobile
support there's a bunch of course
services that are available within the
API manager part or within the mobile
cloud platform and these are
specifically suited for mobile devices
they're things like geolocation being
able to look at the location of where
your device is when it calls you it
might be being able to send push
notifications these things we're going
to talk a little bit more about all
these these features these core services
in just a minute or two and furthermore
you want to be able to plug in different
kinds of backends of external services
that support data and delivery of the
enterprise data to the mobile cloud
platform so this plug ability of mobile
cloud platform into your backends of
whatever they happen to be and wherever
they are is very very important as well
and finally that
the analytics of mobile device of
applications are run on mobile devices
is somewhat different from this regular
analytics of any web app you do you kind
of are dealing with different things
there and you want to have special
support for those kinds of analytics so
these analytics are stronger and more
mobile focused than just any regular API
manager okay and I promise to talk about
some of these features in a minute or
two and a minute or two is passed so
let's do that this is the similar slide
to what we just saw a minute ago with
Jason and talking about the main
architecture of all the devices calling
into your back-end cloud service and
then you're you're monitoring consoles
and managing abilities all kind of
coming in through a management layer and
then finally going out to the data
sources in your enterprise at the back
side so the first thing to mention is
that on the device side there as we say
there's multi channels so there's lots
of different device types and each of
them kind of tends to have its own way
of being programmed particularly if it's
a different vendor you know there's
there's different vendors to support
different types of devices and so one of
the things that you typically want to do
when you're calling the backend is make
that as easy as possible so you want to
make it as simple as possible for the
mobile application they call these api's
and it might just be a REST API but
there might be additional information
like security in authorization tokens
that you need to pass along that way and
so an SDK supports that but this is not
uncommon to to require things like this
on the client device I was talking to
this j ro j rebel company who's doing
something like this they're putting
something on the client device and
allowing you to deploy things into their
into their product and that makes it
easier for people to to deploy things to
their mobile devices and this is kind of
the same thing it makes it easy to call
into the mobile cloud platform if you
have this SDK but the SDK is not
required if you have a regular native
application you just use that to make a
rest call to the mobile cloud service
and you're good to go
on the back part we just generally said
back-end data services but they kind of
come in a few different main categories
the first is some sort of cloud service
that is probably somewhat related to the
cloud service that the mobile cloud is
running in and so it might be like if
you're using a vendor or a specific
vendor that supports a mobile cloud
service then this same vendor typically
will support some other data type cloud
service as well so that's sort of one
category and I think that's pretty
standard the second type is going to be
an on-premise data source so maybe the
the customer wants to actually talk to a
database that's that's sitting on their
own in their own data center or in their
own lab or somewhere that storing all
their data and we talked about that
being walled off and having some
strategy for that and then finally you
might want to talk to just any random
service out there you know any custom
application or any service that's just
available to you you can you can call
that and get the data back from that so
these are these are what we call
connectors and the connector is an
abstraction of being to call out to this
data source somewhere in typically one
of those few categories that's where the
data really is is stored you just need
to get at it and the connector allows a
flexible approach to getting at that
data and reading it back into your
mobile cloud service typically rest and
so for common ways that you get to these
things they generally have one of these
two basic interfaces there might be
other interfaces that you can support
but those are the two main ones that
we've seen and the the idea between
creating a connector is that it's it's
really about configuration you're not
doing a lot of programming or
development to create this connector
you're just configuring it to go get the
data from somewhere and you're invoking
some call so that shouldn't be a whole
big process to do one of the problems
that we've noticed in this space as we
did our research in all of this as we
created and I should have mentioned
just at the beginning that Jason and I
I'm I'm Mike and that's Jason and we
both started working on something
completely different we were on the
server side in in middleware and
specifications and we started working on
mobile cloud a couple of years ago and
didn't know that much about it so we
went out and did a whole bunch of
research and found out about what was
going on and what was about to go on and
then we created a product along with
some other people on team and that is a
product at Oracle called the mobile
cloud service at Oracle so that's that's
why we thought we would share the
knowledge that we acquired in all of the
the research that we did and and
hopefully you guys can benefit from that
so what we found as we were developing
our own product was that there's this
problem at the back end with some of
these data sources require a stateful
kind of session right it's not uncommon
to have a session to connect to some of
these enterprise data sources and with a
connector or with the stateless mobile
cloud service and they tend to be
stateless because their rest calls going
into the API management layer then you
kind of have this issue of well how do i
maintain this this sort of connection
this session that goes from my mobile
device all the way to my enterprise
back-end data source and so that's a
problem that we had to kind of get over
and so different different solutions are
available in different products that I
think you might you might find there
the next feature will talk about here a
little bit there push notifications
we're starting to get into some of the
the mobile specific piece that you might
find in a typical embas so push
notifications now messaging getting give
me information out to the masses all the
users who have who have your app
installed and are using it the first
thing you want to make sure it's your
vendor your embas platform provides for
you is an API that's allow you to
connect to all these different devices
whether its iOS Android Windows you want
you want them 1212 we support you don't
want to be limited so your API vapi
embas providing to you should support
them all but at the same time be generic
again pull that problem away from your
mobile application developer you don't
want them to know all the nitty-gritty
details about apples apns or Google's
GCM your platform should give you a nice
consistent API that abstracts away those
differences to your mobile app developer
can again focus on writing his mobile
applications when you're pushing
notifications you don't always want to
push it to everyone that's kind of the
default position now you can just send
out the notification to every user who
currently has your app installed you
might want to let them know that hey we
know we just create a new version it's
available in the App Store there's some
cool new features in it you're actually
sending that out absolutely everybody
you also want the ability to filter out
those notifications though you don't
always want to be bugging every single
person because the message you're trying
to get out there may not be relevant to
everybody so you can use different
filters to direct who that message is
getting to you one example is role-based
so if you look at the HR application we
looked at earlier that's the type you
know b2e where most of the users you
have as we mentioned have profiles so
you might associate roles in the system
with these different users so you may
push send and push notification to all
managers everyone who hasn't met the
manager role reminding them that is time
to fill out their employee evaluations
no these are due next week you know you
we know you haven't started please start
now so you can hopefully get them in on
time
you can send the notification out to all
devices of give and tight so you know
all the iphone 6 users no don't put your
phone in your back pocket and sit down
because bad things may happen no bend
the gate I'm also do it based on
location if you walk into a particular
store if you have customers walk into a
pick your favorite big-box store they've
got the application installed you may
want to send a push notification to all
the customers who are currently within a
certain distance of that store within
the store letting them know there's a
big sale on socks in Aisle five right so
you can really focus the message based
on the contextual information that the
device can provide to you again there's
with the with the various vendors out
there there's still issues with
consistency the quality of service that
they provide timeouts retries for
notifications getting out there that
again is something you're going to
expect from your mobile provider from
your platform to build into these
generic API so you don't have to worry
about those problems analytics I want to
find stuff out about my application now
it's great you've built a mobile app
you've got deployed you got people who
downloaded they're using it they're
using it this way there isn't it that
way well or are they how do you know
right once you once you've got it out
there how do you know how it's being
used who's using it where are they using
it that's the kind of stuff that really
gets the business people excited no
those are the marketing guys the sales
guys or that they want to know that
they're hungry for information they want
to know what's what's being used or how
their stuff is being used so the first
part to analytics is actually having
data so you have to gather this data
there are different types or different
ways to gather it the platform itself
will typically or at least it should be
constantly gathering metrics every time
an API call comes in it should gather
some metrics so you can find out about
it whenever things potentially go wrong
all the different API types constantly
pulling information that you can use for
analytics
later their custom metrics as well you
can have your application developer
triggering custom events whenever things
happen they can do that from either the
client side or within custom code which
we'll talk about a little bit that's
residing on the server side but allows
them to inject their own business logic
their own sort of personal analytics for
anything that is the market specific to
the area they're working in now the
thing about these metrics these events
that we call that are being triggered
they all have contacts associated with
them is not just that something happened
no something happened no you're miles
ahead just knowing that but with mobile
apps and mobile devices you can get so
much more you can find out where it
happened using the GPS information you
can find out when it happened based on
if the device has a clock you can find
out if it happened on an iOS phone or an
Android phone you can find out all sorts
of things and let Mike talk on the
initial slide with all these different
devices as new devices come out the
amount of context that you can get with
these events is also going to change and
grow you've got all the Fitbit devices
now I can envision a time if you're
triggering events and gathering data you
can capture what the person's heart rate
was for instance whenever they trigger
an event so these events this triggering
again is a very important piece of the
platform that it should they should be
providing API is for you all right
you've got the data now what do you do
with it you want to analyze it and
there's two broad categories of analysis
they're sort of the system analytics and
the application level analytics the
system ones are the things that your
system admin is going to typically be
interested in things like what is the
throughput of the system how many
requests am i able to handle every
minute have there been any major outages
in the last little while have there been
any abnormal behavior anything like that
and then on the application side
that's where you're looking at the
business guys there's not look at the
reports all right well is the bulk of my
customer base are they in North America
are they in Europe you get that kind of
information are the bulk of my users iOS
users or Android users if you've got
profile information you can find out or
the bulk of my users male/female if
that's been entered how old are my users
you can find out which AP is are being
triggered so which parts of the mobile
application are they actually using you
may see that the API is related to the
first three or four pages of your app or
being hit consistently but the last page
has very very few hits so that at least
gives you some some information to work
on maybe maybe the access point to get
to that page is hidden you know maybe
you're not doing a very good job of
exposing that functionality maybe maybe
it's just not popular but at least then
you know otherwise you'd have no idea
that that page was ever it was never
being hidden or rarely being hidden hit
so here's a couple of examples here of
analytics that you may typically see so
this is the type of analytics probably
on the icon on the business side the
active users by location but this is the
type of stuff that your platform can
give you for free every event that comes
in or every time an API is called the
platform could just capture that
information as well as well as the
contextual information when that request
comes in from an 84 from an API to help
render some information on the page
information about the device or about
the user can all be captured so you can
track over time where your active users
are this is one of the examples we
talked about where is the bulk of my
customer base you can tell by this it's
mostly in the US all right that's the
bulk of the users are there with some up
in I think it's great britain up there
so very very useful information and this
is just one small example here's another
example and this feeds more into the
custom events we often use this this
fictional application called fix it fast
has to do with the two major appliance
repair company so
your customers can go onto a website or
better yet use their mobile device load
the application to report whenever they
have a problem every time that happens
they can capture a custom event saying
you know a work order has been
dispatched I have an issue so that's
specific to their domain the other side
of the application the technicians may
have their own app now if they're out on
the road and they see you know there's
an event that's in my area they can they
can accept it and that will trigger a
different event so all of a sudden you
keep track of how many of the open items
that you have are actually being looked
at right now I've actually been assigned
to to a technician and finally you know
every time a work order has been
resolved the issue has been fixed that's
another custom event that's captured and
you can build metrics on this are all
types of analytics so you can track over
time in this example how many how many
work orders are being filed over time
how many a day how many get closed per
day how long are they open all that type
of stuff and it's very simple to do you
just have to use the API trigger a very
simple event it gets captured and then
you have all that data that you can then
use and analyze later on right Michael
talked a bit about user management okay
so we're gonna want to go a little more
quickly over this stuff we we we
mentioned that we kind of build a
product around this and I thought it'd
be kind of nice if we spent five or ten
minutes at the end is to kind of show
you what a product like this feels like
it's in you know it's it's a little bit
it's similar in many ways to what we've
been talking about it's not exactly but
we have some things that don't exist
that we're talking about here and vice
versa we got more stuff than what we've
talked about here as well but but it
gives you a flavor hopefully of what an
mbox like so I want to go quickly
through some of the rest of the pieces
here and then we'll we'll do a little
bit of a demo so user management all
user management means is it it gives the
the custom code or the the developer the
mobile cloud service developer a way to
define their own security and and for us
this means that their means sorry this
means that there has to be some
role management that is declarative role
management in Java is declarative you'd
like to be able to say how many people
have used java ee role management and
security a few of you only well so it
makes it quite easy to do you just
define the roles and then you define the
api's and what roles are required for an
API to be used so similarly here I think
role role based security is quite quite
nice and people like that but you also
like to do programmatic security in
other words have an API that allows you
to ask well what kind of roles does this
user have in your code that is running
on the server side and then be able to
authorize based on that ok I don't know
if you saw that happen I'll do it again
see if you can pick it out see that see
that yeah yeah all right it's subtle to
see if you're awake so we just showed up
we just showed storage storage showed up
in the mobile cloud service that's no
big revelation right I think you
probably expected some sort of storage
to be there we showed two different
types of storage because these are the
most common object storage is an
unstructured store it's a essentially
key value store these are everywhere
right now generally you store blobs
quite often you store JSON blobs of JSON
and if you do store JSON then one of the
things you want to do with JSON is be
able to query over and querying over
JSON is helpful because it's not always
there for you and when you have it you
like it and so so that's this kind of a
common thing for people to do the other
thing about storage services they have
to group them together you want to
categorize objects into containers or
collections of things that makes it
easier to find things because it's not
really the queering abilities that you
have to relational databases so this is
sort of a standard object storage
service I think most M basses kind of
provide something like this I think
relational storage similarly there has
to be some way to store structured data
relational data almost everybody has
some kind of relational database in
their in their world and so you have to
be able to access it locally when I say
locally kind of means means something
that's provided by
the MCS the mobile cloud service or
within a related service so normally
this this database service is going to
be perhaps a little bit lighter than a
regular or full database it's not going
to give you all the management abilities
you're not gonna do backups and stuff
perhaps it'll be more of a cloud feature
a cloud database and that's what we mean
they're so custom code is another
important aspect of any embas system
we've talked about API management and
we've talked about a lot of the API is
that the platform is going to provide to
you out of the box custom code is where
you get to inject your own personality
into the into the ambass this is where
you're going to build up a set of
reusable api's with your own business
logic that you can use to build your
first appt your second app your
hundredth app you don't want to be doing
this over and over again custom code can
invoke any service that we've talked
about so far you can add whether it's
the back end connectors or the
geolocation that's all available to you
what you're going to use your custom
code for typically is to aggregate data
from all these different back-end
systems you're going to shape the data
that's in there transform it you don't
want to just take anything that you're
going to your essay p or oracle database
your taleo management system a lot of
the data that comes out of those
connectors are those transactions to
these back-end systems it's huge data
sets and its really really complicated
so custom code is where you Whittle that
down you might hit so when we talk look
that HR system to render that page you
don't necessarily want to hit those five
six seven different back-end systems to
pull the data back once at one at a time
instead you'll hit your custom code API
that you created and coded to get all
the results sets back at once that set
of business logic that you write is
going to hit all these back-end systems
pull out the data whittle it down to
only what you need packed it up a nice
little JSON object or whatever it is
that you're using and send that back
your custom code platform should try and
support multiple languages JavaScript's
team seems to be the dominant language
of choice right now for mobile
development java obviously is another
popular one Ruby you know the sky's the
limit what your platform offers no the
more the better depend on what you're
comfortable with in working with an
important part about custom code so far
we've been talking about the platform
what the platform provides what it gives
to you what it what is available that is
all provided by the platform writers
themselves they trust themselves they're
secure and with an M bad since we're
talking about this is a service
typically it's running the cloud as soon
as you introduce the concept of custom
code you have to be very very careful
you're allowing the user to write their
own logic and upload that to your system
you have to be very careful with how you
handle that you really want a sandbox
where that code is executing you don't
want them to have access to your own
back-end systems your own data but also
other tenants if someone obviously in
the cloud multi-tenant systems you don't
want someone to be able to write
malicious code and access somebody
else's data so yeah it's very important
to sandbox the custom code quickly so
geolocation probably the mobile features
that were most familiar with again the
platform will provide these api's to
gloss over some of the native specifics
give you a pis to find out where is the
device so when the request comes in
where is the device that's actually
making that request you should be able
to find out where is that device
relative to other locations because that
type of locality that information is
relevant to all sorts of domains it can
help you with your queries no I think I
think we all do it it's all second
nature we all expect if you ask Siri or
pull up google and send out a query to
say what time is my local hardware store
or basically what time until what time
is the hardware store open we don't even
say local anymore we expect the first
hit to show up in the results to be my
local hardware store we expect it to
just know
and it's not just for queries we talked
about the example is push notifications
now all all different features all
aspects of mobile are going to take make
use of these different contextual pieces
of information so let's talk about the
push notifications go into your local
store it's going to use this contextual
information about the geolocation and
when you start mixing it with other
other piece of contextual information
you can create even more powerful
queries so I talked about the local
hardware store to what time it's open
you're going to find a local restaurant
no fine findme restaurants is you know
you can be that that simple will use the
geolocation to find local restaurants
and they'll use temporality the time on
your device to find your ones that are
open so PSR showed up at the very bottom
there that's the type of thing you
pretty much expect out of an enterprise
n bass system it should be fast reliable
a che ISPs are sorry thank you Mike PSR
is a probably an Oracle term I think
everyone uses something different
performance scalability and reliability
is the acronym that we use but it's just
one of those things that you should have
in any platform of the top 10 get you
want to be tool agnostic while still
supporting the ability to plug them in
so just I mean in our case where we're
providing plugins forget but the tools
that you actually use to write your code
you can use anything you want and it's
more important we talk about custom code
as well though for the most part this is
only for the server side we're not
dealing with the the client side code
here but when you're writing custom code
you want somewhere to distort and
integrate with whatever tools you're
using and of course above everything
else we want to be secure we've talked
the talk about that throughout the call
secure it every turn and to end from
client right right to the back end
systems you want to built into the
platform not something that's an
afterthought or tacked on later on the
client Oh ought to is
big the big leader these days
token-based authentication the tokens
can expire also supports the use to a do
third-party login so not necessarily i
dint authenticating answer your local
IDM provider you might want to login
using your facebook account your google
account thought to allows for that once
you're into the system your API is you
want to be able to secure them with role
based security that Mike talked about so
in our HR example only managers or
managers of a certain level maybe are
able to access certain pieces of
information on that application and then
again into secure access to the backend
system so if it's a back-end system that
supports a lot and again you know
typical in the BTE scenarios your
employee will have their credentials in
a lot of these back-end systems so when
they log in using oauth2 and their
mobile device you want to propagate that
token and that identity all the way to
the back end system so they get back
only the data that they're allowed to
see other systems maybe Jeanette may be
more generic and don't have the employee
information in them you'll have key
certificate management set up within the
connector itself so that any time the
connections come through it's
automatically taken care of for you and
obviously want all the all the transport
protocols to be secured with ssl whether
you're going from client to your to your
platform or platform at the back end
systems so mike is going to show us a
little bit here about what what a system
like this looks like we've talked about
a lot of the concepts here it'd be nice
it's nice to see them in in practice and
give you a better idea
no doesn't sound on there we go we have
on this you'll see welcome Hudson 1541
and that is my get-out-of-jail-free card
this is a development version so if
anything goes wrong we just blame it on
the development prior to things not my
fault right so I use this UI MCS account
and that's the user ok so the first
thing that we look at is this is called
a mobile backend as a service so there's
this notion of having a back-end a
mobile backend is kind of the
abstraction that you use within the
mobile cloud service to represent a
mobile application so it's a mobile
application sitting on a mobile device
and it talks to a mobile backend within
the cloud platform in the back end we've
called it geo MBE and this is version 1
associated with this back-end are a
number of keys because these are the way
that you get in and call API is that are
part of this back-end the mobile backend
can host api's we talked about API
management well this is kind of the the
entry into that and depending on what
your authentication mechanism is we see
that if you're using OAuth then you'll
have a consumer key a client ID with a
client secret and if your properties not
to tell anyone I'll even show it to you
there now you can access this this
mobile backend because you know the
client secret and you you put these two
pieces of information in your mobile
application and then that then uses it
to go to 0 auth to get a token if you're
just using basic auth you can use that
so that's a back-end and now what we
want to do is we want to create an API
within this back-end so let's go do that
here we have the API screen I've got no
custom api's right now but these are
custom api's we've got all the ones that
are the core services that we've just
been talking to you about I haven't
written any custom code here but we have
user management storage notifications
and it goes on and on stuff that we
recognize here database and other things
that maybe we don't recognize that we
said we offered well these are all
things that that are in the core cloud
platform their API is that pre-exists
and you can look at each one of these
and look at the AP is this is part of
your catalog of AP is so I can click on
those and find out those api's but we're
not doing that right now we're just
going to find out how to create our own
API so create a new API it just gives me
some help now before I do this what do I
want to do my goal is I want to this
site called geonames which allows me to
specify some information and call a
bunch of web service API s and it's sort
of global and there's a nice API in
there that allows me to pass in a postal
code that's a kind of a international
term for zip code and returns a bunch of
information back about that zip code or
postal code so that's what my API is
going to do I want to pass in the zip
code I want to get back we're that zip
code which the name of the town that zip
code refers to so I'm going to call this
the Geo API you'll see that this is
where this is how I invoke it it gives
you the URL that I used to invoke this
API I'll just geo a p.i and you'll see
at the bottom it says upload a ramble
document or drag it here so in other
words if I have a predefined Rammell
document that describes my api's I can
just drag that in it'll create all the
API is that I need or that are defined
in that ramble the alternative is like
what I'm doing and that is using the
designer to create my API so here it is
I've got this this API I want to define
an endpoint the endpoint is
create a new resource I'm going to call
the end point location that I wanted to
find a method for it get and this get
now from location is going to take
something called a postal code
and it's a string
furthermore I want to return a result
and if I i add a response for the
successful result i'll just make it a
straight string because i want to return
so in my example data i'll say it's
going to return I don't know we're from
Ottawa so well we'll just say it's
somewhere so it's recognizable that's
our demo data that's an example response
I'm going to save this okay now when I
go back to the other parts that I want
to fill in the security I can make it
anonymous so remember the Angry Birds
application that Jason talked about you
don't actually have to login or provide
credentials for that it's just something
that exists and you just play right so
from the server or the cloud platform
perspective it's anonymous the user is
just a user and so you could allow
anonymous access in my case I want to
specify that only users with a given
role in my case the mic role is anybody
here I'll named Mike ah so you might
have this role will find out so you must
have the mic role in order to invoke
this API so any user that has the mic
role can invoke this otherwise they'll
get none authorized and now if I go back
to the API I can see well let me just
open it this way
I can see the end the implementations I
don't have any but I can actually test
this API so I specified some sample data
in there the only hook is that I have to
specify a user and I prefilled in these
default credentials it has to come
through a mobile backend and that's the
GOM be because that's remember that's
the way that you call into API is
through some mobile backend in the
version 1 point 0 i am using OAuth
authentication and Mike Heath has been
specified to have the mic roll therefore
the only thing I need to do to test this
is put in some input string and I can
put anything I want because this is just
going to be using demo data it's going
to use that somewhere data because
there's no implementation and so it
returns somewhere that's actually just
calling the demo what if I want to
actually call my geonames API well for
to do that I need a connector and I did
predefine a connector which is pretty
easy to do
this
just call it a connector the key part
here is that I define the remote URL
this is the API URL to call api's for
geonames that's pretty much the bulk of
it the other configuration I had to add
is geonames requires that you pass in a
user and I create a user on this site
called Mike Keith and the the country is
going to be the US so every time I make
a call to this connector these two
parameters will be passed in along with
my call for me automatically security
we're not doing any security right now
this web service doesn't require
anything special so I don't need to do
anything special now I want to test this
connector so test this connector i'm
using this postal code epi as part of
the geo names part so I'm going to add
that in there it's called look up no
it's called postal code lookup
and who wants to pass me a zip code
anybody want to volunteer a zip code 14
589 ok so now I'm going to test oops I'm
gonna say postal code equals 14 589 now
we're just about to find out where this
person lives let's test it see if we can
talk to this geo service well 200 is
good news this is the information that
we got back from Williamson is that
right ok so it's a correct service now
this is the information that geonames is
returning us it's almost a lot long
everything else plus the place name we
only really want to return the place
name that's what our API returns this
connector returns a bunch of stuff so
our implementation looks like this I can
actually open this guy the JavaScript
for this implementation and all it's
going to do is this is the API you
access it as geo API location the postal
code lookup Jason is that is the
resource that revoking on the geonames
connector the gio con and I'm just going
to basically get the postal codes from
that and get the place name from that
this is just transforming the data I'm
getting back from the connector and
returning just the piece that I want so
whoops we don't want to scan I could
throw things into so now what we do is
we want to actually take the
implementation and upload it so let's go
back to the AP is going to invoke this
implementations there's no
implementations it's just that mock
implementation the default one I don't
need a JavaScript scaffold if I was
starting from fresh but I didn't have
this pre created implementation then I
would create a scaffold and start with
that but I'm not going to i'm just going
to upload the one that I got which is
this one that I just showed you so now
it becomes the default implementation
and I can test it so I'm testing the end
point that i set the application type I
think I did well we'll see in a second
so what's that postal code again 14 589
now all we should get back this time as
Williamson if it works I didn't forget
anything 200 is always good and there it
is Williamson so that's my API I pass in
the postcode I get back Williamson in
the middle I had a connector that went
to the API call called it some custom
code that took the piece out of there
that I wanted to pass back the mobile
device and then return that to mobile
device right this makes sense this is
the way mobile custom code is going to
work you don't want if you're doing
database queries for example you may do
a query it has a bunch of data but
they'd only want a certain piece of that
to pass back the mobile device because
the mobile devices don't like displaying
huge long result sets so this is just
kind of one simple example of creating
an API going through a connector calling
a public service and coming back we
didn't show anything about the mobile
device but we saw the URL the mobile
device calls that's all that needs to
happen is a mobile device the app
running on the mobile device calls that
API and that's what they get back we get
back the answer those summary well I
think I got a summary here let's see
here
I don't have a summary here click that
one give a summary that good so summary
yet the future is still mobile look saw
device they're becoming more and more
ubiquitous they're going to be more and
more out there more and more different
types and business are going to have to
adapt if you don't mobilize your
applications you'll be left behind it's
like a nearly 2000 s if you don't have a
web page you know it didn't matter you
feel like someone up on the web didn't
have a web page you ignored them you
went on to the next one is the same sort
of thing happening with mobile
applications you can't quite approach on
the same ways traditional apps there's a
lot of differences there's a lot more
features functional that people are
expecting other mobile apps API
management it's a start no good example
we saw today with the API management
that's not enough he's got to really add
all those mobile features in order to
really create rich applications and
enterprise companies they need
enterprise-grade empaths you can't just
have you know these little systems off
the shelf you got to have security built
in and to end robust implementations the
whole whole nine yards and analyst
developers architects for once they know
everyone seems to agree that em paz is
really going to be the the platform of
the future for hosting and running all
these mobile applications but we're a
little bit over time thanks everybody
for your patience and so you have any
questions will be around in the area
here and be happy dance enjoy it enjoy
