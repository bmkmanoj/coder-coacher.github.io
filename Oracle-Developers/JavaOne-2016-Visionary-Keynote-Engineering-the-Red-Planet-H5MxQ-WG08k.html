George Saab
hi good morning welcome to Java 1 i'm
very pleased to be here to introduce our
next speaker and and i wanted to say you
know one of the things that i think a
lot of us have in common is we're
completely sure that what we're doing is
you know very you know it's very complex
it's very advanced right is there anyone
who doesn't do advanced stuff in the
audience I know my team that makes the
JDK and the JVM we know that what we do
is rocket science well the next guest is
actually somebody who really does rocket
science our our guest has a master's and
PhD from USC and she was the lead
systems engineer for the revolutionary
uh-uh it's a call the revolutionary
parachute which was used in the landing
of the Mars Curiosity rover she also is
the project manager now for the cold
atom laboratory at JPL she's come to
visit us from Southern California we're
not going to hold that against her
please give a warm welcome to dr. anita
sengupta
thank you for the intro George well
thank you for having me everyone I'm
gonna go get my clicker as I'm the
presentation I'm gonna go through some
interesting slides for you so my
background is aerospace engineering
which is also known as rocket science so
everything that I've done for several
years has been related to either
speeding things up with propulsion
systems or slowing things down with
retro rockets and with parachutes and so
the topic of my talk today is probably a
bit of a departure from some of the
other topics of this conference but it
is how do we explore Mars and
specifically how do we use engineering
to get us to the red planet and so
several years ago I had the opportunity
to work on the Mars Science Laboratory
mission which landed the Curiosity rover
which you see here in this picture so
curiosity is essentially a robotic
geologist and it's the largest robotic
geologist but nASA has ever created and
sent to the surface of Mars and one of
the largest engineering challenges of
being able to send something the size of
a small car do planet which is 400
million kilometers away is to land it
safely on the surface and so I was part
of the engineering team which developed
that system and it was a very much a
highlight of my career and so for
reference what you see here in the
background is the planet Mars and so our
job was to land the Curiosity rover
which departed earth on a launch vehicle
into a crater called Gale Crater about
nine months after we initially launched
it so I'll talk a little bit about the
engineering challenges associated with
how you design that type of entry
descent landing system and then talk
about exactly what the rover has been
doing on the surface and why it's so
fascinating for us so first of all how
do we land on Mars we created a
wonderful video called seven minutes of
Terror which was intended to sort of
engage the planet Earth and children and
adults alike as to the challenges of
landing something on a planet so many
millions of miles away and it takes you
seven minutes to get from the top of the
atmosphere down to the surface of the
planet so please enjoy
when people look at it it looks crazy
that's a very natural thing sometimes
when we look at it it looks crazy it is
the result of reasoned engineering
thought but it still looks crazy the top
of the atmosphere down to the surface it
takes a seven minutes it takes 14
minutes or so for the signal from the
spacecraft to make it to earth that's
how far Mars is away from us so when we
first get word that we touch at the top
of the atmosphere
the vehicle has been alive or dead on
the surface
for at least seven minutes
entry descent landing also known as edl
referred to as a seven minutes of Terror
because we've got literally seven
minutes to get from atop the atmosphere
to the surface of Mars going from 13,000
miles an hour 20 and perfect sequence
perfect choreography perfect timing and
the computer has to do it all by itself
with no help from the ground if any one
thing doesn't work just right it's game
over you slam into the atmosphere and
develop so much aerodynamic drag our
heat shield it's up and it glows like
the surface of the Sun 1600 degrees
during entry the vehicles are already
slowing down violently
through the atmosphere but also we are
guiding like an airplane to be able to
land in a very narrow constrained space
this is one of the biggest challenges
that we are facing and one that we have
never attempted on Mars Mars is actually
really hard to slow down because it has
just enough atmosphere that you have to
deal with it otherwise it will destroy
your spacecraft on the other hand it
doesn't have enough atmosphere to finish
the job we're still going about thousand
miles an hour so at that point we use a
parachute a parachute is the largest and
strongest supersonic parachute that
we've ever built to date it has to be
able to withstand 65,000 pounds of force
even though the parachute itself only
weighs about 100 pounds when opens up
that fast it's a neck snapping nine G's
at that point we have to get that heat
shield off it's like a big lens cap
blocking our view of the ground to the
radar the radar has to take just the
right altitude and velocity measurements
at just the right time or the rest of
the landing sequence won't work
this big huge parachute that we've got
it only slows down to about 200 miles
now that's not slow enough to land so we
have no choice but we got cut it off and
then come down in rockets
one concern those rocket motors on we
don't do something weird you're gonna
snap right back into the parachute so
the first thing we do is make this
really radical diver community fly off
to the side diverting away from the
parachute killing our horizontal
velocity and our vertical velocity
getting it over moving straight up and
down so look at the surface with its
radar see where we're going to land go
ahead straight down to the bottom of the
later
right beside six corner high note
we can't get those brought it into the
tooth or two things because if you were
to descend compulsively with our engines
all the way to the ground we essentially
create this massive dust cloud that dust
cloud could then go and land on the
rover it could damage mechanisms and
academic instruments so the way we solve
that problem is by using the sky cream
20 meters above the surface we have to
Lothal over below us or it's heaven it's
21
and then gently the positive on it's
been promised her
as the rover touches down and is now on
the ground the descent state it's in a
collision course with a road we must cut
the bridle immediately and flight in the
same stage away to a safe distance from
the road so what's so exciting of course
is that that appears to be science
fiction but in fact it's science fact so
we were able to engineer that very
complex system and safely limit
Curiosity rover on the surface of the
planet just over four years ago today so
first of all though people like to ask
me why is it that we're so interested in
Mars and this drawing you see here shows
you a photograph of the earth taking
from space and a photograph of Mars
taken from space and you can see that
the planets are quite different from
each other but at the beginning of time
when the solar system first formed we
actually believe that Mars did have an
atmosphere a thick atmosphere and it had
appreciable water flowing on the surface
so something happened over the course of
the past several billion years which
made Mars evolved into a dry dusty cold
rock compared to earth which obviously
has very large oceans and a thick
atmosphere with oxygen so that we're
able to survive on the surface but what
that means though is that if we were to
one day go and colonize another planet
in our solar system would we want to go
to Mars and the answer is actually yes
because even though Mars doesn't have
appreciable water on the surface it
probably still has it in the subsurface
which could be used by future human
colonies and the other benefit of Mars
it's not that far from Earth it's a
smaller planet but it does have about
one-third the gravity so it's not as
difficult to be able to survive in a
one-third G environment as opposed to a
GRE environment um there is an
atmosphere we actually use that
atmosphere to slow ourselves down during
the entrance entry descent and landing
sequence that you just saw and so you
could conceivably use that atmosphere
which primarily contains carbon dioxide
to make fuels such as methane if you
brought enough supplies with you now it
is a much colder planet than Earth
because the atmosphere is very thin and
it's further away from the Sun but if
you can imagine during the Martian
summer day in the equatorial regions it
actually can get to a temperature on the
order of California temperature although
of course during the wintertime it can
get much coal
minus 120 degrees Fahrenheit the big
challenge of course though is that the
atmospheric pressure is quite low it's
only about 1% at the surface as what it
is on earth which means that if you were
to live on the surface of Mars you would
have to bring your own air supplies with
you as well as live in a pressurized
environment but compared to the moon and
compared to the vacuum environment space
Mars is actually far more habitable
compared to what it would be if we were
to go to a more distant planet for
example the one challenge which isn't
too much of one however is that the
Martian day is only slightly longer than
the earth day so even our bodies
wouldn't have that difficult of a
challenge to be able to be accustomed to
twenty four point six hours versus 24
hours but what is so fascinating about
Mars though is it has had an active
geological history so one of the reasons
why we do space exploration is to
understand how did our solar system
evolve how did our planets of all and
what we do know is that in the past Mars
was actually very volcanic ly active and
what you see up here is Olympus Mons
Olympus Mons is largest mountain in our
solar system and it's an extinct volcano
it's three times as high as Mount
Everest that can give you the scale of
how large the volcano was and the amount
of material that it probably did see you
across the surface millions or billions
of years ago but now the volcano appears
to be um inactive and we don't
understand why why did we have all this
volcanism in the past but don't appear
to have it now we actually are sending a
mission very soon which is gonna look
for evidence of Mars wakes if they are
still present another really interesting
feature is Valles Marineris which is
sort of the scar that goes across the
center of the planet and it's kind of a
kid into Mars as Grand Canyon so at some
point in Mars's past there was a lot of
water flowing on the surface but where
did the water go is it frozen the
subsurface did it all evaporate off of
the atmosphere and the way we answer
some of those questions about why the
volcanism changed how did that change
the environment of Mars where is the
water today is by setting spacecraft to
orbit Mars as well as Rovers and Landers
to explore the surface to take
scientific measurements for us so Mars
actually has moons not everyone is aware
of this it's that are called Phobos and
Deimos they're relatively small which is
the reason why they kind of still look
like potato type structures they haven't
you know crushed under their own
gravitational for
in one potential architecture is to
actually for us to go and visit those
moons Sela set up a telecommunications
relay and potentially mine valuable
minerals or even water that might be on
the surface of these moons as a future
sort of human mission architecture so by
a show of hands who thinks we found
water on Mars well we actually have and
so we have found water frozen in the
subsurface region what you see in this
picture is a Phoenix lander which was in
the mid-2000s came down was landing on
its retro rockets kicking up all the
dust and soil and the little patch that
you see beneath it it's actually frozen
water ice so it's like a salty water ice
brine so we know there is water it's in
the subsurface and we would have to tap
into it if we were in future to be able
to send people there to utilize it from
a colonization perspective now really
you finding i would say which is in
roughly the sep tember of 2015 time
period is that we actually confirmed
that we found flowing water on the
surface of Mars and the picture you see
on the upper right and all of these
images are taken by a spacecraft called
mro the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and
it takes beautiful high-resolution
images across the entire planet and
those black streaks that you see going
across this image and coming down on
this image are actually seeps of water
from the subsurface material which comes
down the sides of cliff faces it's not
that much it's seasonal but we do still
see it which means that we can
potentially tap into these subsurface
aquifers and what might reside in that
water we don't know until we actually go
and visit it and so we have a lot of
data as to what the surface of Mars
looks like from both an engineering
perspective and there were collecting
more data understand what it means from
a scientific perspective um so we have
landed on Mars a total of seven times
now with the u.s. space program we're
the only space program to date which has
been successful other ones have tried
haven't been successful it's a very
difficult thing to do so we build off of
our prior experiences we had the Viking
landers which landed the 1970s you can
imagine the computer technology that was
available at that time not so much as
probably far less so than what you have
even in your own individual smartphone
we also landed the Pathfinder Rover
which was about the size of a Tonka
truck we landed that in the 1990s in the
early 2000s we landed the Mars
exploration Rovers which is roughly the
size of a lawnmower
there was two of the marae and Murr be
and then we had the Phoenix lander which
was in the mid 2000s and then august of
2012 was the Curiosity rover so each
time we have these missions we build
upon our expertise from an engineering
perspective from the prior missions and
we increase our scientific knowledge
base as we go again and again to the
surface to collect more information and
we have two missions which are coming up
now which is the insight mission
launching in 2018 which is going to look
for evidence of Mars quakes and we also
have the Mars 2020 mission which is
going to send another Rover to the
surface and cash a sample to hopefully
bring back to earth one day for further
analysis and these are all images that
were taken of the Rovers over time in
these individual missions so what I'd
like to show you here is the evolution
of technology so ironically in the
evolution of computer technology you
start big and you go small in the
evolution of rover technology we start
small and go big and the reason for that
is that you can carry more scientific
equipment if you have a larger platform
so if you were going to move your house
you wouldn't move it on the back of your
bicycle right or on the back of
motorcycle you would move it on the back
of a large moving truck and so as we
increase the wheelbase it increase the
mass that we can send to the surface of
Mars we can make more interesting
scientific measurements as you can see
the evolution from the small Tonka truck
sighs rover going all the way up to the
Curiosity rover which has an also a new
power system which enables it to go to
more interesting terrain over larger
rocks and operate for a larger portion
of the day and i'll talk to you a little
bit about what some of that scientific
equipment is that it's carrying on its
back um so the Mars Science Laboratory
mission specifically was there to assess
whether or not Mars could have once been
habitable and could still be habitable
today and the way we do that is by
making a series of scientific
measurements one of them is to look to
see whether or not there could be any
biological potential we do that by
taking a look at our organics present
are the building blocks of organic
molecules present we want to also
understand how the rocks and the
minerals formed that they form due to
water based geological processes or
something else well they also want to
understand what the radiation
environment is so if any of you have
seen the Martian I assume most of you
probably see the Martian one of the
biggest challenges for sending people to
live on
surface of any other planet in our solar
system or moon in our solar system is
what is the radiation environment going
to be like and so this is the very first
mission where we actually make
measurements of what the surface
radiation is which will allow us to
understand do we need to develop new
shielding technologies in what kind of
environment are we going to see if we
live on the surface for extended periods
of time so that actually is a really a
big challenge that we have ahead of us
and so we do that by carrying a suite of
scientific instruments on the back of
the rover so then of course the obvious
question becomes where are we going to
land the rover right Mars is a large
planet just like Earth is a large planet
so they have to pick a location which is
going to be scientifically interesting
so if you are an alien race coming down
to earth and you were looking for life
would you go to the middle of the Sahara
Desert or would you go to the middle of
the Amazon rainforest you go to the rain
forest right so on Mars we don't have
that exact same sort of geographical
selection because the planet has lost
most of its water but there are regions
on the planet which did have large water
bodies and so we selected a location
called gale crater which you can see on
the lower image here um where we believe
there was an ancient riverbed or lake
bed presence and where better to look
for evidence of past sedimentary rock
formation or even past organic molecule
deposits than the base of an ancient
water body so he selected Gale Crater
and then just for reference for those of
you who are fans of the Mars program MSL
Curiosity rover was landed in Gale
Crater the prior Rovers the Mars
exploration Rovers were landed in
meridiani so there are very large
distance between them so unfortunately
you know you can't drive from once the
next because you're not able to drive
out of the crater and if you remember
from the Martian movie he was actually
able to go over and pick up the RTG from
another Rover and use it for his power
system so we don't have the capacity to
do that as we actually don't have the
driving distance capacity which is
actually largely driven by computational
on constraints for our flight computers
that we use which is an interesting
aside so in terms of Gale Crater this is
what it looks like in a
three-dimensional sense and so for scale
