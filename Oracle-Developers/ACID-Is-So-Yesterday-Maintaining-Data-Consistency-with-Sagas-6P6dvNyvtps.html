there's so many of you who are you know
here to hear about you know what's kind
of a super interesting topic and in many
ways it's kind of like one of the key
challenges with migrating to a micro
service architecture namely how do you
deal with with the problem of
distributed data because not only are
you breaking up your code but you're
also having to break up your data you
know the idea is that each service has
its own data that's separate and not
shared with any other services and that
creates some some huge headaches in a
way you know it's worth it but but but
there's a couple of key technical issues
that you have to address and so in this
talk I'm going to deal with transaction
management there's another problem with
queries and there's some other patterns
for that but for the next 45 minutes I'm
going to be talking about sagas which is
an alternative transaction model
hence sort of this idea that acid is
yesterday in reality acid works
wonderfully within a service but between
services you actually need a different
model for your transactions but before I
talk about that a little bit about me so
I live just across the bay in Oakland
I've got my start in programming back in
the mid to late 80s building Lisp
systems Lisp of course being that
language with funny parenthesis
functional and then object-oriented so I
works on on Lisp systems for seven plus
years eventually ended up programming in
Java wrote the book pojos in action
which came out ten years ago that was
all about how to build applications with
spring and hibernate which were
transforming Enterprise Java development
then I started tinkering with this
really obscure service known as Amazon
ec2 you know it was bizarre that this
bookstore had an API for provisioning
service but it was so cool blew my mind
ended up creating Cloud Foundry the
original one there was a pass for
deploying java applications on ec2
that then got acquired by spring
sauce back in 2009 right before when
spring sauce was acquired by VMware and
then like four years ago we were sort of
rejected out into pivotal and then I was
at pivotal for a few months and left and
so for the past four years now I've been
pretty much focused on the micro service
architecture kind of grew out of my
interest with with the cloud and with
pass you know there's a lot of synergy
between the two so I do consulting and
training around the micro service
architecture help companies get started
with it also working on a start-up and
we're building a platform to simplify
the development of transactional micro
services and some of the concepts I'm
talking about today are actually
embodied in our platform and I'm also
writing a book on on micro services I'm
reliving the trauma of the first one
though hopefully not quite as bad that's
available through Manning right now and
with that code CTW Java 117 you get a
40% discount anyway and oh yes and also
if you want to know more go to learn
micro services dot IO it's my second
favorite place on the web if you any of
you Josh Long's presentation last night
doesn't rhyme quite as well anyway
that's me so here's the agenda so I'm
going to sort of start off by talking
about the problems that you have in a
micro service architecture dealing with
distributed data talk about this concept
of a saga and then dive into various
different aspects of of sagas like how
what are they how do you make them work
and and also look at the inter process
communication mechanism that you're
going to use in in a saga based
application so you know we look at the
micro service architecture you know I
talked about this briefly yesterday at
the buff now so the micro service
architecture is a application style that
structures an application as a set of
loosely coupled services
so in other words you instead of having
this monolithic application you have
numerous smaller applications that
coarser versus each one focused on a
particular business function and they
collaborate through either messaging or
some RPC or rest and so on and the whole
point of doing that is really to enable
the continuous delivery of large complex
applications at some point if you have a
monolith it's gonna get so big that you
can't really be agile with it and at
that point you functionally decompose it
into services so that you can continue
to deliver quickly and the reason this
works is that the micro service
architecture gives you the testability
you know these services are small and
independently testable and the
deployability you know that's because
the services can be independently
deployed that you need in order to
practice continuous delivery and
deployment and then there's the added
benefit that the micro service
architecture enables teams small teams
of developers to be autonomous to work
independently each team of developers
owns one or more services that they can
develop test and deploy and scale
independently of one another once
they've agreed on their api's you know
once you've negotiated your contracts
between the between your services you
can develop in parallel at that point so
you know a simplistic micro service
architecture would look something like
this where you have a bunch of services
sitting in front of them would be an API
gateway that provides a unified
interface to various clients out there
but then there's the really distinctive
feature namely the this concept of a
database / service which really means
private data it does not mean that we're
going to give Larry Ellison and you know
10x as much money because we've got to
buy all these Oracle licenses per per
service so it could translate to
something as simple as a private schema
per service the the key point is
is that in order to ensure loose
coupling services do not access one
another's data so in this really simple
example you know I've got the order
service that manages orders the customer
service that manages customers they each
have their own private databases and the
only way that you can get at that data
is indirectly through the API of that
service so the order service can't
access the tables of the customer
service and the and and vice versa and
the reason you want to do that is simply
because if if services communicate via
database tables they are tightly coupled
for instance if I'm working on the order
table if I know that is but all the
order service I can change the schema of
the order table and the order database
without having to go talk to anyone else
in my organization right whereas as soon
as someone else is accessing my tables
I've got to go schedule a meeting right
and and as soon as you go outside of
your team you with it slows you down and
the more people you have to coordinate
with the slower your development will be
because everyone else is going to have
their own conflicting priorities and so
if you have to place schedule around
them it could take months before you can
put that schema change into production
versus doing it right now and deploying
that change you know within a few
minutes so that's that's kind of the
goal and that actually I mean this is
kind of a really interesting problem
because you know conceptually we want to
have in it we're used to having this
enterprise wide domain model one place
to go get customer data for example and
this this concept of the micro service
architecture really turns that idea on
its head and then it creates some really
interesting technical problems as well
so you know we rely heavily on the acid
properties of database transactions
to keep our database consistent and at a
higher level to actually enforce various
business rules so for instance imagine
in this application customers have a
credit limit right and so there's this
invariant that needs to be enforced at
all times namely if you add up the
totals of all of the open orders they
can never ever exceed the credit limit
and in a normal traditional application
you would rely on the sort of acid
properties of transactions to fought to
enforce that you would write sort of
sequel that looks like this way you
query the order table to find the
existing open orders you you query the
customer table to get the existing
credit you'd figure out whether there
was enough credit and then you insert a
new order and this would all be
happening within a single transaction
and the nice thing about this is that
this serializable property of a database
transaction will ensure that that
invariant is enforced at all times I
mean there's a little bit of fine print
here about database isolation levels and
sort of locking in details but
conceptually you've got this nice acid
programming model the problem that you
have in a micro service architecture is
that the tables are in different
services and are private to those
services so you just can't write sort of
a database transaction that omits sequel
that looks like this and if you wanted
to you would have to use a distributor
transaction because this is now spanning
multiple services at a minimum you'd
somehow have to propagate the
transaction ID between services so that
they could all participate in a
transaction in if there was just one
underlying database so it's sort of
tricky and it turns out that really in
modern applications we don't use
two-phase commit on the one hand it does
guarantee consistency
though there I think if you go read the
fine print on how distributed
transactions work there's some subtle
points but there's a whole bunch of
practical issues around using
distributed transactions
you know namely like the coordinators a
single point of failure there's a lot of
chattiness in the implementation you
might have to use locks and then some
really practical points that you know
it's not supported by a many modern
technologies so if you want to use
two-phase commit your having to use sort
of more traditional databases and
message brokers you know whereas if you
you know like you want to pick a no
sequel database vast majority of them
don't support distributor transactions
and more than message brokers don't
either
and then there's also this cap theorem
where it's like pick two of three and so
you know you have consistency
availability and partitioning and you
want to pick you can pick two of them
and that boils down to a choice between
consistency and availability and people
prefer to be available as opposed to
consistent so they're sort of both very
you know sort of imp sort of
implementation issues practical reasons
and then this kathy reticle reason why
distributed transactions are problematic
so what this translates into is that yes
within a service you can use acid
transactions but between a service
between services you basically have to
adopt an entirely different transaction
model which hasn't really caught on but
some people have referred to as base
right so instead of acid you have base
and that's and then the kind of the
keyword there yeah remember if you can
remember your chemistry from a long time
ago right and the sort of the key word
there whether it's a bond keyword is
available right it's stressing
availability as opposed to consistency
and it's stressing eventual consistency
so it's sort of like we're gonna I'm
going to talk about something that will
make DBAs feel very uncomfortable right
your data will not necessarily be
consistent eventually it will be and the
funny thing is is that in reality the
real world is not does not used at acid
transactions anyway you know the famous
paper was it was like Starbucks does not
use two-phase commit right you can order
your coffee and walk out they don't lock
the door until you've made your coffee
right and you've you've water and you
you have it in your hand you know so
there's there's all kinds of
inconsistencies in the real wire or if I
was to transfer money to one of your
bank accounts it would probably
disappear out of mine eventually
immediately and eventually show up in
yours
so the real world's not really acid
anyway okay so the model is to use sagas
and the concept of sagas was proposed in
a paper 30-plus years ago called sagas
computer scientists at princeton and
strictly speaking what i'm talking about
here are distributed sagas they had in
that paper they had a slightly different
motivation but the idea is instead of
having a distributed transaction that
spans multiple services instead you use
a saga that is a sequence of local
transactions one each one occurs in each
local transaction occurs in a single
service and as you're going to see that
they're basically chained together using
messages or event and when the saga has
completed the site of the the outcome of
that saga is equivalent to a distributed
transaction but without the sort of acid
properties because the the the the
effects of each local transaction are
immediately available
immediately visible among other things
and giving up on serializability as well
because these sagas can be into into
woven but that's the idea you you you
you accomplish what you need to do using
a sequence of local transactions so in
the case of the of creating an order it
would work something like this so the
request comes in to create an order
it creates an order in a pending state
and then somehow triggers the next step
which reserves credit in the customer so
kind of says that order 1 2 3 is
allocated this much of the available
credit for this customer and then
there's a third step that approves the
order in the order service as in other
words I've reserved credit
I can now approve this order and let's
imagine that in a more complex
application you had to reserve inventory
as well there would be a fourth step so
you'd create the order you've reserved
the credit you you would reserve
inventory and then you would approve the
order so that's the general idea I mean
though there's you know and it is on at
a high level it's can it's conceptually
quite simple it's different and there's
a whole bunch of kind of consequences of
doing things this way
but you know in particular there's some
sort of kind of interesting challenges
so one of them is rolling back so the
nice thing about asset transactions is
you can make a bunch of changes and then
just decide not to commit the
transaction and it's as if you have done
nothing right it's it's just you know
that's the end of it whereas you think
about how a saga works it's a sequence
of local transactions the the effects of
each transaction have already been
committed so you might be executing the
tenth step of a saga discover that a
business rule would is going to be
violated
and now you have to actually undo the
effects of the preceding nine steps and
so that's when you have to write
compensating transactions to undo what
has been done previously
so saga ends up looking like this where
for each forward action which I've
cooled T so we've got T 1 T 2 T 3 and so
on you have a corresponding C C 1 C 2 C
3 that is the compensating transaction
so 2 C 1 undoes what T 1 does C 2 undoes
what T 2 does and so on
so then in a simple scenario let's
imagine that you've executed T 1 you're
trying to execute T 2 it discovers that
a business rule will be violated and so
you need to undo what C 1 what C 1 did
so the sequence of transactions becomes
T 1 T 2 which fails C 1 to undo what T 1
did so in the case of the creating order
scenario it would look something like
this where you create the order you
attempt to reserve credit the credit
limit is exceeded
and so the compensating transaction is
there for to reject the order and it you
know it's it's not necessarily rocket
science to implement these compensating
transactions it's just more work you
have to X
kind of explicitly plan them you know
reach forward step figure out what the
undo operation is and then when an error
occurs ensure that the the compensating
transactions are executed in reverse
order another issue you have to deal
with is sagas are inherently as you're
going to see inherently asynchronous but
if you have a REST API that is
synchronous there's a conflict between
the two you know a request is going to
come in it's going to initiate this saga
and that's a whole they owe these
services start at
changing messages and so it's the issue
therefore becomes when do you send back
the HTTP response so one option is to
keep the API identical and to send back
a response when the Saga completes and
that you know this they were exchanging
messages but were or is exchanging
messages anyway over a network
regardless of what communication
protocol we're using so it's not
impractical to do it this way you know
and the nice thing is the API is
unchanged you know the client would
immediately know whether the order has
been accepted or rejected the downside
is you are actually dependent on all of
the participating services being up and
able to respond in a timely way so that
you can send back the response so in
many ways a better approach is to send
back a response immediately to say I've
received your request to create this
order and the order number is this but
if you want to know about the actual
outcome of that request check back later
which actually pushes the burden onto
the client but it's it gives you much
better availability so the API would
look like this so create order no longer
tells you whether it's been accepted or
rejected merely that it has been created
and then the client is going to have to
call back periodically to find out
whether it was successful or not but
yeah a little bit complicated this
doesn't impact the user experience you
know if you've got sort of JavaScript
running in the browser it can just
behind the scenes keep holing until a
response comes back the server could
even push a WebSocket message to the
browser to to tell it the outcome of
creating the orders to eliminate the
poling so that that's it's a it's more
work but it's not that challenging a
tricky problem however is dealing with
the fact that sagas
are no longer atomic their base they can
be interwoven so let's imagine that
you've created an order and while it's
still in the process of being validated
the user just decides to cancel the
order
somehow right so in other words the the
the cancel order request has been his
saw saga is now kind of into woven with
the create order saga and it's sort of
like hmm how on earth do I cancel an
order that I'm still in the process of
creating you know it's kind of this is
actually turns out to be kind of a kind
of a tricky issue do you somehow quote
interrupts the create order saga to say
hey stop what you're doing and go go
cancel what you've undone you know what
you've done
maybe or does the cancel operation
somehow wait for the create order saga
to complete so this kind of it's sort of
this tricky issue there's sort of the
option I'm leaning towards right now is
that in order for the to keep the sagas
kind of isolated from one another
because you could you could set a flag
to tell the create orders to create
order saga to stop what it's doing and
cancel the order
but now the create order Sargon has to
know about how to cancel the order
and so that logic is interwoven so kind
of I'm leaning towards the second option
where basically there's some kind of
queuing mechanism where the create order
the cancel
order saga is not executed until the
create order of saga is completed it's
not always necessarily this complicated
like if you're just transferring money
you can you can interweave debits and
credits without kind without this sort
of complication I think at some level it
depends on whether the operations you're
performing on object
a sort of commutative and associative
and debits and credits kind of are where
is cants creation and canceling or not
so there's some trickiness there so
let's just gloss over that and talk
about the implementation details because
it's it's technology and much more
interesting no I mean banging my bit
well I sort of know exactly banging my
head but I've been going back and forth
on that last on the issues on that last
slide for a while
okay so sagas are like these workflows
in a sense and so there's some it's a
sequence of operations T ones or T eyes
I should say and then if you have a
failure you've got a sequence that the
the T the C is and so this there's a
need for some coordination logic to
figure out what to do next and so
there's a couple of choices one is
choreography where you've got
distributed decision-making and the
other option is orchestration way you
have centralized decision-making so with
choreography you just have the
participants in the saga can just
publish events to say hey this has
happened another participant receives
that event and goes oh well if that's
happened I'm going to do this and then
they're going to publish an event so in
the case of of creating an order it
would look like this so the order is
created it order service publishes an
event customer service gets that event
and says oh I need to reserve credit so
it's going to reserve credit and then
publish an event indicating the outcome
of that attempt to reserve the credit
and then the order service could he
could based on based on which event it
gets either approve or reject the order
and if there was a inventory service
that could do the same thing right it
could get the create order of that order
created event and then reserve in
inventory publishing event and and so on
so you know this works this kind of a
fairly simple approach and when I was
doing a whole bunch of work on event
sourcing basically created that scheme
before really thinking at a higher level
oh yeah I'm implementing Sagas and using
using Orchestra using choreography and
this you know it actually you know the
benefit is that the participants are
loosely coupled as well the downside is
that services are listening to each
other's events and so there's some kind
of complication there cyclic
dependencies the order has to the this
also some of the domain objects need to
know sort of too much in the sense that
the customer had a domain object has to
know that when an order created event is
published that it has to reserve credit
when in various other order events like
order cancel to publish it has to
unreserve that credit so there's sort of
that coupling there and the order order
service has to know that about the
customer service in the in the inventory
service to know well I've got events
from each of those and based on that I
have to do such and such an operation
also events are kind of an indirect
thing as well so for this reason it's
often better to actually just centralize
the business logic into a kind of an
Orchestrator so you know basically have
some object that is directing the
participants in the saga and just
telling them what to do and so a saga
Orchestrator which I can kind of
abbreviate to just a saga it's really
this persistent object that sort of
tracks the state of the world it's
basically a mini workflow engine the
very very lightweight and just sends
requests to the participants telling
them what to do and so it's behavior is
fairly straightforward so when it's
created it figures out what I'm going to
tell the first saga participant to do
something and then when that saga
participant replies the orchestrator
says well based on that reply should I
go to the next step if and which one of
perhaps several possible next steps or
should I start executing compensating
transactions and then it figures out
what saga participants who invoke tells
it what to do and and then updates its
persistence stayed in the database and
so it's basically executing this this
loop which as you're going to see is
message driven where it's sending
messages to the participants getting
replies back up figuring out what to do
sending another message and and so on
and so forth until it completes
so the flow looks like this where you
know you create an order and actually
that the order service in the example
creates the order saga explicitly the
order saga then tells the customer
service to reserve credits so it's just
invoking an operation with inside the
customer service which is then sending
back a reply and then the create order
saga based on the nature of that reply
is either approving or rejecting the
order so it's kind of a different model
instead of just events being published
and triggering what to do it's a much
more sort of directed approach where the
where this sort of saga Orchestrator is
telling the participants what to do and
as I said this is going to be done by
sending the messages so got a little bit
of code hopefully you can read this this
this will appear in a github repository
very very soon within the next week so
then this sort of simple saga framework
so there's that it's a generic type
where the type parameter is the sagas
data you know it's sort of the working
data that it needs and that's actually
what is persisted
in the database so then the saga
definition is sort of defining the
workflow so it's a sequence of steps and
each step is is in the most general case
a forward action a TI and a
corresponding C I this examples that
simplified but you can see in the DSL
there's Kools - with compensation which
in this case rejects the order invoke
participant which is a four which is a
TI and then the parameter to those
methods is actually a function so I'm
using a method reference there and that
function takes the create order data and
computes a message a command message to
send to a specified destination so it's
just a simple DSL for basically defining
what is a state machine that just
figures out what commands to send to a
to a site to what Sagar participant and
then what to do once it's got that that
reply so that's kind of the general idea
that's what the orchestration logic
looks like and then on the on the
participants side this is sort of
similar framework to support message to
support command message processing so
like the handler definition method
returns basically a collection of
message handlers saying subscribe to
this channel when you get this message
invoke this message Handler and that's
passed a command message yeah that's
kind of wrapped in an envelope and
that's going to execute some domain
logic and then compute a reply either a
success or a failure so that that's kind
of the the processing logic and it's
fairly fairly straightforward to
implement you know once again it's a
very different style of program
from just writing and asked the
transaction and as you're gonna see it
what's happening under the covers is
messages of being exchanged but it's
fairly straightforward and the code for
this will actually appear in this github
repo within a within by the end of next
week or I will be in trouble with my
publisher because it's sort of wrapped
up with a key deadline for my book as
well so so that anyway so that's
orchestration the nice thing is the
actual flow sort of workflow instead of
being scattered around and implicit it's
actually explicit and centralized in one
place also that the orchestrator is
telling the participants what to do so
the customer service is exposing an api
for reserving credit and it actually
reduces cyclic dependencies as well the
downside though is you know there's
always a risk that you're centralizing
too much logic in the in the in the sort
of the author kind of the orchestrator
and the service is a kind of dumb but as
you can see with the framework that i've
implemented there's kind of next to no
logic in the orchestrate it's really
just figuring out what message to send
to which participant okay so that that's
that that's kind of the basic idea
behind coordinating sagas the next topic
I want to talk about is like how how's
all this communication happening so one
thing that's interesting is this well
that's you know heavy emphasis on rest
right and maybe GRP see basically
synchronous protocols and it turns out
as you're gonna see I think in in a
micro service architecture you're going
to rely very very heavily on
asynchronous message based communication
you know so the flow that you need to
implement is the saga orchestrate and
needs to teller needs to basically
invoke
participant which needs to send back a
reply and this has to work even if there
are transient failures right you know
this a saga participant service could be
down or the saga Orchestrator could be
down temporarily right like you know
micro service architecture services are
kind of yeah
it's very sort of dynamic fluid
situation and it's like once a saga has
started it has to complete and you
should not have the sort of the temporal
coupling that results from using
synchronous communication so the idea
basically is you just use asynchronous
messaging you know the saga Orchestrator
sends a message and the message broker
will implement at least once guaranteed
delivery of your messages so it does not
matter whether that whether the
recipient of a message is up or down at
the time that message is sent it will be
delivered eventually and that kind of
makes this reliable and ensures that
your sagas once they've started will
actually complete so the flow kind of
looks like this where you know you've
got these message channels so every
service conceptually has a request
channel every saga conceptually has a
reply channel so when the saga wants to
send a command it just sends to a
service it just puts that sends that
command message to the appropriate
message Channel
the customer service receives it updates
the customer sends back a reply to the
reply channel that was specified in the
commands you know headers which would be
the saga reply channel and so that
that's basically the communication
mechanism and you know relying entirely
on messaging via these channels and on
the surface that does that seems quite
simple but you know there's another
wrinkle namely we're trying to update
the database
and send messages or process and receive
messages update the database and publish
another message as part of an atomic
transaction you know all of those things
have to happen atomically or we've
actually just got a unreliable system at
that point because if if it wasn't
atomic you could update the database and
then fail to publish a message and your
system would be in this permanently
inconsistent state so we've sort of you
know we kind of got multiple levels of
problems that we need to address and so
you need of some form of transactional
messaging to make that happen and the
irony is is the standard way of doing
that would just be to use JTA JDBC in
JMS write distributed transaction
involving both your database and your
message broker but for the reasons I
kind of talked about you can't do it
that way and so you need an alternative
approach so one strategy is to publish
message is to publish messages by
inserting the message into a database
table as part of the atomic transacted
transaction that's also updated your
domain object so for instance I might
have created an order and I want to send
a message so I will do that I will send
that message by inserting it into a
message table and then there's another
database then there's some mechanism
that is pulling in that because I've
done those things as part of an asset
transaction that's guaranteed to be
atomic and then there's a separate
process or mechanism that is pulling the
messages out of the message table and
publishing them to a message broker so
we've got atomicity and now we just have
to figure out how to publish those
messages in in this message table and
one strategy is you just polled a
message table yeah just select stuff
the message is unpublished send it to
your message broker and then delete the
message out of the message table another
option is to actually tell the database
transaction log so if you know every
committed change to your data will end
up in the transaction log and different
databases have different ways of
exposing the transaction log and you can
just basically tell the log see the
stream of changes and pull and whenever
you see an insert to that into the
message table publish it to the message
broker so for instance with my sequel
you know it has the bin log so you just
connect as if you were a my sequel slave
speaking the appropriate protocol and
you see a stream of changes and you can
just publish them to a database to a
message broker and that that works well
and then the other option which is sort
of how I got into all of this is from
the beginning so this presentation is
sort of history backwards in it in a
sense you know event sourcing which is
an event centric way of persisting your
domain objects actually gives you this
ass atomicity because there's basically
an event store which when you save
events into that event store they're at
their experiment so for instance your
order would be persisted as a sequence
of domain events so when it's created an
order created event would be inserted
into the event table and published when
it's approved another event would be
inserted and published and so on and so
forth so there's sort of a variety of
different mechanisms that you can use to
underlie to provide the transactional
mech messaging that you need in order
for sagas to work correctly but that's
like you know at least two or three
other talks
to cover that so that's pretty much all
I had to say today so you know in
summary right you know the reason you
want to use micro services is to sort of
tackle complexity accelerate development
you know a key way in which you achieve
loose coupling is for each service to
have its own database that creates
problems around distributed transaction
management and you need to use sagas to
maintain data maintain data consistency
across your services and in order for
your sagas to actually work reliably you
need to implement some form of
transactional messaging and as I said
framework to support this will be will
be a right appearing in a github
repository next week so anyway that's my
talk thank you for listening and I hope
that you found it useful and you know
happily take a few questions now and
I'll happily talk afterwards
so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
