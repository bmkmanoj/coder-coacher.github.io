beer that we actually produce off of the
tanks that are equipped with the sensors
the quality is very good
Oracle approached me with an opportunity
to automate our brewing system it's very
useful to be able to monitor the
temperature through phone get real-time
readings it's nice to be able to check
and just get that you can take data that
will help us make better beer I think
it's a really cool feature that there is
an app where people can rate our beer in
real time and we can compare that with
our data that we are collecting all of
the sensors everyone from Oracle and
relayer has the great production has
definitely improved with getting all
this data from
it's art just as much as a science
or an IOT unaware software company in
this case we added two IFM sensors and
we're clicking the most important
requirement today which would be a
temperature temperature was their number
one use case second use case was
collecting pressure off the fermentation
tanks by installing these these critical
sensors they'll have visibility remotely
and on-site digitisation is changing the
way people do business I hope you enjoy
the beer you're drinking and we had a
great time actually installing the
sensors here and getting the software
out
we have a tremendous partnership with
Oracle or helping them with edge
connectivity and integrated with Oracle
IOT cloud service so we're providing
services to help customers connect edge
devices normalize that data and unleash
that data into the Oracle IOT cloud
service
we're here at El Paso brewery we're
doing an integration here with our IOT
asset management and our IOT production
management cloud services with his micro
brewery operations so we're working with
an implementation company called relayer
who is helping us out with installing
different IOT sensors for temperature of
the tent the fermentation tanks getting
the pressure of the fermentation tanks
figuring out the specific gravity of the
beer to get the alcohol content we also
have our IOT cloud service team who's
helping them in the backend which has a
bunch of different quality measures so
you can tell if you're in balance on
temperature with the consistency of the
different variables is during the brew
process variations between different
tanks of beer and we also have our
front-end team the apps lab team helping
out with some different user interface
elements for the folks who are consuming
the beer we have a tablet where you can
rate the different beers you can choose
the beer you're drinking and then rated
and that data gets sent to the Oracle
cloud service and stored and this
information also is a continuous
feedback loop to Kyle who's the owner of
alpha acid brewery so he can both get
information the quality measures of his
beer while he's brewing and he can also
get feedback from the consumers of the
beer on what beers folks like the most
and what the quality of those beers is
