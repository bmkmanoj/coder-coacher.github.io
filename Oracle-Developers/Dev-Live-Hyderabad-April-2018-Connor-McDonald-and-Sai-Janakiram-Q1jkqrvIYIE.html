Connor McDonald here with the Oracle
developer community back for another
interview
I'm here with probably the
hardest-working Oracle professional on
the planet and that's why he's our an
interview because he will do anything to
further the cause of the oral cook
community Saipan Marui welcome along
thanks thanks gonna say I have to warn
you I'm just gonna talk some I'm
absolutely buzzing so your job is to
slow me down at my make sure I don't get
too excited yeah
you obviously the Oracle code events
your legend of the user group community
Oracle code events and gam etc yeah what
have you done at this particular
conference yeah this conference is for
me some new developer champion so my
focus is to pass a message to all the
developers more about what is
micro-services
DevOps how to use this into Oracle - yes
because you know it was very very few
people raised their hands about dev CS
which is actually a free of course so
Deb says being developer cloud service
exactly yeah um so in terms of when I go
to the Oracle cloud site this is
thousands and thousands of cloud
services that just keep coming and
coming and more and more every day
mm-hmm what appeals to you most about
the developer cloud service what's one
of the things don't really grab your
attention on it so developer cloud
service is actually the single platform
and you know I think in my session as I
mentioned right so for a developer what
you need you need a you know a couple of
tools for where you want to code your
you know IDE also you need some build
system you need a testing system you
need where you know to have deploy some
cloud services so Oracle dev serious is
the one single platform where you can
actually do everything and you can just
create a project just like that
in a minutes so I get like source code
control exactly so source code control
and the one of the best thing is they
use all open source tools yeah so my
recommendation is since it's a free for
developers just go and login and you
know I think in this conference you have
a credits so that's the best way to log
in register yourself start using it and
you're only charged during
the deployment process otherwise you are
familiar with all the functionality and
you can actually influence in your
customers or company yeah that's awesome
because the last place I worked at a
customer was you know they wanted to go
confluence yeah and I think we're using
git for and it took months just just to
come after the speed and learn and
what's coming up in India for the rest
of 2000 I think this conference is just
about done
what's coming up for the rest of the
yeah so part of so either present all in
your physics group with my really good
colleagues around we have 35 volunteers
35 volunteers dedicated their sacrifice
their family times and you know what not
and we don't know what for what we are
doing but and it's so we have a couple
of really focused events on lined up for
example next month we are doing the real
world performance with Andrew 19 that's
where you can actually bring you know
any type of performance queries and you
know you can bring your awr reports and
the Anduin team actually can solve that
problems and that's a place where you
need to learn about performance and also
next month and then it was a OTN tour
now we change to OD aussi Katra that's
the place don't say I already say we get
in trouble yeah you see it's a dev see
yatra dot in that's a new website for us
and you know the challenge is you you
see in order to code Hyderabad right so
most of the participants from the local
but our idea is to go to the places
where you know they're unable to attend
you know this type of conferences we
bring the speakers I think you're part
of many OTN tours so we bring the very
special speakers you know go to the for
example we are this year we are going to
Hamad about that's a new place and you
know people are so encouraged about the
users group community so we will bring
the speakers to that particular location
and they can actually network and learn
and share whatnot yeah in terms of
networking just coming back to your
DevOps talk or your dad services talk
one of the things you mentioned was is
that DevOps is more about a cultural
shift yes
just a technical shift I know even from
being on some of these these ot and
tours that there's often a bit of a silo
between DBAs and developers what are
your thoughts on how how do we how do we
fix this how do we make us a much more
just a broader community so I think the
couple of things right so that's what I
was talking you know even my question my
first question was in my session you
know how many developers and how many
BBS my so like 90% of the actually
developers attending my developers but I
was actually look in the opposite
direction so I want to see more DBS out
attending my session so they want to
actually focus on Divo ops micro
services because you know that that
thing technologies is changing every
every year and I think 2018 is actually
more focused on you see like even many
companies are focusing on Oracle sorry
developers and work is also doing Oracle
code events so as a part of community
especially part of users crew so DB has
learned developers topics and developers
and DBAs topic I'm not saying you become
an expert in one day but you should know
what it is I think one of the best
example I was giving like you started
your startup company and you know for
example your DBA I'm a developer the
other person is the operations guy right
so when it comes to any problem you all
three can sit and solve the problem so
it's you're not escaping right so you
should actually have a community-driven
I know the one of the best again at FCS
is you have a collaboration platform
where you can actually chart with many
people and you know that we can start
collaborating aspire so one of the notes
on your slide of it we need to get rid
of the throw it over the fence exactly
so it's called actually I have a picture
blind handoffs like you know we just
throw it and I know most of the time you
created documentation so operations you
never understand what we are talking and
they give feedback to us we don't
understand what it is so you're wasting
time in between handshaking process so
now you you need a one single platform
where you need to collaborate here in
terms of building community is that
brings you back to the user group you've
probably got one of the best user groups
in the world for those places out in the
in around the globe that have small user
groups and they're thinking of ways to
keep energizing their art that their
users work what are your what's your
advice to the smaller user groups
and yeah I think it I don't think it
depends on the number of users I think
it's more of even I always talk to my my
leaders chapter leaders you know even if
you are like 10 people are turning for
this particular session that's
absolutely fine they know the value of
users group how they learn because I
know I we used to get a lot of feedback
you know they change their carriers
because by just returning some of the
sessions and especially I think one of
the court you mentioned somewhere I
forgot you come to this conferences it's
more of not you know gaining the
technology it's more of networking with
people and you cannot get the same
opportunity to tomorrow right so you
cannot maple these people so this is the
best opportunity to with networking so
back to your question I think it does
not matter number of but it's only thing
is focusing on our the bottom line
ultimate is how we are helping users in
terms of their career challengers
technology challenges and Oracle is
always there to help us right so yeah
well you're a developer champion so
we're gonna let some of the community
know we're gonna be five little fast
facts that you have to answer one word
and sake just let them know more about
you so Apple versus Windows Windows
Apple versus Android Android because our
state versus Windows 8 on a plane
sorry I'll seat or window seat on a
plane and board but I'll see they prefer
aisle seat so that you can go anytime
anytime you go to talk to and finally
when it comes to Indian cuisine gulab
jamun or kiri here gulab jamun for me
every time now we've got about 30
seconds left
huh your job is to look straight down
the barrel until the attendees here on
the attendees online okay what's the
most important thing I should do
tomorrow after this conference so I
think it's a and my message is more of
developers I think it's something like
you know it's an opportunity when you
learn new car driving a new car or
something you actually start working out
in gym right so you slowly shape your
muscles or you know learn one by one in
your driving so ultimately after
time you become an expert in driving
especially also same example for
building of your muscles right so one
day you you you really recognize you
know that your body isn't Eilish you
know proper shape right so learn slowly
I think again I'm not doing any
marketing about Oracle I think Oracle is
the best company where we have lot of
opportunities you know they can simply
say that you know we have released
autonomous database and you know you're
done but they provide a lot of plenty of
opportunities in cloud space what
technology is not available to tell me
so you have plenty of opportunities so
go and learn and you have a free you
know I think this is the only company in
terms of lot of conferences and income
in especially users group like UK oh
geez around ma be more than 35 years of
experience right so so their presence is
more than 35 years so Oracle is there
for their supporting us from day one so
I think this is the only company where
you can learn so many things so please
focus on the technologies you sign up
for the cloud account
try again coming to dev CS it's a free
absolutely free explore all the
opportunities when you deploy then only
your charges start so try to promote
your own company for the developer
platform yeah thanks a lot thank you
very much thanks as I said before folks
if you have one an example of passion
and energy into getting the most out of
the Oracle community and the Oracle
products this is the man it's user group
code dev champion you name it the man
always looked after me when I come to
India is a fantastic host so that pretty
much wraps it up for the interviews for
Oracle code in Hyderabad next week we're
in Bangalore so please if you're in
Bangalore or in the nearby areas come
along to Bangalore we'll be doing
interviews again and we have one more
eye even better we have one more
interview to go so it just keeps getting
better and better here we just we just
strive to give you more contact um so
yeah so enjoy the rest of the conference
and we'll see you next week in Bangalore
