dev live here at the Oracle code Israel
in the outskirts of Tel Aviv
I'm your host job at Mohammed and I have
as my guest today Joel Aviv who is a
principal product manager at article Joe
welcome thanks for having me thank you
so I heard you just said we were talking
off camera you just right there
yesterday afternoon I did I did it was a
long flight I have 20 hours to get here
from Seattle Washington but Wow okay and
first time in Israel you back in time in
his second time when I drove back ok
yeah so any thoughts thoughts
impressions
it brought me a little different coming
in second times at first but still well
it's high if it was the last time I was
here still hot that's one takeaway one
constant yeah one God exactly so you had
a presentation earlier delivering the
DevOps tools at scale exact it was a
little some of the highlights of your
presentation we don't go through all the
nitty-gritty weather but at least yeah
some of the key takeaways yeah so
basically the talk is about how if
you're operating services and you you
offer things out to developers the
developer landscape is very very
fragmented so some people use Java
Python Ruby leafless class c-sharp Perl
PHP there's just a huge amount of
languages that are widely used and so
really supporting them is that this
called polyglot all I got exactly yeah
yeah and at supporting them in
supporting a lot of different developer
tools developer environment which is
really hard to do with scale because in
addition to all the languages you have
to support I work on the service I work
on Oracle bare-metal cloud where we have
a collection of services confused
virtual networking block storage object
storage etc a lot of other ones as well
and supporting a variety of developer
tools for a variety of services it's
really a large landscape to support a
large long matrix because it's a large
majors exactly this and our team is
basically six developer
or the talk is about how we actually
scale to support a lot of developer
tools a lot of services and a rapidly
increasing pace of innovation with such
a small team so how do you do that yeah
basically what we do is the main thing
is everything is based around swagger
swagger is our source of truth and what
swagger is is basically a way of
declaring your rest interfaces for your
services um as code in a in a hematite
format that you can take and put in
source control and do source control
discs do code reviews use source control
branching and use continuous deployment
based on those branches to kind of cause
any time a change is made to the swagger
specification of your service cause all
of these various SDK to just get
auto-generated as opposed to manually
written because men we writing them
requires your developers to go and
understand all the interfaces I'm
reading up on you know documentation and
then writing the code manually to
support it and then hoping that code
doesn't have errors in it right so if
you can just take a source of truth and
run it through code that would generate
then you very quickly end up with the
end result the various SDKs and in
different languages without having to
spend all that developer time learning
and building by hand so when I think of
Oracle bare-metal service I guess what
donatus comparison is AWS can you draw
some compare and contrast in terms of
what our article but bare metal service
offers in service sure we're a little
bit earlier on than AWS so we're not
quite as you know quite as many services
there we're focused mostly on the
infrastructure as a service set of
offerings at least on my team other
teams at Oracle have set a little bar
the server that uses all the compute
storage networks right yeah this is the
computer block storage networking object
storage load balancer really that that
base infrastructure layer where we
manage the the physical compute and we
just give you computers to use and you
manage the rest of the stack OS applique
and services and things like that but
what differentiates us from AWS is we
have a really we have a better price to
performance ratio and the reason for
that is we offer unlike other clouds we
offer physical machines as a service so
you can really spin up these super beefy
machines if you want to for your big
data your high performance compute your
enterprise workloads and our team is
mostly comprised of people who used to
work at these other cloud flats
he's cloud platform and kind of they
went through the process of building at
once they realized some mistakes they
made but it was too late in the game to
go and rip out those underlying pieces
so now they're kind of designing the
cloud again and they're able to do some
of these decisions a little better which
results in better price to performance
ratios and better customer experience as
well and if somebody wants to try out
article Babel cloud service can they do
it do that as a part of the trial yes
yes that's part of it and I think people
are at this conference are getting $500
$500 credit exactly which is a lot you
can do a lot with $500 now yes so
anything else pups you maybe you were
able to cover in the presentation or
just because we're reaching a different
audience or so for people who who
perhaps would not be able to make it
right
come here anything else you'd like to
share insist in terms of your
presentation in terms of what or what
article offers in this place yeah well
just swagger it's just one part of
scaling it um there's other parts to it
like we use the open-source community a
lot to help us make changes to our
software as well and we we do a lot
around API consistency which helps our
developer team scale but they're the
biggest thing we do is and the best way
to scale is just to hire more people and
our team is actively hiring so anyone
who's interested in the developer
tooling space yes and it's going to work
on that don't livi contact me
well should email okay Joe dot levy at
Oracle comm you got it over there all
right
um well okay what Joe I really
appreciate you coming down I think it
sounds like a really exciting space and
this is something we kind of I guess
with building our foothold
in the infrastructure space with
services like this yeah we got some
really cool stuff
all right rad well thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
