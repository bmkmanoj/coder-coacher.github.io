than the first two and they're simply to
give you a feel for some of the basic
DBA activities you would normally
undertake when using the the Oracle
cloud first thing we're going to do is
to log into the Oracle cloud console and
select the database service I'm gonna
show you the steps to create a basic
service now if you have already done the
setup for this lab if it was you that
did that
this is going to be a bit of a repeat
because you would have had to have done
this in the setup steps to begin with so
first of all we're logging into the
dashboard we're going to select the
database and then create instance in
this case you just give it a basic
instance names name there's a few rules
around the naming convention but it
advises you what those are in the pop-up
and we're going to select the database
cloud service versus the VM and database
release - you noticed you have standard
edition Enterprise Edition high
performance and extreme performance and
when we move to the next panel there's
some other items that that you should be
aware of that are mandatory and that is
the administration administrator
passwords those are mandatory fields as
well again there are some rules around
what you must put in what you what you
can't put in you notice the compute
shapes I didn't want to draw your
attention because when we scale later
you can make choose a small shape and
then scale up later we do require an SSH
key a public key again we've created and
use that that's part of the setup steps
and we're just going to drop down to
Advanced Settings at this point is to
point out a couple of things that you
might want to consider in a few
that is will this be used as a golden
gate target if so you can enable the
golden gate feature there if you forget
that or don't do that you can add that
later and then we go on to the backup
and recovery options you can optionally
create a cloud storage or specify one
that you already have and at this point
we could to create we want to create the
instance we're going to cancel at this
point we don't want to create yet
another instance I just wanted to go
through that with you now the next step
is creating a security rule we do this
all the time the ports are closed by
default that is most of them port 22 is
always open and we're just going to add
a sample rule called open 15 22 now you
notice 15 21 is not open we've been
using tunneling but if you want to open
it you could and if you want to open
additional ports this is the process to
do that sources the internet the
destination is a database and at this
point the kicks off a process to to
create that role and does take a minute
or two not that long but it does take a
couple of minutes if you want to go back
in you can see the role created but it
doesn't automatically refresh the screen
you have to go out and then back in
again and there you see the new rule or
1522 and it's available now so the next
step we're going to do is scale up an
instance say you've created an incidence
you've started using it then you realize
you need more CPU or a more disk space
or more memory you simply select the
service and select the scale-up option
and you can see here you slept all the
way up to 16 OCP use and 240 gigabytes
of ram for the purposes of simply
showing you how to do this we're just
going to add 24 additional gigs of
stores and we're going to extend the
existing data vial volume rather than
create a new one this takes a little bit
longer than say adding SSH keys it's
going to take probably 10 minutes or so
so I'm going to pause this and come back
you can see that the scale optishot down
a scale up down request is accepted and
goes into service maintenance mode and
once it's finished and you'd see this by
refreshing the screen you notice it's
back in normal operation and then you
simply go back and you can see that the
storage has gone from 150 to 175 and the
last thing we're going to do is add an
SSH key and I'm going to generate a new
key it's called lab 300 you want to add
an additional key generate the key you
could use an existing one of course and
at this point you've created it you're
going to go back into the cloud console
you're going to select that option and
it will add it into the into the the SSH
accepted keys the authorized keys file
on board you don't actually have to do
that manually it's all done
automatically for you through the cloud
console well there it is there we're
going to select it and you'll see it
goes back into service maintenance mode
and this is another one of those
operations it takes no more than about a
minute or two at the most and comes back
and at that stage you should be able to
SSH in and we're just going to show you
that that's this H in there we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
