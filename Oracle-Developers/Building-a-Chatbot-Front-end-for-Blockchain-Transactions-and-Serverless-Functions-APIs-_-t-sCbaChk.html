helps me not trip over these things and
get that set up I thought I'd start off
with just a little experience I had
about what would I say three weeks ago I
was landing in Stockholm it was about
9:00 p.m. in the night it was minus six
degrees Fahrenheit people don't like me
too much so they send me to warm places
and the pilot announces we're landing
pilot announces what freezing fog has
rolled in so we can't see much but we're
gonna try to land and if we can't we'll
try again we have 45 more minutes of
fuel and I'm running okay so what's
gonna happen after that but luckily we
ended up you know making it fine so my
name is Siddhartha guru and I run
product management and strategy across
our past portfolio application
development integration security
management analytics and I was a
developer I started my career at Oracle
back in 94 as a developer I'm very
passionate about developers and being a
developer so I just let me see is this
guy working that's not the clicker okay
the mousepad oh I thought I'd be kind of
disconnected from this laptop but I
guess not to say if however statement
we're gonna share potentially some
futures don't buy purchasing decisions
based on what I say the most of it is
available today so I wanted to start off
with that written an article and
infoworld
about the trends for 2018 for developers
and I think some of these topics are
very clear you know serverless how we go
into production with several s but there
are lots of challenges around each of
these for example when you think about
several s programming now you're doing
distributed programming you have to
think about eventing you have to think
about debugging across you know
functions etc chatbots you know everyone
wants to think about messaging as the
new paradigm of interaction and chat
pots are so easy but behind it you've
got natural language processing
you got artificial intelligence you have
to maintain a state engine so it's it's
it's complex and how do we make that
simple
DevOps I mean DevOps is amazing it's
given us so much productivity agility in
being able to do things fast and
higher quality but guess what today
developers are spending maybe almost 60%
of their time with DevOps and what does
that mean that they're not spending the
rest of their time that with that time
coding and we'd rather be coding lot
more than managing DevOps so how can we
move towards no ops while getting the
benefit of DevOps blockchain very
exciting technology everyone's thinking
about it but what are the use cases and
how do we make it simple to build
blockchain applications because you know
getting the hyper ledger fabric set up
getting the block chains to perform as
hashes get added it's hard and how do
you get that to scale and have security
around it because for very business
centric purposes open source the
innovation and open source is amazing
there are lots of technologies that are
coming up but the thing is to get that
open source stuff up and running takes a
little bit of time whether you take
kubernetes for orchestration where
releases are coming out every six weeks
how do you scale a kubernetes cluster
how do you make it highly available all
of those things are things that
developers have to worry about or Kafka
if you want to do inventing already set
up a Kafka cluster how do you scale the
cluster how you bring it down there's
complexity around open source how do we
make that simple and finally machine
learning you know machine learning is
the hottest thing you know it's it's
what everyone's talking about but how do
we get machine learning embedded into
our applications or how do we benefit
from machine learning without even thing
having to think about it so those are
some of the things that we've been
thinking about at Oracle and you know
the platform that we built out and I'm
not going to talk too much about the
platform but it's to be able to build
and develop and deploy applications very
easily for developers to be able to
integrate those applications because
even if you write a chat part you have
to be able to you have to have it be
able to talk to some back-end so easily
be able to do integrations be able to
publish content be able to secure the
content be able to version the content
be able to analyze and predict there's a
lot of data that's out there but only 1%
of the data is being acted upon how can
we not have you be data scientists yet
be able to get value and insight from
the data and then more importantly be
able to predict what is it what is the
insight that is needed and finally being
able to secure and manage these
applications
I mean security is
top spend item today and so how do we
make sure that the code that we're
writing is secure how do you make sure
the once the code goes in there is
secure how do we make single sign-on
across Facebook messenger etcetera very
simple and then how do we manage these
applications where there's a lot of log
data there's a lot of user performance
data user metrics that we have to pull
together how do you make that really
simple so with that you know no
presentation is complete without a demo
so I'm going to start off with the demo
and I happen to be walking around in the
Oracle parking lot and know that's not
what I do on a regular basis but as I
was going to a CVC Larry Ellison has
this specific spot for those of you who
worked at Oracle of no Oracle there's
one spot and you better not park there
is actually security guard there I
happen to see his Lexus LFA standing out
there so I said hey why not build a BART
to be able to sell his Lexus LFA now if
I actually did that that'd be a problem
that but that's what this scenario is
based on is being able to sell his Lexus
LFA which happens to be slightly
expensive and someone really wanted to
put a cartoon together and so here's a
cartoon to make it easy but we're gonna
this is the what the scenario is going
to be and this is gonna run through the
entire presentation is that there's
gonna be a part that I'm going to use
I'm gonna use that to sell his LFA
that's going to be put onto a blockchain
network using a server less function and
then the blockchain network someone is
going to use it to buy the LFA yeah so
that's the that's the scenario and
here's what the architecture is so I'm
gonna use the chat pod I'm going to show
you how the chat pod is built and that
chat pod is called going to use Kafka
and be able to spin up and function that
function is then going to execute and
put that car onto a dealers network and
then on the other end when someone else
tries to buy the car they're going to be
able to go onto the blockchain network
see the car being available and then be
able to potentially purchase that car
and that's going to use the same set of
technologies on the other side and
through this will show you the chat pod
capabilities blockchain and serverless
functions and I have a lot of help
because you know I'll have other people
come up and
and go through this because I can't do
all of this myself according to them
Oh and here you know I didn't you know
move the car but you can tell the cars
moving I'm not a big fan of builds but
you know there the car moved across okay
so let's go to the bots piece of it so
people are getting very tired of apps
mobile apps I fly a lot and Oracle
doesn't care to put me on the you know
my airline of choice it's whatever is
the cheapest so I have apps with United
Delta Lufthansa Virgin Australia Virgin
Atlantic Virgin America every version of
Virgin airline that is out there so what
I want to check in I have to go in and I
have to check-in into that app but
instead what if I could just friend
facebook Messenger on facebook Messenger
like ALM bar and I say check-in it knows
who I am
it checks me in and it makes it really
easy to bring up the boarding pass put
it in my wallet I didn't have to
download any kind of app I didn't have
to manage the application the upgrade
the lifecycle and even for build people
building bots it becomes really easy
that they don't have to build mobile
apps they just have to build the bots
and Facebook Messenger or whatsapp or
WeChat becomes the platform so people
are trying to move away from these you
know mobile apps to some extent and you
know messaging is becoming B platform of
choice and when people are trying to
build this conversational AI there are a
few challenges that they're experiencing
one is you know I need to integrate the
Alexa Google home whatever are the voice
recognition input mechanism that is I
have to integrate with facebook
Messenger slack whatsapp we chat I have
to integrate with back-end systems I
have to make sure their single sign-on
and security I have to be able to manage
that state engine I have to have
dialogue state I have to manage multi
multiple languages and it takes a lot of
AI expertise to be able to do natural
language processing machine learning
speech etc so those are some of the
challenges and so let me first show you
the bots that we built out so if we can
move over to my iPhone guys and before I
plug it in I'm gonna move off of this
wait where's the iPhone plug then cat
you've created some challenges for me
here I'm kidding I love that simplicity
talk I'm gonna get off this main screen
look at the 126 thousand unread emails
and that always doesn't go across very
well as people wondering what I'm doing
okay here we go can you guys put my
phone up there oh okay hdmi 3c has given
simple instructions that i cannot follow
okay so here's the here's the bar and
have friended John's car dealership
that's the bar John's car dealership I
wake up the BART just by saying hi and
hopefully the BART is going to respond
to me yes welcome Siddharth interested
in buying cars sure no I'm actually
selling a car so let me pick selling a
car okay we offer competitive prices for
clients do you have a license plate okay
let me go to my phone and bring up the
license plate out here here's the
license plate and you can also got to
see some photographs of my family can
you upload recent pictures the car sure
this should blow you guys away here's
the car and that is in the parking lot
of Oracle and here it says wow it's
already picked up the registration
number the VIN numbers that means must
have gone and done some kind of search
against car fax and let me make sure
this is the real car right so let me
just go back and see more details out
here so I've got the registration number
transmission one speed I don't know
about that but you know that must be
some kind of error I don't know how car
just has one speed but you know the LFA
by the way there are only 500 LFA's that
we've been built it's a two-seater so
given our family of four I need to sell
this off so yes this is correct yes here
we go
Oh what is the mileage on the car well
since I only drive on the 280 and I'm
generally driving about 180 miles an
hour I can only do that between 2:00 and
4:00 a.m. so I don't get to drive this
car much so I put in 1100 miles out here
okay okay
Kelly Blue Book price is 375 K well that
was my list price this car is supposed
to appreciate
in value but you know they'll buy for
385 whatever I have enough money I don't
care about 25 30 grand this is okay with
you yes okay so that's the front end of
the body if we can come back to the
presentation and then I'll show you how
the part was built so here in terms of
what we built as the platform that helps
make it very easy for you to be able to
build these boxes we built the
integration into facebook Messenger
Alexa WeChat etcetera so we're actually
getting the the speech to text from the
voice input channels we applying
national language processing on it we're
doing multilingual translations on it
and we're able to then have a dialogue
engine and AI engine on the back end so
all the front end integration and then
being able to engage at Facebook
messenger which is what we were using
today is taken care of for you
there's a lot of AI that has been built
in so you don't have to worry about the
AI weird managing the state we're
managing the context we're being able to
parse out the entities that are part of
the intent that was submitted so that's
all being taken care of by our chat pod
platform I'm using cognitive speech you
know vision language capability so you
can actually do image recognition also
within your bar and then let me show how
this bot was built so Sean did you
refresh the thing here let me just see
here I am going to the browser now in
terms of building the Bart so here we go
let's hope I didn't get logged off so
this is our you know BOTS UI mobile
cloud enterprise is the capability in
there I've got a number of different
BOTS
I'm just going to pick for example the
selling Bart out here and here what you
got is the notion of intense so this is
where we're able to parse what the
person is typing and come back with
intense so for example I can I see some
intense here by car I'm looking for a
car I want to buy a car and if I go in
here and I say you know intent I can
actually test you know what the
confidence level around the intent would
be so if I say buying Lexus for example
and there is no intent called buying
Lexus here in this list it should return
back at 43% confidence so this is just
the experiment
peace inside my application that gives
me the ability to see what it is and
what I can do is I can add this example
right to the the intense if I want and
then I can train the model again we give
you different ways to train the model in
this case machine learning is there it
takes a little bit of time to train the
model each time but that's fine and then
you can also go here and go to the bar
and let's say I'm going to selling the
car and this you'll see later on but if
I say selling car it actually will show
me what kind of responses it will
generate for me so it shows me for
example here this was yeah these are the
cars that are available that you know
could be sold etc now in here we've
created the intense the entities
so once we've understood the intent
we're also parsing through the entities
so we created some system entities in
here like address currency etc but you
could create your own entity like
dealership out here and say you know
name is one of the characteristics that
I want to get for the dealership so that
now you can say whether it's John's
dealership or Bob's dealership based on
whichever dealership it's being worked
on
we've got resource bundles out here so
you can in addition to the natural
language processing and multi-language
capabilities we have you can add in your
own resource bundles we're giving you
the ability to bring in you know custom
hooks so if you wanted optical character
recognition in here you can bring in
your own custom component objects in
here and lastly we have also created the
integration with the channels so here
for example you can see the Facebook
channel so we create a default
integration Facebook you can do that
with other channels like WeChat etc plus
we're giving the ability to do web hooks
so you can bring in anything you want
you could create integration with Siri
there's the integration Aleks and Google
home that's already there so it gives
you some sense of how this you know bot
was built and if I go back to my
presentation here and go back so here
the elements of the you know the the bot
piece one is the channel configurator
that gives you the ability to have
various channels configured both input
and then Facebook messenger so for
example in the
our layout and facebook Messenger it
automatic scare of that you write your
bot once and it's available across
multiple channels the dialog flow
capabilities so we tracking the context
and the state so if you ask for balance
of your checking account we're not
asking you which account you want the
transfer done from for money to be sent
to mom if you just said send $50 to mom
we have a conversational AI engine so
we're able to recognize the intense
parts the intense parts the entities and
then we're making it very easy to
integrate the backend systems so be able
to call integrations in the backend to
applications be it's fast applications
or on-prem operations so with that I
want to bring onstage Sean since I've
done all the hard work he's gonna show
you the easy work of actually having a
function being called that execute are
the portion of this demo thanks Sara yes
I'm all good
great all right so so yes I'm Sean Smith
I'm with product management with the
surplice teemed Oracle and we'll dive
into a little bit of the background what
happens next after the chat pod so you
saw the the front end with the chat bot
and then of course we have some
processing need to do right we have
blocked in the background there's gonna
be some processing in between those two
sides and how do we do that so we need
service functions now before I do that
I'm gonna talk about service a little
bit so the service is a category of
cloud services it's not a thing a
certain a specific thing it's actually a
categories or anything where you're not
managing virtual machines and installing
software and you know setting up
networks is serverless so even you know
gmail as a service sort of experience
right you don't install anything you
just send emails a faz or functions as a
service platform is the compute P source
compute element the use of using server
lists so you can imagine you have a
platform with storage with compute with
networking the compute part would be
surveillance I'm giving you the brief
overview just for time so why would you
use service right well it's cheaper
typically then this is the big thing the
typical tipple experience with service
platforms is you pay when your code is
running so imagine you had a piece of
code that performs some service if you
did traditionally get a VM install
Tomcat spin it up it runs and runs 24/7
you pay all the time right whether it's
being used or not
in a service platform typically you only
pay when your function is being called
right so if no one's calling your code
you're not paying which is a huge key
change now the other thing is in a
service platform using functions you're
writing small pieces of code small units
of code not giant monolithic 10,000 line
programs typically smaller ones and so
the smaller programs are much easier to
build faster the code review to
understand
they'll be simpler right because there's
not a lot of code going on gives you
much much faster iterate fix things
change things try things new things out
of course having your code deployed to a
platform this managed for you means it's
much more reliable right so networking
problems failover problems all handled
by the platform and all of that that's
simplicity that we have in terms of
these small functions gives you more
time to innovate right gives you more
time to to try things out if you're not
spending all your time debugging large
monolithic code code bases give more
time to try things out be more
innovative so it's really nice set
benefits around serving us which brings
us to the FM project and that's the
thing I'm you know we're talking about
here today the FM probably so it's a
it's an open source project it's on
github
it's Apache 2 license so it's you can
use it for anything you'd like to do and
it runs anywhere it runs on your path on
your laptop it runs on the cloud it runs
on your data center whatever you like
you notice I have highlighted the word
simple I really enjoyed the talk earlier
because simplicity is kind of the key
and I'll show you some samples of me
using the using your FM you'll see it's
very simple it's not that we're trying
to be complicated right we're trying to
be simple we're not trying to you know
show how smart we are we're try to make
it as simple as possible for developers
and you'll see that in the in the demos
at the bottom end at the bottom of the
FM platform are containers so functions
are actually deployed as containers
which we see containers as sort of the
the atomic model or the the base of the
building blocks that we build a platform
upon that way we take advantage of the
docker ecosystem that's you know really
taking over we're pretty busy project so
we have you know 2,500 commits over 50
contributors we have people from from
within Oracle outside of Oracle all
taking place on github and we are
involved with some open source standards
so around the container native compute
foundation things like cloud events and
other standards are out functions
because functions is a pretty early
technology in the sense that there's
really a lot of people working on func
but no standards that you can really
rely on today so we're part of that in
the conversation so our model is very
simple okay an F n functions like a
little piece of blue piece of code
wrapped in the container it usually does
one thing and being it does one things
you see pretty small and it gets its
input from standard input it writes the
standard output for the results and it
logs to standard error right this sounds
awfully familiar
right so this is the tried and tested
UNIX model that's been around for
decades right a very simple model and
all the complexity around you know where
the logs go how do I invoke that
function how do i scale this thing to
handle incoming load all that's handled
by the platform right so the goal here
is to give a very lightweight pleasant
user experience and all the complexities
pushed down the platform so your life is
a developer is really much easier
there's a CLI so this was a couple
pieces there's a server piece you can
deploy again on your laptop and the
cloud on your desktop there's a client
to let you create new functions so f
internet lets you create a function FN
run unless you're running on your
desktop do some debugging FN test run
some tests against your function deploy
is push it to the server and then call
is a way to make a call of that your
function and all the functions that are
deployed get a rest or an HTTP endpoint
so you see here we have a route to to a
function I can invoke the function from
that route that's automatically provided
by the platform so enough of the talking
right okay so I'm gonna be a code live
so you know I mean goes crossed right so
I'll try so I have an empty folder here
I put the top of the screen okay that's
good if I say FN in it and I choose a
runtime what program do what do I want
programming programming go here and I'm
gonna call this function hello okay so
we basically got a folder now called
hello and so are we have a very simple
coding by convention model we put
functions and folders and that's the
name of the function so if I create a
function called hello it'll go in and
hello we have a whole bunch of function
as this actually starts to be really
useful so I'll go into hello and you'll
see what we've got here a couple of
files I'll just pop it open and oops I
should try that again here I think to
get code
to open that folder for me all right so
I've got three files here's the funk go
now if you don't know go it's not not
too important but you see here it's a
very small program essentially reads
some JSON off of standard input and it's
like a person right with a name it
constructs a message hello person the
name and then writes that back to
standard output it's a very simple
function that's all there is here I've
got a funky animal file this is just a
metadata file tells us you know when
you're deploying it to go what's the
name of the binary you're gonna invoke
when you run the program and so on and
then we have a nice little test file
here the light says describe expect the
inputs and outputs this is Marin is a
black box type of test it's just for
convenience it doesn't replace of course
your unit tests entirely so if I go back
to my terminal here I can actually type
F and run at this point now you see
you're seeing building image so you know
we're using doctor under the covers
I built a container with that go code
and I run it if I type FN - - verbose
just to show you the all the dirty
details here and I do a run you'll see a
lot of stuff you might be familiar with
if you're a docker user right so we're
building docker files again nothing
magical going on here this is not the
goal to again not to be clever is to
show you that this is what we're doing
is automating the process making it very
easy to deploy functions - - doctor okay
so I talked about standard in post and
output and that function you saw was
taking this input from standard input so
I can actually do something like this
echo I'm not gonna write JSON in the
shell which is like good times let's see
here
so I say echo quote the name of the
person I'm going to talk to I'm going to
pass in here and we'll put in I'll just
put in la oh this is the worst idea ever
is typing JSON here and no pipe that
into F n run like that wrong fish we
prepare program with me if I get that
wrong let me know okay so I basically
sent in this JSON object into my
function it read that that that input it
pulled up the name replied back with
other JSON object right so that's kind
of kind of cool just simple piping now
what I'm gonna do next here is I've got
it running locally that
great I can actually run FN test and
it'll take that JSON test JSON file and
run it against my my code here yep looks
good so I'm passing in some test data
and getting about it what I want so a
nice little developer experience here
for go now I'm going to deploy the code
so FN deploy and they have an FN server
running locally on my machine deploy and
I need an application name so I'm going
to call the app la just to keep it short
and I'm gonna say - - local and that's a
little bit of a trick to improve the
developer experience here now I won't go
into details okay I've deployed that
thing and I can see FN apps list I got a
couple of applications ones called la
ones Oh code so la and I can say FN
routes list la and I can see that I have
a function it's called hello and it's
available at this rest and this HTTP
endpoint so now I can say I can say FN
call my applications hello la and I want
to call the hello function hello alright
calls it I can also do this curl HTTP Oh
what Oh Pete thank you
thank you that's so I want support up
here live coding okay good let's grab
this URL here okay do that and I can
call that right so basic that functions
now running could be in the cloud could
be somewhere buts on a server it's not
my laptop anymore and I'm making that
call the experience we're using FM the
functions deployed in the cloud or
locals is fairly similar I can also of
course do this now I can say Karl - D
and I'm gonna pass in that that code we
passed earlier here where's my little
piece of JSON I do not want to type
again okay past that and I'm gonna go
pass it back to the same function so I
can actually run the same kind of code
and it wasn't supposed to server comes
back right so it's very very very simple
so that's that's that's basically the
command that's the the core of FN very
simple multi-language support there's an
example with go let me jump back over to
here okay so that's great I can build a
single function it's very easy to build
a function package it as a doctor
routine
deployed to my my server and run it but
I want to build I want to compose app
functions together to build applications
and this is where the functions world is
going right now is great we have a whole
bunch of functions but how do I build
apps right how do i structure them
together so we came up with FM flow
which gives us a way to compose together
functions do fork/join deal with
concurrency deal with chaining things
together it's all written currently
supporting Java and so we built on the
Java completion stage API our
completable futures api and java 8 it's
designed for threads but we've adapted
it for dealing with functions because I
have these functions running somewhere
in my cloud right so I it's not just
running local in a local thread or a
local VM I'm running my function
somewhere in the cloud but I want a nice
API that lets me lets me orchestrate
them right now it's Java only we're
adding support for json python other
popular languages let me show it looks
like here after I explain what I'm
trying to do so we have our chat by
example I have a cell a car function my
boss comes to me says oh that's a great
solution except that we have to do a
whole bunch of other stuff too you need
to go off and do background checks used
to make sure that car wasn't involved in
a felony crime you know do some all
kinds of checks for the FBI so I need to
do more than one single thing how to do
multiple functions now right this is
this of why I wouldn't need to
orchestrate so I have a bunch of things
I want to do do the carfax report
criminal lookups FBI checks and so on so
using the the completion stage API I can
actually compose together I can actually
describe how to organize these I want to
invoke my cell car function then I want
to do both Carfax and Colonel checkup
and then I want to do all these other
things too so in a certain sequence and
what we do is we build a flow function
this is the orchestration function this
describes the flow right how this is
these functions are gonna be executed so
let me just show you what it looks like
in code now if you haven't seen that the
completion stage API before it can be it
can be a bit dense I had MIT but the
nice thing is a Java standard API that
you can read books on and learn about
and apply here so here I am I'm getting
the current flow I'm gonna go get cars
goes and gets all the cars in front of
cell or a check on I'm gonna go process
that car and here you see me I'm doing a
then compose I'm invoking a function car
a criminal check criminal check and all
those things are done I then want to go
off and print a message all right so
I've gotten got a number of primitives
here all of then except then compose etc
this is just Java so what's cool but
this is this is a Java program I can
think about I can debug with my
colleagues we can look at this go yeah
that's the right algorithm I'm not
writing some declarative XML to try and
describe some sort of flow this is where
we are today is currently a simple
declarative program all right so let's
just go look at go see what flow looks
like so I'm gonna just change tabs here
and I've already deployed this example
so you see here I've got a bunch of
functions to get cars post as cars and
so on it's all running already now I'm
just gonna open the browser again
because I don't have an interesting
piece here so what I can do is I'm going
to basically run the cell car operation
right so I'm gonna say F M call
it's called okoda is the application you
saw that cut
application before and it's called flow
okay so run that cell when you do that I
have a visualizer here use useful
utility the flow UI that lets me look at
the running off running flows so I built
this application with in Java but of
course that results in actual functions
being called and deployed so here we see
these code this code running we can see
that we've gone off and if I click on a
bubble here I can get some details so
the plates are the two LFA's that I
found here I was going to to deal with
to process I can then go down for each
of the cars remember there's a loop
right for each car please go and process
it for each car then go and do a carfax
and a criminal look up you can see here
that as I click on each one I can see
the full stack of how did I get there
and what's going on in the logs this is
really cool for when things were working
it's really even better when things
aren't working so when things are going
wrong you get red red but bubbles here
click on them get the full stack trace
and sort of debug your flow so it's
really cool development experience ok so
that's that's the quick quick and dirty
of the f-m platform so just a few things
to think about we are building up a
managed service this is open source
today you can go download it if you want
to come to our hands-on lab today later
you can download it and try it out runs
on your on your machine we're going to
the managed service where all the
infrastructures had taken care of you're
not building on your computers you'll
build on server less experience on
Oracle cloud so that's coming later on
this year of course security is job one
right in the cloud so this is we all
integrated with the Oracle security
infrastructure so for reliability and
security and also you saw we had these
rest these endpoints right so HTTP
endpoints will be exposed so it'd be
nice to be able to use the Oracle API
platform to build out your API is design
your API is mock them out be happy with
your solutions and then go and implement
the functions behind the scenes so all
that's gonna be possible so if you want
to try it out yourself FN project do go
there we have links to slack to github
all the stuff that you need to get
involved we love to see you see you
there all right now I'm gonna pass off
to jagdeep who's going to now talk about
the next piece so functions have done
their job validated the car sale we're
now going off and complete the sales
picture with with the with the cell and
the cell operation with watching all
right guys okay thanks Shawn appreciate
the opportunity
so how many guys how many of you have
heard about Bitcoin come on all right
and how many of you guys have traded
bitcoins made some money on one two
three four I hope you guys soared it at
the right time you probably sold it
February 5th for every six made some
money let's pretend I made some money
and I'm here to buy a car using that
money right so that LFA you just saw say
that cell I'm going to buy it let's see
how we do it and I'm going to use
chatbot again they're like two billion
people using chat boards right my
daughter if I want to talk to her 14 15
year old that's the only way I can have
a conversation so I have friended about
let's see if this thing responds all
right so the two options here buying and
selling right he sold a car I'm going to
buy a car awesome
so these are some of the cars that Bob's
dealer the guy the used-car lot right
next to my house has he has a Carol
he has a BMW here the ADI well that's
not what I'm looking for I'm looking for
a Lexus and if I can spell Lexus right
awesome
well he's saying he does not have a
Lexus on his lot but he's part of a
network where there is a Lexus this car
looks beautiful this looks like Larry's
car I've never seen it actually but I
look for some details here $399,900 a
dollar short of $400,000 a lot of dough
hopefully I made that money in that
Bitcoin trade but okay I'm going to say
I'm going to buy this car
so this card now got transferred from
Jones dealer to bath dealership he's
going to bring it in he wants me to
confirm I say yes at this point the car
got transferred and he's asking me when
can I come and do the paperwork I say
and do a test drive I say 2:00 p.m.
tomorrow
so people who clap the loudest after the
session get to ride with me tomorrow at
2 p.m. in Larry's car all right so this
is how we went about doing it so we are
all set for tomorrow
so let's recollect on what really
happened here using a block using the
chat board it got transferred from one
dealer on to the blockchain and then off
it comes to the other dealer and we buy
it to untrusted parties were able to do
a transaction without a middleman that's
where the blockchain comes in right in
the interest of keeping things simple
where do you go for simple definitions
of things I go to Wikipedia so what's
the Wikipedia definition of blockchain
it's a decentralized and distributed
digital ledger used to record
transactions on multiple computers in a
way that you cannot retroactively Li
change a transaction that's what the
definition of blockchain is right from a
Wikipedia
and what does it mean really mean the
how does this business transaction get
done this business transaction is based
on consensus between multiple parties
who do not really necessarily trust each
other based on a predefined business
logic so having no me intermediary in
there that's the key thing right that's
that's where the power of blockchain is
Bitcoin is another implementation of
blockchain right Bitcoin is a way of
doing the same thing anybody can join
that network it's a permissionless model
and it's a shared consensus model in the
real world also these two attributes
that we talked about being decentralized
and collaboration this is how most of
the business is done this is how most of
the goods are exchanged this is how most
of the services are rendered right and
there are a lot of use cases for
blockchain in real world anybody doing
real-time projects at this point on
blocking or everybody thinking about it
as we talk to customers we'd run into a
lot of these use cases right a couple of
key ones that I would like to point out
think of a example like a airplane every
part that goes on that airplane we need
to figure out where did it come from
with it the genuine parts were used
there's a history of that part when was
it serviced it's a perfect use case for
blockchain I am buying a $400,000 car I
want to make sure that every part that
went into that car every repair that was
done was done with genuine parts and I
want a unrepeatable history of the
service done right and that's a perfect
use case for blockchain another big use
case that we see is all these marine
shipping right there's so many parties
involved in that transaction there's a
shipper there's a receiver
there's customs involved all that
paperwork needs to get transferred
that's a perfect use case for blockchain
take simple things like doing background
checks having simple things like having
an identity digital identity everybody
has about 27 different digital
identities at this point how do you get
more control over your identity how do
you have not a single source which gets
leaked
and then I will think of Equifax or
anything like that you have no control
over that blockchain is building systems
to have control over those identities
can blockchain solve world hunger
probably but not every problem this is
the solution how do you figure out which
problem to put this on I have some
simple simple things to rank let's point
simple is simple is the way to go right
if you're thinking of transactions where
there are intermediaries in world which
are causing a lot of cost and lot of
friction that's one use case if you're
looking for something which has a you
want to figure out the audit trail or
the history on the transaction that's
another use case the third use case
probably is where there are a lot of
systems involved and you have to do a
periodic reconciliation or these systems
are across many different departments
many different organizations and somehow
you have to manage them and reconcile
them at a later point that's a perfect
use case for blockchain right those are
some of the key things and when you're
looking from an enterprise perspective
from an enterprise the different there's
a big difference between how Bitcoin
works on blockchain versus how
enterprises work enterprises are looking
for confidentiality of the transactions
they are looking for security they're
looking for scalability not every
transaction needs to be out in the
public what Bob's dealer paid jewels
dealer dealership I don't need to know
he made twenty five thirty thousand
dollars I don't need to know that right
I don't need to know what is he buying
the parts for what has his cost I only
need to know what whether genuine parts
were used or not so there is a need to
break this big channel into small
private channels if you will and I'll
show you how we are doing that from a
service perspective and as it
enterprises there's a there's a lot of
buzz around it but you haven't seen a
lot of use cases around it at this point
what are the reasons there are it's a
challenging stuff right it's not easy to
do this real-time what are the
challenges
every Enterprise has a supply chain
system ie RP system all these new
systems that you put in how do you
integrate them into your existing
systems that's a key thing right on its
own as a silo does not exist these
systems all have to be part of an
ecosystem that integrations are hard
that's one challenge the second
challenge is for enterprise things need
to be enterprise grade right there needs
to be resiliency there needs to be
security all these things need to be
accounted for when you are building a
system and just bringing pieces trying
to stitch something together it doesn't
work for our enterprise also this
platform keeps changing rapidly there's
a technology churn going on right every
time there's a new standard enterprise's
want backward compatibility and two pies
you want to make sure that the
investments they have made or they can
reuse their value going forward how do
you ensure that how do you ensure the
operational challenges who's going to do
the lifecycle management who is going to
do especially in blockchain this becomes
hard because you are going across
organizations you're going even cross
companies if you will who's going to do
the live set back back up Google do
patching all that stuff needs to be
accounted for so introducing the
blockchain service from Oracle what we
have done is we have basically a
preassembled managed service if you will
all that complexity that I was talking
about we have tried to take that out and
provide you with the service which you
can just one click you can provision and
it's off and running for you right at
the it's based on a robust
infrastructure and pass layer and all
the integrations that I was talking
about into your past services are all
taken care of in the the center of it
the blue box that you see it's a
hardened hyper ledger fabric
implementation and the reason we chose
hyper ledger fabric one is we committed
to open source and the reason for our
choice of hyper ledger fabric is one we
find it very modular right there there
are a lot of modules and plug-and-play
becomes easy
it's very permissions based if you will
you can
find private and public channels in it
and it's very scaled scalable if you
were right since it's modular based on
and it's a very programmable there's all
the business logic behind it it can be
implemented in containers so this is the
service that we are using and as we move
forward I would just like to demo this
to you basically go through the scenario
that we just talked about let's see if
the demo gods work with me here so first
let's go and look for that car that just
got transferred okay anybody remember
the license plate awesome so this is not
this is not the right one
I probably fat-fingered it let's let's
okay all right so here's the car on the
right what you see is the API details so
everything that we have done in that
service is exposed as a REST API so that
makes it very easy to integrate into
other systems and if I looked at this is
the transaction history so what I'm
doing right now is this is a custom app
that is built on top of that hyper
ledger and we are reading from that
ledger and seeing what the transactions
are so what you see here is how the car
got transferred from one dealer to
another in front of that other dealer to
my name so let me go back and show you
what the service looks like so this is a
dashboard on top of that high-polish we
have various nodes running and on that
this is the dashboard what you see here
is in the last month how many
transactions were committed how many of
them was successful we can obviously go
change it and stuff I have five
organizations to Pier seven channels
I'll walk you guys through it alright
this is what the this is what the
organization looks like so let me swap
so Detroit Auto is the founder member of
this blockchain network and all these
other dealers are part of it
right there's no central authority but
some the Detroit auto guy is the founder
member all others have joined that
dealership what you see from our
organization problem perspective all
these blue nodes here are the
organization's and all these green dots
are based
the remote computers that we are talking
about this is where the hype the ledger
exists this these nodes are what are
committing and endorsing that
transactions if you will right there is
a there is an ordering node which
basically takes all the blocks orders
them and puts up on the ledger and then
there is a central certificate authority
if you will
moving along these are the that's these
are the nodes running and one particular
node that I wanted to point out is the
rest proxy in ordered everything that we
are doing on the ledger can be done
through REST API and this is the rest
proxy that you are talking to giving you
a visual representation so one key thing
that I wanted to point out so there are
that we talked about the open channel
and having private channels so this is
one channel here which all the dealers
are part of so the ledger
associated with this all the dealers can
read off of right
but if Chad's dealership or any other
Jones dealership wanted to parks who
talks to the Detroit auto he can have a
private conversation so there are
multiple Ledger's going on here on a per
channel there is a ledger everybody on
that channel can read the transactions
but he can also have a private Rancho
transaction going with the with a dealer
here moving along so these are what the
channels look like I'll just pick one
save any particular channel to just show
you what the blocks are being committed
so this is what the blocks committed are
and then we come to the concept of chain
for chain codes are basically smart
contracts these are the ways to deal
with the ledger any query you want to do
any transfer you want to do any updates
you want to do this is what you do it
through the chain code if you will this
is how you you first write chain code
and then you install the chain for this
is just so you come here upload the
chain code file define the piers that
it's getting targeted at once you have
installed it you go and instantiate it
and the key thing I wanted to point out
here is you basically can specify here
how many organizations that you want to
endorse a transaction so in some
particular transactions you want some
some particular person to endorse it or
you need three or four parties to
endorse and transaction before it can
get committed it's all that flexibility
exists at this point and the code for
this the the whole thing this is again
this is written in go basically
everything that you're doing you're
dealing with the transaction here this
is where your vehicle definition is and
if I'm going to transfer the call this
is there's a function definition here
which I'll just use to transfer that
application so moving along let's go
back to the presentation here so this is
in a nutshell what the Oracle service is
right all the pieces that you see on the
left here are basically the building
blocks there's the admin console there's
a membership service all these things
are provided to you and all these are
exposed as REST API s and there's SDK
provided for it as a developer these are
the three key things that you're doing
you're writing the chain code or the
smart contracts if you will this is the
business logic that's get implemented
these are the pink boxes that you see
and then you're building applications on
top of it using the SDK and using the
REST API is after you have done that you
basically go and just configure the
thing and the service is up and running
and you get all the pieces of
integrating it all the operational
pieces are all taken care of
so that's all I had back to cidade to
sum it up thank you
I left my phone up here so I couldn't
take photos and tweet but that was great
jiggly thank you so just to wrap it up
you know this is the architecture that
you seen of the car being transferred oh
I guess I have the deep portion on this
one let me just skip this so I just
wanted to share with you what we've
built from an application development
perspective for developers so one we
have a complete CI CD pipeline you can
bring in your own
for example Jenkins as web hooks into
the pipeline but we're enabling you to
use a browser-based interface to manage
crumbs to have agile issue tracking to
be able to have an entire CI CD pipeline
and it is also container native in that
it understands that when you check in
code into gate it automatically builds
an image if the knows how to register it
to a container registry deploy a
container and manage it on kubernetes
etc we're giving you mobile and chat pod
capabilities which is what we showed so
you have a cloud service that enables
you to build mobile applications get
location-based in-flight insight
analytics based insight and also be able
to build chat parts like the ones that
you saw or making it very easy to build
the chat pods API first development so
everything is mobile first API first so
we're giving you the ability to use
apiary if you go to a period or i/o
where you can actually test and design
api's without needing to implement them
we will actually based on the
documentation that you're writing create
a stub of a real functioning API that
will call from any language so that you
can expose that to developers you want
to use those api's get agreement on the
contract and then actually go to
implementing the API we're providing an
API gateway that can run either in our
public cloud run on Prem or run within a
third-party cloud and we're giving an
entire lifecycle management around those
api's including how to monetize those
api is how they're being used what's the
performance of those api and then
obviously WebLogic if you have a logic
we're giving you the ability to run web
logic as a service in the public cloud
and lastly give you the ability to do
drag-and-drop based application
development to quickly build prototypes
that you can validate with the line of
business folks to say hey you know
does this look like the user interface
or the experience that you want or maybe
even get you know your user community to
come experiment with it and then you can
either have that generate all the code
behind it or then you can write that
code yourself so that's the visual
development platform and these are you
know the set of services that I was
talking about and a few more for example
the event have cloud service is the
Kafka based service that was used so you
have that open source you know that
you're using which is Kafka we're
delivering that as a cloud service so
you don't have to worry about scaling up
the cluster as there are more topics
being created or their message event
storms that are coming through we're
providing you identity as a cloud
service also so integration with single
sign-on you don't have to worry about
that and now working on the AI platform
cloud service where we're giving you the
ability to define your models be able to
train the models and very easily be able
to expose your models as api's running
on NVIDIA P 100 GPUs with flash memory
and with 25 gig Ethernet between various
compute or a computing storage nodes so
giving very high performant platform for
AI and then we don't want you to think
about Oracle as just for Oracle
databases but you know you can
definitely use Oracle database as a
depository which is available as a
service where the operation the patching
the backup the recovery all of that is
taken care of by Oracle we're also
delivering that same experience with
Cassandra for no sequel based workloads
with my sequels of my sequel databases
you have those available as services up
so you can run Mongo on our ayahs and
then integration the ability to easily
integrate various applications just by
doing drag and drop between
Oracle's on Prem applications to non
Oracle SAS applications or from Oracle
SAS applications to other non Oracle SAS
applications and then finally an IOT
platform so you can take device data do
analytics on the streams of data that is
coming in do predictive analytics on the
data and most importantly have devices
be able to create service tickets within
your back-end applications be they SAS
or non Oracle SAS so that's the platform
for you available as developers lots of
momentum you know lots of customers here
3,000 plus apps in the cloud marketplace
of folks are exposing apps in the cloud
marketplace and
now leaders in categories you know as
defined by Gartner Forrester another
analyst and we've created a single you
know site that you can go to for
information that is pertinent to
developers from Oracle which is
developer Oracle comm we're adding more
and more content to it and please always
feel free to give us feedback on what
else you'd like to see also spread the
word around Oracle code this event is
being live-streamed today so folks who
not here can also be watching this it
will be recorded but also at different
cities out here in Europe in Asia
Pacific and in North America and finally
you know we want you to come experience
the Oracle cloud so go to you know
cloud.oracle.com slash try it and you
get free credit and you can use any of
these past services to experiment on our
Oracle cloud so with that I want to say
thank you and we should exciting fun
hands-on event for the rest of the day
today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
