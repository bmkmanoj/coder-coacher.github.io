Oracle as cloud evangelist and today I'm
going to talk to you about
we are micro service with Java EE well
micro service is one of the most
important buzzwords that we have in the
software industry and not surprising
because many big companies many big
projects are using it today so what
about Java is it possible to build micro
service real macro service with Java of
course it is and I'm going to show you
right now it's a simple demo here I'm
showing a lot of cold well I have here
example of a monolith built in with Java
and then I'm gonna show you how to broke
the monolith into micro service so
basically what I'm doing here it's a
simple example playing with player and
ranked like a gaming or so so you have
here an entity that is our player ok you
think about GPA a database and so on so
we have here an entity that is a player
and we have also another entity that is
our player rank another entity that's
related to our player we have here the
relation with the player ok this is will
be important when we are breaking down
into macro service and we also have our
beings that will make the manipulation
of their data with player as we have
done also with JPA so we can save player
and move player find by ID final and we
have the same for a sorry for rank so
you have here another state lisbon that
we also save remove find by ID and find
all and here we bought we build some
some service so ninety point service
rest and point serves for
actually find BIID add new save remove
the same with the same stuff that we've
done with the daystate last service all
right and here we have for our player
rank okay so what I've done here also
for our our mono leaf is wrote several
gene unit tests here so we can try if
those do stuff very working so we can
try it right now and we'll use basically
the same stuff that that we've done
before in this series with JPA
where we created a test for running our
GPA access to database and try out those
methods for JP okay so it's built the
taste the text really successfully so
this is our monolith doing with javi so
how do we now can take those monolith
and break it down tube macro service
because we have here the player and a
player ranked let's split this monofin
to processing through projects into
artifacts so we can have kind of micro
services here so first of all we have
just splitted in true projects basically
have the same same files a key here on
the the on this project on the macro
service player and we have on the
specific case of the player we didn't
have any change at all is except for
there is no rank in the project so if we
have here the the beam is almost the
same the same beam and and if we have
here the service during the point is
also the same didn't change at all
so the project for play didn't change so
much for the rank we had yes some
changes because as I said before there
were the relation between the rank
and the player so what I've done here is
that there is as we don't have player
anymore inside the project and when we
are doing microservice we usually and is
the best practice that each service has
its own database so in this case we are
changing the player relationship forges
player ID so we have changed here for a
long stead of the specifically player
object so we are just storing the player
ID and the database for rank and then
you it will go up to the application
should do the relationship or if you
have some reports to take after that it
will be up to the reports to do that
relationship their logical relationship
because each data each macro service has
to hold its own database okay so that's
why we channel here and that's what
basically the most changes okay so when
you have the the endpoint service didn't
say that much well but just splitting
the the project into two pieces isn't
enough okay that's not enough to have
the real macro service what approach
that we use it here is Xu is called API
gateway okay so we just built a gateway
to deal with those both macro service so
we have here a player gateway that will
hope that this the the the communication
between your client okay okay can be a
mobile client a web client the desktop
client whatever clients do you have it
the Gateway will be inside the middle of
communication between your macro service
in your client so here we have another
endpoint that will build a client a web
client web target and you just pointing
to to your macro service player
and here communicate with the same
endpoint that we have on the player on
the micro-service player the end point
for them so find buy ad find all and
player service for save and for removing
so here we have the possibility to have
all the deception dealing all the the
the any specific activity or management
that you need to to have if from macro
cells you can do in this gateway and we
have also a endpoint gateway for your
your rank in the same the same way that
we've done on the player so we have here
building a client and here doing the
communication with your your endpoint
that is in the macro service the the
good part flow from the gateway is that
you can use it for example if your
Microsoft's change the the place didn't
yes the address or change technology
change Porsche or change anything that
the the contract between the the api's
you can keep your gateways to and touch
it for your client perspective but your
micro source perspective you can change
a lot and without break any relationship
with your clients you can also even
change the technology if you're using
Java and you you're gonna use Python or
gonna use anything you can use the
Gateway to to decrease the the break
that you could cows to reach your
clients so it's very good and it's one
approach okay
but that's what we use here so we get a
monolith in you will break in broken
into projects to macro service and you
created a new service that is our
gateway to communicate between them and
if we have another micro service another
application that we built in our
application we just put it inside of our
gateway and your clutch this access your
gateway and you are very very of
flexible to give another features new
features to your clients okay so as you
saw is quite simple to take your heavy
application they break down into Micro
sirs actually isn't just break down the
whole code you need us actually the
environment you need some service
discovery service registry but for for
coding perspective it's a way to get
started and hope you enjoy it and also I
hope you enjoy the whole series I find
is helpful and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
