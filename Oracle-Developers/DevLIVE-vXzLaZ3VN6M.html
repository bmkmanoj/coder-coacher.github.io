because what we're doing is we're
setting up all the live streams and in
the meantime this is all being you know
recorded so it's bad TV but want to get
it back together all right hey I'm
Lauren Ramsay with the Oracle developer
community and we're here for another
episode of dev life at Oracle OpenWorld
2017 and I'm here with Christopher Jones
and with Anthony to linga and both of
whom are involved with Oracle's drivers
for Python and for nodejs
and for a whole bunch of other stuff so
catches up Christopher what I've been
doing we've been doing a lot of this
open-world to cap off a really great
year we as you say look after data
access api's for the oracle database so
my wider group looks after everything
including JDBC and net and then here in
our little subgroup we'd look after most
of the sea based api's including the
Oracle call interface OC I if that eye
comes out like a English I instead of an
Australian eye for interface and then a
lot of the the scripting languages are
built on top of C's so we have the PHP
drivers for Oracle database nodejs
drivers for our pas database even our
for the our language and of course
Python for our provider base so with me
is Anthony to an Ingo who's really been
key to that because he is the creator
and maintainer and that works for Oracle
of that Python C X underscore Oracle
database interface for a local database
and this year has been really busy
working on infrastructure which is going
to really springboard us into the future
Anthony you want to tell us a little bit
about this o DPI and what that is and
how that works yeah
the OTP I see layer is C layer that
simplifies access to the database OCI is
a very complex API and we try to
simplify it I started initially with the
node Oracle DB driver because there was
a simplification layer in there already
I took that one and then I took the CX
Oracle and I put them together and came
up with ODP I see so and it worked it
worked way doesn't work we can--we can
that be found and who uses it it's on
github
yep and CX Oracle uses it know what
Oracle DB is using it for version fu
yeah and we also have a number of third
parties that are using it go and rust
and Ruby so it's been taken up quite
well yeah geez yeah so it's mine target
was those developers of api's for the
Oracle database and they have really
responded we've had some really positive
comments and emails and as you can see
on github issues
the tracking system they're not issues
just saying that they actually like this
it's made their life easier so much
easier wraps things up for them so
Anthony's been really instrumental in
getting that C wrapper layer out there
it's open source you can use it by the
way for other projects you can just take
that curve stick it into your own
applications and just use that to
connect to the Oracle database if she
wants it yeah but as it is targeted
particularly at the driver writers and I
think that's whatever you have it
so I'm github in the Oracle's you know
github slash Oracle main space which is
administrative by the Oracle developer
community right so what does the Oracle
developer community can you explain how
that differs from OTN for the people who
ever kind of caught up with that over
the past 18 months yep we
mounted a very aggressive program
strategy for connecting with our
developers and this is all up and down
the red stack so it's not just the
database developers which you are
interacting with quite a bit it is all
the way up into the middleware layers
the JavaScript all the way up to the top
the CX type of developers well why do
you explain that to me of course that's
a different CX to this CX so what we've
done is the Oracle technology Network
has got decades of excellent background
about all of the Oracle technologies our
database our products how to use the
products get the best out of that but
when it came to an actual one on one
building the community for developers we
decided to take a move toward you know a
better environment for that so that's
what our program is now kind of
responding to is much more interaction
with our developers excellent thanks I'm
sorry so as a side track I just didn't
want to kind of get that plug Oh tear
has been really instrumental in
supporting all of this database
developer work so way back in the day
when I was really focused dedicatedly
dedicatedly I'm from Australia we don't
speak proper when I was dedicated to
working on PHP and the PHP RCIA
interface for the aqua database there
was a Chan who was sponsoring my travel
around to conferences and things like
that so he's really been pushing up
through the stack yes and that support
and that commitment to participating in
the community will still carry that as a
program area but really right now we're
very focused on just bringing the
developers in yeah and participating
with them you know that community
community's really just amazes me I mean
we've had this year
OTA and as it was now Oracle developer
community recognized the maintainer xand
creators of the Rubio ca8
adapter which OC base calls make sea
based calls but exposed as a ruby ap is
the Ruby users and in a Ruby on Rails
active record framework on top of that
so the main tenders and craters of those
were recognized this year as ITN aces
which you know though I'm just totally
amazed like the amount of work that
those two people put out that's a tacky
hero and Kubo and yes or a honda to give
them their formal names you know they do
those in there pretty much in their
spare time yeah and they're just out
there responding to oracle customer
questions to make horrible technologies
work better for them and yeah Anthony
was the same he did all of that for many
many years outside the Oracle framework
a little bit you know work sponsored
just because work needed some of the
stuff but the rest of it is all
full-time work and I think this year
since the last couple of years since
he's been with Oracle we've really
pushed that out
expanded documentation formalized things
we have moved everything to github you
know that the kind of community is
really solidifying and building how you
the two of you interact in the
open-source communities because you know
working at Oracle you get paid for what
you do yeah that's a privileged help so
so how do you participate in open source
communities well you know sitting back
here smoking a pipe before we came on
and you told us what we were going to
talk about what we were going to talk
about is just sort of interviewing
ourselves about how a date works and the
kinds of problems we face and things
like that so I was going to pretend that
we were doing a normal day routine so
Anthony's like in Canada in his
afternoon evening I've just woken up in
Australia so I'm like we've got the
videoconference on and I was like eating
my breakfast here or going and the
Anthony's had a whole day's worth of
work and then I kind of come along and
make him do like another day's worth of
work he stays up yeah things like that
so that's that's just how we personally
interact where you work pretty closely
together on this but you know how do we
work with the community we work in all
of the normal channels which is you know
social media emails the github issues
list I wish they had a better name for
that but it's your the question forum
and and issues for forget hub projects
PHP has its own internal mail this CX
Oracle has a legacy mail list we still
get questions on
horrible developer Network as forums we
get questions on Stack Overflow all of
these standard developer places a places
where where the users and people who
want to contribute actually communicate
with us and so we do have third-party
contributions into these stacks
obviously aspect but Ruby as being
really tightly outside the Oracle scope
because they're so well looked after but
you know other people come in and they
want to improve the drivers that we
maintain as lead maintain us and so they
make contributions and push forward and
the log bugs and say hey it'd be great
if you can do that and so one of those I
will just speak about wonders for the
sake of speaking about it was that this
new access layer the ODP icy layer which
we're using underneath all of the
drivers you know it's just a stack so
it's another layer of the stack we had
it out it was statically linked or not
statically linked but it was linking at
dynamically loaded at right time yeah so
you would build your stack and it would
look for the Oracle client libraries and
it would need to know where they were
and things like that and you build your
application with like an original 12.2
of the Oracle client libraries and
they'd had to rebuild it if you wanted
to work with 11.2 and anthemic maybe you
can take up a story but somebody came
along and reviewed what we were looking
at
yep and what was the result of that and
how does it does it work now yeah
someone suggested that we look into
dynamic loading of the client libraries
and I did do that and I found that it
worked well yeah so now we can have 11.2
12.1 and 12.2 all running all in the
same time we just have the switch hey
your configuration and you're off and
running
no need to rebuild ya set the CX Oracle
drivers there's no Oracle dbv to
anything which uses that ODP I stack it
just uses this runtime DL open
dynamically looks for the libraries in
your search path and will pick up what's
available and then obviously give you
more features if you've got the latest
versions maybe our whole stack available
but yeah it is a simple thing I mean
just sounded like simple you process I
know you could do that in your sleep but
it's really like at this question of
priorities right you know we have a
thousand million things we can do but
this was one which somebody said hey
this would really help me and you know
can't even can you make it happen
Anthony you know relatively quickly had
made
happen made affordable we test it on a
bunch of platforms and IX and Solaris
down to your mac and windows and things
like that so it's it's all out there so
that's just a little snippet yeah one
example we do we do that sort of
day-to-day as we go through it it's it's
open source so it was continually
reprioritizing you know we don't have
these big long-term schedules we have
goals but then we just you know make
sure we can get to the next stage pretty
quickly but speaking of priorities you
guys have some ideas about what you
wanted what sort of functionality you
want to include next yeah how you want
to build this thing out what are a few
of the next things that you're working
on that you know people should be
looking forward to shopping sharding has
been mostly implemented already in the
Python driver yep so that's actually in
the github master branch
yeah source code so if you want to play
with it you can kind of build it and
play with it yourself but there's no
fineries that you're built yeah that's
right yeah no official that release yet
okay so that's an Oracle database
features you can do a shard databases
you know scale out that kind of thing so
that's available now and then we've got
something coming up which you know we
supposed to speak ground futures yes/no
but at the conference we do and this is
open source so you know if it never
happens it never happens but the in the
Java space there's a technology for
document storage and that's called soda
simple Oracle's document access so
that's actually on github as well so
that's a Java project that is could be
possibly going to come out of then the
future version of the Oracle database
and then we would pick that up in the
OTP I see layer which would be pretty
simple because it'll be in I see I would
just put a little wrapper in our API and
then again we can just then expose that
into the node Oracle TBD end of the CX
Oracle into the PHP PDO and anything
else which wants to pick up that access
method and you know if you want to store
Jason in the database you can do that
right now because we have the JSON data
types but this is still just you know
people like having a document store they
just want to stick blobs in and go with
it use cron operations on it
so that's a future release quote-unquote
the kinds of things that we are looking
at there's good ones yeah yeah examples
okay so what build are you on for the
nodejs well build are we on so no doll
referral DB is on 1.13 at the moment is
the latest and greatest office of the
driver itself that works we've I need
diagrams Laura where's my where's my
whiteboard we have this client-server
model in Oracle database so you can
build no an Oracle DB and run it with
11.2 12.1 12.2 client and then it can
speak to all different database versions
at the backends you can speak to like a
9.2 database at 12.2 database depending
which one you've got this this
client-server interoperability lets us
do that they are full network layer just
automatically does the mapping so that's
where we're up with that we've got a
version 2 out there on github so it's a
developed or two developer released to
that i/o developer release so people can
start playing with that and that's the
one we just built on this ATP I
refactored stack underneath that's
pretty good
Anthony's a little bit ahead of us so he
went from a five this release to a six
yep CX Oracle six was released in August
nice with the ODP icy layer underneath
it good it's the first one that we could
produce with Python wheels which is a
big deal let's plate on wheels those are
a special package format that Python
uses to install packages so prior to
this we had two people had to download
the packages directly yeah and now you
can use the pip the Python package tool
to install is much easier that's very
cool so you've got the binaries now for
Linux as well as Windows and as you say
you just run this standard yeah
infrastructure for installing just
downloads the binaries which we've built
and away you've gone and slightly
slightly off the track of that but
Oracle Linux group in the last week now
have rpms with the sorrowful driver as
well and they'll be pushing out some of
the other drivers the Ruby oh yeah it is
there and they'll get on for the other
drivers when this chaos of this huge
conference around versus says subsided I
don't know that people at
at home they're exactly what's going on
here but this is a tens of thousands of
attendees kind of conference is pretty
big it's a lot of preparation and when
we get home though they'll sort that out
but if you're on Oracle Linux right
young Oracle comm there's a developer
channel for our for Linux six Oracle
Linux seven and you can just say you
know yum install C X underscore Oracle
doesn't work it works with the version
of Python which is native on the Linux
wait an hour for Linux group has the
updated application stacks of Ruby and
Oracle software collections library SCL
yeah and they've also got drivers which
are visions of samsara which are
compatible with those versions as well
so you have kind of multiple packages
out there and we'll just install the one
you want okay so we talked about Python
yeah we talked about endo yep we talked
a little bit about the OCI and all that
yeah so let's talk about our no let's
not talk about our um ours interesting
so I was like a statistical programming
language you have Python are kind of
fighting it out in there in that space
to see what's coming on we have a knob
driver out there called our Oracle the
reason I really don't wanna speak about
that is there is somebody who looks top
of that in a dedicated way it's not me
but we have this you know that's oracle
enterprise stacks which is bigger but
there's a little bit of that which is
the our Oracle driver which is the
interface between the other language in
the Oracle database driver and it has
all of those kinds of features we talked
about it at this stage for performance
reasons I don't know whether it'll ever
go to
ODP I see or it'll just be pure OC I you
know look certainly you have these
advantages of a DPR if it wants to go
that but OTP is a wrapper so you lose a
few percent here or there and people are
pretty sensitive to that in the art
world so we have to wait and see whether
that's going to happen but okay so every
year you have these rankings of the most
popular languages we we its productivity
with the choice you know whatever the
slogan is it's 300% your choice whatever
skills you have in your company stick
with those skills because we have the
drivers for your languages no need to
check we're seeing some interest in
things like that go-go language coming
up so we have to be able to spend some
more time there and notice that
community but though they're pretty
active and really you have
anyways my observation when I read this
year's which is it's written by an
analyst who does not even play a
developer on TV right you know so I from
your point of view what do you think the
top five languages are right now that
are being used just general-purpose its
java.net see python is probably pretty
much on there yeah some of the others
from our numbers are very equal so I
don't really know whether it's us or the
communities out there I was speaking
with a business analyst about this
question today and they are a little
hesitant and think they've started their
own surveys because it will hesitant
about trying to interpret any of those
numbers and they also say that the
download numbers are really not very
indicative anymore of popularity of
languages and things like that because
they're experts in that area Laura no
every if we can see a lot of download
not mosquito is perhaps the exception we
don't have this download numbers but
python is all and yeah BigTable you can
go and query that stuff and we can break
down and see just the numbers yeah it's
all on the websites with PHP and the
Ruby and things like that okay so all
right here's the thing so I am just
barely know how to do a little bit of
HTML I mean and I built my first apex
app about an hour and 15 minutes ago and
I think David peak actually managed that
process very well the lights did not
flicker everything was fine if I mean
I'm coming out of absolutely nowhere
what language should I learn first - huh
Python is it that easy is it declarative
it is am I allowed to say stop my code
and it will stop it's like closed yeah
closed
okay it's a simple language to learn
it's being taught in universities and so
forth as a first language for that
reason with Python with your phone
what could I build with Python Oh
everything yeah yeah big apps we have
the very big customers using it you know
what DBAs might use it for a little data
pump or a little control language wheel
without the Oracle databases just drop
the Oracle bit in if I need to connect
but Laurent be asking leading questions
because really is something that users
you know where their skill sets are you
know we just you shouldn't if you've got
the skill set in one area do not try and
do something my great general
development experience away from that
area seriously it's I think it's but I
do think it's really relevant I mean
because more and more line of business
developers they're coming in you know
these are the people that did not even
date a computer scientist yeah and so
you just go with the market it's if
you're if you're a learning program you
don't know anything about it it might be
a scripting language so you choose
something you have a web base you might
go with a PHP something simple Python is
gonna be more general-purpose a Python
driver for the Oracle database and I use
the word driver and this is kind of
something I'm confused about it's all
Oracle term but if I use API for using
the face you know it's I mean the same
things but I don't know what the current
best practice is as people just accept
it as part of Python and I'm a lost
track of where I'm going with that but
yeah I've lost it Laurie if you phase me
at my practice I correct myself like for
most right so I follow your blog each
and every way
and I'm reading your documentation quite
a bit out there on the Python good so
what else where else would you like to
point our our audience to get a hold of
the drivers the documentation to join in
with you it's github good help yeah
that's a no-no Oracle DB c XR / Laurel
on github that can contact us easily you
know my emails out there on Twitter and
things like that so feel free you can
call us anytime I think isn't like it
guys but then you know how to do that
anyway but if you want to build an
application to stop with Python or
something like that well you could come
along to our lab tomorrow morning we're
running a lab up at the Hilton said oh
yeah okay I only have a Mac lab but if
the computers are all supplied
everything set up we can give you those
scripts yeah I mean I will say one thing
about that is we've run these labs I can
you haven't run it for a few years you
know absent flow you do something new
whatever this year is the first year
we've got that waiting list for the labs
but kind of pretty happy about that ya
know that's really cool congratulations
right on all right well it's been real
it's been fun thank you Laura
