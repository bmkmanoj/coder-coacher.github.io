has changed the world and a lot of new
technologies have come along light
containers in order to help developers
be more productive now we want to make
it easy and convenient for developers to
use Java with containers and so to that
end I'm very pleased to say that we will
soon be distributing the Oracle JDK we
talker there are lots and lots of
features in 9 you may think that 9 is
all about jigsaw and modular ization
well no there are actually many many
more features than that here's the
complete list 885 some are big some are
small some are related to each other
some are standalone some are some are
really teeny but extremely valuable
jigsaw to find a standard module system
for the platform apply it to the
platform itself with a number of really
important properties we're trying to
achieve one is that it be approachable
something that everybody can use to
write large applications and large
systems so that you can escape from
classpath hell after all these years
proposed design gives you two key values
from from modules one is reliable
configuration because a module names the
other modules upon which it depends and
the other is strong encapsulation
because a module specifies in its in its
self description exactly which packages
it exports and which ones it does not so
it's a fundamental new kind of program
component why you're deeply into the
Java Virtual Machine and understood in
the programming language it's not a
library or a framework that just kind of
built on top of Java what should you
expect from Java EE over the next couple
of years and what's the theme for java
ee next so the team is right here it's
the new app dev style for cloud and
micro services we are embracing reactive
programming model so it will be
introduced throughout the platform and
we are extending the benefits of
Portability and standards to this new
paradigm of how you write applications
and we have a broad community support
around it
