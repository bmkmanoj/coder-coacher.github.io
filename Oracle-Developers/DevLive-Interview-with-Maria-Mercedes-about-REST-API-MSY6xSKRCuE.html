world 2017 I'm your host Javed Mohammed
and I have as my guest today Maria
Mercedes Alvarez yes Marie yeah so we
met last in Sydney oh yes
so it's a great meeting back on the
other side of the Pacific oh yeah
so you based in Guatemala how was how
was your flight over what was really
good it fast this year I just made 10
hours flying only 10 hours only 10 hours
yes and which city do you come from I
need to make a scale in Mexico City
Mexico and then Mexico San Francisco
nice ok so last time we spoke I don't
you mentioned actually just off camera
that you had given two presentations one
on Sunday one yesterday what were they
about well what a few more on Sunday I
have two talks and I spoke with Hillary
Kuna now go Hamamoto from the JCP about
how juju can a state involvement in the
JCP process and what can I lack tivities
you can do we'll do jokes and in the
afternoon I have a technical session
that was the same one that I have at
Oracle code in Sydney these development
services with play framework and at a
level security using JSON web tokens
yesterday in Monday morning I have a
workshop in the hacker garden about JSON
web tokens okay yes so I don't know too
much about Jason and some of those
things let's talk about I guess the rest
restful api is okay yeah give us a
little the high-level overview of what
you spoke to okay well restful services
is a architecture signing for transport
information between a client and a
server side and it is base ed in the
HTTP protocols
so you can make the only Neeta a nori
and can consume it like apos get or
something then the interesting part is
that is really a strongest related with
Jason's Jason is a standard protocol for
a exchange information between your
client and your server side so but it's
whoa JSON web tokens is a few different
is based on JSON but as for make
authorization process the idea to a stop
to use a session or cookies in a web
client is a stopping and we're starting
to use JSON web token for me that
process so when you try to make a
logging web server so you sent your
username and your password so but what
happened after you made a login how make
it the server-side that have managed all
the information that is do that one that
is asking for information so in the past
we saves on information in our cookies
or in our say session in this client
side say this is not precisely more
secure this is not understand that
anyone is making everything so they
create JSON web tokens so when you make
them JSON web tokens WebSocket web
tokens talking's yes you know when you
have a back ok as usually they say you
know we will add an extra security and
you will need to end your username your
password and then a token is like a
specialty so you make the login and your
server inside returns you a token a JSON
web token and in every request that you
made you will send that as an
authorization key and the server side
with verified if you are the right
person or not and the interesting thing
is that every token is sign it with an
especial key so this key only the server
side has that key so if someone modified
that jacent the information is a JSON
web token or something the server side
will know that someone modified it or
that is an invalid JSON web token that
sounds very exciting so I definitely get
the
that it requires it provides a lot more
security exactly um
doesn't it also require a lot more
bandwidth and / or overhead to transfer
all this additional tokens and
information no no no no okay
so from an article perspective what's
kind of the important thing for for the
people who maybe not had the chance to
visit your presentation what is it they
should know about what you present it
okay why don't know how can additionally
importance come right well this is
something that is starting to be use it
have kept a few years make then but
right now is that we are having more in
taking more importance in make secure
apps because we have a many developers
or people that develop products that
doesn't take care about the security
aspects so it is important that we start
to take care about those ones so people
want to get more information about this
where should they go well well we are at
zero technologies have a website that is
JWT dot a I oh okay yes but if you can
share that with me I'll post it when I
post it oh yes yes yes and we have the
red this is a website when you can in
there they put your tokens on validate
they see if there are validated you can
see a set of libraries from any
programming language if you want to use
JSON web tokens and we have guides of
JSON web tokens from zero they explained
you every things and we have two a
handbook that is for free when people
can read about JSON web tokens another
JSON web technologies because the screen
exists JSON web encryption for example
if you want send encrypted information
so yes people can see in the alpha zero
website about information Oh Maria this
sounds very exciting and I hope you know
the viewers out there will get a chance
to actually learn kind of more about
this and then check your presentations
out also so thank you so much for coming
down
just as a kind of oh by the way I was
trying to look up your background I
googled you Maria Mercedes Alvarez and I
thought I'd just see one person but it
sounds like you have a very pot I
thought was is that you have a very
popular name oh really
so there are a lot of impersonators out
there so all the security you're
providing is gonna be very useful okay
buddy yeah thank you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
