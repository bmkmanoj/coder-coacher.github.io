logo so it says Oracle cloud application
that is the ACC s service and the data
is stored into a my sequel cloud service
and so the combination of all these
Oracle cloud services then allowed me to
create a mobile application which you
can actually see in the Oracle OpenWorld
application if you go to the info booth
and from there you can go to the
internet brewed beer application or we
were serving the same application just a
different view of the data at the actual
kegerator there was a screen on the
kegerators where people could see it and
so effectively they would see what you
kind of what you see here which is a
beer those are the four beers that we
were serving and if they would click on
a beer that would get to a rating page
where they could just rate the beer and
then we would store that information
again in the that's being stored right
now the my sequel class serves and yes
we have about 2700 people 2,700 ratings
and considering that you know not
everybody rated to beer I think was was
a great success
so yeah that's kind of it cool thanks
mark so I mean a lot of work went into
this project hopefully you guys got to
taste some of the output of it at the
conference here and we're looking
forward to continuing the relationship
with Kyle and then working to help him
improve his beer and also to continue
evolving our integration with micro
breweries so big thanks to all of our
iot-cloud brewery folks thank you guys
all right so next I want to talk a
little bit about our autonomous robot
I'm going to turn it over to Raymond to
explain how we did an integration with
our intelligent bot service Raymond
thank you so different provided this
robot for us that we can work on the
base autonomously and I hope you have
had a chance to interact with the robot
during a conference and I had some fun
and so the behavior
normally you just approach a robot you
ask some question and about this
different conference environment and
that Robo actually can provide some
answer to you if you have child that so
holidays a worker that we have been in
work on chat for a while which is
connecting many of Oracle back-end
service like HCM many of our cloud
service that provide intelligent on the
various things that are accompanying us
so now when we provide this robot
harassing we're saying this is their
approval opportunity right we can
provide a kind of a face to the chapel
that that's like a really you kind of
interact with something that give you
can personalize the information and
that's what we made this project for in
terms of technology wise is the robot
which when you integrate interact
actually observes your emotion actually
into your what are you talking about and
that chatter in to interpret and then we
have we directed that information goes
to Oracle MCS back-end and then we have
like a process crowd that provides ok
where this saints go should be directing
to then that at your core a core group
coordinate all the different answer come
back then we kind of interpret together
then push back to and the dance through
the robot through the pepper gonna speed
back to you the since you're asking for
so the technology used the unit demo if
you have played we have using the
integer bot that's on the MCS and also
the application container cloud service
that we we run all our back-end and we
have the apiary a purse like a different
direction and so that's a pretty much
later and we hope you had a opportunity
to play with it
thank you
okay thank you okay so the next project
we want to show you is the CNC light
sculpture so this this involved a bunch
of us Michael Hoffer was doing a lot of
the algorithms I'm gonna let him talk to
the project we also had help from
Vladimir Konstantinov he did a bunch of
the backend implementation and he did
some of the job effects client UI and
this was based on code from Alexander
Kuznetsov so Alexander helped us build
the CNC demo for last year's Java one
and we leveraged some of that code base
for the calibration of the cutters and
the basic framework of the application
so so come up here Michael so I'll
describe the basic workflow you take
your photo with our residents with our
German artist so we invited an artist
from Germany Wolff house'll then you
etch your portrait I'm one of the cnc
cutters which is hooked up to a
Raspberry Pi so the photo got sent to
the Oracle cloud along with g-code
instructions for cutting on the CNC
router and then we contributed to a
large sculpture a collaborative
sculpture which Miriah who is an artist
who specializes in hearing sculptures
composed at the on the show floor and
it's going to be unveiling at the
community keynote tomorrow you want to
go ahead Michael yep yeah this was
really a fun project I loved working on
it because it involved technology and
art as well in a similar way I saw the
CNC cutter is kind of the opposite of a
3d printer so and it was fun that we
actually featured both concepts so you
actually have a raw material for example
a metal block or in our case acrylic and
then you you mill out the object that
you want or you just engrave into it or
cut it whatever you you want to create
and probably you have seen the machines
there they made a lot of noise and they
actually had to process a lot of phases
and the way that worked is I created a
decimal application that does capture
HDMI signals from a camera and then does
edge detection on that and tries to
figure out where the face is actually on
a green screen so we had a lot of help
of the green screen for figuring out
where the hair is for example like like
an operation you were doing Photoshop
and then the edge detection try to
capture like the the most important more
cific significant parts of your face and
the interesting thing here was that like
this was something that the artist like
wolf could actually manipulate so he
could give his input to the algorithm
and that influenced the actual outcome
on the CNC cutter and then you could
publish that to the Oracle cloud
application that flat road and you could
also add your Twitter handle and we
would tweet something like you were here
at that demo and send you the picture
and the same REST API could be used to
retrieve the images so attendees could I
search for the name on the machine and
then cut out their face and watch that
on the CNC colors so here is the desktop
application so you see you can type in
your name you see the original image
taken from the camera and then the edge
detection on the right hand side and
also the cutout path that would actually
cut out your face afterwards and we just
have some parameters to tweak the
algorithms and for the edge detection
here you see the Raspberry Pi user
interface that Steven was also involved
in and he extended the application from
last year so it's just another feature
in that demo so you here you type in
your name search for your name and then
approve that the Machine cuts out your
face and this is what it looks like so
here you see the engraving of the eyes
the nose mouth and so on and then it
the frame yeah and this is one of the
attendees quite happy to donate his face
to the light sculpture yeah and this is
the final sculpture in the end okay and
you don't get the lead come on
so Michael also designed a special
geometry for our 3d builder playground
which I'll let him describe so what you
see here looks like a lot of fun so that
was a table attendees have built so
what's the story here
we try to figure out a way to create
larger pieces with 3d printers and one
nice way to do that was like design a
Lego for furniture and for that I used a
Java a library called che CSG that I
developed first as a part-time project
at work um and we printed the geometries
that we generated with a library on an
Ultimaker and attendees could then
create furniture and other sculptures
like hats and other things artworks
themselves um so for that we used IDE
that I developed as my main job at the
University of Frankfurt
it's called mere else to do it's a
visual programming environment and very
good for rapid prototyping and we also
use it also for teaching programming and
yeah perform experiments with it it has
several interesting features the most
important one is visual reflection it
can actually visualize any java object I
won't go into details of the other
features but this feature enabled us to
just use the JCCC library API in a
visual way and introspect like all the
intermediate results
and it helped really well with designing
the parts like algorithmically so
everything you see there the parts are
designed completely programmatically in
Java code so 3d printing is the opposite
of the CNC machines so instead of just
removing material we add material in
layers and in our case it's a plastic
filament just a plastic wire that we
heat up in a nozzle and then we lay down
layer by layer and after a couple of
layers you see an object emerging and
the advantage there is that you can
actually also create hollow structures
inside objects or you can decide I want
just an infill of 80% that is something
that's impossible with milling machines
because if you use a block of metal and
you want to create a cylinder yeah that
that's going to be a solid object so
here are the basic building blocks so
the main idea was to cut a square in
half and just use one half at an angle
of 15 degrees and a connector to build
almost any kind of object so let me yeah
just briefly yeah we have the bigger one
here so you see the square on the right
hand side and you see you could also
attach them the other way around and
this is for approximating curvatures so
that's really nice way to give people a
way to design complex structures with
just two types of geometries so let me
go back to that slide so yeah attendees
built these just at the the playground
area while we were printing new parts so
it just in case they broke or just I
mean more is better and the viewer
Studio IDE we also showed a demo that
actually runs in the cloud just like
half an hour ago in my session we demoed
that and as I mentioned earlier we used
the JCCC library also at the booth and
demo
to people how the algorithms actually
work and they could yeah unleash their
creativity with these parts and build
stuff like this table which was my
favorite actually so this was really a
fun project and yeah I like doing it and
also thanks to Steven for being my
factory he produced almost all the parts
so in Frankfurt I just did the sketches
I made the design and printed some
prototypes and then Steven and I chatted
and he said yeah well I have a garage
and like six printers and let's just
print like a hundred of those and he did
that so that so thanks yes that was a
lot of fun so I'm gonna talk about a
couple of projects one from Nikhil which
was our lego controlled robots so this
was cool because the robots were powered
by using Java we had raspberry PI's
which were attached to them and they
were interacting with Twitter where you
could give simple commands to make them
go left right forward backwards and
shoot a little you know a little little
little you know safe dots out to make
bells ring make-a-wish MacColl it like
symbols ring so we had our Lego
Mindstorms hooked up using the raspberry
PI's it would then send commands listen
for commands over Twitter and we had six
tags for each the robot so Java robot
one through six a series of different
commands you could send them left right
forward reverse sounds Gong which shoots
out full ball and hashtags for all of
these so this was a lot of fun we had
people going to sessions and issuing
commands from the session room when they
were bored with speakers so we actually
had to keep an eye on the robust to make
sure they didn't run away because some
people are having fun sending 20 forward
commands in a row but I think it was a
lot of fun and it was a nice social
experiment to get folks interacting with
our robots also I'm going to talk about
the bullet time video ring project
this was a collaborative effort with
Jasper Potts
Richard bear Serge blaze and Kieran
valenki and myself and what we did is we
created a large scale replica of the
Matrix movie bullet time effect using
raspberry PI's and our Oracle cloud
technology so let me show you a short
movie about that the idea for this demos
we got inspired by one of our favorite
cult films the original matrix film and
in the scene
Keanu Reeves dodges the bullet with this
this amazing the behind the scenes shows
that it was this amazing rig they did
with DSLR cameras and green screens and
a whole cool setup to grab images from
40 different cameras around the actor so
the way we were building this both on
video ring demonstration is we have some
custom parts so it's used a standard
Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera
to capture the footage but we designed
this to fit on the lighting truck so
it's really easy to mount and then we
have beam sensors attached so they can
tell what order the cameras in what are
communicating the videos and all these
parts they were 3d printed so we did the
designs and the 3d printed the parts and
the simple tone and it's a it's a cool
project for integrating cloud
technologies which are going to do all
the processing of the back end images
with physical devices things but you
didn't even if doing
touch so we're gonna have six TVs on a
lighting ring take each taking one photo
in rapid succession and creating a cool
slow-motion multi-angle video footage
which can be shared on social media so
hopefully you guys get to see some of
the output video from our matrix for a
full time video ring and you know share
and enjoy okay so this is the structure
we created we augmented it with some
Ethernet cables because we had some
networking issues with the original
design even the industrial wired
wireless network that we were trying to
use wasn't fast enough so we ended up
wiring it with Ethernet it was on the
second floor for the week it worked
wonderfully
Monday afternoon Jasper had a small
incident where he hurt himself but rich
helps me get it up and running today so
it was up and running today and we got
some cool footage with Duke doing some
selfies with folks and we're
transporting it to the keynote hall
right now actually Alon was helping with
that and was gonna be used for the
community keynote tomorrow so this was a
lot of fun to create the project a lot
of work to assemble 60 of these so we
had the hall Oracle developer community
team get together and actually hand
assemble all these different cameras do
a little bit of soldering a lot of wire
twisting to assemble everything you what
you get is you get a five second clip on
Twitter where you can actually see this
in action now I'm going to go slightly
off script here and we're gonna see if
we can't get the Twitter feed up so you
can actually see some of these videos
live oh there's there's Paul terror
okay so this is the Oh deaf community
feed so both the the earlier demo we
talked about with the light sculpture
you can see some of the photos people
took and then also you can see the
different videos which were produced out
of the ring and it's a lot of fun you
can do different poses some of these
were the word I think these are all the
ones we did on Monday
Jasper implemented or Richard
implemented a new feature you can see
it's a little bit shaky so we
implemented digital photo stabilization
for the demo and put that in production
today and so the photos which we took
today actually take advantage of that so
you'll see that the community no
tomorrow were they're much more stable
because we're realigning both the
rotation and the position of the photos
to get them all to match up perfectly
then we send the data to the Oracle
cloud we're using the event hub cloud
service Apache Kafka we're using
integration cloud service for some of
the Twitter integration and then Oracle
jet for the user interface and then it
sends the the video to Twitter and then
tweets your handle so then you can
retweet it for your attendees so this is
what the UI looks like where you enter
your Twitter handle and then it pulls
back your Twitter information here's the
countdown timer you get it gives you
five seconds to get in position and then
the camera is take a matrix style
360-degree photo of you and here's the
communications pipeline with the
different components I was talking about
so we're using the event hub cloud
service we're using on the on the local
side we're using some nodejs
to do server communication reusing some
Java libraries for image transformation
so we have a whole bunch of different
technologies integrated into this
pipeline so
I want to turn it over to our last
presentation about the voting machines
so Teemo Teemo and mark come on
I'm marked together with me timo we are
from canoe can you I think among other
people is the creator of the voting
machine and these are the machines that
you see at the doors when you are when
you are when you want to vote and you
can you can give you vote if whether the
talk was good or not and again we're
gonna talk a little bit about the voting
machines so yes we want to talked about
the idea the hardware and software the
idea was more or less a challenge
accepted between Hendrik and Steven so
Henry complained about way you attendees
can give feedback to to the talks and
Joe won and Steve said if you can make
it better than you make it better then
we accepted this challenge and together
we implemented this voting machines
right for the room our goals was there
to have independent boxes all of the
installer check stop Java stick sorry
of course the cool UI in a cool-looking
case
yeah here see here you see the hardware
we were using in order to assemble the
boxes the machines we are using
raspberry PI's as well as just a regular
monitor and a lot of cables as well so
it's also attached with Ethernet and the
case itself so on the left hand side you
see the design the first design and on
the middle that was like like a first
draft with the with a stand in the
middle it looked very nice but it was
not stable enough and I think the costs
the shipping cost as well over a little
bit too too high and so we came up with
version on the right hand side with the
white the white case yeah that's all
custom made so that everything fits in
nicely yeah that's I think that's yeah
yeah on the front end so on the machines
itself we we use the glue on
JavaFX embedded because of the arm build
does not contain a has not contained the
JavaFX libraries we have had to search
for the proper monitor which touch
support and the biggest part here was
the animations because animations are
all made in genetics with a bunch of
single single pictures which is animated
life in in 60 firm in 60 frames with in
with some raspberry pi so this was the
hardest part on the on the Raspberry Pi
on the back end we use in normal spring
boot application with rest api's in the
Oracle cloud
and for us the biggest challenge was the
time zones that voting machines show the
right sessions to the right time in the
right country yeah thanks ok so thank
you guys we have about five minutes left
in the session so I want to open it up
for any questions you guys have for us
about the different projects which we
created so let's just go through them
quickly so do we have anybody who has a
question about the beer iot-cloud brewed
beer okay please
Kyle yeah
yeah okay that's a good question so the
the question I'll repeat it for the
recording because you're not miked so
the question was like you know rich
mentioned the Kyle gets a little bit of
peace of mind knowing the temperatures
right knowing that his his brewery is
behaving correctly when he's not there
monitoring it and I'll paraphrase can
you turn the mics on in the front Steve
for us in case these guys want to answer
so you know Kyle one of the most
important things for beer brewing is
keeping really good hygiene and really
good quality control over the brew and
when you're doing fermentation you have
to keep the temperature in a very close
band so that you're encouraging the you
know aging of the beer in a way which
will make it both tasty and safe for
consumption and so Kyle has to keep very
close track of what's happening as
fermentation tanks how the beer is
reacting whether pressure is building up
whether other problems which are
happening and when they're there they
have sensors which they can look at to
indicate there's a problem but they
can't be there 24/7 to monitor it you
want to add anything to that rich and
the mics are in front of you are alive
one of the things that Kyle said was
that you know if he makes a mistake and
it ends up being a mistake that
customers like in terms of the flavor
he has a base where he can look back and
look at the history and see well what
did I do with that batch and so he has
intelligence he didn't have before and
of course a lot of manual data
collection in the past
so he's pretty excited about about
having additional capabilities of
monitoring
yeah so Marc's favorite beer there is
the the final final it's a very it's a
very strong beer how strong is it mark
talk to the mic mark so one of the
tricks with that beer is they they dry
hop it they give a lot of attention to
the beer because it's a difficult beer
to make because the high alcohol
concentration so this would be a good
test to our IOT instrumentation to see
if he can reliably produce the final
final more than once a year
currently he only does it once a year
because it's such a hard beer to make
okay so good question just in the
interest of time we can probably take
only one or two more questions so I'll
run through the projects and just raise
your hand if something interesting pops
up in your mind so we had the cloud
chopped up robot which Raymond and team
worked on oh please
okay so the question is did pepper need
to know exact phrases come up here and
you know what phrases did pepper
understands parrot natively understand
certain language a certain composition
but mostly it's a Stewart program but
because we who could upload with our
like an intelligible back-end that
actually provide more capability than
native just the report itself because a
back-end that we cannot make it a speech
recognition much better so so the on the
grunt demo you do like I have a set of
things we kind of let okay enable the
papac and what type of thing can do so
you do leave me to a certain set of
things that you asked to but as we move
around adding more capability or then
you make speech like you can make a lot
of asking various question that's
possible yeah yeah good question Thank
You Raymond okay and let's take one more
question but we also had the the CNC
cutter which Michael and a bunch of us
worked on the light sculpture which was
created from that the 3d builder
playground which took over my garage do
I have to be the factory next year is
Michael I'm a very I'm a very
inexpensive factory I'm surprised you
had to ask
we're actually sorry if the market
prices for plastic goes up okay so
please okay excellent question so this
will be our last question how long did
it take to print all of the material
which we constructed so we we started
using larger nozzles to increase
production so most 3d printers use point
four millimeter nozzles we upgraded to
0.8 millimeter nozzles to keep a
consistent level of quality while while
also tripling the flow rate with point
eight millimeter nozzles you can
theoretically get four times as much
with you know the same precision and I
set up a a set of material which would
take a whole roll of filaments with
printing six pieces and it took about 36
hours to do that one roll so six
printers doing six pieces over each
about two days and you can get an idea
like this was many weeks of printing to
get the volume we were using here but
with more lead time which now that we
have the design we can you know produce
these when the printers are idle when
they're not used at events I think we
can actually build and create some
really impressive massive 3d printed and
handcrafted structures so I'm looking
forward to what sort of creative things
the attendees at Future Java and Oracle
code conferences can do with the 3d
printed creations alright so I want to
thank everyone for attending this
session it's really great you guys came
out to hear a little bit about what we
were doing and I'm gonna remind you
about the voting machines outside you
have you have lots of presenters you can
vote for so thank you guys very much and
I hope you've been enjoying the JavaOne
conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
