welcome to article called Berlin the
first session here after lunch
I'm your host Javed muhammad and I have
as my guest today johannes under steam
and I'm sorry I didn't get the
pronunciation quite right with a
developer at the mesosphere so your
harness welcome and I know you just got
off a train from Hamburg yeah so how was
the weather out there a little bit rainy
so but not really typical ceramic
particle farm worked quite nice got it
okay so you have a presentation later on
about container orchestration using a
run Apache mess house and I was just
wondering if you could just step back a
little bit and tell us what is the
problem I think most people kind of
understand darker and containers what is
container orchestration what problem is
that trying to solve so and in the past
years we migrated our traditional way of
shipping software from bare metal
installation to kind of container
orchestrate a container delivery and we
should containers to make it easy to
share container share applications
within our your data center and now it's
at the point where you want to dynamic
dynamically start and scale your
applications with an overall your data
center and that's the point where you
need some mechanism like orchestration
to ensure that your application is
always running okay and if it fails
won't contain a field that is restarted
automatically again or even worse a
whole note fail running several
containers fail and then some kind of
tool need to make sure that these
containers running or previously ran on
this phase node should be scheduled
somewhere else so that the overall data
center and overall purpose to solve this
application is running okay even in the
face so if is not what you think
but basically you can't deploy all of
these containers and delete
orchestration basically helps you kind
of dynamically manage them is that kind
of the things I'll be talking about yes
okay all right
all right so what's your presentation
going to be about so we're in showing
the story about Elif and as I said about
what happened a fictive character Alice
and Alice as a big fan of Chuck Norris
and she wants to develop application
serving Chuck Norris jokes and she
wanted to run it locally then run it
locally in Dhaka and then scale it
really out and ECS scaling to 20 or 50
instances of a java service and doing
your balancing doing upgrades on the fly
having failures and then afterwards are
doing big data on your Chuck Norris data
so connecting your traditional sequel
database to MapReduce to spark cluster
and then doing analysis on that kind of
jokes okay all right and what I know we
we don't at all and I know we don't you
don't want to give away too much from
your presentation but what certainly for
some of the people who are not able to
attend yeah we hope at least the ones
who I hear will but at least for the
people worried about what the message
would you like to impart to them I want
to show how easy it is to integrate such
kind of big cloud container frameworks
to your developer workflow and on the
other hand how easy it is to operate
your container microservice
infrastructure or traditional service
infrastructure whatever you do running
together with your Big Data and from
state applications on the same on the
same data on the sender so sharing
resources
maybe you memory in this between all
parts of the application so in case
you're the spark cluster needs more
resources in the night and your java
services don't need that resources in
the night because all your users are
sleeping you can just scale your java
services down give the resources free
and use it for your MapReduce jobs so
it's a way of reallocating resources yes
dynamically allocating resources are
based on demand okay there's kubernetes
tie tie into this somehow yes kubernetes
this kind of container orchestrate like
an orchestration framework and Apache
missus or DC
a little bit more so these are first
container orchestration we call this
narrow phone which is our kind of
interpretation of problem but
additionally we offer this kind of
integration to other frameworks like
data frameworks big data fast data so
all that kind of new technologies cough
goes for Cassandra and all that kind of
application and share your resources
share your notes between all these
frameworks like as a containers and big
data and parse data and if you want to
you and you don't like marathon which is
not great because I work a marathon
you could also swap that out and use
kubernetes instead the whole container
operations okay great so more or less so
we broke it in the last version the
Kuban is currently not 100% compatible
two missiles but we're trying really
hard to gather support back okay well it
sounds like an exciting presentation I
know you have to get get ready for that
one but really appreciate you coming
down and sharing with us so check it out
it's at what times up three four five
plus three five past three three oh five
yeah
Berlin Standard Time yes okay okay well
thank you your highness for coming down
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
