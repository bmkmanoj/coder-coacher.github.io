and so I will try to keep the session
you know as as interactive as as I can
so feel free to to interrupt me you know
if you have if you have any question so
a little bit about me so I'm I'm at work
or managing the the engineering team
that is responsible for delivering the
GDK previously you know I came from Sun
Microsystems so been working for a
number of years on the java technology
say fireball which means that you know
please don't make any purchase decisions
on this presentation because things may
change so what I thought that we'll do
today it is to kind of give you a sense
on you know where where Java is moving
you know the fact that we are trying to
make java has as open and more open than
it has been in the past
can a touch little bit on what we
announced at JavaOne last year which is
a new new release cannons and yoli's
model for for java and then kind of look
at at 10:00 as coming in March 11 in
September and bit beyond in term of what
the team and the open JDK
ecosystem is working on so first you
know you know from from my hand
Java is the number one runtime in the
cloud the speed if you go all around
from you know certainly Oracle Amazon
Google and then also on Microsoft Azure
you will see more and more
Java so that's kind of putting you know
the the platform and then Java is really
two things one is the the runtime which
is a java virtual machine and as you
guys know this virtual machine is being
targeted by multiple languages and then
of course the the java language you know
as I mentioned you know Java is is
developed in the open on open JDK that's
what is a place where all the
innovations all the development is being
done we have seen you know tremendous
growth in the open JDK community in
terms of people you know coming and
helping us advance and and maintain the
the java technology bunch of new project
in am not a list in all of them I will
go you know later in the in the
presentations you know talking on some
of those project but you know you you
have a very vibrant you know communities
that is working on Java
you see if I can did it work yes so
that's basically is a
OpenJDK project you will find you know
certainly know the source
I want the mercurial repo you know
dedicate and so you can basically track
a rich and said you know going that the
team is making you know on the open JDK
project so it's it's truly you know
development and as an open source
project you will find in a number of of
project that are you know that are there
so we know a lot of interest you know
looking at you know you can get gdk9
project that basically contain you know
all the content on the new features the
feature set you know that is defined for
the platform is being defined and
discussed in open JDK mailing list so
you have the abilities to go and then
listen even if you on that you know you
know contributing you can at least you
know observed you know what's happening
and get a sense of you know where where
we are moving the platform of course you
know dedicate n project and then even
Janicki eleven okay we are providing
early early access build so that's a
place where you know if you have a
developer I already encourage you you
know to go and you know download you
know early versions or the access
version sort of ten
of course ten is coming in Marshville
you know you have now in a build that we
call GA candidates meaning that they are
pretty much you know assuming we don't
find in a significant regression then
this build will 45 in a media build but
at the same time you know getting
feedback from from people like you is
very important to us in case there is
regressions and we slap in a little bit
of time to be able to fix those issues
so you know certainly you know in term
of mango back here you know one of the
thing that that is very important for us
is to kind of you know advanced Java
into places that we believe it's it's
matter for for developers you know
clearly you know we understand that you
know Java if you compare Java with newer
languages or even you know languages
like JavaScript there is always is
complaining around here you have to
write a lot of Buddha played kirtan on
Java and so clearly you know that's
something you know we are trying to make
progress in over the past in a couple of
years we have had in a number of
projects that are trying to reduce the
velocity of Java also working very hard
around you know using less memory you
know we understand that this is very
important in the cloud
why because typically customers pay on
you know on memory usage memory search
is sometime you know the main factors
that is constraining you know how you
can run your workload in what you are
paying for so it's important for us to
continue to make progress around you
know making Java footprint you know as
close as possible then not even time to
slow which in fact you know it's not
true in many cases but still in your
performance will matter and you know we
have and we need to continue to track
new hardware new order innovations to
make sure that the platform is as as
performant as you can predictability at
scale I understand people in a complain
all the time around garbage collections
carry something that you know we need to
continue to make progress to make those
predictability predictable past time one
predictable pastime sorry be less an
issue and then you know this notion
around cloud first you know we really
want to have you know people that are
building the new generations of cloud
services is a micro services more
significant services micro services
large scale services to start with Java
and the JVM technology
so you know in term of you investment
that we are making on the platform I
know clearly security is our number one
priority has been there is no no
platform is platform is not secure and
at the scale of Java on Java deployment
and JVM deployment it's incredibly
important for us that you know we spend
all the necessary resources to ensure
that the platform is secure and and I
can tell you there's been interim of
priority city will always come first
it's mean even if we have new features
we may in fact you know slowdown
features you furniture that this new
features is completely secure
productivity as I mentioned in a bunch
of project Hamburg Panama Illume you
know ember is all around reducing the
Baroque record that panama is you know
ensuring that you have the most
efficient way to manipulate data between
the JVM and the operating system which
is very important for a lot of big data
your workload and then loom is kind of
going forward in terms of lightweights
rates when in the Java terminology we
called in fibre you know be able to run
million of threads on a single JVM in
writing continuations you know
asynchronous notifications you know
within the the threading model java
density it's all around you know taking
all the internal data structure that are
being used by the JVM make them as dense
as possible ensuring that object
representations or you know as small as
we can you know on inside the physical
memory of the system and so that's kind
of you know the conversion so the grain
you know the grain unifications of
object and data you know something that
is going to be very important you know
for for the platform moving forward and
then also it's around making sure that
we can take full advantage of new
hardware capabilities so we can get you
the most OP team
performance startup you know something
that has been plugging Java for for many
years it's something in the world of
micro services is very important and so
we have a number of project such as he
ot aware of time computations kind of
you know convergence the convergence of
static and dynamic computations as well
as class data sharing so you can have
more hot data structure of the VM live
you know before you forking a new new VM
instance predictability as a result of
excitement around you know in a couple
of project in open JDK with zgc as well
as Shenandoah I think as an area where
I'm very excited with the level of
innovations and that we can finally
crack down or make it you know less
visible to application developers what
the garbage collections is doing and
then you know not not least important he
is
serviceability you know if you look at
you know two days you know many cloud
deployments involve hundred of thousand
of VM instances so how do you manage at
scale all those VM so it's important
that we provide you the necessary data
telemetry data from the JVM so you can
understand in a potential bottleneck
potential performance issues at your
application so you workload is running
so so nine that we delivered kind of you
know every everybody has some main theme
you know so nine was all around you know
taking this very complex platform and
you know removing it into a modular
modular platform that is a sample from a
bunch of different modules as well as
kind of you know moving the environment
to make it much easier for people to
upgrade moving forward to new ADIZ of
java so nine was you know big radius
three years and a half you know for four
years five years in the making
a lot of features more than 100 feet
released in all of them here and so you
can go to a pond GDK to get the list of
all those features but the main the main
features was project jigsaw which is you
know introducing for one's a true module
system into the platform and as I was
mentioning this module system is being
used by the platform itself to motorize
itself as well as exposing a module
system to to developers and that's kind
of you know enable us to do this drawing
and encapsulation Sisk which is what we
believe something is going to be even
more important moving forward for
library developers as well as you know
people that are producing libraries that
are being used by user Java developers
another reason the module system is very
important is because it's providing very
strong encapsulation that is being
enforced by the GBM and that's you know
very important because as you are
building applications now you know we
have a new TL the new tool so is a
gelling tool this tool basically lets
you find the circular or transitive
dependency of which module your
application is using and then packaging
a runtime that only contain the module
that your application is using why it is
important because one for footprint so
you don't carry a bunch of stuff that
you don't use that you don't need and
then also from a security standpoint you
don't have to package components that
potentially you know may have more
security concern for example Kaba
clearly you know you don't you don't you
solution is not using copper but you
know as part of today or in the past
we've JDK 8 you know you add Cobra as
part of the runtime now with 9 you can
use dealing to kind of extract and
remove all the modules that your
applications is not using
in nine we introduced a static compiler
which is kind of the you know the grunt
unifications of static and dynamic
computations why it is important because
it's giving it as a choice
static computations will give you very
fast startup because everything is that
it compiled you don't have to go through
dynamical generations but limited
performance because you can do all
perfect inlining perfect cut generations
if you don't know because that's you
know a lot of pretty movie you know
depending on what your application is
doing of course dynamic computation is
what we have in our G the G you know in
notes but we can do you know screw
profiling at runtime fully understand
the right and the perfect in lining and
generate the most optimized that your
application need so it's kind of these
balance that now we are providing to
developers and say that hey initially
you may care about startup so we're
going to give you the ability to
generate some code that will perform
very well quickly on startup and then
over time we can you know and
uncompelled discard or reuse profiling
to generate the most optimized code so
for once
kind of sudden is going to be you know
some work over the next you know a few
years but we expect in a few years to
kind of give you the perfect wall well
you will not have to make this choice or
on static computation because with
dynamic computations but let the entire
VM manage this process you know that
will enable you to start very quickly
and at the end get the optimum perform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
