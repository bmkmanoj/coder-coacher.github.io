letters thank you okay so this is us
this is you have CTO of joy frog clown
little bit sad clown but it is mom yeah
and this is me I'm borrow jboro can any
possible social network including ones
and shouldn't be on but that's okay
that's another matter developer advocate
at j frog and we are the guys who is
going to deliver the groovy pastors
today we both work at j frog j-rock is a
heavily invested in groovy in we have a
whole product or written in most of it
in grails we have another product with a
a lot of group interaction we love the
language and specially will have the
corner cases and the puzzles in it and
that's the reason we are here today well
we stand on the shoulders of giants who
knows what this refers to yeah guys
that's that's the Java puzzlers right
that's the original the one and only
Java puzzlers with of course meal
Gartner and just block the first
occurrence of Java puzzlers the first
show of gel puzzles was actually in
Oracle in oracle world in 2001 back then
they don't do it together anymore a josh
do it a little bit in google events but
it's kind of it was a big deal in java
one up until 2019 well the thing is who
knows on which shoulders they stand yeah
go ahead right they called the car show
the what the what was leakin clock that
the topic browser thank you very much
those are the guys starting back in 1977
and i think
run and kill today right still on yeah
so they still going yeah yeah so you
know it's it's a thing let's talk about
rules yeah okay yeah okay good direction
ah ok so we're supposed to be too
entertaining guys on stage full dormist
with funny puzzling questions and you
have to think about the questions give
us the answers and vote for it and then
we see whether you're right or whether
and release participate it won't be as
fun if you want make mistakes if you
answer correctly we're going to throw a
t-shirt for the best answer if not we're
going to authorial fog we have an
official Twitter handler so if you want
to tweet or if you want to send the spaz
those will show you at the end were to
send them to rule number one you cannot
cheat okay so no internet no java
console no goofy console know anything
that can help you know dancer nope
so 3 is it you is it you you cannot
count on that all right oh love puzzles
are two and checked and valid for groovy
237 okay okay are we good yeah let's
read so okay so outside and here is a
puzzle for you you have a who knows
Grich conference too great very nice
groovy conference in Madrid in Spain and
we actually named the part where after
of this conference because it is that
good so here is a good for you take a
look and let me tell me what anything
about it it's quite where we start very
easy right it's not that complicated so
if I think groovy did the right thing
and I think they did they probably when
I print a new class a new instance of a
class without yeah yeah okay so here we
go this is option number a this is B 2
string of an object might not compile at
all or will it print the property okay
so my guess is d I think if you have a
class with properties it's going to
print the properties if you didn't
implement the two-string photo the
instance let's see how guys learn the
rules so now you vote who think it will
print a okay one smart guy one bold and
brave guy thank you dear who thinks it's
going to be pretty big alright couple
hands good good thank you what about see
it one compile because maybe you cannot
iterate over object right and quiz 4d
with you have yeah yeah people trust you
I like it I like it let's see if you're
right well it's not it will okay so not
exactly what I thought yeah tell me why
yeah of course so the best the best way
to understand householder rocks is look
at the
code so this is the source code of
groovy and this is the method s
collection that is used when something
need to be converted to collection in
order to iterate through it and this is
what it does so if it's not one of all
those it will just create a list with a
single value of our object and then
iterate through it get the single value
print it those the tostring got it okay
let me ask you something then yeah
that's a good one for me me and vodka
sounds like garage good really good yeah
good with vodka yeah but it's still
vodka still valid they don't okay we
have minus 3 and an absolute method on
minus 3 yeah that one is for me because
it's simple short and easy okay Larry
that so the question will it print three
so you do- Lee absolute gives you three
let make sense will it be no such method
because there is no absolute method on a
number I'm not sure it's not the tool
that's going to steal print- Lee oh it's
going to fail to execute the script and
not compile so yeah let's that's a
tricky one because anything except of a
doesn't make any sense so you know what
it's strange to assume that a is the
correct answer but let's try it I would
say a is the correct okay so you think a
who thinks like vows who thinks it's a
okay yeah some trust are hearing a lot
of people thank you you should not trust
us by the way you will own as we go
forward no such method oh okay couple of
guys mine asleep okay quite a few guys
and script will not even run yeah it's
groovy everything runs yeah
okay so let's see no mom's no way why
what happened okay so let me give you a
we should fall some cheese shells by the
way okay so this is the groovy concert
it's a great way to see what the actual
syntax is going to be when we type some
calling movie and if we look at it we
see that without parentheses there is an
operator precedence and the minus 3
basically the day owner- is done last
again nice i like how you use the groovy
console to say we're doing a minus on
the app's method of three so it gives us
back manually and the way to solve it
it's simple just add parentheses yeah
all just avoid putting everything on the
same line just use the value in order to
not in order to not confuse the compiler
oh oh no have confuse yourself with the
result you know what I actually tried it
no I typed it in my IntelliJ exactly
that what she's supposed to fix it and
actually get no output at all hmm so you
know what you should do right yeah I'll
try to print it let's try to print it
okay so let's try to print it so what
this what will this give you okay let's
see so print line minus 3 the fixed
version of minus 3 yeah with an absolute
on it yep let's see so will it print
minus 3 again like we didn't fix a level
yeah will it print three like we expect
it to do because we collected it
remember will it print three and then
for a nullpointerexception or will it
print- tree and throw in our pointer
exception so who thinks it's a I we
fixed it shouldn't be a okay how about
be yeah I go for be with that will fixed
it right
guys were fixed it should work okay what
about see free and our pointer exception
okay and minus 3 and not pointer
exception all right guys let's see good
job guys good job good job you know
grooving well done okay so I'm not sure
I understand how that happened so let me
tell you so first if you think that you
can delete all parentheses and expect
the compiler to figure out what you want
you're totally wrong isn't it groovy
about that like left band of horses yes
sometimes but not in this case so if
you're doing that you're doing minus 3
and absolute again what happens is going
to if you look at the exception here
yeah you will see that you're trying to
print line minus three which returns
another object and then you're trying to
call absolute on this null object so
this is most of you got it right so that
makes sense well that makes sense yeah
let's go and like McCarthy said every
problem can be solved with another set
of parentheses now it is I'm a lot so
again that's one way to solve it just
enforce the right although we just throw
in more parentheses and it will sell
everything out most of the buzzards can
be solved by add more plants as you will
see that i'm not kidding all you like in
the previous example just break down the
execution to two different lines and the
compiler is going to understand you
better parentheses is by far more fun
that's for sure oh alright okay so ken
was this was one of the many passwords
is sent as I can and we will talk about
it in the end how can contribute and get
a nice picture of your face java one
stage I'm going to throw a t-shirt to
this part of the audience because I saw
some good hands from them with the right
answer good good so if you didn't answer
correctly don't cheat okay and don't
take this tissue not for you
okay here's one for you let's talk about
primitives so here is my code hmm what
you define an X to be an int which is a
type and then you print the type and
then you check whether x equals long
with which is a binary assignment is I
don't understand yeah okay okay let's
let it out let's see the answers and it
won compile how about that I think I
think yeah it will print what it should
print print int here long here in
boolean here I don't think it will
compile or maybe out to boxing magic it
will print the rapper object of that
maybe it will just print it ain't
because those will be false and won't be
printed no there does not chance it will
compile a thing what they say one
compile guys what do you say who thinks
is one compile I remind you this is
groovy everything compiles who think it
will compile all right who thinks it
will print as those were evaluated to
true all right couple of hands who
thinks it will do the boxing stuff Cup
events I loved it yeah it's kind of nice
and who thinks that those are false and
only X will be printed yeah I think we
have like twenty five percent for each
and every time I like it well of course
it won't compile guys look at that it's
a piss-up I don't know what so I told
you you should have more trust in us
yeah you're not listening okay that was
easy right there is no chance at compile
yeah now let's see why I explain to me
one okay so further all this is ok into
the type I just print it and it prints
int that's fine right that's for sure is
not okay because this is not a boolean
expression no matter what
you have only think about that so what
you did here is just set another set of
parentheses I told you it fixes
everything will it fit will it fix this
one my question is one only one set of
parentheses oh I start small I only 111
yeah I think I think it's a good
direction of course it will fix it of
course definitely now the interesting
thing is why and the answer is the
groovy truth so you know you all know
about the groovy troops right everyone
else about guru truth the thing is
groovy tries to make a boolean out of
more or less everything so in the
previous example there was no way it is
a boolean and that's the way it didn't
compile here it might be boolean already
because once we wrap this binary
expression with the boolean expression
by ending parenthesis grew those kicks
in and tries to do its thing and then
turns out that this expression is
actually true right so as we said adding
another pair of partners this always do
the trick yeah another short in that
direction if you answered correctly it's
yours good all right okay so let me ask
you back a question hit me ok whodunit
that's the wrong yes for lefties
okay so we have a method whodunit that
returns the closure and inside inside
this method we have a closure that
returns the butler did it okay and I'm
asking you and you guys if i print lined
the output from this method from
executing this method what's going to be
printed out n NP this strange-looking
result a startup error which means no it
wouldn't even compile or it will print
what we expect it to print the butler
did it so notice you tries to disguise
the correct answer and said this
strange-looking string it's nothing
strange about it that's the two string
of the closure and this what will happen
because this is what you return you
return the closure you print it this is
the two string of the closure i vote for
be ok you got will be who votes for way
now bond except nobody who votes will be
ok thank you guys you get i love because
you're wrong you're very naive ok who
votes for see it won't compile not too
many who votes for be the butler did it
let's see no it wouldn't even compile
and the question is why this is very sad
so let me having the wrong is this code
guys just to say wait for a second for a
t-shirt wait for a second it's too late
but still now you're sharp you have been
for three puzzles now and now who thinks
they know why it won't compile any ideas
cedric you are not allowed to answer
yeah
not our parenthesis that deserve that
deserves the floor froggy that's
definitely froggy answer good all right
okay you are let's see and like me okay
so what's happening here is the compiler
is unsure whether this code of block is
an anonymous closure or whether it's
just a standalone code block okay and
you just to remind you what we had see
so it can be an animal squad block it
can be a not standard on code block it
can be an anonymous closure so to have
the compiler in order to fix it we just
have to add an arrow yeah it's almost as
good as parentheses but this time it's
an arrow so yeah that will do it we all
right and we have this was another
contribution by David and he forgot his
t-shirt for that all right now this is
for you okay so we're going to talk
about public property all right this is
the code and here we have indeed shiny
new trades from groovy 2.3 and the
puzzle comes with them so this is all
public should be very simple all right
so we have a trade with the public
property we have some class which
implements this straight and now we have
a new object my question is I'm going to
give you four options of how to get the
value of this property ok so here we go
first public property dot at property ok
and these to refer to the field and not
two together method what do you do you
I'm just drawing answers to fill up the
four options ok
you told me that parenthesis will solve
it you never talked about underscores
how about addressing the methods just
going to get property which is you know
generated getter etcetera etcetera or
maybe in all the nice way of get
property I think it's the last one looks
the most straightforward thing to me
let's see how your credibility is
thinking the up who thinks its an a all
right hold no one all right I'll work
for a four things it's be yeah okay who
thinks is see okay people you have to
vote so everyone would not resist them
now they vote for do you write who
thinks it's d now you have to raise your
hands good for you okay you still trust
me again and that was a mistake again ok
so it's what why why okay so now anyone
knows anyone knows why but luckily has
two questions okay go ahead okay first
what is this double underscore name and
second how the hell am I supposed to
know about the syntax so the answer was
the first one is very simple you
shouldn't touch public property in
Russia and in traits okay and the answer
for the second one is you just need to
read the docs so traits is one of the
limited number of features which is very
well documented in groovy documentation
its own mooing the new documentation
platform that and its new thats the
reason have very good documentation so
it includes a warning whoa what traits
support public fields they are not
recommended to use and consider the best
practice so the guys name Lydia a name
is Rick did it is most to prevent you
for touching public property but if you
still in C
this is how we do it with double
underscore right that's the way okay
okay out of range yeah who remembers all
right because hit me with ranges okay so
you have a range of 1.0 until 10.0 and
we're doing an assertion where the range
contains 5.0 which may or may not fail
and then we're printing the result of
range contains 5.6 yeah sounds trivial
to me let's see what what you guys think
so assertion fails failed no it doesn't
contain 5.0 false 02 yeah o and P and P
you know that's the classic filler of
missing can't answer when we don't have
option and P is going to 0 yep you
Chanel yeah that's another option will
all see more as we go so what do you
guys think who thinks it's a okay I
assertion failure doesn't cut it okay
who thinks it's been your frog yeah
gobbler hands for beer who thinks it's a
I actually think that this range does
contain painful tricks si si sorry we
all things it's deep which for Dean upon
the exception yeah okay whatever let's
see so it's fun why it shouldn't be
false let me explain to you what okay so
if we wait a second when it's like let's
first draw a t-shirt who knows why go
ahead why it's with step one that's a
t-shirt a lunch I said that's at issue a
maybe a small one will be better
there we go good answer I love it go
ahead let's write the code okay let's go
so first let's let's do it and let's see
whether your item so let's look at the
class of this range so if we define this
range and then we print the class name
we see that it's an object range yeah
and then what we did in both methods
methods we asked for the contains method
let's see how that's implemented so when
it does it contains it basically
iterates on every element in the range
and it's doing a comparable on it and if
we do it yeah well yeah well it was
written a long time ago people who
worked it out no longer with us so if
we're doing the iteration and we print
each element we see that it does exactly
what you said it prints whole numbers
all doubles 1 to 10 and finally to fix
it you can use the contains within
bounds method of a range which will
check whether their values between two
discrete elements in the range now I
have to say that I have a problem with
this approach and that's because words
have meaning contains means that it
should be in there and five or six is
between one and ten so contains is if
you ask me should return true yeah but
you assume that code has to be logical
yes and that's very easy to do in this
way all you need to do well I don't care
if its object range or whatever range
call it trill continuous whatever and in
this case just delegate to contain
through the amount of the convent's
method keep the iteration as you like
just make the work contains mean what it
should mean by the dictionary ok so I
don't agree with you and it lends the
GUI developers does
don't agree with you either so you're
out of luck because if you can read it
it says won't fix but police van in the
right and the right novato it it's too
late what date is it whoa it's 2000 in
it okay yeah it's too late for voting
still like you still a kid yeah
it's a collection of discrete elements
right yeah you see
okay Dirk thank you very much thank you
and that's a t-shirt for sure let's see
if I can hit you with the t-shirt from
here small hey yeah it is have a big one
right was even close no it's not me
actually the fred was very good in that
we discovered he's quite a quarterback
let me try it again yeah you will be you
will do the next one okay and that's
going to be fit by Scott which has a
blog about it yeah and that's because it
cannot go buy anything else there are
only there is indigenous number number
of hits between 0 and 1 so doesn't know
that the range was for one point zero to
ten so just unlimited number of hits in
between you cannot enter 8 on every
possible value it was it was just to
mark that it's not an integer but double
it's not really indicating procedure ya
know but it's a good question why the
jumps are in 1.0 oh you have to read the
code and add parentheses also works but
you do actually you just guessing yeah
okay I love the Rangers give me one more
mo one more inch boo you one more inch
for me I'm ready now you won't trick me
with that one okay ready we have zero
all the way to nine and then we're doing
an iteration with each and print every
element minus one okay so what do you
think we'll get will we get a minus 1 go
up to eight yeah okay or will we get
will we get zero up to nine it will we
get an array of zero up to nine but
without one will we get an array of
minus one up to eight what do you think
yeah okay so there is a print lender
which means it should go down a line
during iterator so it should be a or b
because this print if it was print that
made sense but for print LAN scissor
should be a or b and i'm going for
should be tricky so i'll go for be okay
because a is the correct answer
obviously i'll go for be okay losing
today let's see who thinks thank you
yeah i love how tricky it was actually
very cannot double vote remember so
everyone with a no no we don't have that
much progress you get a frog yeah okay
how about be be yeah be who thinks it's
me be okay yeah okay for things that no
I voted for be you would for a tool a
contingency okay all right come your
hands or see what about d what about it
yeah all right let's see it was right
you don't need you induce much trust bow
I can tell you that people don't think
the same is you so no it's see okay so
let me enlighten you so what happens
here so this is a code what we did we
created a range so 0 up to nine is a
range and we created a single array with
this range inside so when we do the
iteration we all need to it on an array
with the single element inside and when
we do minus one the operator 1-1 on a
range is going to remove the element one
from the range which gives us the
collection so the heat is the only
element and then we removed from it and
I know what the problem is those aren't
appearances those are brackets if I
would use bandages there it would work
it right it was very evil of you yeah I
know but let me let me revenge so there
thanks to ken again he is like on fire
by contributing by the way anyone said
see ya good job good job
of the guy in the end let's now let's
see let's see this guy dances see go
ahead move it yeah okay okay listen I'm
doing the next one come closer missing
all right now I'm going to revenge you
like a pirate you remember the talk like
a parent date was like what two weeks
ago less than two weeks ago let's yeah
let's do it let's do it okay so I don't
know how to talk like a pirate so my
english sounds like pirate anyhow so now
i'm going to present you treasure map
this is a treasure map and what we
pirates do we mark treasures with an ex
inside a nap so i'm going to put an X
that marks the treasure inside a map so
we will be able to find it right that's
the code very simple primitive let's see
what it brings we will print no such
element exception hmm why you put a key
I don't know I think it will bring
treasure of course don't against the key
that you put in the map will imprint no
no for the same logic no will it bring
treasure and it makes sense of course I
did it and we'll throw blue screen of
death now this is Mac but blue screen of
death it's always a possibility isn't it
if it's in virtualbox you ok so who
thinks it's a d no one dear thank you 4d
thank you ok he wants a fog little who
thinks it's a no such element exception
yeah all right ok yeah thank you who
thinks it's none all right most of you
think it's now it doesn't make any sense
good and what things it's see we think
this pleasure yeah okay cup your hands
thank you for that show me both well
it's no
wait a second wait a second who knows
why your regard we should go ahead okay
it wasn't string go back for a second to
the code yeah so you say ki will be yeah
all right yeah that's that was good yeah
the stern so it that's exactly it ki is
a literal well that was even worse than
the previous tenants key is a literal no
matter what and you got a hint from
IntelliJ the green one should be
thinking yeah yeah but so yes of course
let's fix it front fix thank you dear
parenthesis it was now the error is what
one time thing brandis's are forever
yeah geez think we're getting to it
another one is just using Java API and
we hate that with passion but g string
is a hell of a sick way to do it but it
will work right and the best the most
elegant way actually is using this
notion of you know auto pilot eh
at forget that this yeah there's
something subscript subscript yeah yeah
of course we'll have parentheses this
one is hell of a sick way to do it all
of them works yeah okay so you like the
pressure yeah give me like me a pilot's
talk talk like a pirate here is another
take on that now we are going to make it
more complicated and we have two routes
for the treasure not 12 so now we are
going to put two routes to the treasure
and it's actually very similar but thank
you for mentioning the g string i am
going to solve the problem with that
being string but using this seek way of
converting it to the string as it should
be okay all right now i'll talk to me
again no such element X i know because i
think if things are consistent then we
we nailed it right so yeah we're
definitely so now won't ever over things
it's not such element exception no one
voted for that last time maybe this one
no no one wants it okay how about now
guys will fix it we really did okay how
about treasure what do you think you are
yeah yeah yeah yeah someone thank you
thank you for trusting us guys you're so
naive I like it okay how about kernel
panic this time yeah yeah okay nice so
most of you think it's now right you
have you think we fixed it I think we
fixed it show me nah wait in so you give
me there okay so now by the vault key
little no matter what except numbers
alright so it will just check for the
name of the type of the key we will see
that this is integer and we tried so
hard to make drink out of our key now it
won't match of course yeah so this is
quite of surprising and annoying but
let's go with that gyan who is trying so
hard to get to Java 1 he misses playing
and then another plane was late and then
he missed his connection but I hope he
will lend it here until the end of Java
one this pastor is here and thank him
very much yeah now it's your turn let me
save the date so Java one will in Java
one how about Java too we have a list of
lungs and we're putting one two three
inside the list and we're having a date
to this list okay with the ad operate oh
that's definitely Java too okay and
we're printing the list what will it
print so let's start up fellow it won't
compile will it print one two three and
then the date is an array will it print
an array with one two three and the long
of the date yeah and it's a tricky
question because you have to do a new
date and see whether the long matches no
it doesn't it doesn't oh is it going to
throw a trust cast exception yeah ok so
I'll tell you what I am seriously voting
for see now no kidding because groove is
awesome it does a lot of magic compares
conversions inside and we all know the
date is backed up by this huge long
milliseconds from January first nineteen
seventy right the epic time so what I
expect from groovy is that when I need
to put a date inside the list of lungs
it will know how to convert from date to
launch automatically so let's see how
things like you who thinks it's see
okay good good thank you who thinks it's
a it won't compile when you compile yeah
it's a d.d classcastexception I'm
confusing you okay most of you actually
and who thinks it's be okay quite a few
let's see oh it's actually be I'm a
little bit disappointed but I think I
know what happened I think I know yeah
it's a ratio not that a ratio data ratio
yeah you're right that's a racial yeah
so it's a Java erasure in runtime the
bytecode contains only ordinary classes
no generics and that actually but why
didn't fell on the compiler let's let's
try and fix it why didn't fail a gumball
time okay let's see how you can do it in
white ok so in goofy you can insert
anything anywhere this is not safe for
work statement and to fix that wait a
second wait a second who knows how to
fix that that's a t-shirt question you
already got a t-shirt now I want my
compile time checks
now I I actually what I meant here I
want to fail it on the compile time yeah
yeah thank you very much that's a
t-shirt you sure you want to do that
i'll try our learning to learn to stick
ah i wouldn't say that okay so yeah that
was that was very good answer air is
correct you and the gang thanks to these
guys to drink we have this beauty right
we can force groovy to do a study
compilation checks and actually fail
compilation when we try to add date
inside list of lungs by the way it will
also force us convert those integers to
be lungs as well on the way all right
remember this song REM 1993 I think
what's the frequency can go ahead ok so
I'm going to ask you what's the
metaclass bulk let's do it so we have a
map with a metaclass inside the key and
frequency for the value and we're going
to print out what's the dollar map don't
metaclass bow alright what's it's going
to be missing method exception because
we don't have a medical asst method on
whatever dollar my booty groovy we do
what's the blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah bow I cannot read that and what's
the java.util in cash map and the
address doc maricris whoa Oh what's the
frequency well who thinks it's a we
think it's be couple of hands you need
to vote ok who thinks it's see ya oh
that's good I think it's see I can
explain your wife now what's happened
here wait wait let's finish with all
right sleep I just want to run very few
ok ok now let's look bear with me while
you wait see huh I know the answer now
what's going on here it's a blueprint
map which is linked hashmap with a
shellcode dot metaclass this you see
it's green it means that its string so
it will print it they're very bottom
Aziz ok let's see if you're right and of
course you're not ok so it works but I'm
not sure it's a good thing ok why it
seven worked let's look at it ok so what
happens with when you do overloading
you remember that so what really happens
is that if map don't metaclass is
overriding over it reading for a med
format dots get metaclass as the key it
cannot be overridden for map get
metaclass as the attribute let's sneak
ok so in map the gate for a key precedes
the get fluent for the attribute so
that's all yeah ok now the good thing is
now you might be scary with all the
groovy operator overloading don't be
that I think the only case where I
actually have conflict between two
different behaviors that are override
the same operator and the operator in
this case that's the only corner case
with maps you need to be very wet that
get actually does something get the
property from the map and not getting
the property of the object as a
metaclass for that example and yeah
that's a little bit tricky but that's
okay then that's the only part all right
okay perf you so yeah that was easy can
again you won't believe this guy's on
fire ok prime cuts any vegetarians in
the crowd yeah ok good ok now this is
called the determines whether some a
number is primitive or not right so by
not a prime yeah of course so it goes to
it takes the square root and defines the
limit until what to search and then it
starts from two girls on the limit tries
to divide it and then returns false if
it if it's a
managed to divide it if the model is not
others and returns through otherwise and
then I do for as a string convert it as
a double and yeah it wasn't easy show
show it again folks left side again so
assuming I'm gonna get one and it should
show me the answers yeah ok so here we
go first true for is prime how about
that false for is not prime that should
be right numberformatexception you know
why because i play with strings here and
missing method exception for I don't
know what square root each whatever okay
so my first thought is that for is going
to be converted to a double that's good
i'm not sure if it's going to be
converted to a double using the unicode
dead ASCII value of the number four
because it's a single digit or if it's
going to take for the string and convert
it to real double but then i thought you
have a closure here okay the three turns
false but you're not doing anything with
the return lately let's let's wait for
that so guys what do you think who
thinks it's a all right what thinks it's
been who thinks it's see okay and did
you stop voted by the way you won't get
an integer this way not good you have
what is your answer so i think it's a
it's a yeah i think that this return
from the closure okay doesn't matter you
think it's a and that's a correct answer
and whoever didn't vote a should do that
now who knows why it's a
go ahead return that iteration of the
quarter no not the whole treasure so
each will continue and we would turn
that love truth that's a froggy that was
good but it's only a froggy any other
yeah you already got the future okay
girls only once a we have no yeah good
oh okay yeah that's not even froggy know
any other ideas all right so this is
what's happening he wants to answer yeah
go ahead not exactly yeah so let's see
it's it's quite simple and Nikita was
very very close so the thing is as Nikki
dimensioned local return return to hear
returns from returns forum from a
closure this is a closure and the return
returns from closure and not from the
whole method but the method each returns
now so this is our actually ignored
that's what he said anyhow okay yeah so
that's at issue yeah I just wanted a
very patient on you but yeah okay okay
okay I got a rich folks all the way from
now on yeah all right no shirts so yeah
that's that's why and that's actually
very tricky thing this local return and
we see it a lot we're done it a lot and
just be aware of it and know that
closure has its own scope that it
returns from it and not from the method
which is quite the opposite of how
lambda expressions work in Java yeah so
that there is a whole story around it if
you are interesting to see how it can be
fixed beyond going to the work using the
any method you can a go to this URL and
as you already see it scan again he has
a whole story of how all this was fixed
and involved yes so as I mentioned it's
can again
okay you're taking us and ten years back
yeah let's Van Hollen and jump okay
let's jump okay so we have a class van
Halen with the metal jump and here come
here are the lyrics and another method
missing for overriding missing methods
with the right signature name and dogs
and it returns lyrics and then we do a
print van Halen Doge jump what's it
going to print out go ahead hello the
lyrics like we wanted to okay you're the
null startup Pharaoh twin to compile or
missing method exception even though we
did override the method missing now let
me let me let me try to figure it out so
we go to jump and here we try to
evaluate here are the lyrics this is a
method call this method does not exist
so we get to the method meeting and now
we don't care what the name is so
they'll work for lyrics and you just
print return lyrics so it'll be here are
the lyrics I go for it yeah definitely
who's with bow think say you won't get
any t-shirts okay who thinks it's be
okay there's no majority so far who
thinks it's a start-up Pharaoh utorrent
compile okay some of you don't vote
don't be scared missing methods
exception missing method good chose it
because I said you're not voting or okay
you're good yeah so you didn't fall for
this one I did budget what are the
indigent yeah yeah so it's a quadratic
yeah you can go to a static method how
do we fix it yeah yeah well we cannot
invoke static method
and well actually yeah when you see the
exception it's quite quite clear what
happened exception and the way to our
override static method with the method
missing is this 11 underscore not to
yeah make it a little less hard to
figure out but it's documented all
around so it's it's okay the other
option will be this one and there is a
correct option i fix it nicer code yeah
just use the object orientation don't
you study context and you're good all
right this will be the one the last one
and I love this puzzle it's so good so
let me let me treat it let me treat you
with a pie so here we go we have a
double three and then I print land value
dot for Tim is double and check whether
it's double yeah I give it only simple
code no not nothing complicated will it
print true will print missing property
exception will it print false or will it
print media missing method exception hmm
so what I think it's going to be false
because you're doing 314 and it can't
you concatenate it to a string and then
you do a double on a string and actually
no think yes I think I got it it's going
to be false
go ahead what did we learn ah yeah all
right that's that's the way to get a
property right that's a way to get the
property so that we try to get a
property here but see go go go back like
my mom yeah here's a missing poverty
exception yeah that should be missing
property exception right because this is
a property let's try it again you also
told me that numbers are exceptional
let's try it again who thinks missing
property exception now no no luck who
thinks a who thinks it is double who
thinks it will we be who thinks see
false it's not a number guys you are not
working we run out of t-shirt but you
won't get any froggies as well who
thinks it's the media major exception
weight for weight was the Frog meeting
methods all right ok now ok good frog it
doesn't tell if you won't go right now
ok ok just give him from because it's a
nice guy alright so the answer is false
who knows why first of all two steps who
knows why we didn't fall on the missing
property exception why this didn't
happen someone any ideas alright so I'll
help you with that because what is a
primitive three it's not an object but
in groovy we have properties on
primitives like we have probabilities on
everything start with the number thank
you very much that's a t-shirt and our
booth because that was very very good
it'll get a frog from them so what
actually happened is groovy checks if it
should even bother to try and figure out
even the property or not by checking if
it's a valid Java identifier a very nice
if it's not a valid identifier why even
bother and starting to is one is not a
very far now the thing is this is a
property because this is a valid
identifier this is not because it's not
a validated
the good thing is we have IntelliJ to
clearly mark this is Peter Graham of
here out of the groovy support and
IntelliJ look this looks like a property
this looks like a string intelligent
nose and tells you now the question is
why it's not true I'm going back to the
god I make it there is a method on
string is double any ideas yeah thank
you very much that's definitely t-shirt
in our booth and froggy for now and
that's because the two string the print
line of three is 320 320 plus dot 14 is
a valid string spring framework version
but not a double all right I think we
are almost out of time thousands so yeah
let me know we have some more but we
won't show them so let me go to the
conclusions part and it didn't work how
about now it didn't work how about I
want to go yeah you know it didn't work
okay this is because it's Mac it's
almost it's almost a
nullpointerexception a blue screen of
this let me just fix it vamos a cushion
what we'd wait yeah okay here we go yeah
sure perfect
thank you very much and we're here it
was supposed to jump here never mind you
got the idea now let's talk about a
little bit about the conclusions and
what how there are many ways to give a
t-shirt to get a tissue so first and the
most important thing is don't write the
code that you saw okay most of the
things can be fixed with parentheses but
it also can be fixed with a clean nice
coat and that's exactly what you should
do okay just don't do those tricks if
you are tempted to do those things
because they are so cool document them
for the next three der don't make a
puzzlers out of your coat it's a nice
for a conference session not so much for
the production source code sometimes
there is just a bug we deliberately
didn't put any bugs as partners a just
because they are not puzzlers there are
bugs and sometimes you encounter one of
thoe of them now this is a really rare
the groovy code base is very very stable
and contains very limited number of bugs
put there on purpose of course for you
to stumble upon them but they are really
really limited so usually it's your
fault sometimes not but earlier you put
it nicely use static code analysis and
you so how IntelliJ would help you
fixing most not stumbling on most of
those puzzles right so deliberately
which stripped out any any analysis and
you know any markers of errors in our
code otherwise it wouldn't be passers
anymore just use in IntelliJ use another
static code analysis it actually helps
very much and of course read the docs
okay this is the best thing you can do
to allow to keep yourself out of most of
the paddlers just read the docs and that
will do it and as the Giants we step on
their solar said do not
code like my brother which go backs to
do not drive like my brother thank you
very much well we have just started I
think this is the fourth iteration of
guru puzzlers there are new partners
coming in they're all pastors going out
we're constantly improving it and we I
hope we will keep doing it and aim as
the original java pastors we might end
end up in very nice uniform well they
have some ideas what it will be I will
keep you as a surprise for you and if
you encounter any positives or any
interesting stuff please send us you can
send us by mail to pass vs jeffro calm
you can start the conversation about
them in in twitter by tweeting to groovy
paddlers to Edgar partners we'll take it
from there and we actually give t-shirts
so if you send us puzzles we you can see
the tweets back from people who got
t-shirts we promise to marry Becca
t-shirt and and yeah you can you show
those park yeah okay and you can follow
the twitter handler google puzzles to
get notifications about well the next
talks are going to be if you have
positive feedback just send it to google
puzzles on twitter we search for eight
or directly or to me or to bow if you
have negative negative feedback we don't
care so guys your positive feedback
should also go in the feedback form of
jello one because we want to be a rock
stars for next time so please mark the
correct answers in your freedom forum
thank you very much guys
