hey there's his new chip compiler it
should produce better code I'm not
exactly sure but what do you think about
trying it out and so Twitter was open to
now say yeah let's give it a shot and it
turned out that it works really well for
us mainly because most of our micro
services are written in Scala and growl
has a very very good job for Scala code
and so we saved a lot of money and CPU
cycles so brah it's a research project
by Oracle labs they're working on this
for a while now Gras is much easier to
understand I think it's it's mainly
because of two reasons number one it was
from ground up
designed as a modular compiler right it
used Java packages and all this it it
has its own build system that makes sure
that I don't know across dependency or
circular dependencies or anything like
this and the other thing I think is
especially thinking about the current
generation or the next generation of
software engineers coming out of college
they don't teach C++ anymore but they
still teach Java so for them to
understand it it's so much easier and
and you you take raw it's a Java project
you load it up in your favorite IDE and
it's just there you're browsing around
it's it's so much easy to understand
when you go to conferences now and
you'll hear the GDK architects speak
about what's going to happen you know
mark Reinhold Chun ROS and Brian get
some it's cool stuff coming up right but
it's a big investment it's a big
investment for Oracle if Oracle wouldn't
be behind all this I don't see how all
these new research would be done like
project Valhalla and you know all this
stuff Panama and and all the things that
are coming this really works it's not
just a new shiny thing it's actually it
will save you money that's that's the
message I'm trying to get across the
other thing that's that's super exciting
is rahl is the compiler that produces
code but there's something called
truffle that runs on
if it an abuser scroll and it's it's a
framework where you can easily implement
languages or collapse as implementations
for JavaScript and R and JRuby and it
can it can bring you massive performance
benefits because they the way they
approach this is very different to what
people do today and the combination of
truffle withdrawal gives you this
massive improvement
