to the emerging languages a script Paul
are you guys excited because of jawan
yeah this is this is the last talk of
the conference I know it has been a
really intense and wicked a week so we
reserve the last the best for the last
which is these guys it's starting from
where we'll be you're right a staff
present in salon then we have Charlie
present in mirror follow it by Andrew
presenting cutting and finally Dirk on
Freya so the format of this bowl each
one of the speakers will have a chance
for five minutes to present the language
at the beginning and then a second run
of other five minutes to do something
that will excite you and probably entice
you to try all these languages and
definitely like rack cell yesterday on
his original scribble I add no value
other than telling these guys when the
time is over so without any further ado
I do let's go with the staff so I'm
Steph I'm talking about the salon
project which is a new programming
language so what is it it's a powerful
language it's trying to be a modern
language it's it's it's coming out right
now it's one of the strong goals is that
on top of the power that we bring you in
the language that we want to make it
readable so that is easy to maintain in
teams which is basically what people
love about Java right and it's
predictable so that this a small number
of rules and you learn them fast and you
know when you look at a piece of code
you know what it's going to do but it's
more than language it's also like like
Java time it's also a platform so it
comes with its own SDK it comes with
modularity built-in and great tooling in
the forms of command lines and ID so we
released
version1 that I beta last Tuesday so
this Tuesday actually which means that
the language is now feature complete
after two years of waiting it it runs on
the JVM or it also runs on JavaScript vm
so you can compel to Java JavaScript we
have a specification online already we
have great command line tools in the
form of in the fashion of get you know
with one command and tons of pluggable
sub comments we have great ide based on
Eclipse and we have a great module repo
and a module system as well so I'm going
to show you a bit of a bit of things
that might you know and teach you to to
learn the language so this is a class
for instance it has a constructor which
takes two parameters one of them is the
name the other one is a country the
second one is optional it has a default
value they're both shared so you can
access them from outside it's easy to
refine methods so for instance the two
string method in Java is the string
attribute in salon it's easy to refine
it you just say okay my string
implementation is this and it's a string
template so there is interpolation in
the middle we have first-class functions
so for instance we can invoke the
constructor of person and create a new
person here we're not passing the
country it we're using the default value
you can see the value keyword because
there's a lot of type inference in salon
it's a it's not the dynamic language
it's strongly typed language but the
type inference is is pretty good and you
can see that glasses are functions to
you can you know their first class
functions you can get a reference to a
class and it is a function which you can
invoke you say make a person and you can
invoke it and pass it the name and you
can see that the fact that we have a
default argument in the second position
is not lost in type system you also have
static references so you're a person
that name is a function that will get
you the name if you pass it function if
you pass it an instance of person we
also have support for flow typing which
means that for instance given a
parameter which would be a union type of
either integer or string a then we can
assert that it is actually a string and
in this case in the rest of the method
because we have checked that it is a
string it's not an integer we can access
all the methods of string we also have
flowing conditions so if it is if B is
an integer and it's not new because we
support we have a strong support for a
null safety in salon so for instance
whenever you see something which is of
type integer it can't be new and like in
Java so when you want something that is
integer or nil you can use the syntactic
sugar integer ? and then you can see if
it's an integer then you can do math on
it you know it's new we also have
refight generates so this is you know
useful to make sure that you're really
reasoning about something that you know
it's it's of the right tag you can shake
one minute a list is of type list t and
that we share the same type and we have
really great metamodel since the version
1 at 0 beta so for instance here we walk
the current package called samples and
we look at all the decorations all the
class declarations which are shared and
we iterate all the declarations and if
they take if these class decorations
don't take any parameters then we are
going to apply the class give it any
type argument if it needs to so in this
case we don't have any and then we can
we get a model which is a function so
picture the class called class in Java
and think that it's a function you can
just invoke it and get new instances of
everything emanate right as I said we
have great inference so for instance
when you have a sequence of mixed
content such as integers and strings the
type checker is able to infer that it
contains an iterable of integer or
string then you can do a functional
programming on hng you can filter all
the integers but filter is not really
smart because it only reasons about the
fact that you should accept something or
not so it tells you returns a boolean it
says yes or no but the type of what you
filter the result is still going to be
integer or string
if you use comprehensions at the bottom
where you see the curly braces for you
can iterate everything and then you
check if it's an integer then you can do
math on it and the type checker will
infer that only answer is an interval
interval of only integers and that's
time up let's go with the next one thank
you very much hello everybody I'm going
to talk a little bit about Mira it's a
language that I originally came up with
a few years back that is now kind of
been taken over and and continued to
develop over the years first of all the
most important thing is that mirror does
have the coolest logo of all of these
languages that took me a good that took
me about a day's worth of work to do
then okay so uh there's a lot of things
that I liked from Ruby a lot of things
that Ruby developers like from Ruby a
very clean language expressive very
compact the fact that it's dynamic
language is often one of the reasons
people use Ruby but it is a lot slower
than C or Java or we're certainly
working on improving that in the the
jruby world trying to bring it at least
up to Java speed on the JVM but there's
a lot of things that you can't do with
it as a result and then the other side
we have Java which tends to be a little
bit more verbose a little bit in elegant
in certain places lambdas are helping
that but there's a lot of things that
can be done to improve Java even beyond
that most folks would agree it's it's
uglier than a lot of other languages
certainly not as clean and pretty as
Ruby or Python however it is this
statically typed language and it is very
fast if you want to write something on
the JVM and take full advantage of it
usually it needs to be one of the
statically typed languages and so Java
does very well on performance and we'd
like to be able to combine these two
things and the original idea was what if
we could have essentially Ruby syntax
but just be Java under the covers and
that's what Mira is it has a parent
features like I call them surface
features from the
be language it has the same general
syntax as Ruby it has sport foreclosures
some of the rich set of literal types
that are available in Ruby but it is
actually as fast as Java and it just
does it just creates regular JVM
bytecode under their covers so it starts
with this idea what if this the the in
allegan Java version of this code could
basically just boil down to the Ruby
version and this is exactly what Mira
does with only this is this would be a
ruby version and that's the only change
is required in this particular case to
turn it into mirror which will generate
almost identically the same code as the
Java version so features from Ruby that
we do have in there currently optional
arguments are in their internal
iteration using a closure of a block
like like a lambda and Java 8 closures
obviously literals of there are string
the integer float big integer regular
expressions hashes and lists which
turned into a mutable array list or an
immutable list or an immutable map we're
looking at different ways of doing
mix-ins or open classes so that we can
be able to make it look like there's a
method on string that wasn't there
before be able to add methods to
existing types without actually
reopening them other features that we're
looking at possibly adding the Sharps
extension methods is one way that you
can add statically to existing class
additional methods implicit type
conversions possibly although the Scala
folks have warned me off this early the
hell it imposes upon your type system
pattern matching case class kind of
stuff that's also possibilities I think
probably the key the killer feature that
makes mirror interesting for me is that
unlike pretty much every other JVM
language you get a source file in you
can pilot you get class files out and
that's all there is that you need it has
no runtime library of any kind we do
this in various
waze's various tricks that we use to
allow closures to work and allow other
features of the language to work but you
can you can't run most of these
languages build an application like an
Android application that's in like 10 or
15 kilobytes you always have that ball
and chain to drag along that goes along
with the language runtime so this is a
key feature that we've tried to enforce
all the way through development of Mira
you got source in class out you compile
it and that's it and I think I can pass
it on Thank You charlie so hello
everybody I'm Andre and I'm talking
about cobbler colin is a another JVM
language by JetBrains creators of
IntelliJ IDEA and other ID products so
as many other people here we were after
a better language for our JVM platform
so it's a statically typed one again so
we are very much into safety into static
guarantees it compiles to JDM by codes
and JavaScript which is very fashionable
to die and both versions are both ways
compatible with the respective platform
languages so in Java you can mix in on
the Java platform a knex Java code in
kaavalan code freely calling it both
ways so we're focused on basically the
industrial setting of the usage so its
readability it's a simple and powerful
abstractions and performance as a
priority and of course tooling matters
so I'll proceed to demo the language and
we'll try to impress you a little bit so
this is what a class looks like so we
have the most unfamiliar thing here is
that types are on the right so this
class declares the constructor and three
properties at the same time one of the
properties has the default value so that
when i call the constructor here i may
not pass the third parameter or may pass
one doesn't really matter so this is how
you make a collection and God on we
don't have collection literals and we
are reluctant to having special syntax
for things so we have good enough
abstraction
to express things other languages have a
special syntax so if you want to list
you just call a list of function and
best things in this is how you treat a
list and print everything if you want a
map and filter here is your filter
here's a map these are higher order
functions and in fact they are not only
higher order they are in extension
functions because we rely on Java
collections more or less and Java
collections don't have these tool before
eight at least and we are not on eight
so these are extension functions that
enrich existing libraries that's how we
keep our a library footprint low so we
are also supporting Android use case and
the Iran M is very small although not
zero and this is another example of how
you make a map again it's all in
functions no special syntax for maps as
such and here's how you rate a set of
pairs which a map is so one of the
important things is the notion of
extensions Charlie said two words about
it I'll say a little more so the point
is that I have classes in my library
which I cannot alter but I want new
methods on those classes and one of the
biggest things there is tooling because
I want my code completion to actually
propose this these different new
additions to it to the classes so that
can explore my API by tooling and this
is how you do it in Collin it's just a
function for string called an extension
function you have your this inside it's
now magic you we are not actually
changing the string class it's just an
external extension but it makes the
system very powerful this is how these
functions appear on collections without
changing the collections and the same
thing makes say strings iterable in
catalan they of course do not implement
the interval interface because Java does
not allow this but an iterator method is
enough to iterate through a string
another point is static type safety and
that's why here we have a compile-time
error because list files of java.io.file
returns a nullable thing it the array
there may be no so we do not allow you
to the reference that unknowable thing
right away you can do other things like
check and return if it is now and then
you
and unit so it's again flow-based typing
which becomes fashionable or you can
just check and use it inside an F and so
on so forth so the flow based typing is
smart enough to figure your types on the
way you don't have to cast or to play
NASA tricks with any any other types of
some stuff I would thank you one other
nice thing is that you can combine hired
functions and instead extension
functions and this is how this with
function works here it's again not a
special concert just a function in the
language which allows you to access
methods of this string builder inside
the block as if it were like Pascal
construct for saving you preferences on
your code I think I'm done thank you
thank you very much ok ok yep No hello
everybody I'm going to present a
language that you may have never heard
of because from the language
implementers they say possibly 200
people on the planet have heard of that
language language is called freegan
which is a German word from German
logician who was the first one who
published the paper about functions they
take functions as arguments in 1891 that
was when people couldn't even think of
computers right if if English is your
first language then it's almost
impossible to pronounce it correctly and
you're entitled to call it freaky if you
want to it is kind of freaky it is
estimated knowledge the only purely
functional language on the JVM as of
today and purely functional has being
purely functional it has a number of
interesting effects and I'll try to
compare it with Java now let's assume
you have a java method foo it takes an
argument and the argument is a pair a
pair of
a and B not like generics now we have a
pair you know that feel familiar it
returns something of type a from the
signature what can you tell about foo
what can it possibly do well it could
take the first argument of that pair of
course and return it you know that's one
thing it could have seen it in your
quote sorry but yeah it could do
printing right it could just print the
value it could reach out to the database
and ask for some value of a return an a
it could change the a return it it could
spawn your threats it could launch the
missiles and have third world war you
have absolutely no idea what it does
right from the type type type signature
it could return a null it could throw an
exception right you have absolutely no
idea if you do the accept same method in
inflation or in Haskell actually go sort
of Haskell before audience oh sorry but
after our fake is a hostel for the JV
and I'm done haha there are your ladies
and gentlemen so sorry not yet not not
quite so um yes if you do the very same
equivalent and in in Vega you know the
only thing that such a method can
possibly do is return the first element
of the pair it could at worst case
consume endless time for endless memory
or may not even return because of spec
overflow those are the three things that
could go wrong right since you're on the
JVM but nothing else it could not even
pop not even possibly return a null
that's impossible given the same
argument it will always return the same
value who I wish java.util.date would do
that right so that's you know that means
you can immediately optimize your coat
your optic calling a function is can
always be memorized and since you're
always you already have calculated the
value you can you can
replace it with a bed look up right
that's you can memorize and optimize and
do things in parallel of course and it's
thread safe and so on so that those are
the main merits and I'll keep the rest
for later thank you okay so Dirk is
saving one minute of his time all right
so this is the end of the first realm I
hope you guys have already had a chance
to get acquainted with the languages so
on the next round these guys will do
their best to impress you and see what
they got so take it away staff please
nautically not exit now okay so i have
i'm going to show you to salon programs
talking to each other one running in the
browser the other one running on a
server as i said from the beginning
salon is a platform it has modularity so
here i'm showing you in module
descriptor for the server part which
imports database connection network
access input output and jason support
from the salon sdk the jigsaw java base
module if it still remains anyways and a
maven module so you can see that we have
interrupt with java let's see what the
run function does so we have a get SQL
method which opens a data source 22
Postgres database i have in this machine
i have a read SQL method which takes an
SQL connection and a callback with which
expects a name a version and a number of
downloads i'm doing an SQL query and for
each of the rows I verify that I have
indeed because the database is not typed
I have indeed a string of version it
downloads and then I invoke the callback
so in my run function in the main
function I will
open the sqlconnection and then I will
create a server this is based on the the
salon SDK and I open a web socket and if
the path starts with web socket then I
have a number of callbacks weather which
is on the open i will start reading SQL
and then for each row in there I create
a JSON object which is a part of the
JSON SDK of the salon SDK and this is
going to be my object I print something
and then I send it as text as a pretty
so I pretty printed and then I sleep for
half a second so i'm going to sleep for
half a second between each sending each
data to the client and the client client
is this so we have a bit of JavaScript
to get jquery and require ajs which is
the module system we use on JavaScript
so we configure the module system for
require and then I requiring my salon
module and then it gets a client and I'm
going to plug the run function from
salon on a callback for click for a
button and here have a button right so
let me show you the code of the run
method here i'm on the javascript right
and salon is a statically typed language
so if we want to access things that are
not defined in salon like in the SDK
here i'm using the json module but there
are a number of things that are provided
by JavaScript such as you know support
for web sockets or jQuery then I have to
open a dynamic block and I have a number
of dynamic values such as the socket the
jQuery object and then I just type it
like i would type javascript accepted
solana it's typed statically except for
the dynamic parts and I create a
function every time I get a message i
will parse the json i will make sure
that i do have the proper data in there
then I will do some jQuery to happen
some things so let's see what it does I
go in the browser now so i have this
thing i'm going to get the list of
modules from the server and you can see
that when i click i get all the modules
from the server with a half a second
sleep between each sense so this is
using web sockets and this is this is
running on the client and the server
using the json api so one thing to note
here is that this is really typesafe so
when i go at the look at what i can put
in a JSON object for instance this is
the beauty of union types i can put here
name which is a string i can put a
version and if i try to change the
version and put something which is for
instance what do I have here I have a
server then it's not going to be allowed
because it's it's strongly typed it
could be an integer astraying a number
of things but definitely not a server
because we have a type system that
allows us to say it can be a number of
things with union types so to conclude
I'll say that salon is open source even
the module repository that we have
online and everything that is deployed
you can try it online you can learn
everything about it on the on our home
site and you can download modules for
free and you know you we get a package
on salon you can get the back basic
package you get to use up to 15 lambdas
in your module up to three nested for
loops the lead edition gets you 666
lambda / modules and a lot of classes
and in Ultimate Edition you get pay as
you use function calls so every time you
get a one cent function called bill for
for functional calls and unlimited type
parameter so if you want 600 type
parameters in your function then you can
do that I encourage you to go and check
out our web page which has lots of code
lots of documentation and our module
repo which is really great and you can
see we have a number of modules in our
sdk already most of which are also
available for javascript thank you
thank you very much as their for
discussing say loans business plan that
was refreshing thank you look at me i
will i'll just run through some more
examples of mirror code so this is what
we might have in ruby for printing out a
string this is what it is in mira
exactly the same puts is defined as a
macro that essentially just does system
out print line for you an example of fib
in ruby only one one little change
required to the signature it doesn fer
all the types and for a lot of other
stuff and you know it ends up making the
code pretty much look like ruby other
than adding a few types in here and
there optional areum arguments similar
to how it is in ruby only thing that we
do here is we add the the type of these
and in this case i think actually could
be inferred as well iteration so this
gives us a list of integer objects and
we can iterate over them even though
each does not exist on list it's defined
as a macro in the system and it does the
normal expansion into list walking using
an iterator same thing with a thread
this is identical to what the ruby code
would be create a new thread give it a
closure it turns that into a runnable
and you have your thread object in hand
ready to go here's an example of what
the macro definition logic looks like
within the square root macro we're
defining here we have our quote and this
will then expand out to whatever is it
within that that block of code each
place where you call it and then the
back tix there basically say whatever
the input argument is to this macro
insert it here in the code so down at
the bottom puts square root for put
square root number both of these expand
out to math dot square root of whatever
that argument was that was passed in and
it the macros can be defined on a global
basis or on specific classes so it looks
like you're actually defining methods on
classes that are closed that are someone
else's but it's just a macro that ends
up
expanding in place and all of the normal
static typing propagates through this
correctly a larger example of doing
swing the moat the interesting part here
is probably the at the bottom adding an
action listener again using a closure to
define the body of the action listener
it turns into the action listener
interface and handles the the event for
you that way what else we have defining
an interface and then using that
interface within a given class again
here's our array iterator our iteration
over a list it's a puddle for that one
and this is the one this is what I like
I was very happy with the way that
mirror was working out as far as a
statically typed language but there are
some cases where it's nice to be able to
drop down and just do dynamic dispatch I
chose to do it the same way that C sharp
does declare it as a dynamic type then
any calls against it will compile and
they'll resolve at runtime using normal
Java look up no normal java method look
up and dispatch and this this example we
have a foo method that will take
anything any dynamic type any any object
type and then print out the the class
and the name or the size of that object
down at the bottom we pass in two things
one of them is an array the other one is
our arbitrary class they have no type in
common except for object but both of
them are able to be passed in here and
the method calls work just fine just
show we do have a basic maven support
there is an ant plugin so you can use
this in any existing projects we're
hoping to help get some folks to help us
with ide support the parser is going to
be pretty simple the typing is not very
complicated it should be pretty easy to
get some AI de support very quickly so i
won't one bottom line i want to say here
that seems to confuse folks sometimes
it's not Ruby you can't like take a
rails app and write on mirror somehow it
uses java's libraries Javas type system
there's no runtime library required Ruby
libraries will not work but you can
write a lot
what you would write in Ruby and it will
feel the same way but compile statically
down so it really does feel like Ruby
with a really nice clean lightweight
syntax closures the macro stuff gives
you a lot of the features of being able
to reopen classes from Ruby and at the
bottom the bottom line is its
performance equivalent to Java and like
Java see you get source files in class
files out and you're done you've got no
runtime library to worry about future
directions that were going with this the
compiler is almost self hosted at this
point I originally wrote the entire
compiler in Ruby and it was about like
eight thousand lines of Ruby code to do
the entire thing it slowly been
migrating over to be more and more
written in mira i think probably by the
end of the year it will be completely
self hosted a generic support possibly
it's kind of a nice trick that we
instead of doing generic support one
thing we can do in an inside up closure
block is just declare them as dynamic
it'll still be able to call the methods
on them we won't have to propagate all
those types all over the place and then
you can add types back in as you want
and then of course I mentioned well we'd
like to get ite support across all the
major IDEs and that's it you can check
out mirror org it's on github it's all
free open source everything else so
that's all I have thanks Thank You
Charles this is over to Andrew okay so i
would like to present the way you do web
obligations in God lon so here is my
silly example my starting page well just
give an option of having a file list and
navigate through directories the
interesting part is what it looks like
on the code side so it's the way to
build web applications without writing
HTML with angle brackets and CSS so
without having five languages to
integrate but doing everything in the
same language cuddlin so this is what
the homepage looks like this is the
mark-up I have there so we have the H to
UL everything from HTML but in a little
bit different syntax because these are
all function calls in cotton so again no
national constructs nothing like C sharp
object initializers it's just a bunch of
function calls and everything is
statically typed here so that if I for
example pull this list item out of the
list it will be read at bone type check
and even my references are typed because
they are not just strings they are
references to some classes so here is
how I can't do a list item outside a
list and here's how I know whether I use
this particular link anywhere else so
here are all the links to the file list
page for example and so this is what the
routing looks like so when you come from
the browser to the framework it looks up
the addresses it can handle in this kind
of class list and so here every class
describes one a request you can answer
one types type of requests so if I add a
parameter here like some other extra
string my code does not compile unless I
make sure that all the links actually
pass that parameter so it's a type-safe
framework with no possibility of even
broken link right so the big thing there
is the first big thing is type safety
you can actually check everything at
compile time the second thing is we use
so this is code and I can do of course
normal things like loops for example if
I want a hundred list items in the row
no problem here's my hundred it's just a
function call inside the loop the same
way I can extract this into a separate
function and call the function many
times so this compensates for HTML and
CSS having no means of abstraction so we
have not only a unified structure but
also structure with means of abstraction
and reuse so we we can turn your markup
and your styling into programming
languages instead of just data formats
so this is the second big thing and in
the same way so this is kind of an a
pattern in kaavalan we call it typesafe
builder so the builder idea is borrowed
from groovy but they're they're dynamic
here they are static we guarantee
that the structure will be correct so
this same pattern can be used in other
domains as well so this is how we do web
applications but this is how we do swing
for example so you don't have to
structure your code in a row when you
are building actually a form of some
sort you can nest things and it's again
no magic is just two very simple
features put together so our experience
so far shows that colin has very strong
on the dsl seidel although we have very
few dsl enabling features in the
language i think that's it thank you
thank you Andrew so if I make a
suggestion there those who know me know
that I'm crazy about swing I could
propose an update you're not creating
the objects inside the uid even this
bastard are you as you should but maybe
you could use a cotton lambda for that
okay that was an interruption so now we
go to the airport Dirk take it away yep
thank you so since you already you all
know Haskell for some reason well that
that was really surprising so I can I
can shortcut a little one typical thing
that is really cool about SQL is not
only and now frager it's not only purity
of functions but also type inference it
goes really far beyond what you have
seen before I can for example give you
in implementation and this
implementation is for example my x when
x method but my own one and it has two
parameters in MN + n and what it returns
is M times n ok not surprising right ok
it does it that's the the read eval
print loop here but it can ask the rep 0
for the type right I did not declare
this the the type of this function i did
not declare the normal header as i would
do in java but it can ask the type of my
x what is it and it says well it takes
an alpha
and returns a function that takes an
alpha Andrew Johnson alpha I going to go
into this a little and this alpha has
only one thing it must be alpha a
numerical type class I must be able to
do numeric things with arithmetic with
it that's what it says here right takes
a little bit get used to of course I can
sorry oh sorry yeah so yeah like that
they're fine good much better one thank
you so my x 2 and 3 not surprising 6 hmm
but what I can do as well is I making
you like a double-double me hmm and I
give and it is defined as my x 2 what is
what type is double me it is a function
that takes an integer now it knows it
must be an integer and returns an
integer so it is a partially applied
function if you have a rather good right
double me of three is six right that's
the kind of thing that you can do and
therefore you have this crazy signature
in the beginning with these a function
that returns a function that does
something okay you actually read this as
a function that takes two argument and
returns to this one that's kind of what
you do now and now the next thing that
is so cool about Haskell is a lazy
evaluation let's say we do have is that
visible from the back so sorry I know
you only see the back of your of the one
sitting before you good so this for
example is a endless is an infinite list
a list that starts as one with one and
it proceeds endlessly hmm if I would
evaluate this it would never stop the
repple would never stop if i evaluate it
are you with me but i can take from the
list if i want to
take to take the first one off the list
now this is really something if you
compare this to java java would first
evaluate the arguments of the method
call and here going on endlessly before
passing the neverending story to the
take method not so Haskell and not so
eager it is evaluating it lazily by
default of all parameters so what Thanks
as I call it so it's not confined to
let's say a streaming API or so it's
always works that's the least how is the
integration story with Java this all
compiles to bytecode of course it runs
on the JVM of course it interoperates
with java of course but it's not
integration it is interoperability and
the reason is if we would integrate like
groovy or Rubio so does the whole
messiness of that platform would leak
into Vega and we would we want to avoid
this there's a gatekeeper so to speak
what we have here is figure inside
IntelliJ abuse of best IDE on the planet
Leah hasn't Eclipse plug-in but anyway I
use IntelliJ IDEA great work that stuff
no so what you see here is a piece of
cake the which takes the current to
string value of the of the update now
the new date what it does with Java is
from java.util.date it tries to get new
data to string right now at the at the
border if you're using it from from
Freya let's go you have to declare the
properties the characteristics of what
you are using from Java you have to
declare that this new function function
it goes from nowhere to an IO mutable
right so called Monette I all mutable is
Latin for as messy as can be means all
bets are off if you call this and no
guarantees apply anymore
right but we can friggin and such
Haskell can divide between the clean
path and the messy parts and you can
still rely on the clean pots that's how
flaky does it and they have been
multiple attempts before to bring health
go to the JVM and they failed exactly
here at that point this point convinced
me that I put more effort into the
language because this is really the way
of keeping the messiness and the
cleanliness distinct thank you thank you
very much sir so I guess I'm the first
one to say that this has been a very
gentlemanlike cage fight so now it's
turn to the audience and you have heard
the arguments of each one of them so
let's open up the mic so to speak you
guys now have to if you want ask
questions to these guys and see what you
got who's the first take care yeah I
know is it for is the last session you
guys want to go home you guys want to go
party yeah Tom please
they're good short days for their
section
yeah repeat the question so he said that
he wanted to know what intersection
types are for insulin so intersection
types or something that I did not
explain today it is some something that
actually exists in Java in the
constraints of type parameters in a
certain number of places you can
actually write this is a type T which is
of type integer and comparable for
instance or or something more
interesting like a person and
presentable this is a way to to reason
on objects that you know have a number
of interfaces and you don't know exactly
what implementation they have but as
long as they have these interfaces then
you can do something with it that's you
know for instance I have in another
presentation had an example with
something that is drinkable and edible
and and I took a Guinness for instance
as an implementation of both and and
soup for instance as well you know then
you can have a function which takes
drinkable and edible and you can drink
it you can eat it you don't need to care
whether it's a guinness or it's soup or
it's something else that you can do all
the corporation's you need on those so
it's it's it's actually pretty useful
and it's a shame that in in Java you can
only use it in very specific places but
but what's what's even more annoying is
that sometimes the type checker in Java
will throw you an error and give you an
intersection type I don't know if it
ever happened to you but sometimes they
will tell you how you can do that
because it's comparable an integer and
it with the ampersand syntax that you
cannot use in Java so in salon you can
and these are first-class first class
types another question over that
excuses as to why is performative of the
languages as they well
things that are very difficult
so not sure
excuse or comes the reality Ruby and
we're gonna be rose I a perfect pretty
good feeling so is there something
hear that
it's been less well that certain parts
right so the so the the short story for
the question is other things missing
from Mira that you could do in Ruby
perhaps because it's dynamic nature and
so on and the way it's structured the
goal with Mira has always been to see
how much of Ruby we could implement but
still have it be a normal statically
typed language with no runtime those
were the constraints that we put
ourselves under and as you mentioned
monkey patching is a little tricky to do
the macro definition makes it sort of
feel like you're patching it you can at
least add methods to existing classes or
make it look like you've added methods
to existing classes so that you kind of
do we can't do things like method
missing or some of the other dsl support
that would come along with that there
may be ways to fake that in the future
but there's nothing in there currently
it's kind of surprising how little of
Ruby's surface level features we can't
implement we can actually are able to
get most of those features in there in
some way still having all the static
typing and the guarantees that we want
to have out of the language I suppose
the largest one that people notice when
they come to Mira is that because we
have no runtime library we have no
runtime library there is no existing
collections other than the Java
collections there's no special behavior
for for Strings there's no none of the
Ruby libraries that are out there we'll
work on Mira so you use what's on the
JVM and maybe build a little bit of
extra glue code for yourself but
otherwise we're able to do a very large
part of Ruby's features still having a
plain statically typed language
okay so is there a goal to create a
standard library for Mira to add some of
those additional features it certainly
could I would I probably just say write
those and turn them into maven libraries
or jars or whatever and then they
essentially be usable as regular Java
libraries anyway the standard library of
Mira is the standard library of any JVM
language it's just what's out there as
far as what's in the JDK and what's
available online Stephen
has it on the right well so the question
is the preference of putting the type
definition the type declaration whether
to the left or the right of the variable
yeah well I can well I can offer my
explanation so actually the best people
to answer this are C++ how X people
because they added to C++ the option of
having function return types on the
right and there is a very simple reason
because if you have function types they
push you towards having types on the
right otherwise syntax is very hard to
put together so there is an option of
see like function types or cell unlike
function types but you know so this this
is it right off you either stick with
those which are many people don't like
them I'd say or you stick with types on
the right that's it it's a totally
arbitrary choice yeah are you saying
that people are flipping coins when they
design languages yes it's totally
arbitrary I think it dates back to the
difference between the C syntax and the
ML syntax and just the way that these
languages will inherit from one another
and this came all the way from there I
think I wouldn't say it was arbitrary
for fer mira the main goal was that it
continues to read pretty much like ruby
code and so attacking the types on the
ends allows it to just sort of flow like
it would be Ruby it's the valid the
variable a that just happens to be an
int the function foo that just happens
to return an int so it ends up flowing a
little bit more easily I will also admit
that it was easier to add to the parser
there you go an honest answer this is
one darn testing is the name that should
be reversed
I'd like to agree but it's not quite the
case for example inflated where the type
the type qualifier is is optional
totally optional and typically inferred
but if you want to give it you give it
on the right so with an extra coat lines
it requires an extra an extra character
that separates them so yeah maximum
question X a little bit comes again any
more questions ok so before we close let
me say two announcements first make sure
that you fill out the survey if you
really want to see this this kind of
talk for the next child one then the
second one is I want to plug in another
language that could be in here in the
next year right line small talk on the
JVM and so now less yeah watch out so
yeah this is what we were expecting a
real case Matt within the languages so I
check small talk anytime let's speak a
winner ladies and gentlemen and we're
going to pick the winner by how much
noise you make about that particular
language so let's begin now on the other
on the other side let's begin first with
free gear they are pronounced it right
Kathleen Miller salon oh then sounds
pretty much the same okay so let's do it
again our reverse sale on mira guess
somebody is proposing to you Kathleen
and freaky well you know what honestly I
believe all these guys have witness
because they are standing here in front
of you and this is all notables because
of your entertainment this is all
because we wanted to cool stuff in a JVM
so thank you very much guys thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
