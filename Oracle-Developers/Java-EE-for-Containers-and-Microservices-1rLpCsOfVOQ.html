Enterprise like in the broadest term I'm
doing Java EE development mostly
konichiwa and I'm also more forbidden
technology is like container container
orchestration darker hue benitez
openshift one of the most important
principles as you could tell it is in
the back wasn't ability so the language
evolves really carefully so that you can
be sure that everything you have been
doing all this time and money you
invested can be used in the future
further on enterprise's really like that
fact so you know they are not thinking
in like two years or five years or
sometimes even ten years but more way
longer so when they invest something
they want to be sure that they don't
have to change it tomorrow Java EE
applications as opposed to the past can
be written with minimal code right so
yeah you can be very productive as an
enterprise developer using to LA EE and
introduce a lot of business use case
with minimum how I would call it
plumbing so basically you you
implemented business use cases and the
business logic you care about and
everything else like HTTP databases all
these things you're not mainly
interested in but kind of like a
technical necessity can be introduced
with minimal effort I would say Java EE
is very well-suited for new environments
how I would call them for micro services
for especially containers and container
orchestration as a matter of fact Java
EE is steeled as far as I know only
technology that separates the
implementation from the business logic
that means everything you ship the so
called artifacts only contain your
business logic and the application
server that's already in the runtime
does all the heavy lifting for you
we have seen a lot of movement from from
Oracle in I would say in personal
opinion the rights direction we have
seen a lot of open source involvement
Oracle has open sourced a lot of
technologies has been involved in Cuba
needest
development for example and while trying
to build up community relations more and
more more than the past and I would say
it Oracle moves in and strange maybe
unfamiliar but very very positive
directions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
