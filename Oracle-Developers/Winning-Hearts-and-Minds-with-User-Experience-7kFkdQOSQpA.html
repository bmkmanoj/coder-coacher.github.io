largest like email marketing campaign
service right and in this book designing
for emotion he says designing for
emotion makes your users want to
continue to use your product so first we
can make our product look good we don't
even have to get to the UI part of it
yet the user experience motivation but
then if you want them to continue using
our product if we just make a few small
changes in user experience we can make
them want to continue to use our
products right
how many times do we go into the office
and we're using some legacy application
that's been written like 50 years ago 10
years ago I know I'm guilty of this at
Oracle we have a number of applications
which are which we're designed quite
some time ago right wouldn't it be nice
if our users weren't to continue to use
their applications not only that like
not only that they find it attractive to
be in with like they liked using the app
but they wanted to continue to use they
wanted to put up with it there's way too
many poorly built applications out there
and I think the reason for a lot of this
stems from the fact that we were
designing these applications in the
beginning or quite some time ago for
technology experts right we were
designing these applications for people
just like us or other smart developer
minded people but that's a huge thing
that's no longer true
technology is no longer just for the
technique or the annuity right
technology is really for everyone and
this really started because of this
entire like mobile revolution that
happened a few years ago right now
everyone here has a smartphone we all
use apps we're all developers here but
you can go to any conference any room of
people and everyone will have a
smartphone and they're all using all
sorts of apps in fact the apps you have
today are the same apps that everyone
else has right so here are the top apps
in the iOS App Store and the Google Play
Store and I bet you have at least a few
of these applications installed here so
what happens is you know we build these
enterprise applications we develop these
systems and then we go home and we use
these really nice mobile applications
which are really designed for user
experience right from the moment you
open up snapchat or Facebook or whatever
they want you to be hooked into using it
right they want to you the in fact you
do use it you use it more and more and
more and then you go to your office and
then you see the applications you have
in your office your corporate IT systems
your HR systems whatever systems it may
be and it's just not the same they're
not designed with that level of user
experience that level of finesse right
they're not designed to be intuitive
very often you'll take training to learn
how to use some piece of software right
I think we've all taken training on how
to operate some application some
enterprise wide applications it's
because it's really hard to use it's not
intuitive so these users just like us
you know we were coddled by this entire
tech industry for our consumer
application but not so for enterprise
and then we take these attitudes with us
these attitudes that oh application
should be well designed well thought up
easy to use we take them to the
enterprise and we don't see that there
and if we don't provide that in the
enterprise if we don't provide that in
business then our users will slowly
change and they'll go to other providers
that are offering these benefits right
so that's why we have to think of user
experience as a part of our as a part of
our core strategy on building
application and this is a quote that
often attributed to Steve Jobs here
he said design is not just what it looks
like and feels like design is how it
works right
so way too often we can view is design
with the appearance of something right
it's not so much the appearance it's the
way that it actually functions so
although the first quote said hey
aesthetically pleasing products or
easier people find it easier to use
that's not the full story it really must
be easy - it must be easy to you they
must look good it must work well it must
be fast it must be in a performance it
must be intuitive there's a whole lot
more here and designing for our end
users it's a lot of hard work you have
to really understand who your end users
are right you have to put yourselves in
their shoes and see it from their
perspective
so now we as developers we have this
road in front of us right how do we
build application that our users want to
use that our users are I wouldn't say
crave but they really want I like that
you know they're happy to use our
application so we're going to code our
way to a better user experience no we're
not I just wanted to show you this
because this is a code conference so
here's like the one snippet of code
you're going to see in my entire
presentation does anyone know what this
as a first of all who writes CSS here ok
quite a few hands going up this is a
very simple snippet of CSS the first
line says hey if you have a link on the
page you know don't underline it because
underlying links are so passe and
they're not cool anymore but if you do
have a link and you hover over it and it
doesn't have a class make it underline
that way you know it's a link otherwise
you won't really even know it's a link
right so how do you do that the second
line right there that second ah CSS
property says hey if you have an anchor
which doesn't have a class and you hover
on it give it an underline it's kind of
a cool little snippet and this is like a
css3 property with a whole knot selector
but it's really cool and this is the one
line of code you're going to see in my
entire presentation ok so everyone with
me so far
all right so let's go into the five ways
we can improve the user experience of
our application the first one going to
be line patterns
so these signs are very familiar to us
right I don't think they're all from
here but quite a few of them are from
you are from Europe these are all
patterns that we see in our daily lives
every time we're walking in the street
whatever it is we see these patterns
these road signs and so on I'm going to
do that one more time just to show you a
few more so when you're driving you know
the speed limits you know whether
there's a pedestrian crossing you know
when to stop you know when to you know
when you can overtake someone or not and
so on and the reason why these patterns
exist is because they're consistently
used throughout the entire system and
the moment you recognize one you can
erect it you apply that same
understanding to every other pattern
that you see so every time you see a
stop sign you know where to stop
regardless of which country which
neighborhood you're in it's all the same
and what that really comes down to is
that patterns are instant familiarity
the moment you see you recognize what
it's supposed to do what it's supposed
to mean and with an application there
are also a number of design patterns
right so this is website called UI
patterns calm and if you go there you
can look at a number of UI patterns that
you can apply to your application so
whether you're doing a navigation bar or
menu or a pop-up or cards or a date pick
or whatever it is there's a pattern out
there for you already so there's no need
to reinvent the wheel it's very seldom
that when we're building an application
we're really designing a completely new
never-seen-before UI components for 99%
of use cases it's already been done by
someone else and there's a design
pattern for it so I would encourage you
to go to this website and just take a
look at what patterns already exist if
you're looking to build something
there's probably something already out
there so in apex we have a number of
design patterns as well and here's just
a few of the most common one so here's
the list of its all of the design
patterns you can see navigation this is
a fairly common design pattern and you
see it all over the place in fact you
don't even have to think that the
hamburger icon the top left corner of
your screen
that's how you get to the menu it's so
obvious now everyone understands it
implicitly right the moment you see that
icon you click on it an issue with you
more options now you can argue one way
or the other whether this is a good
design pattern but quite a lot of places
are using this right so in apex and the
UI framework that we have called
Universal theme there's two patterns for
navigation on the left you'll see the
side navigation panel right so you click
on a button it expands out you'll see it
in the mobile form as well and we also
have tab navigation right navigation on
the top and this has been common for
quite a long time and that navigation
pattern is also instantly understood by
practically any users of using it here
is similar patterns again using Oracle
jet so if you're building a jet
application you have the same type of
patterns here when your screen is small
you can go to a left side navigation or
you can have like tabs in the top
navigation when you have something like
this completely understood try not to go
out of your way to design your own
navigation pattern people really
understand these patterns there's many
others out there these are not the only
two but you shouldn't need to reinvent
that part of the wheel Wizards I'll go
into Wizards a little more detail later
but this is a really good example of
Wizards I like because it shows you
exactly where you are so I'm on step 2
it shows me that I've finished step 1
because I see a nice green checkmark it
gives me some like affirmative
affirmative indication saying let's say
I've completed it nice green check
there's a next button which is hot right
it's highlighted in blue meaning this is
the default action this is where you
should click Next however mr. customer
if you really want to go back or you
want to cancel there are those actions
as well they're just in the bottom left
corner so they're further away from the
correct action which is the next button
and finally we also see the step 3 as
well so step 3 we're not there yet we're
on step 2
and this wizard just works everyone
understand this concept here's another
pattern these are like carousels we see
them all over the place here's like an
implementation of this and universal
theme and what's happening here is you
have a number of different panels of
information you want to show and you
want users to be able to navigate to
them maybe you have it on your home page
maybe you're showcasing some product or
feature whatever it is it'll just this
will just cycle through you have
indication at the very bottom saying how
many slides there are
you have annexed in previous button if
you use your keyboard arrows it will
also work so carousel is very common
pattern something else card right we see
cards like everywhere now if you have an
Android phone Google now is all about
cards when you open up your Google now
screen it's all like cards like what's
the weather like you know what's your
next appointment whatever it is
Pinterest is entirely based on this card
do I write it's like a water flow card
UI as you scroll down you see more and
more cards these are common and people
understand how to use them it's a small
block of information has varied
information might have an image might
have an icon some text whatever it is
bits a singular block and you can just
get through them so they just have the
design patterns you can apply to your
application let's look at visual
hierarchy now design is really just
communication except you're not talking
about it you're displaying something on
the screen right and the way you show
what's important on the screen is very
different than when you're talking if
I'm talking and I want to make a really
important point I might raise my voice
with the you or with the web design or
web application you can't really do that
right so you have other ways of showing
what's important here's some text from
this University website and it has you
know paragraphs and some phrases but
it's kind of hard to understand what it
is right you can look at it and in fact
you don't even want to read it because
it looks kind of boring it's just like
ah here's just some like black text on a
white background it doesn't look very
interesting here's the exact same text
with a little bit of style applied to it
right we just added some more
information to give it a visual
hierarchy
we've styled the headings correctly
we've added some spacing we added like a
number one number two icon and now it's
far easier to read now you can plant
this information you know oh this is
talking about what is this universal
theme it's key principles and they are
responsive design and versatile UI right
you can just read this you just skip
through the heading and if you find
something you're interested in you can
continue to read that
here's a good quote I like grouping
visually grouping similar visual
elements and organizing it into
meaningful patterns is inherent to our
human nature as eating or drinking we do
this all the time right every time you
see something you immediately group it
together you're not actively thinking
about doing this this is just how your
brain operates in this row of chairs
right here there are two green chairs I
see that as two green chairs not as oh
it's a black shirt a black chair a green
chair a green chair in a black chair
right you just see that group that's
just how we as humans think we can apply
the same type of pattern to our
applications and we can show what's most
important what actions to click on and
group them in such a way that it makes
sense so here's a fairly complex screen
in a web application and we're showing
some opportunity details here and we can
show we highlight what's most important
so on this screen for example the area
in green that's the title that's the
opportunity name so it's like the
biannual upgrade and then we have these
two action buttons the two primary
actions associated with this opportunity
you can either close it as you want it
or lost it or you can edit that
opportunity and edit it's hard because
it's the most common action you would
take and then you have all this
additional sub information about this
opportunity right just key key value
pairs right below the most important
piece of information and then here's
like a video how this page actually
works so as you scroll up and down
you'll notice that the sub attributes
hide below the primary piece of
information which is which opportunity
this is
and the primary actions are always
on-screen right so as you scroll up and
down you'll notice that the most
important piece of information is always
on-screen everything else will either
show or hide depending on how you're
scrolling
so there are a number of ways you can
add visual hierarchy to your page let's
go through a few of them really quickly
so the first one is color right when you
see this pattern you immediately pick
out the three circles which are in a
slightly different color and your some
of the projectors make a little bit
harder to see but it should be like a
brown color here's another one where I
made three of these circles a little bit
larger than the others right and
immediately you see those three circles
in fact you ignore the other ones you
just see the three you can also use
contrast right so same color different
contrast and now you immediately pick
out you know different circles based on
their contrast you can group things
together with the chairs example these
are grouped Taylor so these four blocks
are brown circles they were grouped
together you immediately see them as one
you don't see them it's four individual
circles I can you style a different
display of information or you can group
things similar together how many of you
have seen the Oscars
most recently remember that like the
whole mishap with the best film did you
guys see the actual envelope that was
hand out to the people that announce the
awards and this is what it looked like
okay so you tell me what that awards for
right so the category is Best Film and
you get this card the lady just read out
well end right what if we were to
redesign this so there's a really good
blog article on this where this guy and
analyzes this exact card and said if we
just apply some rules of visual
hierarchy we can have completely avoided
that entire blunder that happened at the
Oscars right now in this card the most
important piece of information is which
award is this card for and that
information is at the very bottom in a
very small font which says Best Actress
the most important you know positioned
information on this card right now is
the Oscar that's the number one thing so
you already at the Oscars and you see
the Oscars and at the very top and then
you see the actress name and the film
name and there
the exact same font size what if you
were to redesign it like this now it's
very clear right
what's this award for it's for Best
Actress this is the first thing I see
and then the actress name is actually in
a larger print so now best actress Emma
Stone from lala land at the very bottom
you have the Oscars text right so this
example of just changing some text sides
around to make a very big difference now
that you know the narrator had seen this
card they probably wouldn't have said
la-la-land
they probably would said hold on a
minute I have the wrong card this is the
card for best actors please give me the
card for best film visual hearts can
make a big difference but it's not just
about visual hierarchy not just about
applying some design patterns a lot of
our applications display data right so
how do we apply these same constructs to
displaying data in a meaningful way a
lot of our applications have tables
right we were displaying some
information usually a lot of columns in
a lot of roads how do we make this most
effective so here's an example of a very
common table and just some employees
their names your hire dates or salaries
and right now it doesn't look very good
right it's kind of hard to understand
it's kind of hard to read although it's
blown up sort of my little bit easier
does anyone know what the names are from
now
okay yes good good catch so I was here
and the first thing I did was I removed
this employee number a call that's not
even relevant like why do I care which
employee number unless it was some
system where that was critical
information the first thing you could do
it just remove the columns you are not
you don't need to see it all time right
guard of that column the second thing
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
align the columns correctly so here's
this data where all the headings are
centered and everything else is left
justified what if I just align the
columns a little bit right now it's hard
to make a little bit more sense I also
apply some format Maps so the hire date
before was this giant format with the
entire like you know timestamp and
everything now it's not I also had a
thousand separator to my salary column
so before after right mix it a little
bit easier to understand and now what if
I added some alternating rows and maybe
styled my headings a little bit
differently right it's quite a long way
from this to this now it's much easier
to understand my names are no longer
wrapping I know exactly who or like is I
know like I use like the Board of
Directors I know he's in management
I knew his hire - anyway salary
everything much easier to read compared
to what I got the first time around so
just applying some very really small
you know styled choices to your table
you can make it much easier to read and
finally I can arrange that differently
as well so now I'm sorting by salary I
have a little icon over there it's very
clear everyone understands that this is
oh I'm now sorting the salary you can
have a search bar and so on so here's an
example of a table that we have and this
package app called opportunity tracker
and the first problem I see is there's
way too many columns here right like I
don't need to see that many maybe I do
it for another context but in general I
don't so here's a simplified view of
that same exact data right now I
understand it a lot more it's easier to
comprehend
but it doesn't mean the tables are the
only way to display data we all have
smartphone apps most last time you use a
smartphone app that had a table right or
any consumer websites like when's the
last time you saw something that had
like a table right go to Facebook
there's no table is there you go to like
Google there's no tables there maybe
you're using spreadsheets then there's a
table there but that's a spreadsheet so
it's very different it's not very common
in consumer applications what if we
showed that same report in cards instead
right now we can show all super mation
this small block rather than a row that
you have to read across here's a picture
of Craigslist I was looking for a Mini
Cooper and this is the first list of
results that I got right everything's in
one line I don't see the picture of the
car I just see a lot of information I
could change my view to look a little
bit different right so now I see a
little thumbnail and I see information
in two lines so it's a little bit easier
to understand but this is the view that
I really want right I want to see the
car picture up front that's the most
important thing and then the attributes
below it and now I can see six cars at
once another way of showing the same
information right is this website called
cars.com and they're probably the
largest like website in the u.s. to buy
and sell used cars and this is how they
organized the situation so typically if
the tool that you have supports tables
then your application would look very
different than this you probably use a
table you probably a column for car make
car model mileage and so on right but if
you just present it a little bit
differently consume this information for
you the next point I want to make is
that there's something called the
picture superiority effect and this is a
fancy way of saying that humans respond
better to photos in terms of recognition
and recollection so we understand photos
or pictures better than we do words it
goes through a completely different
mechanism in our brain to understand
like to interpret something if you see a
photo it's a different part of the brain
than if we were to read text
so the way you do this is you use charts
and visualizations right here's a number
of options using Oracle Jett these are
just common charting components right
and different components are better for
different things but you have to use
charts a little bit wisely right it's
way better than just showing a report of
data obviously but the way you display
it also makes a big difference here's
you know some salary information for
some employees and right now if I asked
you hey who is like the third highest
paid employee it's kind of hard to find
out you really have to look at each of
them individually compare them like the
heights relatively rose to one another
and then say oh I think Jarrod's making
third amount of money right or you can
just sort your rows or sort your data
and now it's very clear like oh okay I
know exactly who's getting paid what I
know who's getting paid the most who's
getting paid least but now we have this
extra element of this color here why do
we even show this color is that even
important what if we didn't show it
right why what does that want to mention
doing so remove the color and now this
chart is easy as day we understand it
completely we notice is about salaries
and it's organized in a way that makes
them another example here's a pie chart
where it's showing some project
information and there's quite a few and
there's about like 15 or something like
that
and it's kind of hard to understand this
pie chart right the first one I
understand oh okay that's 34 percent of
the slice but the next one is 18 and so
on and I'm not really sure what the
other colors are like this dark blue
color over here like I have no idea what
that is right so I can look at the
legend and try to figure out what it it
so now I'm matching the color in my
legend to the slicing the pie but I
still don't know what percentages right
I just see that it's a small slice of
pie what if I use a bar chart to display
that exact same information right now
it's much easier to understand now I see
oh exactly which project costs what and
so on so as a best practice use pie
charts only when you have maybe three or
four pieces of information really five
maximum any more than that it's hard to
understand the relative size of the
slice or the wedge compared
the rest of it so using charts wisely
could help a lot and displaying data it
doesn't have to be all tabled the next
thing want to talk about is handling
user in so a lot of our applications we
take in user input right and we have a
lot of forms probably a lot of
spreadsheets or reports whatever it is
the first thing might be the hardest
thing to convince our customers up or
our clients up but it's to minimize user
input right the number one thing in
phones people hate to do is fill out
forms because there's always a ton of
fields and people just hate filling them
out especially on a small screen right
so this this is websites called Hotel
tonight or there's an app called hotel
tonight have you guys ever heard of this
app so it's an app you can look at
hotels in the city that you're in and
you can book it immediately so when you
first sign up they ask you for a credit
card information whatever it is but then
you just see the hotels you like and you
click on it you click on buy and that's
it you confirm and you that's it you get
the hotel every other hotel site and
that's on the desktop you go to the
website you sign up for an account maybe
you don't have sign up but you still
have to put in your name your address
your credit card information on how many
nights all this information and then you
click Next and you finally buy it right
so I think someone did a study and it
went from like 43 clicks to get a hotel
room at a normal hotel website to like
five taps on this hotel tonight
application so they're using form design
as a competitive advantage right they're
minimizing user input I think it's
pretty amazing that that's their key
thing like we're going to get your hotel
fast as anybody else and they're crazy a
success for it here is an application of
minimizing user input so I'm going to
build an application without doing it
by doing as little as possible so in
this new create application wizard the
first I'm going to do put in my
application name when you're working
that's right again
there we go so type in my application
name at a page I'm going to add a blank
page it's all good page name is within
for me everything else is checked
everything else is fine I have smart
defaults for everything I just click on
create application my application is
created I can run it that's it right I
all I did was type in page name added a
blank page from it's all I need to do
anything else everything was already
defaulted for me so minimize user inputs
default when you can I understand asking
a lot but a lot of our forms are fairly
complex you can't really do this but
even if you were to remove like five six
fields from your form it's going to make
your users lives a lot easier
the next thing is it might seem obvious
but the field order matters you want to
put things in a way that makes sense and
it should all point down to the next or
the add button or the admit box right
that way your eye just goes down down
down down down click a button marking
fields it's required is very important
I'm always surprised by how many
websites have failed to do that it's
hard to know when something is required
or not so the easiest way to do this the
most foolproof way in the entire world
is to just put a red asterisk next to
label right just put this red star and
it's gonna label everyone understand
that oh this field is required there's
other more clever ways of doing this but
at the very least marketing is required
and use a red dot you can also break up
long-form right so here's an example of
a form for your user profile and it has
a ton of field so when I see this or
when news user sees for the first time
it might feel intimidating it's like oh
great I got to fill out all this
information just to get a hotel room are
you kidding me
or I could break that same exact form up
into three chunks and now I don't see it
as one large form I see it as three
smaller forms so the cognitive load of
this page is far less but even better
what if I could use a wizard instead so
I just show them like three pieces of
information as one and
and it's like oh I is gonna fought these
three things I can click Next I'm done
so here's an example of creating a
project and P track where we use wizards
so try again ok so click on create
project type in a project name click
Next
everything else already defaulted for me
click Next select my project status
click Next
confirm everything click on create
project that's it so there are a ton of
fields on that page but everything is
already defaulted for me so all I have
to do is click click click Next I'm done
that's how you can use Wizards to
simplify overly complex flow and now
finally we should have graceful errors
right like don't bomb out your page in
case the user makes a mistake otherwise
you'll get you'll end up with behavior
like this so if you can't read in the
back the user encounters an error and
says the ID of the record does not match
the ID of the one on the server are you
do you really want to save it it could
create it could cause harm and corrupt
your data press ok all right that's what
happens we see these errors all the time
right like it's some complicated
developer friendly error but doesn't
mean anything to your end-users and they
get a choice of ok or cancel and ok
buttons usually hot so let's try to
avoid this one weekend so the last thing
I want to talk about is designed for
mobile right so why is user experience
so so irrelevant today right why is it
so important today now more than ever
before and it really comes down to
mobile right the use of mobile mobile is
kind of the catalyst for all of this
change because of these all these apps
that we have work Ahnold by this entire
industry it's forcing us to rethink
design patterns that we thought we
understood
so before the TV will sit around the
table and after the TV would probably
sit around around the TV and you know
converse over there and after we had our
PCs and laptops which kind of started to
do our own thing but we'd still be
sitting down someplace right like this
is how things were and then in the age
of mobile everyone just like walking
around and they're doing a hundred
things at once right you're not like at
this one stationary location anymore I
really like this graphic is from this
design and tech report and one of the
conclusions they made was we want to do
in our palm while walking what we used
to do on a big screen while sitting down
in a deck and this is true for
practically every industry mobile
attached right before you have to do
something on up
you know stationary on a laptop or a
desktop and now you just do that on the
go you're sending emails you're sending
money you're like a you know trading
stocks you can do anything any kind of
major transaction there is you can do
that on your mobile device not only that
but with mobile you can need to reach a
larger audience I really like this chart
it says you know it kind of compares
like that smartphone ownership by age
group over 2012 2015 so it doesn't have
the last two years but you can just see
the trends right so every single age
group from our youngest or elderly
they're all embracing smartphones right
and you might say da I already knew this
but saying this the numbers it's pretty
interesting because you see the growth
right every single year more and more
people have smartphone everything is
going on so that means we can reach a
infinitely larger audience and we could
with desktops right in fact in countries
like China in India the Internet is not
what we would think of as the Internet
we think I think of the Internet as like
a web browser right but for them it's
what's on your phone that's the internet
the web the laptop and web sites that's
some that's that is the Internet as well
but that's not my internet all my
internet is on mobile phone if it's on
there that's the Internet and that's
true for over two billion people their
first experience with the Internet was
on a mobile device
the next thing is well if that's the
case is the importance of laptops and
desktops kind of you know decreasing in
this chart it ask people what's your
most important device for connecting to
the internet again from 2013 to 2015 and
what you see here is smartphones and
tablets usage people consider them to be
their most important device to connect
the internet but laptops and desktops
are going down right and I think you can
probably say this to yourself as well
you're on the internet far more often on
the phone because you have it with you
every single place you are right whereas
a last five you have to take this like
massive machine with you connect to
Wi-Fi it's justit's a pain so before
while this was the most important device
for every age group it's all going down
it's like it's all really all about
smart phones and tablets and what this
means is that before right we would talk
about web 2.0 or responsive web design
right you don't talk about those terms
anymore
even today web design is responsive
design it was from the very beginning
responsive design is web design done
right so just like we no longer say hey
this is a brand new web 2.0 website
we're going to eventually come to a
point where we don't say this is
responsive that's just what's expected
of you because your website or your
application has to perform on these
number of these like a multi of
different platforms and screen sizes
right even with an Oracle there's a
number of applications that we use and a
lot of them are designed you know 10
years ago 15 years ago even and they
really only work on your desktop screens
and we're still using those apps today
so if you started to think about it as
you're building new applications now
imagine what your users will be using 10
years from now right it's very likely
the application do you build will still
be in use so as you start designing for
you know different devices they start
thinking responsively about your
application you could target the next 10
years where people probably won't even
use laptop who knows what's that happen
but at least you can future-proof your
application to some degree
another way to say this is you know
mobile accelerates technology adoption
right we're using more technology and
more of us are using marketing
technology it's not just a tiny people
it's everyone for example everyone uses
apps like uber to get a ride here's a
really funny tweet I saw online so in
1998 don't get into injures cars don't
meet people from the internet 2016
literally thumbing strangers from the
internet to get in their cars alright
and this is not just by the tech you
people it's by everyone so technology
really does in mobile it really does
accelerate adoption of Technology how
times change so to sum all of this up
right if we just apply these core
principles of following design pattern
and building a visual hierarchy to
showcase what's most important and
what's not to display data correctly in
a way that's efficient and not
overloading the user with more
information to simplify or reduce user
input using patterns that exist right
like wizards and so on and finally
designing for mobile we can really build
superior applications and by doing so
hopefully we can win the hearts and
minds of our users thank you I'm happy
to take questions but I think yeah sure
yeah really good attention to things you
didn't really cover whatsoever welcome
folks sure you assumed everybody has
good outside
and you say that in America so how do
you like something likely it's much more
interest given up for example wondering
for that whole hour marathon a fourth of
the babies every day that's correct
so while some of these examples may be
targeted - it's like a u.s. audience I
think the general principles could be
applied more globally so is there
something in particular that you notice
that you would not do in the UK if we
address in this country you can enter a
comment right so that's a very
interesting observation right so for
example some websites are now doing this
in the US where if you just put in your
street address and your zip code then
you could get the city information the
straight the tape information the
country information absolutely right
well and I think a lot of people are
going into that direction yeah that's a
hundred percent agree with you and I
think that will happen we will try to
minimize in fact we would use things
like geolocation on your phones like we
just ask you like hey where are you
looking look like ordering from does get
my information all good right okay I
mean obviously one of the things you
want with all websites any website your
country let me do that the rest of us
wait on the track the track
yeah that's right so for example I was
working on the Oracle store project
right and we're the first thing to do is
you have to select your country because
otherwise prices change the product
availability change everything changes
so the first thing I don't work on the
project anymore but now the moment you
go to the website which how to detect
where you are I believe but if you don't
the first thing you see on the top is
hey please select your country here and
then everything else proceeds right so
absolutely hundred percent agree with
you any other comments or questions ok
well thank you so much I think we're on
time as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
