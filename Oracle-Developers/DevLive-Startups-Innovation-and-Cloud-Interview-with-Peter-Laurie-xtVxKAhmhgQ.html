I'm your host Javed Mohammed here at
Auto Cocotte Sydney and I have as my
guest today the luminary keynote speaker
Peter Peter Lorre Peter welcome our job
thank you so much for coming and making
the time thank you for having me
so uh I'd actually sat in into your
keynote Elega I just found it
fascinating I love the world of
innovation startups and cloud and it
seems like you kind of touched upon all
of those things yeah so first of all
just about innovation
actually I had Alec Sadler from
auto-collapse on earlier also and I was
asking him just a question about
innovation everybody wants to innovate
right but not everyone gets to I think
you have you're an entrepreneur yup just
to share with us your worldview about
innovation okay so um I don't know it's
a very broad question it's a very broad
course but still just you know everyone
has a different ability talk about
active um so for me i'm innovation is a
really hard thing to define anybody who
says that they've got a good clean
definition for innovation is probably
reaching a bit for me I'm generally
chasing valuable hard problems there's
plenty of hard problems around but
there's not very many valuable hard
problems and to me an innovative
solution is a new solution to those
valuable hard problems we've got this
constant background of technology
changing as well a lot of opportunities
which is where the tech and the clouds
that comes in that really changes the
way things work so in that disruption
without bringing another buzz word in on
you but within that disruption there's a
lot of um a lot of things that change in
their value and suddenly someone can
come in and just say hey what if we did
it this way and from external that looks
quite innovative but I think it's just
literally coming at a problem in a new
way and then the sinister side of the
business as well that I mean people tend
to order 3 kilos of innovation and then
the consulting firms gladly give them 3
kilos of innovation back and then
there's a transaction that happens and
everybody looks at it and goes that
wasn't very innovative there's a lot of
that going on at the moment but I think
there's also a lot of opportunity being
realized at the moment as well I think
one of the takeaways I got from your
keynote
was your emphasis I think you touched
upon it this just now was the emphasis
on value creating value and you do an
interesting chart it's kinda hard to
visualize there's a tic-tac-toe about
value and the vertical scale and effort
on the horizontal scale on the x-axis
and you just kind of broke it down in
terms of I think the top right corner
was the easily easily thing that here
you put some you invest some money
here's some other wise so as you call
them did develop new things and you kind
of broke it down again again you want to
just kind of it's kind of hard to break
it down just because there were so many
different categories but you want to
just kind of encapsulate that talk today
so we are we do a 3x3 grid and we do
effort all on the bottom and value along
the top the vertical axis in the top
right hand corner there's the high value
high ethic project so now the ones the
businesses normally do so enterprises
run at those things and that they're
reasonably good at it you know like I
said in the keynote that they're
definitely finished I don't know if
they're complete and the normally
celebrated is a great success
independent of their whether they're
finished or not so they're normally done
and they come in from the administer and
people run at that and they spend a lot
of money on it like you said with the
ROI that there's you know they might
drop 300 million dollars into a core
system replacement and it's going to be
worth half a billion dollars to them so
they make money from a cost-saving
perspective on that
so those projects are always done and
then the other projects that are always
done are the ones that a lower effort
that is a high value median value a low
value and they get done because you
can't stop people like us doing it right
we're going to spend the extra few hours
would expend the weekend or sneak a
couple of hours every day and we're
going to do those things because those
developers will put a lot of effort into
being lazy so those ones get done and
then what actually misses out is the the
medium effort projects in the middle
they just don't get done because they
can't afford to be attempted because
they won't make it past a feasibility
study and what I use this device that
I'm the Jason Lowe and I came up with
when we're trying to work out how to
sell cloud properly and well we use this
device for us talk about those two
missing boxes that just are under
serviced at the moment and then we
present a way of maybe attacking those
with a lean software development process
okay so
okay well thanks kind of getting an
overview of that one well what I'm
thinking startups and I've been in a few
not me that you're famous yes so I'm
really glad to be at article um one of
the things that kind of has struck me is
again you know everybody up I wouldn't
say everybody but many people want to be
entrepreneurs people want to be
innovators but it seems like for a
start-up or for a company to be
successful it seems I literally the Sun
Moon and stars all of the lineup you
know the idea the management team the
execution the timing just being an
entrepreneur you you want to just talk
about that yeah absolutely Dominus
it really is about the right idea at the
right time with the right people and
that's a really tough thing to do it's
really hard to execute on so I'm the way
to do that is to not necessarily wait
for all those lows that although
celestial bodies to line up for
everything to line up it's to actually
be out there doing stuff so for me the
way I think about it is a dynamic
optimization problem so to tray my
engineering background and a bit of
machine learning stuff in that where we
need to be moves over time so even if we
could get there perfectly we can just
jump straight to where we we perfectly
execute a project to get to where we'd
like to be it may well be that by the
time we get there the perfect is moved
so what we need to do is be able to move
and also adjust where we're going to so
the way I talk about that is ready fire
aim as opposed to ready aim fire so it
means that you've got to adjust and move
so if something comes out and under that
or changes the landscape of what you're
trying to hit then it doesn't matter you
just move and do something else and if
you take a step back from that as a team
or as an individual that skillset is
valuable independent of which area
you're working in so I think of it as a
robust business or on a robust technique
but it's basically literally getting out
there and getting started and keeping it
on where you need to going to be and
then adjusting and getting there do you
have a real model entrepreneur someone
you look up to um it's a little bit
weird I really don't like I know some
people who get a little bit of a crush
on certain entrepreneurs and and the
most that I feel
is that that I feel a little bit
untested like I should be out there
doing it as well and that's probably the
motivation it's not a it's not a crush
on someone or anything like that yeah
it's a bit weird I don't ever feel like
I want to grow up to be that person but
I do feel a little bit inspired so that
you're nobody really across individual
do you do any do you do anything outside
of the software technical space thing I
don't know play music or sports or are
your artists do something that because
of what I'm thinking of Steve Jobs
talking about you know Apple being the
kind of this fusion or intersection
between science and art or engineer any
any thoughts about that um yes so for me
I find the actual the technical part of
it so the software development part I
refuse to get off the tools I love the
tools I love building things and it's
actually the creation part of it that I
enjoy out of it it's not as much the
technical part I mean I love the
technical part as well but I'll get a
fair bit of creativity out of that and
the other thing that I'm doing a lot
more of now is actually on the team
building part of it so I'm participating
in especially in the Brisbane startup
ecosystem but generally in the Australia
startup ecosystem and what I really
enjoy is building peers actually in the
in that ecosystem not building employees
or building anything like that the
building peers and I'm finding that
really rewarding at the moment which
means that we're releasing more and more
people into the ecosystem and we can
have more people to play with know so
many there's a business do a little bit
of a shadow for it called um startup
catalyst where we take 20 18 to 29 year
olds across the San Francisco and
Silicon Valley to blow their minds
generally technical people and we drop
them in the middle of places to
understand that the skill sets that we
have over here the technical training
the education system is right here is
world-class and we produce world-class
people so that's a really good example
of what I love doing
yeah you have any hobbies I've got a bit
of a TV addiction hello what is any
favorite programs I will just Game of
Thrones right here last night so that
was that was fantastic but um yeah I
just used that for distraction and I
find that it extremely distracting so
unfortunately for me I think I've got a
13 hour attention span not a 45 minute
one so one thing I want to kind of add
was just in your keynote you're one of
the few presenter in fact I don't
remember the last time I saw something
like that you actually had a PowerPoint
less if that is a word a presentation do
you I don't know yes actually I actually
drew it it's a Microsoft Surface we have
a Microsoft Surface but I have one
because it's absolutely the right tool
for the job I get up there I draw the
entire thing so for me I spent a lot of
time at the whiteboard and I found that
getting up and doing a PowerPoint took
away some of the presentation so I love
getting up there and drawing it it
allows me to adapt to the audience
really well and for the two weeks
leading up to a presentation it the best
thing ever because I don't need to do
slides however for the the hour or so
before the presentation it means I
haven't done slides so it turns it from
being a presentation you can practice
into performance art which today it was
quite lucky we didn't have any numbers
in it so I didn't have to do any Maps
right
it's definitely makes me think well it
was it was very successful at Yoga
somehow so thank you so much for coming
by everybody done a great work thank you
very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
