developer I work in the aerospace and
defense industry previously I was in the
military and when I got out I got into
construction and I've had a great time
of construction building things but it
wasn't the career for me I started
financially and I decided you know what

hadn't coded before nice how do I go try

coding in college ended up doing ok at

reached out they were able to help me
out well then continue on was able to
get a job and since then I've been able
to advance I'm really happy with what
