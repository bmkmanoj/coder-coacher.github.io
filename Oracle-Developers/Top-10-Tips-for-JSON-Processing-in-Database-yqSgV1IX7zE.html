10 do's and don'ts of Jason processing
in the database my name is beatta
hammerschmidt I work for the Oracle
Corporation I'm a developer for the
database product this talk was given
last week at the JavaOne conference in
San Francisco was very well attended
over 400 people and I was asked to
record it and to upload it somewhere so
that came so that people can watch it
again so what am I talking about I will
talk a bit about why you would want to
store Jason in a database and maybe why
not and what your storage opsin are I
give a little history lesson about
hierarchical data models take you on a
time travel and will then show how
today's relational database systems
which have support for Jason can provide
schema flexible features for your
application development for example I
will then give a demo on how we do this
in Oracle but most of what I say applies
to some extent also for other database
products so this talk summarizes the
experience we made using Jason but also
XML XML has been supported in the Oracle
database for over 10 years now Jason
also know for a couple of years so we've
had many customer interactions and here
we in this talk I tried to summarize
some of the experience those customers
made so the first question obviously is
why would you want a store Jason in a
database that's not very obvious just
because the data happens to be in JSON
format doesn't mean you have to store it
in the database it is still possible to
map it to relations and something we've
seen quite often is that if the data
comes as Jason for example from a public
web API or some micro service
communication and there's little control
over the schema let's say you consume it
from a third party and that third party
might add new fields or change the data
type of these fields then it's very hard
to map this to relational data so in
that case you might want to choose to
store this Jason another very typical
example is if Jason dominates the
application stacks to think of a
front-end in a browser which uses
JavaScript then a lot of business logic
is using
no js' on the server so in that case yes
you can map it to a relational data
model but it's somehow breaks the data
model off your entire stack so in that
case you may also want to just persist
the jason in a database retrieve it back
or filter it on certain properties
something we've seen with some large
customers is that they have an old where
a legacy relational application but they
want to have some degree of schema
flexibility which means they detect
overtime today and you need new fields
maybe by regulation or they have to
track more data and altering a table is
quite expensive you need a DBA to do
that and you may also have to make
changes to your mappers so in this case
people choose to add a column to their
relational table which stores the JSON
data this is the typical flex field case
in some cases the user knows the schema
but it may change but we've also had
customers who allow third party to
extend their data model and in that case
the fields would be unknown so there is
not even a possibility of coming up with
a relational schema for these fields
another example which is less common is
if if an application wants to consume
JSON data for example a game record or a
travel record and the cost of
reconstructing it would be too high so
let's say you have to pull data from 20
or 30 tables to generate the required
jason then you might as well store it as
jason and the database and pull it out
as as a set of bytes instead of
reconstructing it so how can we store
jason in the database so there are plain
key value stores which are used for very
fast retrieval they typically scale very
well but they have limited jason process
and meaning they may handle jason as an
import or export format or you can view
rate rows as Jason but they may not be
able to project values from inside the
Jason or they can't look inside the
Jason to apply a filter in or an index
then there are dedicated jason databases
where Jason is the data model
and they're obviously quite flexible if
it comes to to Jason capabilities so
they can query them they can index them
there's somewhat weaker on on joints and
other aspects which we gone to discover
a little later then relational databases
without any Jason support which force
you to shred these tables so I already
mentioned reconstruction cost is pretty
high but that approach is also not very
schema friendly and today relational
databases have added a lot of Jason
support examples would be my sequel or
Postgres or the Oracle database and in
this talk I gonna look into those
relational databases as well as the
dedicated JSON databases so let's look
at hierarchical data models and the
example I picked is something that
everyone understands very intuitively
which is a school or or a college where
you have a bunch of students and the
students go to a course and the course
is given by a teacher and generally a
student visits multiple courses and a
teacher can also give one or many
courses so in an anti-relationship model
this can be translated quite easy we
have an entity student this entity has a
bunch of attributes let's say an ID and
the first name and last name and a
couple more and we have the same for a
teacher let's say the teacher has an
employee number and a salary and bank
account and we have a course which has a
name and a start and an end date and
then we define these relationships
between these entities so a student
attends a course and a teacher teaches
the course and then we add cardinalities
to it so a student can attend mouth end
courses which means multiple courses and
a course is attended by multiple
students so we have an end to M
relationship here but here in our data
model we say that a course is taught by
one teacher but one teacher can can
teach multiple courses this is old old
stuff but it translates very well to the
relation of data models so we pick the
attributes from our student entity and
generate column names for those we do
the same with the teacher and the
courses but the one to end relationship
between course and teacher is reflected
by adding the employee number column to
the courses table which points to the
teacher table so now the n2m
relationship between students and
courses needs a mapping table where we
just have the student ID and the code ID
of the course and this is the relational
translation of this entity relationship
model here quite easy quite
straightforward old decades old but also
not very schema flexible so now how
could we do this in Jason so it looks
pretty easy we take our student entity
and that has all the attributes and we
just choose key names or field names in
our Jason and that offers the benefit
that if we have to add fields we can
just add them into the Jason so this is
all very straightforward but how would
we translate our school into Jason so we
don't have only a student but we have
multiple entities how do we translate
this into our Jason and luckily I don't
have to do that one company who has
dedicated Jason store did that they
wrote a paper you can look it up in the
Internet where they described a
migration from a relational database to
their Jason store and they came up with
this data model where you have records
off the form that they have first a
person and a person has and has a role
in this case the role a student I would
assume that another role is teacher they
have some information about that person
in this case the students name is Rick
matin and under the course or under the
student we have the course information
so of course here has a date range when
it starts and when it ends and it has a
title so in this case we modelled the
information that Rick Mayton attends the
course introduction to mathematics so
that also looks straightforward here but
if we look
a little longer at it we will detect
that there are some not-so-good
properties with this way of modeling the
data and one of them is that the data
has to be repeated so for every student
that takes introduction to mathematics
we have to repeat all the information
about the course
meaning not only the title but also the
start and the end date so that means
that if the dates shift let's say
mathematics has one additional week or
so then we have to update all the
occurrences we basically have to visit
every student see if if he or she
attends the introduction to mathematics
course and do an update now the problem
is that if you're Jason store is not
really transactional that you may end up
with inconsistency let's say you have
changed the first ten of your courses
but then something happened in the
database you didn't update the rest well
now for some students math ends early as
for others and you have an inconsistent
state in the database that might be good
for the students but not so good for the
application in general here then there
is some data anonyme UNAM anomaly stuff
and normally stuff so if you have the
course under a student the question is
how do you model a course which does not
have a student or a teacher yet let's
say we have a new course physics we
haven't found a teacher well it seems it
can't be that easily represented because
it's under a teacher and how do we query
this data so obviously it's quite easy
to pull out a student or a teacher by ID
maybe we can also pull out the courses
we could have an index on course ID
but how would we find all the teachers
of a student we would basically have to
pull out the student and get the courses
I would assume that this could also be
an array of courses and then we have to
visit every teacher and see if that
teacher happens to teach this course so
the query language might not allow such
a relic
of the easy queries so at this point we
would already have to have an and
someone code up such query and let's say
we wanted to extend our application and
say we allow students to attend a course
let's say through a website and we have
to model a maximum out of people that
can attend the course let's say
mathematics can be attended by 30 people
how do we find out if there is still
place in such a course that's rather
complex because the information about
how many people attends a course if that
has to occur in every course then we
basically have to update many
occurrences of the same data so this is
also an example of a rather simple
extension of the application that would
lead to quite complex changes in the
data model and if we look at all these
properties which are mentioned as
problems here then this is basically the
same set of problems that IBM IMS
suffered this was an a hierarchical data
model developed in 1966 to support the
Apollo program the moon rocket that they
built a Saturn 5 they had a bill of
material which was so big they needed
the database so they developed IMS so I
just took you on a 50 year time travel
unfortunately into the past so the big
question is is Jason just some glorified
IMS and this is how a data center could
have looked looked like back then but at
least IMS was transactional so it was to
some extent better it wasn't schema
flexible but it was transactional so now
what's the first lesson here if you
blindly use Jason then you're basically
in for a lot of pains so relational
forces you to design a schema first you
have to create a table before you can
insert data whereas this Jason seems to
suggest that you can just insert your
data first and you don't need a scape
you don't need a schema and I think this
is not true for the vast majority of
application that we've seen so unless
you have really a very very simple
application which
only needs a couple queries you really
need to plan upfront schema-less is an
allusion to a large extent and the guys
who wrote the paper about the migration
to this jason store actually admitted
this so they said that they only have
five queries and they're known and they
account for 85% of the queries so they
kind of say yeah this works but only for
very very simple applications and most
of the application i've seen have more
complex queries so now that brings us to
the json support in relational databases
and today most common databases have
added support for jason post grass my
sequel sequel server oracle database IBM
db2 and many of them have applied the
sequel 2016 standard which defines
sequel jason functions and the main
message is that the relational database
is able to store your json data
alongside with other columns so you're
not putting your relational databases in
a json mode or something like this no
instead you create your tables as
usually and you can pick some columns to
store jason so in this example here we
have column 3 which is a varchar data
type and we add a chicken strained and
we say please database make sure that
column 3 is jason and reject everything
that is not jason so this means that all
our relational features are still
available like we can do joins we have
transactions we can do view row level
locking and security just because it's
Jason it doesn't mean that we have to
change all of that so the question now
is like how do I store my Jason in a
relational database so one approach is
to basically just have a table with one
column and that is jason data we put the
jason in there and for every look F we
have to parse the jason skip the
unwanted fields obviously we can do some
indexing here for example d tree
functional indexes or another approach
is to say well i know that some columns
exists in all my fields for example we
know
student has an ID and we map those
through relational columns and we have
adjacent payload column we could have
other columns as well for example
metadata columns when this record was
created or updated or who did that and
in this example here you see that the
student ID is both in the relational
columns as well as in the JSON payload I
could have chosen to not have it in the
payload that would be fine this is what
we use for our simple Oracle document
access collections the soda collections
this is what I gonna demo in a few
minutes the other approach is to put
known fields or relational and extra
jason column for Flex fields so in this
case it's as we would design a
relational application but then we have
one extra column just for the new fields
that would occur and this can be done
for relational applications to basically
get some flexibility one question is
should I add the JSON as an additional
column or should I put it into a
separate table and perform a join and
the answer to that is if you mostly
access the relational fields then you
don't want to put the JSON into the same
row because you wouldn't need more or it
would less relational fields would fit
into the same block so if you query most
of the time on your relational fields
you want to pack as many of those into
one block otherwise your i/o will go up
so this would be an example for the
second case if you're mostly query
the first fields here and only rarely
the flex fields so these are basically
your options and there have some
performance benefits so typically when
we parse or when we process the JSON
it's getting parsed and we processes as
a stream of events so Oracle has some
optimizations here where we have an
in-memory format but typically we
typically the relational databases needs
its parsing and the datatypes have
different performance characteristics so
for short jasons you want to use a
format that is defined for short text
like varchar'
and since they typically perform better
than the ones for long text like lobs
are seal up and you may want to check if
your database also allows cashing off
these values which is not done by Oracle
by default for example so if you want to
enable lob caching generally it's better
if you have a large collection of small
data than a smaller collection with huge
data so try to keep your Jason's small
one example is for example if you use an
index what the index returns if you look
for a field is the row IDs so if that
row contains megabytes of data you will
still parse a higher cost to parse it
and typically you only get large JSON
data because there is a collection of
some values that get repeated let's say
a collection of line items or
collections of purchase orders so in
that case you may want to consider to
put these into a different table
generally it's good to avoid any sort of
conversion so make sure your database is
in Unicode character set and that you
Jason avoids escape sequences and if you
use lobs use the data centric API for
read and write so don't use set lob or
set blob and JDBC but you set string and
set bytes instead so whenever you use
partitioning or sharding it's those
values should reside in a relational
column and not they should not be pulled
out for you Jason the example is is
quite simple let's say you insert a new
record if you first have to parse it to
find word needs to go then you have to
store it somewhere it worse is if the
insert already has that information in a
relational column the database can
immediately direct this to the right
partition or to the right chart so
virtual columns allow you to simulate
somewhat a relational column but
typically they're not as performant they
may not be materialized virtual columns
but whenever you access them you have to
parse it to find the value so don't use
them for partitioning and shorting and
joins can be done both obviously on
relation columns but as well as on field
values inside the Jason
and to make the parsing fastest you want
to use the mostly XS Jason keys to the
beginning of the data so if if a filled
you frequently query or if you that you
frequently use for a joint if that is at
the end of your Jason text then you will
have two pars and skip all the previous
values that come before before you have
the value that is of interest then jason
has no date format so or time stand
format so we recommend to use ISO 8601
only that if you have dates or timestamp
in your data reason is if you use any
format that depends on the on the locale
of your server then you might end up
with date formats that can be
misunderstood so for example Europe
United States has a different order of
day and months so in order to avoid that
just use ISO 8601 as the one format and
it's basically a string inside the Jason
so now let's let's demo some of the
features I use the Oracle database to do
that and we've created an API which
makes it easier to insert and query JSON
over the Oracle database so a few
definitions here upfront so a collection
is a bag of documents and it's
identified by a name and internally it's
a just a system manage table then the
document inside a collection is one JSON
instance it's identified by a key and we
store metadata alongside with that JSON
data for example when it was created or
updated an e-tag and information like
this and the soda api is a sort of
veneer on the top of the Oracle database
to view the Oracle database as a
document store so it's easy to write
crud operations put gets delete without
writing any sequel you can then write a
query in in JSON as well so even for
some queries you don't need to write
sequel and the data is fully maintained
by the Oracle database so any sequel
access joins transactions are still
possible and right now we have drivers
for
forest Java PL sequel OCI and in the
future we will come up with support for
some more languages so in this demo I
will create a collection called students
through a rest call I will then create a
collection called
teachers through Java and I will create
a table called courses in sequel and
that has adjacent column and then I will
also create a plain relational table
without any jason and will show then how
some easy slash hard queries can be
written easy for a relational database
hard if you cannot do joins and I will
show how you can do
Jason generation from existing
collection data or from relational data
and also how you can make a
transactional change to multiple
collections using a single rest call ok
so in this demo I will show how we can
work with Jason in the Oracle database
and I start demoing how easy it is to
create a collection so this database is
rest and abled and I can make a rest
call using curl in this case it's a put
command to a given URL using the soda
layer which is here and at the end I put
this drink students which indicate the
name of the collection so now if I do a
get for example in the web browser I see
some JSON being returned but here inside
the collection the items is empty and
this is because the collection has no
content so now let's make another rest
call another post where I insert some
jason here this is one student so the
first name is beta the last name is
hammerschmidt and courses is an array
with c1 so I make this call and if I
reissue the get here then I see that
this jason has been inserted so
collection with just one document is a
bit trivial so I wrote a script here
let's let's run this and that inserts a
couple more students I think we have 30
or so now and you can see here in the
browser how easy it is to retrieve that
so under the cover that collection is
nothing more than a table in the Oracle
database so if I describe students I see
that there is a table and the column is
an ID created on last modified version
and there is a column called JSON
document it's data type is a blob and
this is where we store the jason so if i
want to select just this JSON document
value or this column then i see all the
jason's that are that have been inserted
using these rest calls so I can extract
fragments in here let's say I wanted to
select all the first names then I
basically go first to the JSON document
and then I do a dot first and I see all
the first names or if I wanted to select
the array of the courses then I would
put dot courses and I see all the array
values so this is data from inside the
Jason that I'm selecting so let's say
let's create the teacher's collection in
Java
so I wrote a little Java program here
and it's similarly easy to create this
collection our Java driver is on github
so it's an open source driver it comes
with this class called Oracle client
which you just instantiate then you give
that client a JDBC connection so you
start with a you set your JDBC
connection up as you would usually
and then you can create the collection
call teachers using database admin
create collection and that returns you
an Oracle collection called teachers and
you use that collection to insert these
documents here so we insert five or six
teachers so let's just run this this is
the Java how we run it just have to
change the folder here and then we run
the Java function to create the
collection so why would expect that now
we have similarly a table called
teachers let's just confirm this here
yes it has been created it has the very
same shape so we can also print our JSON
data inside let's say we were only
interested in the name so again I do a
dot name and I see the values from
inside the Jason so courses let's say
courses is not a collection so I won't
create the courses table through a rest
or a Java call but instead I create a
normal table here we just copy this over
so we have a courses table of course has
an ID which is a varchar 20 jason
document is a club and I add this Jason
check constraint here so that all I can
insert is Jason data so this would
prevent me from inserting anything that
is not Jason and let's insert these five
courses
let's just see what I selected select
star from courses I first have to
comment
courses and you see that we have courses
with a name like chemistry and the
course points to a teacher by using the
teacher ID and a course is held in a
room and the ID for a course course for
is stored relationally so it's not the
ID in this case it's not inside the
Jason like I did it with a collection
but it is stored outside as a plain
relational column so let me just copy
this so that we get proper printing here
in C plus now the one query I mentioned
would be hard on the dedicated jason
store is to find all the courses with a
teacher named because you have to do a
join and it's relatively easy here
so we basically select a teacher name
and course name from our from our of
both tables like the courses table and
the teachers table or teaches
collections and then we just do simple
join where the collection teacher ID is
basically the ID of the teacher
collection and if I run this I basically
get the name of the course together with
an with a clear name of the teacher well
you might say well this is now a
relational result I want to work with
Jason here oh it's real relatively easy
we just put some jason construction the
same query just with a JSON object on
top and i get the very same result
returned as jason objects
so now let's list all the courses that
the student take so remember in our
student collection the courses were an
array because student could take
multiple courses so again we select the
students first name the students last
name and the courses name we have to do
a join across all these collections or
tables so we go to the courses we go to
the students and then we iterate over
the courses inside the students so
student Jason documents give us the
Jason that represents a student then we
go to the courses field which is an
array and with this wildcard square
brackets star we select all the courses
we project this out as a course ID and
then do a join between the student
course ID and the course ID itself and
there's an order by not so important and
I get back that Tim ramon's it has
computer signs and math and so on so
again I could run the very same query as
Jason if I put a JSON object on top and
in this case we make an array of all the
teacher names so here the student tom
has those teachers and student steve has
these teachers so it's oh this in this
example actually it was a little more
complex query because i had not only to
join courses and students but also the
teachers i was interested in the teacher
name not in the course name another
simple example is that that could be
quite relevant for a real application
here is that you say well if the course
has too few students or too many
students we want to know about these
courses so we select the number of
students as an aggregate it's its
account then the course name and the
associated teacher name we join courses
students and teachers again we iterate
over the array and the students and we
group this by well first we join it that
a student course ID matches the course
ID and then that a teacher ID matches
the reference inside the course we group
this by course name and teacher name and
then we have account where there's less
than test a less or equal than ten
students or more than 25 students so we
basically run this and we see that in
math
we have too many students and in physics
we have not enough and well you see that
these queries grow in complexity so you
may not want to give all your developers
the task of designing such such queries
so let's say we just create this as a
view so a developer might not have to
use that entire query instead we create
a view and then just give the view to
the users so now we have abstracted this
query under a view and we can select
this and what I also did is I made the
JSON generation on top of it again so
now we see if we select from this view
we see number of students 26 course name
is math the teacher is Jasmine so we see
the same data is now returned as one
array and we can also just look into the
data let's say we were only interested
in the in the names of these courses
then we're not selecting the entire
jason but we say dot course name and we
see that math and physics have problems
so you can see that all the relational
mechanisms still apply like joins or
views and it's pretty easy to find the
data of interest and also to expose it
as jason data so now let's say in our
application we want to extend it we want
to have a weapon to face worst you can
log in and admit herself or himself to a
course so in order to do that we would
have to see if there is sufficient place
in the course let's say a course is held
in a room and the room has to be big
enough to accommodate all the students
and if there is enough space then the
course ID is added to the students array
of courses and some counter has to be
incremented so we make sure that we've
added one person to the room so let's
add room capacity table this is a table
which just has a room name and a
capacity
and this table has no Jason this is a
plain relational table so let's just
select a fit so that you can see it
select star from root capacity so yeah
you see there's no Jason in this but I
could very easily using a Jason
aggregate function exposed the very same
information as Jason so now we see that
in the room Goss there's 20 people and
Einstein there's 30 okay so now in our
let's select the courses let's take
another look at our courses Jason so you
see that the course has the room name
here career Darwin Einstein but we want
to add information how many students are
attending this course so we need to
update the course and we do this by
running a sub query which counts how
many students are already in that course
and the result of this count is stored
as student count so we add a field
called student count to our courses
using this update so let's just run this
we have updated five rows this was the
commit and now let's select from courses
again and we see that next to the room
we also have a student council chemistry
is given by teacher t3 we have to look
up the teacher table to find what the
real name is the chemistry course is
held in the room Curie and there are
currently 13 students in this course so
now if we want to add the student to the
course we have to do this in an atomic
manner so it's either we add the course
to the array and increment the student
count or we don't do it don't do
anything of these two steps so we need
to have transactionality here otherwise
and and you also have to basically do
this in a way that there is no problem
with concurrent access if this is the
web application multiple people could be
trying to attend a course at the same
time so if you look up and see oh there
is place in chemistry then you add
yourself but it can't be that in the
meantime someone else has added herself
as well then you would get
inconsistencies or too many people in
the course it would basically be entire
chaos so in order to make that
transactional change we use stored
procedures that it's another feature
that exists in many relational databases
and here we use a procedure it's called
add student to course and the input is a
student ID and a course ID and we return
a status which basically tells us if the
operation was successful or if not what
the cause was so first of all obviously
we have to check that both the course
and the student exists we do this by
selecting from our courses and students
and if the count is zero basically then
the student or the course does not exist
and we return now after this we know
that student and course exists and we
lock this one student and one course for
an update so this makes sure that nobody
else updates this one row while we're
updating it so this is what we do here
we select the JSON document into a local
variable from our students table and we
use the ID to basically just fetch this
one student and with a for update Clause
we say well nobody else should update it
before I'm done so now we have to check
if the student is already in this course
so we use this by and jason exists
clause where we look and into our
student jason and check if the courses
array already has an entry with this
with this course ID that is the case
well we don't have to add the student to
this course we error out and say the
student is already in the course now we
need to check if there is still place in
the room so we have to extract this
field student
which we've just added to the course
from our course Jason and we have to
select the room capacity and the room is
also extracted from the cursor from the
course Jason using this dollar that room
path expression so now if the room
capacity is smaller or equal than the
student count well then the course is
full we arrow out and only after all
these pre tests have succeeded we add
the courses we get the courses array and
we append the course to it so the
courses array originated from the
student we make an append and we write
it back we make an update and the same
stuff is done for the course we get the
student count and we increment it and
put it back and perform an update now
the status is success and we commit and
we're done so let's let's just let's
just register this procedure and let's
just run this here okay and since the
database is rest enabled I can now
invoke this from a rest call let's look
at it we're student nine so basically
our student nine attends the course two
and course five so now we want to add
the course to to the student also using
a rest called so this rest call at the
end we have the procedure name at
student two course and what would happen
is we get an error message the student
is already in the course yeah makes
sense because the C two was already here
but let's add the student now to course
three
it's it's an okay the status is success
if we do it again obviously we would
basically get the same error message
that it has been added and if we want to
add the same student to course number
one we would see that just copy this
here that this course is full exactly
how it's doing already in course anyway
so now if we select this here again then
we should hopefully see yes that person
has been added to c3 okay so that
concludes the demo so basically I've
shown you how easy it is to insert or to
create a collection slash table insert
data into it without even writing sequel
there's a lot more that soda can do this
is not really a soda demo but I've also
shown you how you how easy it is to do
joins just because you have Jason
doesn't mean you have to store
everything he normalized it makes still
sense to store different entities in
different collections and then to
perform joins you can't create views you
can't generate brand new Jason from your
existing Jason or from relational data
using the generation functions and with
store procedures you can also make
transactional changes across multiple
collection okay allow me quickly to
conclude this talk so in a relational
database
Jason can be stored alongside normal
columns just because as Jason does mean
that everything good that's out there
can't be reused so schema flexibility
can certainly be done by using Jason
so this empowers developers and somehow
DBAs don't have to be asked to add a new
column all the time
all the good alt relational stuff is too
good to be given up so there's still a
lot of benefits if you have used
transactions real level security and so
on and so on with a soda API you can get
somewhat a similar experience if you use
a no sequel database so you don't have
necessarily to write sequel for simple
puts and gets but you can still use
sequel for complex analytics and a lot
of stuff that you can do in the myth
here with store procedures could also be
done in the database so you have a
central place for business critical
logic this is one picture here how we'd
like to see the database obviously in
the center we have the soda API on the
left side for no sequel application
development where you exchange JSON with
the database but on the right side all
the sequel capabilities are still
possible for generation purposes or
analytical purposes so you can learn
about more about oracle Jason and soda
on OTN or we have some examples on
github there is also a blog that I write
and you can see my Twitter handle if you
