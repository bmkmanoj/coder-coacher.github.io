industrial automation security and in
general in a concepts around what
constitutes best practices in this
domain so a quick show of hands how many
of us here work on embedded security or
security in general on a day to day
basis awesome so the genesis of you know
this session was essentially my
conversations with Tim and I let him
introduce himself
he's from Rockwell Automation
essentially we had several conversations
about Industrial Security which is
becoming a concern which is growing and
I from Oracle perspective talk to
customers who are looking at solutions
strategies and best practices for
implementing embedded small footprint
security so essentially how we would do
this is Tim would now come and he would
give us sort of perspective on what is
security in terms of industrial
automation as a domain what he thinks
are some of the key concerns and areas
and then I would come and kind of give
you guys some best practices Nuggets
basically food for thought and
essentially leave you with that so
without much ado I like to call Tim
Burnett to start his session
good morning that's not okay you can
tell them that with Oracle t-shirt jeans
so anyway I'm a software architect with
a company called Rockwell Automation
and Rockwell is a manufacturer of
industrial automation and control
products so basically we help factories
become more efficient we have an awful
lot of embedded systems from tiny little
intelligence sensors up through large
multi core programmable logic
controllers and I'll talk a little bit
more about that as we go through the
presentation what I'd like to do in this
section
Ranveer's gonna talk about some
solutions and you know cookbook with
some recipes but I'm going to talk more
about challenges how things where we're
coming from an industrial automation and
factories in terms of security and where
I think we're headed to and some of the
challenges that we're running to into as
part of that transition so a little bit
about Rockwell Automation I doubt you've
heard of this company but they're
actually a pretty big operation
they've got 22,000 employees worldwide
revenues up around six billion dollars
based in Milwaukee really for the past
hundred and ten years so the company has
been around for a while it's a public
company now but we have customers all
around the world we're really strong in
North America with our products but
we're pretty big in Europe and really
making a big push in in Asia too so if
you think about our customers there's
lots of different customers that we
service and some of them are
pharmaceutical companies and some of
them are systems integrators that take
our products and our software and build
them into solutions for n companies but
those n companies wind up being the
automotive food and beverage pharma
increasingly material-handling think
about FedEx and UPS mining and oil and
gas so we're really in a lot of
different areas and we have our
catalogue of products is about that big
lots of components and relays and
switches and things too but probably
some of our biggest products we sell
motor drives which is the electronic
control circuitry for electric motors
and it's important
for a lot of applications to make that
efficient and to have very good motion
control over those motors so that's a
big business for us and of course our
hard core PLC's and industrial
controllers and increasingly quite a bit
of software so how many people have any
experience in your automation and here
anybody ok great ok so some of this
would be familiar to you guys but as you
probably know there are lots of
different kinds of production processes
there's the idea of a discrete process
control and you're thinking about the
factory assembly like it General Motors
or Chrysler and then there's batch more
in the food industry and even
pharmaceuticals you think of things like
brewing beer or even even wine in
certain batches and then there's
something a little bit different on the
spectrum it's more of a continuous
process and here you think about things
like a big giant metal line that heats
up and has to keep on running
continuously and if it doesn't there can
be serious problems so we service all of
those so we come really from primarily a
discrete background with Rockwell
Automation but these environments is you
might imagine are incredibly challenging
you think about a drilling platform out
in the ocean or even a fracking truck
we'll talk about some of these use cases
a little bit later but you know it's hot
it's cold it's it's wet these things get
washed down sometimes an acid and other
chemical washes
there's electromagnetic electromagnetic
interference to deal with anji shock so
so it's a tough environment for our
products and there's a lot of safety and
security concerns so how many people
heard of Stuxnet a couple years ago I
mean that was a pretty big deal you know
there was actually an air gap that
wasn't connected to any network and that
that virus came in on a USB device so
there's lots of concerns in this area in
manufacturing as you can imagine is
extremely competitive and everybody's
trying to you know increase their return
on investment downtime is not an option
the other thing about these systems is
they're incredibly long-lived we have
PLC controllers from the mid 80s that
are still
lines at general motors and they haven't
been touched
I mean basically they've been running
with very little human contact at all
for 15 20 25 years and that's not
uncommon so maintenance pairs support
all these things can be a real challenge
you know where do you even find those
components to support that device
anymore but people have a lot invested
in their assembly lines and in their
processes that use these devices when
you think about long live systems like
this you ask yourself you know where is
it if I have a Linux kernel or some
operating system where's that gonna be
in 10 or 15 or 20 years in terms of
support and patches I mean it's just
kind of mind-boggling
so these environments are different and
in some other ways too in terms of
networking and computers we have
historically had very limited
connectivity Ethernet is only recently
coming in to connect a lot of these
machines and Wireless is just beginning
to make inroads into the factory there
are unique and sometimes bizarre
protocols that we have to deal with
everything down to very lightweight
protocols for communicating with devices
up through a little higher level
fieldbus protocols and there's a lot of
different ones I mean there's some that
are popular in Europe's and they're
popular in the US and we have to deal
with these the devices are obviously
somewhat constrained you think about
some of these small intelligence sensors
have maybe a simple microcontroller and
not a lot of room to do things with so
security down to this level can be quite
challenging we'll talk about that in a
little bit and the other thing about
factories is traditionally there really
is no dedicated IT staff and they're
quite separated from the rest of the
enterprise that their corporation might
have so there's not a lot of support for
things when things go wrong in in the
factory environment the security onion
is a pretty general concept we're all
familiar with multiple barriers multiple
ways of dealing with security threats
the only reason I put this up is I want
to point out two things one is in
factories we're really heavy on these
devices on the actual device right and
since they're increasingly being
connected any device can compromise the
system so so this is something that's a
little bit different
about our environment the other thing is
that you see physical security
historically that's what folks have
relied on in factories was basically
they pulled the plug and it's not
connected to anything and it never is
going to be connected to anything it's
kind of the factory managers standpoint
that's proving increasingly unrealistic
today as folks want to gather more
information from the factory processes
and analyze and information but
historically that's where we've come
from some general key automation
concepts you may have heard of some of
these terms
SCADA stands for supervisory control and
data acquisition this is kind of the
core system in manufacturing control
basically it consists at the heart of
the system or the brain is a logic
controller that's programmable and
that's one of our flagship products and
then what controls the the what
interfaces to the controller is what we
call an HMI or a human machine interface
and this is typically a hardened panel
or a remote computer that's used to
monitor turn on and stop a restart the
process also it gives the human operator
alarm a notification of alarms and
events that are occurring in the system
so a lot of our systems and software
around this concept of SCADA and another
key concept is these programmable logic
controllers are programmable and we have
the tools that our customers use to
program those so it's important to
understand that we actually have kind of
a design time environment where we build
and construct the system in the logic
that runs the system and then there's
the runtime environment where we
actually deploy that logic and it runs
and it's fundamentally different so we
sell tools to program controllers so I
mentioned the historical assumptions
that you know disconnected was good
because it was secure and emphasis on
physical security and how that's really
changing so this is kind of
state-of-the-art for a large factory in
a corporation today and this is actually
we have partnership with Cisco and we
call this our reference architecture but
essentially while not disconnected it is
logically disconnected because there's
basically a DM
he's separating the enterprise or the
back-office from the factory the problem
with this is you know it's very
complicated the VPN has to be maintained
and again we don't have IT folks
typically in the factory supports have
to be open and closed people have coo
come and go have to be authorized and
there's to be an authentication system
for the whole thing so this is kind of
state-of-the-art but it's also very
labor intensive and challenging for a
lot of our customers to put in place so
there are lots of changes and it really
that the center concept is around
connectivity there's there's kind of an
explosion now that we can make a lot of
devices more intelligent we can put them
on the network and they can share
interesting information and they can
filter information for us so now our
PLC's are on Ethernet we've got smart
sensors both wired and wireless the
motors and drives and actuators are
really all communicating so this is kind
of changing the game for industrial
automation we're also seeing and I'll
share with you and a little bit one of
our customers who's working with the
clouds they're basically collecting
manufacturing information assembling in
a gateway and sending it up to a cloud
where they've got dashboards to track
the process and also the ability to do
analysis on time series data so
analytics and dashboards in the cloud
connected to factory data is a really
big trend that we see consequently there
is now the ability to do more in terms
of remote services and remote access and
management to a system so you don't have
to have control engineers on-site but
they can come in and examine the system
and debug it and run Diagnostics on it
from a remote location so that's another
level of connectivity and another
security concern for us in general the
other big trend we see is and this is
not just industrial automation but the
increasing shift from complexity and
hardware and Asics being moved over into
software and firmware and we see that in
really across our entire product line a
shift into software and it's kind of
tough for a company to understand where
their value proposition is as the
it occurs because we sell hardware and
we're in a hardware mentality and yet
most of our engineering effort today is
going into software systems so I'd like
to talk about this mg Brian cloud
computing application I'm going to show
you a short YouTube video in a moment
but let me just say a little bit about
what this is um mg Brian is a
manufacturer of giant frakking trucks
you've heard about fracking going on out
in the mid middle part of the country
and basically these trucks are are
dropped off and and they run and do the
fracking thing via remote control and so
what these guys do these trucks could be
a million dollars and there's a lot of
maintenance items involved in this so
what they wanted to do is have the
ability to collect data from the trucks
monitor their performance and see if
maintenance items were necessary and
schedule those and so what they did is
they came to us and we basically had the
control system they use in the fracking
truck and they said you know we want to
get this information so we created a
gateway product that basically tells you
the location of the truck and
communicates over a cellular network up
to a cloud database we're currently
hosted in Microsoft serger but we might
change that so anyway I want to share
this kind of story with you guys and I
think you'll find it interesting
M G Brian a leading manufacturer of
heavy equipment for the oil and gas
industry is using transformative
technology to dramatically change
business process and deliver value to
their customers
the last 25 years the industry has been
very stagnant in the way that it's been
continued to look at a moment that
continued to build
equipment the same way you know over and
over and so what we're trying to do is
be leaders and market innovators and in
the business and we
hi so basically we have a design time
environment that allows us to design
widgets and screens and faceplates and
this is the actual what we design 4mg
write and execute on a hardened panel
out in the field that's mounted on the
side of the truck so that's the notion
of an HMI or human machine interface
feel like that's what's gonna set us
apart the environments these trucks are
being put in or extremely difficult
harsh conditions you know 30 40 below
Fahrenheit to 120 degrees Fahrenheit so
you have a 1.1 million dollar piece of
equipment and air filters are $40 a
piece and there's four of them so $160
if they don't change those they suck the
so I'll let this cue up again and talk
over it so the gateway that we actually
mounted on the truck do is it does a
number of things that interfaces and
collects data from the motor drives to
understand if motors need maintenance
also from the programmable logic
controller for time series data and any
alarms or other maintenance items it
aggregates the data and then sends it up
and packet eise's it to the cloud where
it's organized and stored into a
relational database the sand and the
dirt and different components inside
that turbo so you can lose the turbo or
you can literally lose the whole engine
so if we can help them be preventive and
help them notify them ahead of time
what's happening we're not just reacting
that we're taking care of them through
the Microsoft Azure cloud remote data
collection and delivery of key
performance indicators to a variety of
mobile devices including Windows Phone 7
and Windows tablets potentially give
Angie Bryant's customers the ability to
monitor equipment from remote locations
oh there's a lot of limitations to the
legacy way of doing things from a
standpoint of going to
go to a data center and hosting
something behind a door somewhere from a
scalability standpoint if he's runnin
off with just five trucks and we went to
a thousand overnight well the the legacy
data center approach would not work for
us so we wanted to make sure that we
went with a system that would grow with
us expand with us and have basically it
worked the same way when it did with the
first five trucks as it will with the
next 10,000 trucks from the day they
actually drive off with a piece of
equipment off our lot and the time they
use in the field everything they do is
stored
okay well watch the wrap-up on this in
just a minute but so this system this
notion of having an architecture with
the Gateway pushing data up to the cloud
is actually something that's getting a
lot of traction with their other
customers we actually have five or six
new projects going on with a very
similar architecture and we're working
on some remote security hardening for
the device so I think this is this is
really a big deal although this might
not be surprising in other industries
for industrial automation and factories
this is a pretty big step forward to be
able to get this data off the lines and
analyze it with some some big iron so
this is a pretty big deal for us and the
cloud database the maintenance guy he
can see the health of his trucks the
operation guy knows his echo where
trucks are at and how they're running
the from a logistic standpoint do their
new parts so the guys ordering the parts
he makes sure that the parts are good
and up-to-date on these systems I mean
really just really giving them a tool to
properly manage their equipment within
the cloud of armor you're enabling all
the mobile devices like the iPhones and
the iPads of the world
so I mean that's huge by exploring ways
to harness cloud computing MG Brian
realizes that technology applied to a
mature market segment can help
differentiate the company we're able to
sell a better solution Turk
Merson and it's not just about building
better equipment but it's about being
able to help them globally manage your
equipment that's something that's no
one's been able to do before and that's
the benefit that we're gonna have and we
see the growth is tremendous
okay so I'll wrap up with just a few
other comments about what's going on as
I see it in the industry so as a result
to some of the changes that are going on
in our business some challenges are
being introduced we can't really rely
any longer on disconnected or physical
security that's just not an option
they're not going to be able to run
manufacturing sites like that anymore
so since things are much more highly
connected the whole issue of trust that
the device level is becoming a really
big deal and we're gonna have to figure
out how to solve this problem if we're
really going to secure down the
connected factories of the future so
we've got to you know have identity
identification authentication we have to
figure out how to do decent cryptography
on highly constrained devices so you
hear other people talking about
elliptical curve algorithms and some
things that might help a little bit in
this space traditional you know PKI
infrastructures are difficult in the
factory because things are often
intermittently disconnected and then
connected back even things like a
programmable logic controller might go
from online to offline and while it's
offline there still might be issues that
we have to address in terms of security
so a traditional PKI environment is not
really going to be a great solution for
us and the other one is just the fact
that we have all these different
industrial control protocols to deal
with that really have been designed over
the last 20 25 years without a
particular I to security because we
always had this disconnected assumption
that the factory was not subject to
being connected any other place so we've
got a bridge and address security
concerns for those protocols in terms of
building some products there are some
big challenges too I mean when you have
a product that's embedded anyway you
have this type of a challenge but when
you have a product that has a really
long life cycle and you've got your
intellectual property in it you don't
want that that intellectual property
compromised in the first year or two of
a 15 or 20 year lifecycle so that's a
pretty big deal for us and it's a big
deal for our customers because when they
design the latest and greatest machine
for that's automated making
for instance out in asia-pacific they do
a lot of OAM Assembly of things like
diaper machines and packaging machines
and they put a lot of intellectual
property and a lot of engineering
know-how into these machines and they
don't want them reversed engineered so
we have to address that and seal in the
intellectual property so from a software
standpoint we've looked at things like
code obfuscation and the truth is it can
slow reverse engineering but there's
lots of problems with it too typically
it'll introduce some performance issues
at run time and it really complicates
the heck out of debugging and even
looking at things like simple log files
and trying to figure out what's going on
the system so it's not really a silver
bullet the other challenge we have and a
lot of hardware vendors here are
probably talking about that this week is
hiding secrets throughout the entire
lifecycle so not just in the embedded
device itself but addressing the issue
of how do you handle secrets even in
development do you have some sort of a
cleanroom
that's secured were you putting these
keys and bending it into the software
and how are you managing that all the
way through the lifecycle and into
retirement so these are some of the
things we run into when we do our
product development some of the
challenges and I'll let Ranbeer take
over and talk more about some of the
ways to address some of these challenges
thanks Tim for excellent introduction so
essentially now that we understand some
of the challenges for the domain what I
would like to do is essentially give you
guys a flavor of what could be some of
those tools or best practices which we
can follow and essentially get to
security nirvana just try to flip the
presentations
okay
so obviously I'm Ranbir Mazumdar I work
for Oracle and I work primarily with
discrete manufacturing industrial
automation automotive so all this all
the guys who care about small devices
analytics and intelligence in these
devices and now more and more how to
make these devices and appliances
secured so this is a standard disclaimer
as we say every other slide in this deck
would change not this one so all it says
is this is just for research
don't make product decisions based on
this understand that these are
futuristic stuff so it's legal speak so
industrial recipes cookbook for embedded
geeks like you so why did we do recipes
so if you see this quote by Albert
Einstein put your hand on a hot stove
for a minute and it will seem like an
hour you're sitting with a pretty girl
for half an hour it just flies by it
seems like a minute so I am hoping this
is this presentation is the pretty girl
and not the hot stove for you guys so
this is what we will cover today you
know I want to introduce you to the
notion of data security we will talk
about some of the requirements for
embedded security and essentially what I
wanted to do was I didn't want to
introduce any product I didn't want to
keep this a marketing pitch I wanted to
build out a system almost like Lego
blocks which you can kind of put
together and essentially use them in
your architectures so we won't really
talk about any product or any any
product based solutions it's it's
technically in the sense we talk about a
crypto system cryptography we talk about
different strategies and essentially the
recipes are some of those strata
geez so what is data security in my
conversations with customers and
prospects and engineers we all talk
about essentially two aspects two
dimensions of data security
the first is data at rest another is
data at motion so whenever we talk about
a device whatever happens inside the
device the data residing is the data at
rest and any car conversation it has
with a back-end Channel it could be a
back-end server middleware cloud
what-have-you that's basically data in
motion and traditional view of
cryptography is the standard alice is
the sender Bob the receiver and Eve the
eavesdropper that is always the case
there are different attacks which are
simulated using these principles and lot
of people actually view data at rest
almost as an instance of data in motion
and if you see the famous introduction
to the cryptography book applied
cryptography almost views data at rest
as data in motion but it's like you
interacting with yourself in the near
future so it's pretty interesting what
are some of the requirements why do we
even need security we need security
because we need confidentiality so it
protects sensitive data from people who
should not have it integrity of the data
is essential because now you want
whatever was available to you not change
because of some sort of malicious hacker
or some sort of unintentional corruption
of that data and of course you want
authentication authorization Federation
and all those basic principles of
Identity Management to be available to
you and by the way this session
exclusively talks about embedded
security so most of the notions of
security authentication Federation PK I
almost fall apart when we talk about
really small sensors and that is one of
the reasons why we want
to do this session because it's it's
fascinating to understand how we almost
have to reinvent the wheel when it comes
to extremely constrained devices so
before I introduce you to a few other
slides which talk about the architecture
almost the flow I want to talk about
what is one of the key key ways of doing
an attack so if you see I talked about
the side channel attack so if
cryptography essentially is a
mathematical expression by which you
make it difficult for somebody to crack
into secrets and the essential idea is
if I have a way of creating ciphers
creating blocks which are difficult to
break through it will be difficult for
some somebody who wants to read into
your confidential data it will take a
lot more time effort CPU cycles so we
have to understand that no amount of
cryptography can make something
foolproof so given enough time and
resources every system can be cracked so
this is basically if we go back to the
next slide and I'll come back so if you
see a standard embedded device will go
from left to right starts at a silicon
level at a circuit level so you have
attacks like side-channel attacks which
basically use the CPU timing essentially
power monitoring you can actually now go
back to the previous slide and see an
example of basically decoding the RSA
key bits using power analysis so if you
see what these guys are doing the
hackers are doing is they are using the
peaks to represent the bits so they have
systems which basically plug into
embedded devices and based on harmonics
of that device they can actually figure
out what kind of data is basically
moving so you don't really have
to go through the brute-force ways of
cracking into the cryptography of the
device if you can compromise the device
using side-channel techniques so
something to keep in mind even though we
as application programmers Java C C++ we
are at a much higher level
there are ways or we should think about
securing infrastructures right from the
silicon micro architectures is is the
next step we have to think about new
arcs most of us who are computer science
guys you understand that it basically is
a way in which an instruction set is
implemented in a processor and there are
different ways you can do that there are
attacks which target microarchitectures
and B as Java programmers or as
application level programmers do not
really have a lot of control but
essentially when we are creating a
strategy or we are influencing an
embedded small constrained device
security strategy it is always good to
know that there are best practices
available from the device so this is
basically an exploded view of a device
so we start at the silicon we go to the
micro arc then we go to the sock which
is the system on chip so now you have
things like arm PowerPC core IQ free
scales these are essentially systems
baked into one silicon so you have Co
processors and various other things
essentially on one single chip that's
the next stage which you have to think
about these Co processors can be
compromised and there's this ton of
information available online as to how
you can actually mitigate those risks I
didn't want to go too much into the
details of that because you know that's
like a whole one-hour session in itself
but I wanted to give you an idea that
security is as strong as the weakest
link so if we move up we might have the
best crypto systems we might have the
best crypto algorithms but if we are
compromised at a silicon level at a
microarchitecture level everything falls
apart so essentially it's an onion and
we need to make sure that each and every
level is hardened for us to really clean
that the embedded device is bulletproof
so what I wanted to do was I want to I
want to create this Lego block an
essential building block of embedded
devices so if you see it's a very very
simplistic view of what an embedded
system does so you have the red which is
dead you know it's like mi4
the red is dead blue is glue I don't
know if anywhere you have seen that
movie Tom Cruise he climbs the Burj
Khalifa so anyways bad joke I guess so
so the untrusted world is all what you
see in red and the trusted world is all
in green now essential key difference
here is that solid green dot which is
essentially the root of trust so any
device requires that root of trust in
order to differentiate itself from the
untrusted world how do you do that you
introduce concepts of authentication
confidentiality data integrity and
non-repudiation non-repudiation
essentially is I send you some
information you need to know it was sent
by me and not Tim so basically how you
implement that is you sign using a
private key the digital certificate is
used for non-repudiation
which brings us back to cryptography so
I sign with my private key you open with
a public key and you know that because
the public private key was generated
using the same algorithm I am the guy
who I claim I am and I am sending you
information so these notions essentially
are encapsulated in the concept of a
circle of trust so you have a boundary
you create a boundary where you distrust
everything which doesn't have that
circle of trust now that we understand
this building block now how do we take
it further and use this small concept to
build out our system this is basically
what the circle of trust is now based on
our Lego blocks so if you see we are
using the same notion
Ready's
Green is good so now we are
superimposing that Lego block on our
first flow of the embedded device start
with silicon move up the architecture
ladder get on to algorithms and finally
the protocol layers so the key thing
here is when you are designing an
embedded device what you need to do is
neat you need to walk on the greens so
at every step if you have let's just be
start at the top we have a you have a
device you have an appliance the
server-side is fine but if that device
instead of communicating on an crypto
software which is trusted it
communicates with a non secured software
here dead because it's compromised so if
you if you slow down that's this whole
waterfall notion of Lego blocks for
building your security now that you have
a crypto software you need to be talking
to a secured Hardware on that let me use
these pointers so on this level if you
have the world's best cryptography
software implemented but you don't have
a secured Hardware somebody might be
using a side channel attack and getting
everything you have done so the idea is
to imagine a thing that security does
not stop at one silo even though we are
using technologies which seemed to be
bulletproof there might be a different
layer underneath which might be
compromised now when you have a secured
Hardware you have to realize that there
has to be a secured silicon somebody
might be compromising the instruction
sets on the silicon and essentially
taking whatever you guys are using
because at the end of the day it's the
zeros and ones which the chip or the
silicon is transferring which is all
what it is so if I can read those zeros
and ones I basically know your secret so
this introduces the notion and this can
be applied to various different domains
devices we all talk about a whole stack
you have the hardware you have
the artists you have the jvm or some
sort of intermediate glue layer and then
you have domain-specific applications
and then you have your you know protocol
stuff so in any scenario you have to
make sure that all of these are secured
and Beyond for you to really have a
secured system so this brings me the
first recipe so recipes that essentially
thought foods for thought it's not
really a recipe as in it's a complete
solution it's something which lets you
think about security
so first is partition your security
so partitioning means and this is a code
by one of the great embedded software
security guys talks about fault
containment a partition system should be
able to contain your fault so everybody
can be compromised your data can be
compromised the next step is how do you
contain that how do you make sure that
that malicious software does not
propagate across your software silos
different you different concepts of
partitioning if you see people talk
about memory and processor time
partitioning MMU units basically are a
true representation of physical
partitioning you basically create
special Hardware which ensures that
unauthorized memory access or CPU access
does not happen logical partitioning is
the software side of the story
so what you can do is you can
essentially create an infrastructure and
architecture which introduces redundancy
and introduces silos of security so that
at every step you need to authenticate
authorize the data carrier and basically
establish trust so what I'm trying to
say is look at your architecture split
it into different partitions and analyze
reanalyze to make sure that the handoff
is secured
this is an eye chart but essentially
this is what Oracle proposes as the IOT
framework it's kind of different from
what you will see in a typical keynote
but on the Left I'll help you on the
left I'll help you understand this if
you see these are devices which could be
medical devices which could be sensors
it could be CNC machines lead machines
these could be factory floor nodes which
are generating content now you have
these little dots which basically could
be sensing devices this could be
transducers essentially could be bits
and bytes now you have gateways which
are like concentrators so if you see I
have a silo of a node then I have a
shallow silo of a gateway now the
Gateway could be a smart meter so you
have a neighborhood which has every home
which has a smart meter all that
information is aggregated now upstream
there is a concentrator which act which
understands what is coming in and then
hands it off to the next level which is
basically the cloud it could be a
back-end and essentially what this
diagram represents is there are so many
levels of indirection in between this is
this is where the middleware starts this
is where the big Oracle or your big big
back-end systems come in this is your
cloud and if you have if you see you
have various different systems here
which are eligible for their own
security paradigms so you can have an
event processing engine which still
adheres to sam'l tokens authentication
authorizations
so basically you start with devices
which are extremely constrained and you
have strategies to implement security in
them and then as you flow through this
diagram you have different levels of
security so the idea is if if somebody
hacks into your device he shouldn't be
able to get to your back-end he
shouldn't be able to get to the cloud
now that we talked about multi-tenancy
as in somebody is now
storing yours as well as some your
competitors data on the same server it
makes it a imperative that security is
basically implemented in an onion
fashion what he mentioned so you have a
physical separation you have you utilize
as many of these counts or constructs as
you can to make sure that somebody does
not start from the device and has an
easy flow into your back-end so
partitioning real-world examples of
partitioning on a processor level arm
introduces trust zones trust zones
essentially at a very high level is the
same concept what I introduced as my
Lego block you have a notion of a
trusted world and a not non trusted
world and whatever needs to be executed
in a trusted environment is handed off
by the system or the manager with a
trusted zone it executes it and sends
you back results so imagine a situation
where on an embedded device you want to
make sure that the browser is secured so
one way of doing that is essentially
take the instruction sets which the
browser would run to go to a website do
its stuff have that run on a trusted
zone so what can happen is now somebody
would not be able to go open a Java
applet a compromised Java website which
has probably a malicious applet and
download that on your system because you
have already locked that down because
you know that 99% of the malicious code
which was injected was using applets on
compromised VMs in browsers so
essentially gives you a notion and if
you have stuff which needs performance
optimized performance you can still run
them on non trusted areas provided you
know the risk mitigation you know the
risk involved in that so that's a
trade-off free scale has core IQ
multi-core socks which have a notion of
what they called robust partitioning so
I would
encourage you guys these slides would be
available later so download these and
you can get a lot of information online
I don't have enough time to really go
into these but what I wanted to do was
kind of give you guys these nuggets
these ideas to go explore so explore
partitioning so the second recipe is
what we call a separation kernel now
traditionally a separation kernel was
almost limited to a hardware ecosystem
what it does is it creates a black box
and there is a notion of a sender and a
receiver or a caller or a colleague so I
call this black box and I say hey give
me a and the black box gives me a but
the black box in inter in turn has a
system built which basically lets it
decide if it needs to be sent to a
secured zone if it needs to be encrypted
if it needs so essentially my request
spawns spins off a series of events
internally which is completely
abstracted from the sender so as a
person who is creating embedded security
creating devices and appliances creating
a separation kernel is an excellent
strategy to create software separation
device separation and some of these
notions so what a separation kernel does
is it divides all resources under its
control into blocks such that an active
entity or subject or collie in one block
is completely isolated from an active
entity in different block and Java does
this I will show you how so the idea is
create a conceptual model of separation
which basically isolates subjects in
different blocks so you can have shared
resources you can have concepts of
read-only stuff so if I have JVM which
is an excellent
example of a separation colonel it runs
its own security manager it has its own
memory manager it has almost a secured
silo and using specific technologies you
can actually implement separation
kernels so you have jsr 1:21 Java
isolates what is an isolate isolate
basically is a separate logical VM you
have multiple threads which can talk to
each other they have their own statics
and heap space so you don't share heaps
you you basically have read-only access
to byte codes executables different
class libraries so don't don't have the
problem of overwriting you can't
override those and by the way all of
these are in what we call aggregates an
aggregate is basically a superset of an
isolate and there is lot of information
available guys online so the idea is
partitioning creating ways in which you
can have isolates and you can have
logical blocks which still work as
blackbox internally because if I send
request to an aggregate which is having
one or more isolates running in them I
would not aren't know or the system
would basically abstract the all the
under-the-hood interactions from me for
me if I call a class if I say class foo
add int add a B in return C and I pass
one and two it will give me three but
internally you could basically split the
ideas into multiple isolates create that
logical and almost a physical separation
so that now you have tools to achieve
this so this is basically isolates so it
creates it basically is a way of
creating overlap preventing overlaps of
shared resources each isolate is
illogical VM and we have parasha
isolate security managers so last I
checked they are going to implement this
for Java ME embedded as well as Java SC
and I don't have the trying timeframes
but an isolate is an excellent example
of separation kernel moving on Tim kind
of alluded to this plan security in your
software development lifecycle most of
us don't most of us already have code
which is implemented and deployed and
now we are trying to figure out how to
make that secured I speak to a lot of
people who are who Duke architectural
reviews framework reviews and it's
mind-boggling to know or understand that
a majority of people do not have abused
use cases when they're actually doing
requirements and design that is critical
because if we do not anticipate these
malicious attacks the ways these happen
and the way the implementation has to
take care of things we would never be
able to solve these there will always be
a zero day waiting to happen
so basically simple concepts test cases
planning work with your keyway work with
guys who do these tests right these
tests and educate them about a whole
host of separate test Suites available
or custom test Suites which they can run
on your code to make sure they basically
take care of all these malicious use
cases penetration testing there are
companies now who almost are they
actually hire crackers to break into
their system and that's a part of the
SDLC they pay guys
tons of money I mean Facebook does that
Facebook basically pays W 20,000 bucks
if you're able to come up with a bug so
essentially that's that's basically the
way to go go out and get guys who really
know what they are doing and ask them to
break your system if you are interested
in that as a developer do that because
you know there are these tons of these
online security companies which actually
have cracking competitions they
basically have cryptography puzzles so
all you have to do is go immunity Inc is
one of them there's a bunch of others
who actually post you know cryptography
based puzzles and projects it's a good
way for developers to understand and get
their feet wet in these areas where you
you are essentially seeing a lot of
things happening I didn't really want
this to be a cryptography crypto system
kind of a session but you know just to
kind of go over the basics for some of
us who probably have not had a chance to
work it basically is symmetric or
asymmetric PKI is an asymmetric
cryptography example you have a notion
of a public private key public key
algorithms are usually very much in
vogue and you know they all the
encryption systems like RSA el-gamal all
of these use public key encryption x'
digital signatures and certificates I
spoke about you sign with a private key
open with a public key essential for use
cases like non-repudiation which brings
me to my fourth recipe understand and
embrace the right crypto system crypto
system Tim mentioned ECC elliptic curve
cryptography
there are different all it's it's not
one-size-fits-all ECC has tons of data
which proves that it is an excellent
alternative approach to PKI smaller key
sizes computational efficiencies and
providing the same levels of security as
other options diffie-hellman RSA there
are a lot this lot of information online
which talks about ECC and essentially
the reason why we need to understand
this is because on small embedded
devices sensors the regular notion of
cryptography and M and enterprise
security falls apart understand that
embedded security is like quantum
mechanics what we understand in pure
physics does not apply in quantum
mechanics in the same way if you wanted
to do you wanted to exchange sam'l
tokens for device Federation's if you
wanted to use the same sam'l tokens
which are available now as Enterprise
solutions you'll have you'll be
pleasantly surprised that these are
extremely heavyweight objects and they
don't work on extremely small
constrained devices so the need is
almost to go out and recreate notions of
Federation device authentication using
strategies which were available for us
in the enterprise space might not always
help you that's a critical thing to
understand power ratings of encrypt
small embedded devices is critical I was
at a sensors show about three week about
a month back or more maybe and they were
showing these little sensors almost like
a quarter and these had their own
batteries they were out in the wild and
they were being charged by the flutter
of the wind so they were out in the wind
and they were fluttering and that
piezoelectric sensor basically recharges
itself using the power of wind and and
basically the mechanics which generates
that potential energy so the kinetic
energy converted into a potential energy
gets stored in piezoelectric sensors
charges the sensor so if you are now
trying to implement a security mechanism
for that kind of a sensor you better be
able to create notions of security which
are different from a typical PKI
infrastructure because creating a PKI
infrastructure requires you to work with
objects which are really heavyweight so
you have to have a notion of a key store
you have to have the key stores located
somewhere have to have a trusted
conversation with the key store get the
digital certificates get the public
private keys and this is not easy guys
on these small sensors key generation is
really expensive but there are embedded
devices on the other end of the spectrum
which almost have you I mean our
hardware as good as servers now they
have like multiple gigs of memory so
obviously those lend themselves very
nicely to you know java-based jazz jce
those kind of enterprise infrastructures
and I think that's that's more more or
less aid so I have a list of references
I have essentially the ones which really
help me build this slide deck lot of
good information out there guys I just
wanted to give you these nuggets to kind
of set you guys thinking about embedded
systems about embedded cryptography and
and essentially give you that platform
to now start thinking about embedded
systems not as a monolithic unit as
something which you have to peel the
layers and basically can keep making
them secured
thank you so we'll take some questions
if you guys have any yes
yes I'll try and paraphrase quickly just
you know in your factory business
Microsoft technologies dominated do we
see change in that I think absolutely if
you look at some of the standards like
OPC UA is now platform-independent
whereas the old OPC was based on comm D
comm tied tightly to Microsoft platforms
I really think there is a trend and
there's a huge demand to get on other
hardware's and places where Microsoft
really just isn't the right solution so
I'd say yes I see a big change there
anything else going one going to done
