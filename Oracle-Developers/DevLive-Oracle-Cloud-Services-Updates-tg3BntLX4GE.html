I'm here with Gerald Menzel how's it
going Joe very good Laura thanks how are
you good
it's a good show so far oh it's great
about 300 people here yeah with good
vibe in Belgium were actually it was
nice and sunny the last week understood
and we started Oracle code and started
to rain this morning but but people
showed up we have a cute vibe here
people are very engaged yeah you go to
learn oh the the talk around the
conference is all about micro services
isn't it yes I mean not only but you
know it's always with Oracle code we
cover the latest trends so I guess
services containers DevOps
open source frameworks languages
databases AI chat pods you name it right
ahead of the latest trends out there
that we cover here and we have great
speakers today as well as the sessions
are really really diverse talking about
everything and people can take a lot
home learn a lot from the sessions from
the speakers and also from their peers
that are here and when their networking
just as they do right now you know I
always thought that chat bots were just
kind of like toys but there's a lot of
data that gets generated by those chats
yeah absolutely and I think you know the
trend is know that people have too many
apps on their phone right I mean I have
too many apps on their phone they're
just saying if there's an app for
everything yes there is right and by now
it's too many apps for everything so
chef Wharton and the whole machine
learning in a computer science get a lot
more advanced I mean some of the
techniques go back very very far into
the 80s even right or 90s but the
technology the the hardware power and so
forth is very much advanced and now
being able to actually predict human
interaction rates with computers is very
exciting and I think that's really the
exciting piece about the chat pod it's
not so much what the chat box ends back
but it's actually being able to predict
what of this user this human being want
was this he or she after and how can we
engage in a way that
feels natural and exciting to the
end-user this morning in the keynote
Ames was presenting about what it's an
exciting time to be a developer right
tell me why do you think this is an
exciting time to be a developer I think
because the the direction has turned
around for a lot of years years maybe a
decade it was all about operations you
know how can we after most efficient
topics and so forth and you know make
sure that our IT systems are running and
then the the merger of smartphone of
cheap commodity hardware and so forth
there's a doesn't that I could list
right now allow for people to innovate
and I think the one big change is that
people can innovate on quite beefy
hardware for very little money so you
know like a person like me sitting on my
living room if I wouldn't be playing
PlayStation all day it could actually go
out there and write essentially maybe
not me somebody else probably the next
generation whatever it may be right
whatever we see it throughout throughout
the world whether that's new mobile apps
writers that are really trending that
picked up that got people to become
billionaires or whatever or big big
corporations whether everybody knows the
stories of Facebook of Airbnb of Buber
etc right where you're essentially
especially the last year right where you
just start with a mobile app and and you
literally change the way hell things are
done on the planet it's really true I
mean there are many examples of Anjani
so let's talk a couple of minutes about
we're going to check the list off here
okay ready okay we couple yeah yeah this
is our star speed round okay ready
worker great acquisition yeah an extra
just from the neighbor country right at
Allen's company yeah yeah come here
maybe country all right so let's talk
about API omnipresent ever since but
luckily a lot of people now focus much
more on api's again right so API
application programming interfaces of
the effort
time the focus has been little chaotic
in the past perhaps a lot of trends a
lot of technologies emerge around it
making it easy now we I think we are
right in the right direction of you know
API first making sure that what you do
there is make sense to other people that
you can use it and so forth we add the
other acquisition area coming along as
well earlier this year where it's all
approach of you know you write your API
while documenting so that you make it
actually reusable great technology right
company yeah yeah exactly right the
documentation is something that
developers never ever liked in the past
yeah it takes time away from actually
coding if you make documentation part of
your coding so they think
yeah games ok
github github lots of things to say
about github I think the most the most
proud of is that or at all not only as a
present now and get up what are we
actually pushing more more open source
projects to github I'm personally
involved to see the dockable thoughts
that we have up there it's one of our
most popular projects up there but there
is we have to know chase driver after we
have just yet again I think three
projects went live on github it's now
getting in the stage where I cannot
excuse me I cannot get or keep up
anymore with what's actually being
launched there so that that excites me a
lot obviously we also saw in the keynote
today where you have get up integration
with the technologies that we have what
are the some of the cloud services or a
prairie as we talked before and so forth
yeah center center part of every
developer think of a lot of developers
even if it's not get up per se but at
least some git or some sort of kids of
version control system that's great to
see that integration okay
and our final final item in the
lightning round
we Alan Ladd rid yes I know
so many nice cool I mean to be all evil
juventus was a really nice really ideal
a brilliant go but you know I mean I got
seeing the signature one from their
distance unbelievable and then you know
Ronald
again and yeah he was just right there
right at the spot and of course the
fourth one was just kind of the tip of
the iceberg for the icing on the cake or
as you all right
so yeah whatever we give you another one
very disappointed by the record that was
certainly completely unjustified but oh
hey it's football American football
right that's right it happened we only
have two times 90 minute two times for
45 minutes right that's right that's
right
well thank you very much it was great
getting together with you as usual I
think this is like our fourth interview
I believe so yeah so certainly we won't
do them Sydney because I got our you
know come hey are you coming to Seoul no
I can't come to Seoul but I'm going to
Mexico City well I won't be down sorry
but anyway we have a couple of more
cities to go so eight around the globe
check it out developer or to come slash
coat if you happen to be in the region
or you have friends in the region you
know make them to sign up it's a free
one day event it has been great so far
really blew us all out of expectations
great great serious we really really
delighted and thanks for joining in
online all right thanks gerald we'll
