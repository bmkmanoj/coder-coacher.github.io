manager with the digital experience team
at Rp and with me I have Naveen
technical staff working with the content
and experience cloud team so what we'll
do now is that we will go through some
of the some of the aspects about how to
teach about we you must have attended a
lot of sessions in fact the keynote also
talked about BOTS and how wonderful they
are in terms of taking some of the
manual or mundane work out of customer
experience so we will talk about how to
even enable that alright because finally
it's all magic that you know you ask a
question to abort it gives you an answer
but the answer finally has to come from
a content management system that's what
we'll talk about today instead of see
this couple of times now this is to say
that yeah whatever I say here you can't
hold me against you can't hold it
against me this is what we'll be doing
I'll be quickly giving you an
introduction to content and experience
cloud service how many of you have heard
of this CEC as it's also known as about
web Center have you worked on that
center here no pude in middle you have
worked on Fusion Middleware good so I'll
talk about that and then I'll talk about
the business scenario on why API first
approach is required and how does CC
give you that power of multi-channel
delivery third thing is that Naveen will
show us a demo during the demo will show
you how
all these fine Kashmir somewhere comes
together
the ability not only to manage content
but also throw it on a website
so you can create a website you can
ensure that all of that shows up in one
place it is very contextual you can
build all those websites visually
necessarily meaning that you can drag
and drop you can create all those
components as developers you can create
all those interactive components
drag-and-drop one so that you make it
really simple to assemble really quickly
a website and then you can always heat
rate or web sites you can create
versions of websites you can create
updates so that whatever changes that
you're making the website is not
immediately displayed to the public you
can always create one version for
yourself keep working on that and then
once you are ready you can publish that
it is similar to the way you work on
core don't you where you have a branch
for yourself or a version for yourself
and then when you are ready you come
into to the back in the source control
repository and finally we also provide
like I said a whole bunch of api's which
necessarily means that you can build
whole lot of back-end applications that
integrate within content and experience
cloud for example we have partners
Oracle partners who have built the
ability for you to pick a document which
is in the document repository and then
send it across lawyers have them
digitally sign it and bring it back into
the system right how does this process
work typically here you really have to
take a printout of your document you
have to dispatch it or snail mail get it
back have them sign it get it back and
then put it somewhere in some safe
location that's all not required
of course it's required if the country
is law says so but we also have API
first approach where you can do all of
this online alright so what does it mean
when you build a content management
system how many of you are familiar with
the term resource bundle that is one
list where you put all your the strings
all of that so that
can do a translation right all right
good now did you know that most of the
websites out there large websites pick
up strings from resource model in a way
right I'm not it's not a resource bundle
but it picks content from a web content
management but the idea is that every
string that you see on the UI on the
website is coming from a web content
management it's not that somebody types
it out right there for you to see but it
comes from a content management system
the reason is very simple now if you
have to translate this website into some
other language than English right how do
you do that you don't start messing
around with the presentation layer you
go back to your content management
system and you kind of translate those
strings so that you know depending on
the browser preference you get to see
the website in that language right I'm
talking about one such scenario where
this fictitious company called assurance
it's supposed to be an insurance company
B stands for Bengaluru okay I'm from
Bangalore oh it's Tim - insurance
company we say insurance business suit
does travel insurance home insurance
health insurance and I also discovered
that there's pet insurance why not and
there is also insurance for bird hits
that aircrafts suffer alright okay so
know we have a insurance product all
right how do you kind of model this
insurance product remember this is a
scenario I'm talking about so that you
get an idea of what information
architecture is information architecture
is very similar to the way you model
classes in your daily life right how do
you model classes you have an interface
then you have abstract class which kind
of represents a whole swath of classes
right and then you have specialized
classes where it kind of inherits all
the attributes and blahblah of its
parents right so this is typical in from
class diagram that you do information
architecture is very similar you have a
company in this insurance
it has an insurance product how do you
model it you have a similar structure
when it's very complex by the way it's a
very specialized kind of task where
people do so what does the product have
very similar to a class having variables
or attributes as we call it the product
also has a lot of attribute it has
documentation sub products similar
products reviews hot line blogs
calculators you know you can imagine
that a insurance product has a premium
calculator right so who a lot of things
how we manage all of this
typically content management systems
have a mechanism in which you can
specify that this is my product this is
the attribute it has so that all of this
individual description for example or
the validity the the similar products
can be managed without you having to
muck around with the UI it just happens
in the data layer so that UI can be
built on top of it all right now that's
not all you have this content you have
modeled the content alright you have
contributed to the into the content now
you want to launch a new health
insurance good but how do you ensure
that the contributors and the consumers
of that data see the same result what I
mean by that is a person who legally
looks at the insurance product and
decides that this is right this is the
right language to use it actually
appears on the website it's very
important because if we get the language
wrong we will be talking to lawyers
rather than customers right so we need
to ensure that whatever legal does is
what the customer sees let's say you've
got a trainer down there then a trainer
goes out and trains people on a product
he must see the same documentation that
the documentation team has put down for
this particular product how do you
ensure that the only way is to ensure
that is you have a content management
system which kind of binds all of these
consumers and contributors so that if
you want to throw this onto a website
you use the same content system
let's say a designer rode a nice little
template for you to show this or render
this website on a web page now this has
to show up on a desktop computer or a
mobile device no it has to be same it
can't be that you have a different
rendition for mobile device versus
desktop device you know is that kind of
destroy everyone's piece because it's so
difficult to manage how do you ensure
that when a customer calls in to call
center and the call center person is
trying to answer their questions they
better give the right answers right
which is reviewed by legal which will
blessed by documentation team otherwise
again the kind of information that goes
back to customer will be very different
than what he saw on the website cause
not of trouble so there's always this
mechanism where you can use multiple
content systems to manage each of these
use cases but no you don't do that
because it will get into trouble best to
have one content system that manages all
of these so that the information is
consistent I didn't even talk about the
translation aspect right so many of our
customers for example they translate
their websites especially our European
customers into multiple languages and we
also are talking to few customers here
in India and they have the requirement
of translate their website into six
seven maybe more languages just a quick
pop up question so how many official
languages - Cindy I have 22 alright so
imagine people from all our country
trying to access your website you
definitely have to connect with them
with a language that they understand
right alright now I talked about the
content management system and how
difficult it is and why is it so
important that you have one system that
targets or delivers to multiple channels
what about this scenario when you're
developing this system you do even
imagine that there will be you eyes that
you never thought there will be for
example did you imagine that there will
be a UI
alexxa or a billboard right what's so
special about this billboard shows up
you know when you are driving on the
road right did you imagine that your
same image that you collaborated on here
will show up there or how about this
Alexa it doesn't even have a UI it's a
device right you ask a few questions and
it gives you the answer how do you write
or build systems that work with all of
these what we believe is that content
and experience cloud is something that
allows you to do this because of the
fact that we have created this platform
where we give you collaboration we allow
you to curate and create content allow
you to authored manage publish and
analyze all of the content content
remains here but where is content coming
from content could be coming from any of
these sources and where is it delivered
to it can go to any such I'd say UI or
UX right how is that possible it's
possible because we have ensured that
the way you connect two systems or all
agnostic of what those systems are
because it's all API first approach that
we took you have a legacy system that
you want to connect to you can always
write your adapters which knows how to
talk with that particular content system
pull data and what we do is that we
provide all these functionalities in the
platform plus the ability for it to
deliver it regardless of where it is
coming from for example we have inbuilt
connectors which allow you to pull
content images from content and
experience cloud and throw it at
commerce cloud in Oracle has you can
throw it at your legacy applications or
you can throw it at ERP systems such as
jde for example so we have done that
already
we have inbuilt connectors for that so
what we believe is that you have content
coming from anywhere we provide all
these rich functionalities on top in
this platform
and the content can be used to throw
experience at any device or any such
channel including the oral ones oral
ones his theory he's our old one he just
listens to you or Alexa she just listens
to you right and then gives you answers
it's kind of magic because last year at
Oracle OpenWorld my boss she showed a
demo where she asked a question to Alexa
and then alexa talks to CEC and gives an
answer very very similar to what my
video will be doing here
rather than using Alexa will be typing
things out all right yeah coming to the
demonstration now we'll be doing that
next so we have intelligent bought loud
service which I mean we'll introduce you
to I'm sure you know about AI BCS by now
a bunch of things have happened already
that have introduced to you too IBC is
and then in distressed calls into
content and experience cloud whenever
maybe in has some question it dashes off
some calls and then what content and
experience cloud does is that in
response to that question it sends out
content and it's a content it
necessarily means text or images or
whatever in form of JSON so that an IBC
a set of things you just displayed there
all right so what do you know hi thanks
to bethey so my name is Naveen I'm a
senior software engineer at Oracle and
I'm currently working on no content
experience cloud management so I pretty
much design and develop the rest a place
for CEC so yeah let's get started
so as Tripathi mentioned CEC helps you
to manage content across various
channels and is centralized to me so
what that means is you can have your
content pretty much at one place that's
in CEC and you should be able to access
the same content across various channels
name it you can access through a desktop
channel or you can access it through the
same content or a mobile channel so you
you need not duplicate the code or the
multiple channels right so you can have
the content at one place that's one
advantage and you
most of the cases content remains same
and what changes is the presentation
part across various channels so you have
a different presentation for the mobile
devices you have a different
presentation for the desktop devices so
CEC has this it clearly separates the
content and the presentation part that's
another advantage of CEC and it also
provides lot of rich REST API calls so
that you can integrate with any partner
product so today we will be more
focusing on that part so where I'll show
you how to pull the data from a CEC and
show it on an intelligent Butler okay so
just before going to that let me show
what CEC is okay so this is the CGC UI
so yeah not this that's the spinner this
is the one yeah
so as I said it has a clear separation
of content and the presentation part you
can see two sections there which is the
content and experience so content
section really manages the content so
you can have different types of content
where you can manage all these
subsections I will go through it and
experience part is about the
presentation so where you create sites
templates components and all this kind
of things so we will be more focusing on
the content section today so yeah under
the content you have lot of the sub
section so let's go to them so this is
the documents subsection so where you
can
yeah okay so this section so you can
manage your folders files a typical a
file system kind of thing so you can
come here you can upload your folder
subfolders and all this kind of things
so this is like document management so
this is the documents section so this
conversation so here you can manage the
conversations on the content so this is
what typically talked about social
collaboration so this section will help
you to me manage this conversations on
the content and let's skip this thing so
this is the digital assets so this
section will help you to manage your
digital media files so name it are
images PDFs takes right so you can all
pretty much manage all the digital media
files here and it also has the inbuilt
rendition server so let's say customer
uploads a huge large image right this by
default will generate all the other
renditions like come nail medium images
and all this kind of stuff so that you
can use it so you can use a thumbnail
image in a mobile channel whereas you
can use the medium image in a tablet
right and a large image in a desktop so
it you need not upload all the version
of it so if you upload in which it takes
care of generating all other renditions
apart from that if you can also upload
your custom renditions elsewhere right
so that's part of this so I already have
uploaded some our digital assets here so
you can go here and you can upload all
these digital assets right so let's get
this content items so this section will
help you to manage the structure content
so you can view structure content as
simple a definition like kind of let us
take example of a article what
attributes will article have a body
right and a headline and the main image
so there are some attributes you can
predefined for an article so that's
where you you can come to the screen and
you can manage your structure content
you can go to their manage types and you
create your definitions right so I
already have some definitions lo okay so
you can pretty much go here and create
new definitions if you want right let's
just see what let's say I want to create
something called cart right so now the
screen enables you to select all the
attributes which you require for the car
so you can come here you can design your
car you can select what attributes this
car contain as per your requirement you
can select all this type of attributes
we provide all these attributes called
or text attributes over all this kind of
things so you can and this is major
important things so you have your
relationship model let's say article and
author so it's basically a relationship
right so that so you can have this
attribute called reference and you can
hook another content to this item right
that way you can have your relationship
model built and you can pretty much
create create your digital data modeling
and you can see this media this is
another important thing so where you can
hope that digital assets which you have
uploaded here right so your structure
content can get into have this digital
assets as well so that's about the
definition right so I already have some
definitions which are created so let's
just see what it contains see I already
created one definition called OC
underscore knowledge which we will be
using this but the demonstration so you
can see I have created three attributes
for it and you can pretty much specify
name of the attribute whether it is a
required attribute or an optional
attribute whether it is a single valued
multi valued and you can change here and
all these things so
that's about content items so yeah so
that's for the definitions design so
once you have created the definitions so
you can come here you can create the
instances for it
so instances are nothing but content so
in Java but you can say it's the objects
of that class right so he can come here
and you can create it new content and
you can select for what type you want to
create this content for and then you can
select this type and you go there let's
say you have this thing called just for
this thing so I'll come to the
collections or in few minutes so yeah as
you can see right so you can get to give
the details or the content which you
have for this item so you can give the
value for the body attribute you can use
value for the keyword attribute and all
this
oh I lost it
okay so that's about the content items
so you can see that I already have some
content items that I have created so you
can pretty much pinter the content items
based on the definitions here and you
can there are some statuses which we
will be going through in a couple of
minutes so so here are some content
items which I have created so we will be
using this content items in our demo
right I have taken all content from
various topics that I've included sports
I included nature sport surfing all
kinds of things so this thing so let's
go to collections so collections you can
see it as a workspace let's say you have
now the content items you have the
digital files you have everything so now
let's say you are working on some stuff
right you can you can get collect all
these content items put it here
you can group them as that's the major
advantage of this you can group them and
you can create your working set and you
can work on them right
you can't literally if you have
thousands of items there you can manage
it
so you can take whatever you you're
working on correctly and you can create
work set you can create the collections
here and work on them so I have created
collection called Bangaluru right let's
go and see what item so I have so the
content items I have created in the
created I have added them to this
collection so that I can currently work
on this collection okay so you can see
here right so let's filter out something
okay so so other thing which you are
seeing here is some content items has
this tag called published and others
days inhabited right
so as slippity mentioned so there is an
approval and approval cycle that is
there in CEC so your item will only be
able you can access the item and only if
it is published so if it is not
published what that means is your items
still in the management phase or in the
draft phase so you are still not yet
finalized on the contact
so you can pretty much so you can come
here edit the items and and you can move
it to the approval cycle or once it is
approved you can publish it once it is
published it will be able to you will be
able to access that thing right so
that's why so some items are already
published so we can only access the
items that are published so that's the
road CEC overview so let's now let's
look at the IBC assistance and how do we
pull the data from CEC so so let's first
look at the demo and then we can go into
the technical details of it so I already
have created a bot called mr.
know-it-all
and this bot knows all the content
information about all the stuff that is
there in the CEC right so it's already
pretty much integrated so let's first
test it so here are some query patterns
so let me ask some questions
so this thing will now connect to the
CEC instance and get the data and show
it here right this data is coming from
the content item that is available in
the CEC right so let's ask some more
questions to it right so now this is
saying that it doesn't know the about
nature so let's go and find out why
doesn't know it right so I come to this
collection right
I have something called nature but it is
not able to find this is because the
nature is not published so before
publishing let me just show what is this
made it what this item actually contains
right so as I said right I have created
a definition called OC underscore
knowledge and that has the body
attribute keyword attribute and these
are the values for the nature content
and these are the keywords so you can
come here and add more keywords and
basically these are the keywords that we
are searching in the intelligent border
right so yeah that's just wanted to show
you the what is the data of this okay so
now let's come here and let's publish it
yeah let me select this and let me say
publish now once it is published then
you will be able to access this content
outside CEC okay okay this is published
so let's give it some time because
there's a background indexer that is
running and that's so basically in the
input the integration we are basically
using the search rest calls to the CEC
so let's give it some time for the
indexing to run so that then you should
be able to access the item so meanwhile
let's let's ask some more questions to
it okay some let's ask some interesting
questions so since this is election
season let's ask who will win 2019
elections right okay it says that all
the octopus is dead
see you know about this octopus this
thing okay so by the way this is also a
Content item in the CEC okay okay so
let's go into the technical details of
it so you might be wondering how this is
able to pull the data from CDC right
let's see that part
okay so one way to integrate with the
curve party when the IBC s is to create
a custom component right I think if you
have attended previous sessions Ravi's
sessions and all these things so you
should be able to identify what intents
are and what is entities means in the
IBC s world right so so this is
something called custom component I have
created a custom service called
know-it-all service right and for the
custom component you have to give a
service URL so this this is the service
URL which I BCS will make a call to this
service upon inquiry so I have given one
service URL this is an application which
is running right in my laptop right so
this is a node.js application see ya
this is a node.js application so these
things are like the rest calls which
that have been made to this server so
just printed other things so so this is
the node.js application so I have
configured this so this is the reason
why this I BCS can't talk to that node
application and let's go to the index
right okay so you can see here this in
there is an intent core knowledge right
so and I have configured them with these
many queries so someone can fire a query
or knowledge asking for a knowledge in
these many ways you can ask tell me
about which I have used right you can
you can pretty much use the other things
as well to ask information about
knowledge so these are the entities and
these are these are the intent and these
are the entities so if you go to here
this is it something called keyword
entity which is configured to this
intent if you go to the entities so
entities are nothing but so in a given
query you should be able to extract the
entities so I have asked something
called tell me about sports and really
my entities puts right so so this entity
so here is the place where you configure
how to extract
the entity from the intents the query
which our user has asked so I have
created the keyword entity here and
there's a type of configuration you can
do this is my my thing is a regex
configuration so i just pick the data
from after this in this pattern so this
is the configuration here okay okay now
when whenever we fire a query right so I
asked about something called tell me
about nature so from this query this
entity will be extracted based on this
regular expression and I will get
something called about nature and this
thing will be passed to or it will be
passed to this node application which I
have configured to this custom component
so it basically makes it rest call to it
by passing this entity and that node
application will in turn make another
rest call to the cec server get the data
back and give it back to the OBCs
instance that's where you are able to
see the responses here okay so just to
summarize the poor thing I already have
an image available here okay so this is
the flow so as you can see this is the
IBC's instance so upon a query it
extracts the entity makes a rest call
which is obvious
in fact it is a post call to this
node.js application and this node.js
application as of now it's running on my
box but it's not limited to that you can
deploy this node application on any
typical MCS or a compute box right so it
basically makes a post call there and
that node.js
will in fact make a rest call in fact we
are using search REST API so CEC
provides lot of rest APIs but we are
using what is the Search API for now to
the integration so it makes a rest call
to the Search API and CEC gives the
results back in the JSON response format
and that changed on response in turn it
sent back to the IBC as instance and
that so you are able to see the
responses
okay so we have seen both our IBC s and
we already have seen da CEC let's look
at some code snippets of the node.js
application right so you can see this
thing that this is URL so you can see
here whenever I fire a query it
basically makes it post call IBC s makes
a post call with this URL to the my node
application alright so let's look at the
code snippet of what is post how it is
post call is handled so my component
name is mr. know-it-all can see that
right over here this thing right let's
know it all this is the component name
so I get a post call on this component
name then after that I have some utility
classes where I extract the component
and I will invoke that component in my
case it is no eternal component so
obviously the call comes to here alright
and this is the method that is being
called invoke and yeah so now here it is
able to extract the entities that are
passed to this system by IBC's so if you
extract an NP result or something
something it will be something like
about sports or about nature from here
we extract the exact keyword that's here
so we remove all this preposition kind
of things and we get that keyword and
from that we will ask a CEC server to
give me the data about this keyword so
basically this is the place where we go
here and CEC service and it says it
calls you me some knowledge hundred
calls fetch content so here is the on
the rest call which we make to the CEC
by passing these query parameters so we
are saying that I am searching over this
content like we are using this OC
underscore knowledge type so you are
saying to CC that you mean all the
contents of this type that is OC
underscore knowledge
and with this thing called if that this
is the attribute of the OSI underscore
knowledge so when I have created the
definition for OSI underscore knowledge
I have given this thing called attribute
called OSI underscore knowledge
underscore keywords so if that keyword
uni if any of the keyword contains this
whatever you have typed in the IBC as
instance just give me that results so
this is pretty much the rest code which
we are making to the CGC instance so the
CEC instance details are configured here
so you can see this headless dot content
items so headless gen KS is the place
where we have configured our CGC
instance details everything so that's
how it is able to make the corn to CEC
okay so now let's try the same question
which we have which is not able to give
the results last time we did not give
the results about the nature that is
because we haven't published it now that
we have already published it should be
able to give that results now C is able
to give the results now because we have
published that item and now that's why
it is able to access so that's pretty
much from my side so the value that CC
provides now and in future is that the
keyword all of that that you know you
have even configured it with content
item and I mean showed that that you had
a Content item and you configure a lot
of keywords through which you can search
all of that will be automated in that
the content itself knows what its
keywords are right so that
got it yes the idea is that yeah the
idea is that it could be an image and
who puts all the stats on an image it
could be a video who will put the tags
on the video what we're saying is that
this platform content inexperienced
cloud it will build intelligence going
forward which will Auto tag the image or
the video based on what it understands
from the image itself so that the very
drudgery of adding tags manually will be
taken out or for that matter you have a
big textual content an article the
keyword is something that you got to
feed yourself but how about the
automated stuff which will pull out the
right keywords and then pump it out into
the content item so that like I said in
a call center person or customer or
anybody for that matter working on any
channel we will see the same result
rather than we deciding oh this is a
channel so we'll read code for that and
but write content for it and this is a
channel separate content for it
content is same the way you access it
through our ApS will remain constant
that's on our roadmap so you can see it
in about end of this year we'll have
something going on for us yes CC comes
with CDN support which is to say that
the moment you buy CC you also get CD
and support which is Akamai to the
moment someone accesses this content
item in your region it will be right
there
so that if the second person access the
same content item it won't be served
from the content server but right from
this serial no yes part of the deal
pretty much you know via sure sure there
two ways one is public information which
is available to anybody that's what I
mean short now and there's secure
information which pretty much goes
across
SSO which you know it's enabled by IDC
is going forward IDC s is so as of now
it's handled by the Oracle access
management under or collided here so
yeah so that's what the secure channels
you have a soft no what I have demoed is
on a public Channel so where you don't
have an authentication yeah pretty much
you can configure your channels so you
can create a channel and you can say
okay this is my secure channel now you
know one will be able to access until
other indication yeah I wouldn't get
into that discussion but this is what we
have to offer where you know the content
is just sitting in one repository and
the various channels where you can
access it from and these channels like I
said are you wise you wise change every
three years right four years maybe and
there are you wise like I suggested that
don't exist today how do you cater to
that because of this API yeah so to
summarize as far as security is
concerned there is one public
information to you know and let me
showed you how to do that second is ID
CSR talked about which is ID identity
cloud service that we have where you can
set up SSO so that you bring in multiple
systems and then you can you can log in
using your corporate credentials both
are possible that is pretty much a
configuration that goes into a certain
file so yes you can see here right this
is the access token and as of now this
is so so basically there are two kinds
this is channel and there's the tokens
so channel is the one which you
configure saying that okay all this
content items should be available in
this channel and tokens are kind of
access tokens kind of like you can you
can have any number of access tokens on
a particular channel and each token has
its expiration type right so as of now
this is an
access token for my public channel so
that's how this is the contester
configuration my question is how does
the CS and understand that the query is
coming from an Alexa device or from an
abort shouldn't write like it's just a
REST API call that internally gets right
yeah so it doesn't matter you didn't
know that I'm trying to understand
because as you showed the nature tag in
DC as you also had an image as well as
some content for a bot or for Alexa
image is not necessary
so some somehow see I should understand
that sending an image is not necessary
that's a pretty much configuration so in
the REST API call which I have made to
CEC I have specified just give me all
this attributes so these are the
attributes which I require just give me
them you can even ask for an image and
you can still the display the image in
the body stuff just pretty much right
you can say that yeah because whenever
you write a code for any channel you
know what that channel expects web
channel for example it can show
everything whereas Alexa it can show
pretty much talk something Siri for that
matter they can just she can just talk
yeah yeah yeah that that code which
talks to the UI that is pretty much
something that you must write anyway
right for example if you are writing a
plugin for Siri you got to write
something there that's a code that you
will contribute you know what Siri is
capable of she is capable of showing
images articles and so on
well select size not right so you are
kind of differentiate there
yeah we saw that IBC s has a mechanism
in which you can decide what is the
intent itself and how do you pick up an
insane intent and how do you refine that
question so you must have attended those
sessions and you dive understood so it's
all something that happens in IBC s
rather than in content and experience
club our point is that you maintain
content in one repository and any
channel can talk to it using a REST API
yes in the node.js application we have
written that in this keyword search now
can we create a custom field and then
means I don't have to change the node.js
application every time a user changes
that and then I have to search basically
on that sure so in one of those files
you saw that you know we do NLP thing
right so you can always manipulate that
code so that it understands lot more
about your intent and then write that
code based on that okay it's pretty much
that blue code the blue Glu igloo it
sits between CC and the UI UI in our
case has happens to be IBC s and like
you also talked about collections so the
collections can contains anything and
everything like the images videos
everything and then how how I'm gonna
differentiate between the collection
that let's say I have created a
collection and I have to give a keyword
on that collection now the images will
be a little different than the video how
can I give a differentiation between the
images this the video is this then when
I am searching it will give me only
those relevant information and not fully
right so collection is something that
you use during what we call the
management content management and what I
mean by management is that you are
creating a content system you are
building a solution that's when you
create a collection but once you publish
it it's no longer there it's available
on our channel as we call it and you can
simply pull information from that in
fact we do have and that I'm building
one such demo where you ask a question
like now we ended
it will offer you multiple choices when
you choose one of them it shows an image
so all of this what we call a flow that
flow is missing in this demo but you can
always build that in a BCS again the
flow is not part of CC itself if you
really see it is part of IB CS itself
and once you know what to ask given that
you have asked me about something which
has multiple choices that support that
you have to write so that you ask CC the
right question it returns you three
items rather than one item in this in
the case of this demo it was one item
right but it could be that you have
three items coming in you can show a
nice little menu and say what do you
want to do now right very similar to the
keynote that we saw we have multiple
options we are given alright yeah with
the CC yeah like I said now we already
have integration with JD Edwards where
you can maintain all the files in CC
what I mean by that is the which is
option can you show me I don't see we
have here it's not yet this is self
service itself okay so what really
happens is that you have JD and then you
have a business object paper and this
business object could have multiple
files associated with it what they have
demonstrated claim is that you can
always show all these documents the
first part over there okay you can
maintain all those documents there and
have JD show them why is it important
let's say that you have a vendor or
supplier there are few documents that
you have to share with those people
right how does that happen today or
emails and emails are very susceptible
to getting lost right how do you manage
that you may have CC manage those
documents so you share that very easily
and yeah like I said you know the
documents part of CC it makes it very
simple for you to share documents not
only with your colleagues but also with
external entities anybody out there with
public links and so on so that you
collaborate on those documents and once
you decide that yeah this is the deal it
simply can be shown in
JD Edwards with this integration support
from that yeah that man is fan so do you
mean because normally ERP holds if I
want to understand the inventory that's
kind of exercise it does internally they
use here I don't see that kind of robust
technology so do you mean that yeah here
piece here P so if you want to create a
chat bot which talks to ERP systems and
gets information you really have to be
talking to ERP systems yes not no
content system you see not necessarily
CC is a content management system okay
right now let's say that you are having
a you want to create a blogging kind of
website or it could even be your website
or your dot-com presence as we call it
right how do you manage that like I said
the content must all come from a typical
anil dot-com company content comes from
back-end system where it doesn't know
about any language nothing you just say
that I want to show this piece of
information and that's it it gets it for
you
that's what content management system is
good for so you going to say if I want
to sell CC along with the ERP to
customer I think it's not going to help
actually so I think with the chat board
directly which interacts with my ERP
system but where CC will help is that if
you have the cases use cases where you
share these documents with your external
systems with your external vendors and
suppliers because if there's lot of
communication a lot of collaboration
that happens because I talked about the
fact that you can collaborate on files
if you don't like a price of the
supplier you can always fight it out on
it conversation and come back and you
know deal at that level rather than or
emails because it's very slow our phone
calls which is not formal right so you
do all those file related operations
using CC so that five months not from
now and the deal is cut you want to know
how this conversation went you can
always go to CEC and find out how that
went it's all maintained their version
and so on yeah
yeah hey right yeah right so the first
question necessarily you want to use
this in the in your company we have to
play it right right
in fact we use content and experience
cloud extensively within Oracle in fact
between my mean and mean I mean comes
from Hyderabad and I'm from Bangalore we
collaborated using CEC by the way in an
internal instance that we have he threw
in his file size room in my PPT is
heated the interesting stuff I did the
boring stuff right so PPT yeah so we
collaborated on the top of that and we
have internet system but apart from that
Oracle also has something called
Oracle cloud machine OCM yeah very hard
for me sometimes because I'm used to all
these acronyms and I can't use acronyms
here
alright so cloud machine is something
that you can deploy on your machine in
your data center and have it provides
the same cloud experience that otherwise
you get from Oracle public cloud not now
but the plan is that we support even CEC
for that matter an Oracle cloud machine
right one we don't yep
second part well your the back-end
system is just fine you know how we
manage the data it's left up to us right
but the idea is that you have one
knowledge base system which serves
multiple channels that's our main goal
here alright so all so many just it's
not about content it also manages the
experience part of it right so it's not
just this thing so which I haven't
covered this is the experience part so
wait you can create the templates
components and you can take
create sites right so this also manages
the sample yeah and coming to the
experience but this is where developers
jump in you have themes which
necessarily means that it's a theme for
your website components now we talked
about jde we have such a component where
you can always create a component which
is JavaScript based or whatever language
talks to some system in interest shows
some information on your website right
so all of that is possible because you
can always get a developer to create
custom components templates are
interesting because let's say that you
have one website for a certain business
of yours now you want to replicate this
in another country because you opened
your operations there or a customer
openly their operation there rather than
creating their entire website right from
the scratch you create a template of one
website and then as many as as you want
you can always spin out as many sites as
you want from this template so all of
that is something that we expect
developers to jump in and fill up the
blanks obviously every customer will
have their own solutions
search engine you are using I mean yeah
I hope not we are using to the scene but
we will be more into the lastik plastics
elastic first but that it's on the road
now obviously it will be finally it will
be elastic yep
any other questions
all right thank you so much for joining
this and thank you so much for being
patient with us yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
