you on the last day in the afternoon
session I guess they couldn't have given
us a better time than this and I hope
all of you enjoy the Oracle OpenWorld so
far welcome to our session it's from
tank farm two handled my name is Robbie
and it's Ganesh and we are from catalyst
business partners located here in the US
and globally in about ten countries we
are primarily a system integrator but I
will talk about us little later first we
will go through what we are trying to do
here by saying thank form to handheld um
a few years ago I had an interesting
question in my mind who has the best IT
system in the world and I tried to do
some research around it my question was
is that NSA is that now sighs at FBI
that CIA who actually is having the best
IT system and there was no clear
indication of that of course the
standard parameters come in mind
processing capacity volume and all that
thing what I realized in with time is we
do not understand but we all of us carry
actually the best IT system in the world
that's us and by saying that I had some
observations here what we have in our
body is very interesting it's probably
the best IT system because there is no
better connected systems than our body
if you think of the skin of course this
was not developed in a day from
Precambrian era until now for 600
million years we have been developing
this connective system and the Nature
has done a superb work in that what it
has done is it has a tremendous sensing
ability it knows how to send that change
and it goes into a very big data center
actually in our head and all the nerve
centers that we have is exactly what we
are trying to do today with the data
centers around the world
so when we try to understand our own big
data system we understand exactly how we
have to evolve our own IT world towards
that there is some very fundamental
interesting observation there one is we
sense first of all what do you want to
sense is a very important aspect then
how do we filter and then what
information is important to us till
today our database is not intelligent
enough to understand what is important
data its source everything you give it a
crab it leaves eclipse that keeps a crab
that's exactly what it does today it's
all wrong then how do we generate in a
contextual inside and our system is so
powerful that we can use these databases
that we are having as called as memory
and we can react appropriately and we
can apprehend the future we can
understand how to be proactive upon it
expected context our connected systems
today in the IT world that human beings
built is very much in the evolving
session today it's evolving it's nowhere
close to the maturity nature has shown
us with that premise I will go a little
bit more and I will take you to some of
the wave fronts that we have been
noticing over the last 60 years maybe
maybe 50 to 60 years and this is a very
interesting visual representation it's
not done by me it is the source is
informatica they publish it about a year
and a half ago and it is it's a very
interesting observation kind of gives
the entire IT world's evolution as a
wavefront you can see between 1960s and
70s how IBM is to dominate the was the
dominant player in the market and then
back office started getting digitalized
slowly it moved towards front office not
only a few people programmers we're not
the only privileged people to access a
system it started becoming common
Microsoft Oracle they all
started to making a mark after that it
slowly moved into the world of Amazon's
ecommerce came in then came the search
engine because data got accumulated
already a lot we're searching was not an
easy thing followed by that we
understood that Facebook picked up the
game called social network so our data
network started spreading horizontally
not only just vertically and then
furthermore today we are saying internet
is not only for the humans who have a
life but also for the lifeless or
lifeless things and that's where I OT
came in picture it tooks called Internet
of Things so things are doing the
internet work which humans have been
doing so far so this is the wave front
there is another very very interesting
observation here if you look at the
bottom you see the logarithmic scale
actually 10 raise to 2 to 10 days to for
how the speed of data processing has
improved so here is another interesting
observation we should pick up from this
that is um what was the bottleneck of
cloud architecture until today it was
not the processor speed is the
communication speed in the sense how
fast internet was able to pick up a data
that is being sensed to that processor
wherever it is so this speed was our
bottleneck and today all of a sudden
after the internet picking up the real
speed just like our skin did to our
brain the moment you send something it
goes to our right place of novel system
that's what we can do today is why cloud
architecture is becoming such a common
buzz such an important aspect of IT
world and that is where we are today
about 10 days to 11 bits per second and
going from here actually i'll change the
context completely this is to give you
an idea where we are moving why we are
moving and how we are modeling the
nature in our IT two men moving from
here i'll take you to the land of black
gold the domain that we are trying to
bring IOT and the cloud to
and the company that you see Sahara it's
actually a Nigerian company it's a it's
an oil company over in Nigerian we have
our work being done there we have been
doing work with them for about two years
now on this this particular picture
shows you oil movement so it comes from
the production site it's called then
after that it moves to the supply chain
it's pretty much a supply chain of oil
it moves through the carrier it's called
up upstream a movement and it goes into
the storage kind of a warehouse but we
call in oil and gas industry that as a
tank farm so it goes into the tank firm
it remains there and then there are
commitments that are made for sale and
that commitment is fulfilled by the
downstream distribution and that's how
it comes to our local gas stations
whether it is a shell whether it's VP
with its Hammacher it doesn't matter
that's what happens actually in in the
whole whole wide world and remember what
we use oil for is just one part of the
oil a majority of the oil is being used
by the flights every day so this is same
supply chain also fuels aviation
industry it also few else some of that
train industry so this is a very
important aspect of the business it is
Oh age-old therefore it does not splash
in the news as often it's quite an
interesting inventory system in addition
to that I wanted to point out as I said
it's a land it's a land of black gold
it's indeed like a gold and gold is lot
not useful much but black gold is very
useful and it does not have enough that
we want so there is a lot of interesting
aspect when you make something limitedly
available and extremely felt like an
asset there's some immediate property to
that which is people like to steal it
and that is actually an interesting
aspect that oil and gas industry does
fight on a regular basis in addition to
that oil is a hazardous material you got
to be extremely
careful how you handle it and in this
country in the u.s. there is a PA who is
very very strong in this regard and the
seepage is an extremely important aspect
of any oil tank and EPS do come down and
closed down tank forms if that is not
certified well so it's an interesting
aspect of even the keep keeping the
business afloat you need to have certain
regulations to be maintained so having
said that I will instead of me
explaining the some of the major pain
points of this industry I'm going to run
a small little clip here it's an
animation not so funny we wanted it to
be more funny it didn't happen
unfortunately but the animation kinda
shows the problems of the industry
business problems one is the oil
pilferage here basically the episode
goes like this that a tank for manager
is noticing that in the morning noticing
that somebody is stealing the oil from
the tank form and filling the tanker
when he comes to realize that it tries
to chase but it's already gone that's
one of the problems and then we have
another issue which actually is very
important and especially in the not so
developed countries we face that quite a
bit it's a way they're challenged I mean
most of the places do not have many
alternate routing that can take heavy
tankers in the u.s. we have that
opportunity we have multiple rerouting
but in most of the parts of the world
you don't have those so much of
rerouting possibility there's only one
or two ways to bring such heavy vehicles
that carry you know that can carry oil
because those are special vehicles so
what happens if there is a weather of
indicate or any calamity that hits that
road you do not get enough oil on time
yet you have a commitment to sell the
downstream folks so you get into a very
bad mess so these animations take us
through those set of things and then I
will I will explain what it is trying to
say as you go through this and connect
you feel
sits like a dawn in the morning side the
tank farm manager had guy but he is to
make sure that he has enough oil that's
been committed in the morning to be sold
he notices that M is empty the tank is
empty and it was not supposed to be so
this is the reason of it somebody is
stealing now I see has to order the oil
and it on some ternet so that kind of
tells you what is one of the
possibilities we go into the inclement
weather scenario so all of a sudden the
rain comes and these are the commitments
made already we understand that nobody
is coming to be ready by the oil that
and these guys have custom electorial
already sorry to say this week people
the sky is going to be crying we're
going to be seeing a lot of rain and
some thunderstorms honestly there is no
way out today and this one is a
hazardous material
some drivers
it just tells you some of the key
problems of the industry and of course
what what the episodes show is not
exactly how the state of the industry is
we do not really go today all the time
to measure climb up the tank and deepest
ink to measure where the oil is although
that's still practiced by the way it's
not that it's completely gone out of the
world but it is not a common practice
anymore we have tank gauging systems
that have come out and there are there
different technologies used ultrasound
redder and but there is a very standard
that that is coming up around the
international standard that's coming up
that is to do with something called
servo gauge which is shown on the on
this is a servo gauge it's an
interesting concept it's a floating
needle that actually gives you the
length of the oil the properly er days
when you had the manual gauging there
was some of course common sense issues
right there you can see you can easily
understand that that you'd have to be
it's prone to human error parallax and
everything else in addition to that you
have all the systems that we have
currently and this is actually true all
the systems that we have currently in
the ERP systems or anything that's been
used today it does not get any data
directly from the sensors you actually
have to manually enter the data there so
these are the problems of manual gauging
so automatically automatic gauging comes
as a more important and interesting
concept so we do have automatic gauging
systems today an atg which is a commonly
used word in oil and gas industry it's
me it means automatic tank gauging
systems so we do have a tank gauging
systems that will that can generate the
sensors as the the information since the
information and passes it on to a system
kind of integrate aggregate or whatever
we call that and then we can process
that so what we have done now this is
where it comes the IOT and the cloud
architecture so let me explain you what
we are trying to do here
if you can think a little bit it's it's
more like a pyramid concept the data is
at the topmost bottom the sarong data so
a lot of data can give you some
contextual information so you refine it
a little bit actually Oracle if you
think back why oracle became or become
big in the very beginning in 90s and
i've been working with oracle for a very
long time so since 1990 so around that
time the only database that was in the
market well I'll not go into the
controversies here but but the reason
why they became big is because they
could relate data that's called
relational database and formed an
information which all others were not
capable at that point of time coat and
uncut so having said that information
technology started becoming an important
aspect because now data another data
when you add up together it becomes a
meaningful stuff then that's how the IT
technology started booming back in early
90s and I probably be one of the
fortunate ones to see it through all the
way and what happened with that
information technology we were still
stuck to the information technology
today when we mean I t but it actually
has evolved quite a bit from information
technology we moved into something
called intelligence technology that's
why there you see in early 2000 all the
bi is started going up business
intelligence and then after intelligence
you try to get insights and that's
exactly where we are today everybody is
talking about insights with a big data
predictive analytics and all that it's
nothing but refining the intelligence
into more meaningful inside information
which becomes insights so if you look at
the parameter and place it in a pyramid
form raw data information on top of it
is your insight what happens after that
well if you if you look at our own brain
what happens after that is called
intuition so what is i.t i.t still
remains IT but it does not mean any more
information technology it becomes
intelligence technology then it becomes
inside technology then it will probably
become intuition technology in the
future
so I will not go much into the intuition
engine concept because our lawyers will
kill me but what I'm trying to say is
there is that direction that we are
taking today and what we did in the
gravel and the picture on the top then
now and next I'll try to quickly explain
that in the context of wengie sector
there the reactive is if you think about
it earlier Emily if you just imagine
like Oklahoma where you have some tank
forms and there is nobody driving by 44
minutes and hours you have a highway
almost empty that's exactly how it is
because it's in remote places stank
forms are remote places in many cases so
if there is any problem where there is a
fire hazard you know or or any sort of
issues you really do not get to know
much unless somebody reports that that's
exactly how it used to be earlier days
somebody would call 911 or somebody will
actually inform the authority that there
is a mess going on in your Chevron tank
form right here and that's that's how it
used to be to be very honest with you
but today that's not exactly the case we
have predictive and out not predictive
analysis yet implemented everywhere but
we have alert systems monitoring systems
that are implemented and that actually
can give you information when it
happened so if it happens you get a
notification and that is current state
but still it is very much by the by the
company so if it is a BP stand firm then
BP will have to take care of that
monitoring system on their own what is
going to happen in the future is where
we are directed to it's called social
mission network it's a different concept
where this all becomes a platform and
then like our home monitoring is not
being done by us but by a third party
all the tank phantom are being monitored
by a third party company and they can do
they can use the multi-tenancy and they
can the same company can monitor bps as
well as Chevron's as well as Exxon
Mobil's tank forms and they are into
tank for monitoring business and that is
exactly where we are heading to now I
will just quickly tell you business
intuition engine this is a quick
architecture of that it's our
proprietary architecture but I can show
part of it and it's pretty much an 8
software that's at the sensor level and
that's why we are in the IOT session
it's at the sensor level it makes sure
that a data is being modified enough to
be considered as an intelligence
component and then we transfer that to a
server and from there using the
communication protocols that supported
by OT and then from there on we further
work on gathering integrating
intelligence across other systems
business applications everything else
and we try to give with a sufficiency
and and confidence limit we give them
that this is a predictive analytics of
that data that we get so we are little
bit more prepared than from the past
what we had happen until now that's
pretty much what do we have we are
gearing towards for the future existing
systems which we are already selling in
places and implementing with the tank
forms this is the current architecture
of that you can see that there are three
different type of tanks only from the
length you can actually identify and
properly calculate the volume now when
you talk about oil volume it's an
interesting problem because no matter
how refined an oil is there is some air
that gets trapped so when you keep on
storing oil in a tank and you know you
fill the tank from the top you drain
that oil when you sell it from the
bottom so what happens is the more and
more you fill the tank your ear amount
in the midst of water amount in the oil
content goes up you can visit very very
well understand why because oil is going
out at the new oil that's being poured
has a little bit of trace of all the
water that actually accumulates on the
top and this is not usable so that's
called a dead zone and and so this
measuring techniques go into much deeper
than it looks like and then what happens
is a dead zone it's called dead zone the
area that has a mix of oil and water you
try to isolate that to calculate the net
volume so here the sensors actually
hear that in sensor information to a
tank for management systems kind of
SCADA concept here and then we use that
in our our local database and also push
it to the ERP and send information out
depending upon the alerts that's being
generated and this is already available
today so you can see that we can do web
based monitoring and basically a
dashboard concept and we can also send
any alert required with you know
supported protocols to any device that's
support it there so this is what we are
already doing and you can see a little
bit of a snapshot of our solution at
work that's information this is like
length atmospheric pressure deep density
total observe volume and all that water
volume so these are the things that are
key for a tank for management this
information comes and here this is flow
rate information so there are multiple
sensors summer for the amount
calculation somewhere from the
transaction volume because ERP once you
get into the ERP the sale is generated
the invoice is generated based on the
flow of the oil that's been taken out if
in case of sale for purchasing how much
you received so Florida is also a very
critical component for transactional
purposes and you can see there are
different type of monitors that we can
use a CRT display so point is this is
for the more you know people who are not
very conversant with computer yet they
work in the tank form and that's very
common and they just can read it off the
panel instead of going into any any
laptop or any computer because they
wouldn't be able to operate that so
these are these are practical problems
in a tank form and we incorporate such
displays plus you have something at the
at the low end see these are tall
structures and every time you cannot go
up to read a reading so you also have a
backup at the base of the tank so all
these things are are used today and we
came out a long way from putting a stick
into that tank and getting the
information that's very critical for the
business and business intelligence which
you will see as we move forward through
the
the presentation Oracle does have an
inventory application for the oil and
gas industry it's very much targeted for
for this particular industry it's called
Phil stock management and we integrated
with will stock management and that
actually integrates with the p.o and you
know purchasing p2p says I'll cycle as
well as order to cash cycle for
invoicing and everything else so the
this particular oil stock management has
some key requirements in it as you can
see these tanks require preventive
maintenance it needs periodic
calibration it has some information on
volume to sale or purchase and
preventive maintenance purposes plus
wherever they whenever there is a sale
or a by there is a custody transfer so
all these things are very key to
management of a tank farm and this
particular ERP takes care of that module
ERP module takes care of that I'm taking
a snapshot from one of the Oracles
standard form it might be very much
familiar with that if you are in oracle
application it actually shows exactly
the same sort of parameters that i
showed that was displayed in the phone
in the earlier slide you can see the
density is here the temperature at
MOSFET temperature the gross volume net
volume as I told you part of it is not
usable as a water mix oil and those will
be taken out and that is the calculation
for that as you can see the debt stock
is what it is called and and this ERP is
already in use in oil and gas sector and
we integrated with that I want to give
Kanishka an opportunity to talk a little
bit about what we are planning to do
yeah IOT platform we are migrating into
the past model just to give an highlight
high-level thing so we can go into
multi-tenant and the service model not
just a solution but a service model can
be derived from there making it in a
seamless solution for tank form across
any manufacturer btp or a chevron or NX
on mobile any details you want to
discuss perish yeah before that actually
uh if you can just scroll down the back
that's a very interesting slide this is
what yeah so here actually you can see
the stock visibility most of the time
all over the word you might be noticing
this like the data which is being
entered into the Oracle that particular
data specifically I am talking about the
inventory part the data is being
inputted by a layman by person with
actually issuing a oil in the tank farms
so they're actually the catalyst comes
into the play we do have such kind of
sensors because when we are talking
about these census these are not a
normal senses what we are talking about
these are actually the high-end sensors
which gives an accuracy of ron about 1
mm and the census what we are talking
here are basically ultrasonic and there
are sensors and sorrow gate sensors so
if you guys might be knowing about
surrogate sensors at a global level
there are only two or three
manufacturers who are actually producing
surrogate senses and we are actually one
of them apart from that Sabo gate
sensors honeywell emerson's all these
people are also manufacturing these
radar sensors and till yet they are not
able to send that particular data into
fuel stock management and all these
things so what we have done there in
Nigeria is basically sending the data
whenever the funeral issued from our
sensors directly into one centralized
server and from there to the Oracle fuel
inventory software so that's the real
time application what we have
implemented till yet but yes the problem
what we are facing is has been rectified
and that's why actually we are migrating
to IOT platform so this is all about
like this is a macro level overview what
our intention is and how we actually
wanted to go you can see these blocks
this is block one two three four these
number of these blocks are basically
telling they are basically telling a
tank form so it's a
eat of tank farms of a client say
Chevron then there is another fleet of
tank farms of shell so what we are doing
we are putting our sensors in each of
their tank farms collecting that
particular data into an Oracle cloud in
that particular Oracle cloud of a whole
application is already being delivered
so then from there we are implementing
the multi-tenancy database concept so
that through that same particular cloud
the guys can actually take their data
inventory data or if they wanted to go
for Oracle sales data APA are all these
modules they can actually fetch the data
the real time information we are talking
about and from the same cloud actually
we have our own dashboard it's a
customized dashboard through which each
and every client can get the real time
information from it's a kind of
predictive analysis what we have
actually implemented in that particular
dashboard you might be seeing that in
upcoming demo absolutely so can I thank
you very much what the key takeaway here
is I mean if you are not in ong sector
the key takeaway here is that we are
marrying sensor data with erp dana
period and then we are applying business
intelligence on top of the two data
segments who are actually isolated until
now we are marrying them and then we are
getting business intelligence out of
that in the cloud giving a possibility
of a new industry called tank from
monitoring industry that's what we are
trying to do here and X quite
revolutionary if you think from the
classic standpoint because everybody's
has this headache of making sure
especially in the u.s. is very important
that the EPA regulation because of that
you need to have all this thing very
well monitored however if you can give
this headache away to somebody whose
business is to monitor all the tank
forms all the time giving rise to the
business intelligence that's required
for them then it is even better so
that's the direction what that
particular slide showed a solution we
first built now we are moving it into a
solution as a service that's what we are
trying to say here and and then you can
see the benefits is quite quite common
sense benefits I don't have to say much
you're
connected all the time it's a real-time
data analytics you're optimizing the
best way possible and it is you know for
us this for the technology folks it's
important that we are using a platform
that's pre-integrated so the service of
the solution deployment time is very low
and that's exactly what we are doing we
are using the standard Oracle stuff all
the way for development anything be it
on the server side beat on the embedded
technology or the IOT side it's very you
know standard approach or all the way we
are trying to do java of course there
are some areas where you cannot do Java
we are facing that about 5% block still
working with the Java one box and all
other guys to remove those barriers
today especially about the legacy
devices when we are talking about any
industrial automation extreme or
controllers because these legacy drivers
the controllers are basically having an
output in Modbus protocol device and
protocol control net protocol North
Elliot Oracle is not having those API so
that we can just read that particular
data and send it to the Oracle cloud so
that's the bottleneck what we are facing
so exactly so this this this protocols
are so established you cannot refight
them you cannot tell that whatever you
have done oil and gas in Sector you have
done everything wrong so you cannot say
that so you have to build on whatever is
existing and that's where we are working
with our open source folks also trying
to get it to a streamlined area but the
point here is that yes some of those
api's are not available today we are
working towards that but but we are also
finding ways around it and that's how we
are handling the situation today but
with hopefully within a year or so will
be much more streamlined this particular
slide actually talks about our target
architecture that we are looking to
generate from this within a short time
and we are working closely with Oracle
for that the this architecture actually
shows you what we just said because
there will be CCTV which is a in a
visual monitoring there are Wi-Fi based
devices is all this serial rs-485 232
type of connection you have well as
heart modbus cellular all these sort of
protocols will have to be supported by
our one box that's their dream too but
unfortunately that's not the reality
they have showed it on the ppt but real
life doesn't say that so we are trying
to work it out so all this can be
supported very well in the Java one is
that's why it is Java embedded sweet and
we will get rid of all the workarounds
that we have to do through computers and
everything else is a dedicated piece of
hardware that's actually being used for
the oil and gas sector to collect the
information and send it to the cloud
pretty much that's what we want to do
and i think that's it that's the right
direction to take and that's our target
architecture and a little bit more
detail Ganesh why don't you go ahead and
explain it a little bit yeah this is
actually what we are actually planning
and this is what the design what we have
actually forecasted for our product line
especially for tank for management
likewise if you see the great block from
the down we are moving to up so the down
block basically a tank is there on the
right side this is basically indicating
the tank from the data is coming up into
the sensors and from there actually we
are sending the data into IOT box and
well I OT box is a very general word
this whole applicants you can think we
will be using one Java ME and java I see
like these are basically the sensor
nodes so in order to capture these data
sensi nodes we will be using Java ME and
our Java ME will be running on Raspberry
Pi or something like that and then that
data will be transferred into Java ICM
where it that particular hardware will
be running on you tonight util it is a
very popular hardware in which most of
the IOT applications right now are being
experimented I won't say that it is
being run so after that in that
particular you tonight we do have a
booklet database from where we will be
putting our be eyes and the data based
locally there and then doing the
intelligence running the BI like we
won't be over loading the server side we
will be putting up a business logic
there itself in the hardware like
whatever the transaction any oil moment
which has been happen in a day only that
data that filtered data will be
transferred to the server it's not like
24 / 7 you will be sending that
on the server that's right yeah that's a
very key thing here though because most
of the most of the connected systems is
very interesting the way we are moving
in the IT sector there is a load but how
to distribute that load so that no
particular node is becoming overloaded
that's a very critical design aspect of
today's connected systems so where do
you get it actually that's why I came up
from the human body if you look at it we
can feel any difference much better than
any particular for example I see
somebody I cannot draw that face but I
see somebody and that the person comes
back a few minutes later without a
moustache for example I can recognize
that the person has changed that's how
our brain works so the Delta of
information is very critical we cannot
keep on passing every data every data
point of our face we need to know
exactly the salient points and how the
data has changed around the salient
points that's a very very interesting
angle and all our work all our
intellectual properties around how you
massage this whole connected system
network to make sure that there is no
block or no barrier to the work yet
information flows what is butting into
the business that's the critical piece
here and and I wanted that for all of
you to know because in any sector you go
to if we do not do that we'll have a
bottleneck tomorrow it's guaranteed you
know we are talking about IOT but can we
handle the if you are thinking of every
millisecond sampling data can we handle
and can the network handle answer is no
so how do we are talking about hot
realtor yeah absolutely the real time
and that's that's exactly where we are
today anyway going back to to the next
last last slide on on on the business
piece is that the the whole solution
what actually kind of just said is is
what I will repeat it's to do with the
tracking of all movements and tracing of
oil that's all we are doing we are not
doing anything mini rocket science but
we are making sure that the oil either
is an essay part is oil or it's a cash
that's it there is no other currency for
it so either the oil is stored in the
ten
or it's in the tanker or is in the pipe
or somewhere but everything should add
to aggregate sum amount all the time and
if I am buying in and then where am I
storing that has been converted into oil
when i'm selling it that has been
converted into cash and that's all we
are doing through the systems making
sure that the oil is protected and oil
is transferred the oil has gone through
the custody transfer the safeway that's
what this the goal is I will tell you a
little bit more and i'm going to show
you our future the way we are visioning
the future with this little animation
again and it's let me tell you what the
story is here the same tank farm manager
is is doing this and I place that tank
tank from manage manager here in bay
area and the idea here is today when
open world happens for example there is
a projection I saw is about 20,000
people every day travel and 60,000
people almost come here and stay during
this period so the population increases
oil demand increases and it becomes a
tremendous amount of jam also so so this
thing is is a common problem today and
many a times as an opportunity to sell
more yet you do not know how to plan it
now in addition to that think about it
if a weather forecast is there and it
says that hey I cannot and I'm getting
the oil from say some place where the
source is inundated with water and you
just cannot get that tanker on time you
are in it even worse mess so an
opportunity lost and and you have
unhappy customers so that's that's
actually today it is true by the way it
is not made-up story you can see a lot
of times that happens so here is the
future
ah welcome to oracle openworld so he is
thinking about the fastest thinking
about all that maybe before selling it
don't worry be happy so what happened
right now is a system automatically
understood that all the way the problem
is there although many world will have
so many people but it is taking the
predictive analytics calculating the
right amount of oil ordering it ahead of
time and you have it and people who are
trying to make money illegally this out
that's the message course it's probably
not true for in San Francisco but it is
true in nigeria and many other countries
be happy so here we are and I like to
hand over to kanishk about the demo it's
it's actually I mean it's a real time
thing but for us here in this case just
to make sure that thing gets flopped
it's not completely real time but but it
gives you the essence of what we are
trying to do or what we are doing here
is a dashboard and Kanishka you want to
take over it is on a very high level
before he goes into the detail you can
see the top top sites are giving you
alerts and it is giving you the state of
the tanks in the tank form and then it
also has it has a few few elements built
in already that we are showing here it
gives you a geographical map and the
location of every one of them and you
can go and drill down into any of the
tank forms and going to the tank level
so it's by that country by the company
by the tank form and then by the tank so
each ID you can go to the lowest
denominator here which is a tank and you
can identify how much oil is there what
is the state of it when when the
maintenance is going to happen all those
forecasting and we are integrating with
the eam like the maintenance modules of
Oracle and we are going through the
whole cycle here it's it's it's actually
the real stuff and in addition to that
here the last piece on a high level I
will tell you it takes care of the
weather forecast in the area and you can
see this is our puja which is in Nigeria
and it actually tells you how much rain
or whatever is
spected and depending upon that it goes
to a predictive analytic cycle and tells
you how much to store under the current
trained so so this is what it does but
as Ganesh goes through the presentation
to be more clear as to how this is
graphically shown to you thank you so
coming to the dashboard you can see
these four blocks these four blocks are
basically indicating into any tank form
how we actually we are telling the
status of each and every tank
irrespective of the job African location
where the tanks are so suppose like if
there is a client named by sahara that's
what ever actually the client is in
nigeria so it's a typical example when
i'm taking it like in nigeria there is a
location Mme and they have a one
particular tank these are the parameters
the kind of fuel what is the shape of
this tank and the level what is internal
temperature volumes different technical
parameters all these informations are
being shown here in the real time so
through this actually the owner can make
out irrespective of the location that
what is exactly the how much amount of
oil is present in my tank now if i see
this particular section map view this
map view because we are talking about
africa
ok
so this is actually telling the
cumulative these yellow dots are
basically telling the locations of the
tanks at different different locations
and you can see the mouse over
information like this is kaduna kaduna
is one place in nigeria so this is a
cumulative information what you can see
here how much is the oil present in the
in that particular time form so just
from one single dashboard he can make
out for each and every site how much oil
is actually present in each of his tank
farm so data which is being actually
coming out from the site is being UV are
actually using we are in planning to use
this particular IOT box the freescale
one so from there we will be sending the
data on the remote server that's on
Oracle cloud and that's what actually we
are showing here if we go down that's
what dr. double chocolaty was telling
that the weather forecast it's a kind of
predictive analysis based on the current
weather today Friday Saturday upcoming
days whether this is real later by the
way you can google again you can go to
weather channel you'll find it this is
real where I'm just refreshing okay
so here you can see based on the
experience of the client he might be
thinking that for upcoming month and
upcoming weeks my oil demand will
decrease like will be like somewhat like
this you can see this blue line but
based on the predictive analysis weather
forecasting and the oil supply demand
and on our software what we are
suggesting him to better to stick off to
this particular plan so this way
actually he can optimally utilized his
assets plus he can actually optimally
make out much how effectively actually
the his investment can be make out so
similarly these these are basically
graph for two different locations abuja
and Mme both are actually located in
Nigeria for that particular client if
you wanted to see this particular
section product consumption product
consumption you just need to select day
twice yeah we just put a little bit the
data looks from here actually you can
make out what is my oil consumption
supply and demand so from this
particular curve client can actually
make out that since last one month what
was my oil supply at which locations the
demand was high it's all actually
location-based location X location Y so
based on that the whole oil consumption
pattern will be terminated and what we
are doing at the back end based on this
pattern plus weather forecasting and
considering other factors also we are
doing the predictive analysis and that's
what we have actually mentioned here so
it's a single dashboard and which is
actually giving lot of information and
another thing is remote communication
status like in case client is actually
looking forward for the data logs
when we are talking about remote
monitoring or real-time information
chances are very high that there might
be some data loss so in case there is
any data loss data loss like there is
any network problem in case the network
was down for which particular day the
network was down how many times the
network was down in a month and for how
much duration that particular
information is being shown here through
this red bar minus forty means like
minus 4 4 minus 40 minutes the network
was down so this is a kind of remote
communication status information dialog
box coming down this is a jeweler's
through the scheduler actually the
client can make out for which tanks I
need to maintain it and for which
particular inspection of our which
particular dates my inspection committee
from government will be coming up to see
my info factor whether i am working fine
or not so these through these schedulers
actually the client can put a reminder
and broadcast it to its number of
locations so that managers can know it
and act and accordingly in a timely
manner let me point one thing out here
very interesting problem in the tank for
management is it's not just a one person
job because there's a their auditors who
come from outside the tank engineers
were involved tank inspectors who are
involved so it's it's actually quite a
bit of collaboration work of any
maintenance in addition to that you know
you have your own maintenance crew so it
is a task that needs to be planned and
coordinated well so what we can do is
using such scheduler it actually can go
into others calendar and it works out
that way and and you know the oil supply
the whole thing that supply and the
demand is also needs to be properly
worked out because if you have four
tanks and one tank is being maintained
you need to make sure that other three
tanks are properly fulfilling the
contracts that you have already signed
so this is a good balance to to do and
it happens to this sort of a software it
actually tells you what's to be done go
ahead
last thing is all about the
notifications like from here this
particular dashboard if there is any
kind of alarm or if any blast has been
generated in particular tank form a
quick notification can be made from this
particular utility similarly using wall
the wall concept like it's a common wall
for the registered number of users they
can actually chat around like in case
there is any calibration needed in case
there is resource pool is required from
one location to another location
immediate prompt information can be made
out so in nutshell this particular
dashboard is a single information system
which is not on which is not at all
giving information only for the
real-time data that how exactly that
date how exactly the oil is being moved
from one location to another location
apart from that the end user of the
client can actually make out the pattern
the usage pattern and from that
particular usage pattern he can even
forecast that how much money I need to
invest into one particular location and
how much oil consumption can I expect
from any particular location so it's a
that kind of dashboard what actually
catalyst has delivered and you can
actually the fun part is you don't need
a computer to access that it is also
mobile friendly so you're pretty good at
anywhere anytime concept and of course
majority of the time you just look into
that and say hey it's all healthy sites
or or or not why it is not healthy if
your is if you are managing that tank
for more you're owning a tank form
something like that so that's that's
pretty much the end of our content here
and I would welcome if you have any
questions and I understand very well
that not all of you are from ong sector
so some of it i wanted to make sure that
you understand what we are trying to do
and how we are trying to make a
difference here and i hope i could
communicate that to you I'm opening two
questions
like a cycle count in warehouse pretty
much is what you're saying right it is
actually policy of the tank firms we we
are agnostic to that but you are
absolutely right there has to be a
procedure and a policy that has to be
implemented for that and each tank firm
does it it is part their handbook it's
not something we dictate we are just
doing the software for them and bringing
the information but you are absolutely
doubt that right that's that's a part of
the management okay I understood what he
was saying hmm industry hasn't matured
so far so I I have to take a guess here
so far that's you are talking about the
data breach here right this is pretty
much that's what you are talking about
something to be thought about because
all the great cards are being blitzed
today but I honestly uh right now we
have not gone so far yet so it's a good
point you raised and I think we should
think about it more more in detail not
just liability division or protecting
ourselves from any liability but more
than that I think how the industry is
going to shape around that because
you're right it's it's a very precious
data and if you think about it if you
just think about it how much of how much
of Tanks how many tanks are there in the
world how much of oil is being reserved
every day and the amount of wealth that
is its enormous just for the aviation
industry itself it's it's tremendous
amount I mean it's not in so many so
many gas stations are in the in the
street and all of that is taking this
from the tank farms and then it is
coming from the production when you look
at the whole thing you're absolutely
absolutely right there's trillions of
dollars right there you know around the
world and the protection of that is very
critical and probably more it gets
matured these questions are bound to
come I mean I would not want to imagine
lycÃ©e that
have an answer for it but but I I can
see where you're coming from you're
right yeah but i always say one thing
about the security thing i ask this
question this is an interesting point
though it's a different angle i asked
many of many many of my friends so you
aren't for so many years in your life
how much money do you have in your hand
they show that great guards right
there's almost no money in the pocket
it's all with the bank now that's real
asset you can you're trusting all your
whole life earning with an entity
outside your home yet that has happened
but if we talk about that back in 1870s
when the first bank started nobody
wanted to give anything even back of
america was a custody of united states
government right for fed reserve they
they couldn't move the gold from west to
the east is why bank of america got
formed and they were having a
representation the west coast because it
would be looted in the paths right that
that was the story so so when people are
used to giving their own or entire lives
earning to another entity with a trust
that it will be back to me I'm sure
information is going to be the same way
although we are having the human cry
today a lot so yeah but let that unless
you fight it out I have no one to say
about it any other question sure
yes yes yes that's exactly what is
happening what it is constant monitoring
those those servo gauge that he was
talking about or the radar it constantly
monitoring now whenever there is a
volume up or down if it is not already
planned for like we have a sale upcoming
or we have a purchase upcoming if it is
not then there is some suspicious
activity right there so so you actually
the alert is generated based on a
predicted transaction versus an
unpredicted transaction and that's
that's exactly how the intelligence
works yes erp yes no it is primarily see
most of these are contract-based
transactions so you pretty much know
that this day will sell this much in
this day it's still that way but you are
right that might be the next step what
do you think the nation yeah even then
it's actually the contract based
transactions but the pilferage actually
happens in specially majorly it has been
observed when at the time we are
actually when the guy is actually
issuing a few so at that time pilferage
happens and when actually the oil is
being moved in the truck from one point
to another point wait like driver
doesn't have any liability like how much
all he has actually taken and how much
all he will be dispensing and how
actually they cover up that should be
the next question they actually put
water they actually put kerosene and oil
so when we when the game is all about
measuring the volume so at that time the
guy can simply put oil of water of war
kerosene or water so as to patch up the
difference in case how much oil he is
actually extracted from the truck so
that in in front of honor honor would be
the impression that hey i have taken i
have issued some x amount of oil and i
am getting x amount of oil but actually
x minus y has pilferage has already have
so we do have that sensors and that
information we connect that system with
our gsm GPRS devices through which
actually at that particular latin long
we can make out that at what time the
lid was open by using our capacitance
and magnet or destructive sensors plus
we sending the data into gsm or GPRS
modem and then sending it to the server
then displaying it to the dashboard
making out the reports pilferage reports
on that but this is entirely yeah just
but also i think what it was what is
about to mention but a skip that step
i'm getting into that the tankers also
are equipped with sensors that the oil
tankers that carry oil so the amount you
are selling is the amount it should go
up but now that's something for example
by the way this is interesting because
the business model of oil transaction is
going to change today it will be
surprised to know because not everyone
has tanked forms in every geography so
you might be surprised at the BP is
filling the real retail station gas
stations from actually chevron that
actually happens it's a very high level
contract between the oil suppliers and
whoever is close by it can fill it but
if you have a complete system in your
control where you have that tank as well
as the tanker the trucks both of them
have the sensors implemented then you
know exactly how much oil is being sold
to this tanker and that is exactly how
much oil has gone up so so that type of
control we'll have to be more Universal
it's not there yet but but that to
answer your question absolutely to the
like the beyond doubt sort of a answer
would probably be when it is universally
implemented and universally accepted
standard that every tanker has to have
the sensor and the reading has to be
transferred back to the custody honor
all those things these are some it's not
technical issues though it is more like
a practice issue if the practice changes
towards that I think the pilferage can
be taken out of that equation but but
it's still a way out
sure sure completely agree with you it
is it is very very very very big problem
that's actually our absolutely
absolutely so just in order to solve
that particular problem that's what
actually our effort is towards putting
our own hardware's and putting such kind
of dashboards so that actually a real
track-and-trace 2407 can be done so this
is just an effort to achieve that we are
we are making in a cloud and you a using
electro fill out for that thing yeah
yeah thank you so much but indeed it is
is these are these are challenges in the
industry and hopefully we can do a
little bit to improve but I don't know
we're putting in effort towards it sir
thank you very much for your time
appreciate thank you sir attendance here
