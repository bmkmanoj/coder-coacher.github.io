another dev live session I'm your host
Javed Mohammed and I have as my guest
today Simon Carter who's director of
product management for VM and VM box so
Simon welcome thank your vantage of it
so great seeing you again again yes s4
tells you from Milan yeah how was the
weather out there so yeah now it's very
hot it's very high starting from this
week we are we had a very hot time or
the weather and yeah you know it's
summer as usual in Italy so hot so
Moscow is going up and down but under
this valley it's a bit it's a bit colder
here yeah all right so Simon I know you
have a presentation later on today you
and fellows give us a little of you into
that one you're talking about DevOps and
you're talking about Linux and the VM
and VM box are can be used in to create
an environment for DevOps you know give
us a little preview into that yeah yeah
sure
so during during the session I'm I'm
going to show how you can be live really
well and those survey producible
environment based on Linux Oracle Linux
beautiful edition solution like for
example VirtualBox and at the same time
other tools like vagrant or docker for
example and you know the target of a
devops environment is to build a
solution is to build an environment for
developers where they can always work
suppose that you have for example an
engineering team working on one unique
solution from different laptops
different desktop environment the target
of DevOps is to build this same
environment for all developers the same
environment that you will also use on a
production system and thanks to this
open source stuff these solutions based
on Oracle Linux visualization so visual
box vagrant and docker I'll show how you
can really build a really ball and
for this whole environment that can be
used on on laptops desktop environment
of developing but at the same time for
the production so basically so using all
of those of using Linux and and VM and
VM box and darker and vagrant you can
create the same environment from in the
development to test to QA to operations
yes yeah so while we were off camera and
you were telling me a little bit about
what your presentation is about
something intrigued me you talked about
DevOps being something that you can
create in a single user environment as
well as in a in a large team and I
thought that was very odd because why
would why would you need DevOps in a
single user environment DevOps in a
single user environment can be helpful
because you can always start from the
same base from the same operating system
release with the same libraries with the
same version of everything while you are
going to build your solution and at the
same time helps you to build an
environment in some second instead of
installing an operating system or
instead of fetching an operating system
using this technologies like vagrant or
docker you can build a development
environment in seconds instead of maybe
of hours together
so regardless of a single user are you
at a team you still want to be able to
recreate that same environment for
development test and production and for
example you can also you can always nap
your work so you can get snapshot and
you can come back can come back in case
of problems so it's also helpful to a
single developer but obviously it's much
more for a team working on on the
solution ok and you want to talk a
little bit about what Oracle offers in
this space get what are called offers in
this place for virtually we have the
Oracle VM VirtualBox
so our visualization solution for the
desktop side but at the same time also
for Linux and it's also important to
remember that Oracle Linux is completely
free abuse and you can also have updates
without any
any charge and so it's also important
that Oracle Linux so the operating
system that you can use to develop your
solution can be the same operating
system with the same patch level that
you're going also to use on the
production system so both VM box and
then exactly I mean you can't be that
yeah yeah alright and obviously this is
for the desktop side of the solution we
also have this other side of the
solution that is based on Oracle VM
server and and also the same Oracle
Linux okay so from a DevOps standpoint
so looking at now more of a larger team
environment what are some of the
considerations that you cover in your
presentation
are there some best practices that
you'll be talking about that that help
to create a DevOps culture gap yep sure
so the present into the presentation
I'll I'll do a bit a brief interaction
to the develops and also to different
solutions that came up in the past to
add for the DevOps environment at the
same time then I'll move to the products
so I'll move to Oracle VM VirtualBox and
move to Oracle Linux vagrant docker
showing what you can obtain by
dissolution by this product and then at
the end I'll show you I'll show also a
brief demo or what you can do using this
kind of this product well it sounds like
a very exciting presentation and I hope
all the attendees over here will come
and check it out thank you one last
thing I think last time we met oh one of
the last times we met I think was it at
open world a lot of them suffers we
discussed about the your local villains
soccer team and you again telling me
some interesting things that happen
before our conversation and after you
wanna just tell us about that just so
fast yeah the views we find that when we
had that conversation in San Francisco
this seemly the name is Atlanta lost six
messages and middle in a row in a row
and after that matches this this little
team once
maybe all the matches after and now is
fifth in the league while next year
Atalanta will also play the the Europa
League excellent
yeah so you you did the difference
I brought good luck I can be their
mascot yeah I think there's probably
better-looking people than me that's
okay Simon thank you so much for coming
and all the best with the presentation
thank you - thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
