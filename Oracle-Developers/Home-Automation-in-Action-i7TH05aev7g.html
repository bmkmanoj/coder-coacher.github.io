from the south java sales group I'm
sales consultant we've been with some
and so this is now my I think 7th chava
one so it's getting excited again so
next year please more people join so um
we have a short talk today about home
automation in action and I'm here to
support my partners mr. hot from
processed and Socko he's a technical guy
he should be on this as well so we will
change it in the final presentation
slides so I will start up and basically
set the rate frame around it and then I
will hand over to mr. hot and he will go
a bit more deeply and you will see so I
do basically the upper part and then
read about the developer view and soccer
will do a demo and then we have some
conclusions let's start so everybody
here if you're not interested in
Internet of Things leave now so this is
my slide to show you that is about the
big Internet of Things story of course
Internet of Things contains many many
many many things and many architectures
and that is here one I think it's very
critical in the years forward and it has
a big advantage to be a bit faster than
most of the others so it's almost there
already so it's good is a developer to
invest time take a look and and start
developing applications so a lot of the
Internet of Things is driven by more the
back end guys who wanted more data and
other stuff so m2m but there are also
market drivers I think are very critical
here to keep in mind if you look at this
space the one and obvious is a
smartphone so you as a software
developer maybe don't appreciate or you
will appreciate what this start did for
your world because you have a device and
every
but it might as if your java developer
not really change your world there are
other markets like the embedded market
where the smartphone certainly in the
hand of the management of the people
change this mindset of people doing
embedded and that's a very powerful
motivation and about powerful thing so
usually I don't talk to java developers
at all I have to evangelize this stuff
to people who do C or C++ or even
assembler so I have to explain to them
why Java it's a good thing and so on I
don't have to tell you I'm
miniaturization though everything gets
smaller everything which is now a gauge
where you will we have a boxer which is
still a box like this I expect in two
years to be a box like this and then
eventually it will just be in the socket
somewhere and you would not even know
that you have a box in the upper ability
so price of father of this in the Obama
really very very important in the
Internet of Things it's all about things
talking to each other and not to a
back-end only so as much as it pains
Oracle that not every day that will go
to the back end it doesn't make sense
for a lot of things so you need this
interoperability and that's a powerful
driver for three and also place and time
suddenly becomes important if you think
about something like a smart city or
telematics where you are what you're
doing locally that makes a lot of sense
for the device so if you talk to
embedded developers and to embedded
companies but again most of the people i
do they still sink in this wrapped box
black box design they come from usually
a very hardware level MCU kind of thing
where they don't really program a lot um
they nowadays think about linux of
putting operating system on top but
still its rings wrap they think about
one application maybe two they want to
do so like a display application or a
data application and a lot of sis is
about device and hardware and the other
plus point
network is an afterthought oh of course
you have tcp/ip and then you think about
it so you have it in the box but you're
not really thinking as a design
perspective on it and the other thing is
intelligence is something that happens
in the cloud adds a lot of their
thinking because they don't want to take
care on in the device and it's small and
expensive and so on and this is for my
perspective not the right the view on
embedded devices because they will
become more smarter there is a use case
for it and you should do it so we are in
a preaching situation for the embedded
market and all java and developers can
help bridge this and move this fall
forward further along and faster we go
from this custom development one use
case at a time to basically layering
sings so whoever did Java EE this is the
time that we transition from khabar to
Java EE so we are this time we are
thinking from we make mom input
application framework and Cobra was nice
and we couldn't interconnect and
everything but everybody had a different
solution then Java EE came it was not as
good as khabar at the beginning really
not as good but it has this wonderful
idea we have one horizontal platform who
does everything for everybody and it did
win out and that's the thing we are
talking here about one horizontal
platform which does a lot of things for
most of the people out of the box and we
think it will win out and that is what
it gives you it gives you certainly
something which has local intelligence
but which is modular and can be taken
out of the indent of the cloud on a
device it runs separate and the seas but
it's still downloadable like an app
store like a smartphone and this is a
slide people now in embedded understand
because they have a smartphone in their
hands because they know how to go to a
Google or an apple app store and
download an application so actually I Oh
wrong
I showed this slide already like four or
five years ago when smartphones we're
not dominant yet and people looked at me
and they didn't get it now they get it
that's good um so one of the core
components in this myriad of devices and
we will have this variable devices which
are tiny or part of your socks or
whatever and there are layoffs of sizes
and one very critical component is the
smart gateway actually this is a breath
it slide I also slightly updated from a
slider didim embedded world for years
ago the first time we're only hardware
developers are and they looked at this
and still didn't get it but hopefully it
will spread around so you interface
between the things which are in your
local network and you know they are
connected by bluetooth sig b/c wave
whatever local network connectivity you
connect it to a device that knows it
that's the Gateway it has not only
connectivity it has smart for smartness
and it is applications and then the
applications talk to the back-end data
stream so they will talk to the
enterprise they will talk to I don't
know a web shopping application though
if your refrigerator is empty it goes to
where else and orders milk or whatever
and somebody delivers it next year um so
that's it and basis again and it has a
few layered things which are very
critical so it has the Java Virtual of
machine um it wouldn't it wouldn't be
here and expected here knows of the true
machine so it's about Jala it abstracts
a platform it has this GI server
container which basically gives you a
description of the modules and the
applications and burn it has other
layers of IP you need to really make a
complete solution so um the lower part
of basically like Java EE and then the
higher part is basically your
application framework what you would
develop on
and then of top that's the little boxes
there are the real applications and my
prediction is that a lot of these
applications for multi-platform will be
developed over time at the moment the
most service providers think about their
own ecosystem and very you know planned
applications but there's coming the time
at the moment where a lot of unplanned
innovation is happening and and this is
the point to be and create things for
healthcare for energy and other markets
so um again I shows this slide lot to
not java developers but there are as a
java developers are a few key points you
have to to understand which convinces
people to move to java slowly but they
they are convinced one key component is
security it has a very clear security
modal model which is clear
understandable and it's across all
devices the not everybody needs to do it
develop his own always perfect security
model there was a company in Germany
that produced the heating system a
remote you know what you have in your
cellar a remote heating system and with
IP and everything and then some guy by
chance found out that you could tell
Nate in it it was not a port 25 they
actually choose another port I don't
know any but by chance he did a port
scan and found it and root password
surprise surprise was rude and though
they actually had to send out like their
service people to go up and upgrade the
software on those things and this was in
winter so um the chant that your heating
system would work or somebody would hack
it from the network it was open to the
whole internet wasn't really a good
thing and they apologized in the
newspaper with a big saying that they
failed and so on so security is very
important in this and that's a key
component a good selling argument for
zar java and of course it's easily
scalable but between the smallest and
the highest so whenever you talk to C++
guys or to see guys tell them to give
you this as a standard
not that everybody can develop it by
himself of course you can but a standard
across all the reservations and I will
not be able to do this um that's about
Java see very shortly in case you're not
don't know the embedded binaries so we
have a standard set of binaries for on
powerpc and x86 they are very small java
SE it's a complete set we have java SE 7
update 40 now as far as I remember it
has hard float support for our if
somebody is asking and it has these
optimizations for embedded so it has
something like if there is not enough
memory it has ways to react create an
event and other stuff which your
enterprise binaries don't and so it's
it's very useful for embedded and it's
fully java SE um oh it's GI on top you
need it basically to virtualize your
applications it needs this part where
you wrap your design in bundles or
applications so what we are doing here
is basically creating something like an
operating system well again you have a
level of your you have your AP ice and
you have your runtime your ex or
whatever and then you have your
description what an application is and
that is actually what osgi dots and it
has another big advantage it allows you
if you have a good back-end system to
remotely deploy applications
standardized with a remote management
system so you can remotely update
applications or part of it or libraries
over a lifetime and please consider that
in an Internet of Things world there
might be I don't know a million gateways
out in the market which run different
applications each run with different
applications that because the home owner
it puts applications on there out of
your catalog and then you need to update
these libraries and you can't do an
administrator who locks in remotely in
everything so it's not Enterprise world
you need this to update in a concise
and that was all those two IVs framework
gives you a man it has these benefits
that it also gives you as a as a
developer this reduces complexity you
could also all of this again do just
with Java and build your own container
format and everything and you can do it
and the other are is other possibilities
but this is again a standard way to do
it and has been around I don't know
since some kind of throw away what was
called Java embedded server 14 years ago
15 years ago and they always joy for
room took it and really created a good
product and standardization out of it
and this gives you all these big
benefits now so it's been used mostly in
enterprise applications so all
applications of us now use it but now
it's coming to the embedded and there is
not the first and that's not the last
step in this iteration so we are on on a
road to the future and there are a lot
of things added have been added already
and will be added on top of this
standard platform over time so we are
now where we have all this on the right
side but we don't know what is the next
step so and that will be added as a
standard platform and it will support
what more things so that's about some
value of a middleware like java ee
developed over time so there is one
slide and I think I hand over to Thomas
who can play explain it much better and
myself
i think i can get it gets us Mike here
hello okay fine right everybody thanks
very much before I just step into the
slides let me just you know give you a
set of an idea i mean about my company
the company is called processed we are
on since 1997 and from a very beginning
you know we've been a pure java company
it was not kind of exceptional at the
time we joined the OSGi in 1999 and from
a very beginning we had this kind of
vision that's about the slide know that
you need some some local intelligence in
in local area networks and that was as
we found out much too early in the end
we all know that m2m so far just means
you have some actors and sensors some
devices fairly dumb devices that send
some data to the cloud and then all the
applications are really cloud
applications and we at the time we
thought you know there has to be and
when I started working actually that was
in the early 80s if that 10 pcs and
people thought you have couple of dumb
terminals and a few servers and that's
that's all you need and so our vision
was we need kind of an embedded server
and that's how we called our products or
our implementation is called embedded
server and now coming to that slide why
did we think we need this we need this
just because local smartness gives you
much more flexibility it right now I
mean for Oracle that's why it's probably
the first runners mentioning the most
concern here is to manage the flow of
data so the idea is instead of sending
raw data into the cloud you can locally
process the data you can locally filter
the data you can do event processing of
all time of all type and that's that's I
think the main key on Oracle's a point
of view the other thing is obviously if
the network is often this might happen
that the cloud is not on for for a while
then you still want to manage your
heating system or whatever if the
electricity is cut off and either they I
don't want to get too in too much detail
but you can just and secure
30 is one of the major concerns with
local intelligence you can enhance
security quite a lot easier setup and
extension is actually one of the major
use cases right now because what you
need is really interoperability so the
problem in a smart home adults in other
local area networks especially in the
industries that you had to have a lot of
different protocols where all the actors
and sensors are connected with so you
have you know and people I know ten
years ago has all started we're all
complaining that there is not a standard
for connectivity and we all know there
will never be a standard for
connectivity we have in the home we have
bluetooth and zigbee and they have new
standards coming along like is that wave
in ocean and how you call them and you
have in the car you have these bus
systems and you know i mean the problem
so what we came up with and that's
actually something we brought into the
osgi as a specification request that's
kind of a 98 whatever pages document is
an abstraction layer so basically
something we're developers in the end
can know can say see this is kind of a
switch this is a washing machine
regardless of the protocol it's
connected with so that's one thing then
okay I leave it here maybe the next
picture now before we really dive into
this home automation stuff I just like
to stress that we as processed and all
our friendly competitors that are
offering this kind of stacks are really
not only locked into the smart home
market we do a lot of business in the
aromatic space these days people realize
that it makes sense to have more
diagnostic more kind of get closer to
the to the driver to the driving
behavior we do a lot of health and there
are various industry 4.0 solutions what
we actually offer as process is the
complete middleware so we don't we
basically offer one thing that the
platform that runs on on the devices
whether these are
telematic on bought units or smart home
or whatever kind of gateway type of
devices they come with a lot of
additional features that are not
standard and they come with a good
tooling sets or to enable you to very
easily develop evident and optimized
applications and then what what what's
equally important on the back end side
on the the bridge to the enterprise we
offer a remote management system that
allows you to administer those gateways
in the field that allows you to do
device management to do the lifecycle
management to do software updates and
all that stuff so that the beauty of
this or SDI technology which is
scalability and remote management can
really be utilized now yeah finally
smart home I think that one we had
before there's as we all know kind of a
smart home kind of evolution we came a
long way I don't want to basically
explain the past I think we all know the
past I really want to look at the future
and the future is really kind of very
very much sort of a nap type of world
which we all know from the smartphone
environment there are a lot of I mean I
don't worry for the time that just if
you think of apps in the home or
connected to the home because it's got
home automation is one thing but from
there you can go into else you can go
into a and energy management security
and all those use cases that the thing
is you know how do we really get an
ecosystem going where everybody does
what he can do best a thing on the
smartphone market has shown us how how
that can be done that needs that means
we need an open platform where everybody
who is good in a particular field PD
hell speed security beard family care
can build an application and put it on
the on an infrastructure that's generic
infrastructure as that there so that
people can really just focus on
and what they are good at on their
applications now this is sort of your
point of view the application
development but what's equally important
and that's something that we have
already proven is that one needs to
build an ecosystem and we had process we
started off with basically the hardware
side so two or three years ago we
started off having customers like Zach
salsa te who are by sumitomo and the
whole the whole range really right now
we have people like Cisco you Justin out
last week that stmicro was going to have
a system on the chip I just talked to
one of the people there there is one
overlay you've seen it very interested
as independent advice platform which is
launched by Ventura by Intel which comes
with an SDK so everybody who is was
really interested in that market is
realizing that this kind of architecture
this kind of ecosystem is arising and
that's why people yeah bring-bring
austria on their chips and they are the
gateway then what's equally important is
a lot of system integrators that have
embraced that technology so one our
customers for example RT systems
alcatel-lucent or for example Amdocs
trust now the nice video about home
automation from M dogs &amp;amp; M docks really
has a complete offering for telcos and
they go to all the telcos all around the
world and offer this kind of
architecture us with process to the
software then obviously all the solution
to the ious visa solution providers I
mean we have a lot of customers you know
starting from abb and eaten very big
ones but we have dozens of smaller
companies that use our software to
develop telematics application
smartphone application and all that and
that's really I think shows that people
are investing into this that's actually
how we recruit right now most of our
customers because these guys they win
customers that then use our software
last not least obviously we talk about
the telcos
and the telcos we are not so difficult
to get because there is kind of a not so
well-known standardization body which is
called the hgi the home gateway
initiative where all the telcos gathered
and basically decided on a speck on the
reference architecture for smart homes
of the future and they frankly they got
together because I didn't want that the
same happens to them that they
experience in the smartphone market so
that people like Google and Apple just
went you know directed to their
customers and they just became a bit
pipe they were very especially I mean
this is a tree I staff really started
off very actively in Europe the European
companies yeah I reckon are a little bit
more standard oriented and the rest of
the world but since the rest of the
world is now seeing that this is really
serious standard that evolving here and
people like you know AT&amp;amp;T digital life
you probably know this project runs
process software we have customers in
Mayan system Sisco and customers
everywhere outside of Germany now god
that's that's basically the ecosystem
that was all around apps and that's how
we see the future what's very very
important here I mean when we start over
i was telling you back in the 1990's we
thought how do we get a reference
architecture that's really accepted
generally accepted by by all the
participants in this ecosystem and we
knew that standard would be key I mean
it's one thing we knew it has to be an
openness absolutely neutral platform
that everybody has access to but also it
has to comply it was a lot of standards
and we said it's not good enough just to
comply with standards we have to drive
the standards so we joined the osgi 1999
we've been very active there we have a
board seat in the osgi we are leading
expert groups I was just talking about
the specification for the abstraction
layer the hgi is the other thing I just
mentioned we've been
active in the broadband forum with
zigbee is that way if now it's etsy m2m
that's just key to to have standeth now
yeah let's have a little bit of closer
look at our smart home stack again I
said it's not only just an osgi platform
it comes with a lot of additional
features one feature is this home device
manager which is basically the
abstraction layer I was just mentioning
which allows you to connect easily that
wave zigbee and proprietary protocols
and then all the sensors and actors that
speak this language there's also a home
automation manager which sets certain
rules so that you know if the motion
detector detects a motion doesn't go to
the cloud and the titian decisions made
on the cloud but there's a kind of a
local intelligence with which says okay
then we call the doctor or whatever okay
and that's not fun what we want to show
the demo with this time we want to have
enough time to show the tremendous so
the end-to-end architecture then just
looks like that the yellow saying is the
home gateway where we have the osgi
framework the additional features that
the entire Middle where where the apps
are running it connects to all the
actors and sensors why are various
protocols it connects to all sorts of
devices tablets smartphones pcs to allow
the the interaction further for the user
and then the we connected obviously to a
powerful back-end system and our
back-end system this remote management
system is just a tiny part of the entire
back-end system it's actually one of the
first enterprise systems in the world
that has been based on Java it's very
modular it is very easy to integrate it
in existing back office systems and so
it's really been used by quite a few
telecoms telcos in the meantime okay the
isvs I was talking about the solution
providers
using the software so that's once again
where do we come into play we have this
software running on the gateways we have
the remote management system and we have
the tools in the SDKs that run on the
developer pc developer view I think I
hand over to right now you switch me on
again it or not if not it okay so um to
develop this applications you can start
easily i mean it's posed to I base but
if you really want to try out
application it's best to have to
complete API sir um and that's where
from process you have this three parts
basically the first the same as om
toolkit um that's basically a blocking
or set of plugins for eclipse that gives
you all the api's pre-prepared comes
with demo code and you basically load it
in Eclipse and you Sokka later we'll
show a bit of this and that is another
very very important part it's a profiler
so of course you need to remember that
the box you're running on might have
maybe 256 megabytes or from or even less
so creating very well behaved and not to
memory critical applications it's very
important and that's where you need
profiling for and believe me it's much
more important than on the enterprise
space because remember there is no user
to interact so there is no administrator
who can go in and fix a problem which
came along on the way so you have to
profile deeper and create more use case
tests and of course you need a you have
a set of plugins so you have better
understanding for the hardware and other
stuff so that's how it looks soccer
later will show more detail and I wanted
to to give you a short framing on the
demo we are showing there are basically
two modes for the developer
the one mode is basically as a developer
and test mode so you have a box on you
can take a raspberry pi or whatever to
as a hardware platform and you develop
your code you takes a thing and deploy
it and test it on it and also you have
emulator on your desktop i highly
recommend to test every application on a
device running and profiling that's
really critical that's a developer view
but then in practice in the real
deployment whenever a telco or a service
provider goes out with these folks in
the market you have not as a user or as
a developer access to the direct box so
like this Apple you are not you're not
going to deploy directly to the device
you're doing the other view our sorry
this is the web administration control
if you are developing so the other view
is and that's the realistic view in if
you have a market go you know a gone to
market deployment is that you deploy to
an application database basically so you
you upload your application it goes
through a ref you cycle and there are
really good reasons to go through a ref
you cycle actually I think even more on
better reasons than doing on a
smartphone because imagine in a real
home home automation world you're
allowing this thing to open and close
your doors starting up your heating it
going it down operating on your stuff
and also observing you while you are
acting and you really don't want this
data to be shared with other people if
you don't approve it and that's very
critical and then of course you the user
goes into the application portal and
download the application you have
developed so this is important because
we will chose this in the demo there's a
view case for you to understand now
that's it I shut up so I could takes
over and he shows the demo go get the
mic hey everyone so I'll try to make
short to demo
of the cubic own project so this is a
project that was that is developed by
dodge telecom with the partnership of
crosses to know Rocco and I just want to
say that my demo will not be very
impressive in terms of devices that I am
going to show because I couldn't bring
much hardware here but if you go to the
cubicle site then you can see a lot of
nice videos about the project and I'm
just I'll just just just try to explain
the the infrastructure that dodge
telecom provides
okay so first i want to show you this
box this is the cubic on box the home
gateway that is used it is an with an
arm cpu around 1 gigahertz and linux
embedded jdk from oracle yes sorry
unfortunately no the user interface is
in German so i'll be explaining or what
you see so it's a product currently only
for a German naturally since the Dutch
telecom product people will be available
it will be available in the market next
month I think and yeah at some point it
will be also available in other
countries so the interface will be
translated in english definitely at some
point ok so so about the box yes it has
it runs in belen jdk from oracle and the
processed home automation stack posts a
number of deutsche telekom applications
on top so it uses web interface to
access the box and currently i'm
connected directly to the box so the
users can do that from the home network
they can connect directly to their box
and administrate and use their
applications but there is also a home
portal provided by dodge telecom so you
can access your gateway from anywhere in
the world as long as you have internet
of course ok so i will gin
so now this is the dashboard of the
cubicle where you can have a number of
applications installed and you can run
them from from this from these icons and
currently there is only a single
application which is called the basic
client that I'll show you or later but
first let me just say that when you when
you buy for example this box you also
need to set up your network and in this
case I have a zigbee delicacies
controller and i also have a for knox
binary switch zigbee and i have a lamp
connected to the binary switch so that
i'll be able to turn on off the lamp
using the ZigBee protocol and us reiner
and thomas saying you can connect a lot
of different controllers to this box it
has four USB port so you can poke
different controllers and control Z wife
or home attic or in ocean or any kind of
device as long as it has the same
functionality for example binary switch
in the same way so the home the device
abstraction layer obstructs the protocol
so the first thing you need to do is
probably to pair the device to your
network so deutsche telekom provides
this pairing wizard where you can see a
number of device windows currently the
list is kind of short but in the final
product to be much bigger so we choose
for Knox we choose this particular
device and then we have a wizard that
shows us the steps we need to do in
order to pair this device to add this to
our network unfortunately obviously the
interfaces in German so I'll skip that
and go directly to the basic client so
I've already paired this device to the
network and then i can open
the basic client and I can see all the
devices that I currently have in my
network and I currently have a single
zigbee device and the interface
recognizes that this device is a binary
switch so it puts this button here that
I can use to toggle my device on off and
so what happens when I when I click the
button is that the the browser sends a
JSON request the Gateway the Gateway
processes this request sends it using a
zigbee driver to the logistic and it
sends it to the device and as I see this
happens rather quickly so there's the
system is very responsive which i think
is pretty cool considering all the
hardware and software components
involved in this ok so this is the part
considering the users now deutsche
telekom provides this basic client
application but the their goal is not to
write applications themselves so they
have this partnership program where a
partner partner companies can use this
platform to develop applications and
then sell them to the end content
customers so i'll just quickly show you
some of the tools that are available for
this partner companies one of the tools
that is so from Reiner is the weapon min
console so this is based on the Apache
web cool so that if you are noisy I
developer you most probably familiar
with but it has some additional plugins
like the home devices pogin where you
can see your devices and you can get
information about the devices
and you can even invoke actions on these
devices and choose to toggle it okay so
this is this is a tool for developers
when you when you are connecting your
devices to the network testing them you
can use this and the other two that i'm
going to show is the key icon sdk it's
based on eclipse based on the end to get
plugins from processed but they are
extended to add additional deutsche
telekom specific functionality so i'll
try to create quickly an application
that is able to control this device so
what you have to do is create a new
project and as you see there is a
specific project type called cubic on
application
and just to be quick i will create the
project based on existing sample there
are a number of template's available and
i'm sure that there will be much more
other templates in the SDK in the future
ok
so as you see the SDK generates a lot of
content automatically and I just quickly
show you what it taught in generates for
example it generates this icon this will
be the DD icon of your application on
the dashboard so you can replace it to
have your own icon this here is the
folder for java source currently the
template i chose only has web interface
it has no java code in it but you can
easily add your java classes here if you
want to run any java code on the gateway
to use the walk away p ice of the home
automation layer or to register your own
servlet in the oil judge server or
whatever else you would want to do and
then it generates its generated some web
interface web application it's a basic
basic HTML that lists all the binary
switch devices and provides way to
control them so that's just an example
that that you can use to start with and
then develop your your own nice
application so to to deploy it again
it's pretty simple you just click the
application bundle and say installed to
then you can slay you can select two
options you can select to install this
on a back-end server which tryna showed
you you can deploy it on a cart and then
it can be downloaded to multiple such
devices or you can put it in on your
local box or you're developing your
application and testing it so that's I'm
going to do now
and so if we refresh the interface now
we see the new application on the
dashboard we can click it so this is the
index HTML that you got to solve here
that's that that th and other is
automatically generated by the SDK and
it leads list this binary switch and you
can switch it on or off
okay so was like quick enough to click
last time
feedback
so okay that was a short demo and of
course it was very simple but we wanted
to show you the different steps which
are in this you know so from an
application developers perspectives the
first steps the initial thing is it's
very easy and please keep in mind this
is a project that goes to market so I
think fifty thousand devices for the
first start budget on the comp ring will
bring on the market and sell and they
expecting it to grow very fast and they
are not the only one sir very similar
projects at the moment in us in Europe
and other stuff so this is really
something you can start developing for
and think about ideas and of course you
can use as explained the Raspberry Pi
and everything to try this out at home
and on you know get it application wise
but the idea for this is and that's very
important to keep in mind is to upscale
development so um we are here to as you
might have heard from the Internet of
Things discussions to give you a
platform which is ready which has all
components you need from a platform
layer and then you decide and develop
higher-level applications so um the
market will need and that's my personal
prediction and i think i will be very
Riedel is it is the market will meet
specific solutions which are on this
personal healthcare or pet management or
whatever and that is where the
innovation will happen and we think java
is plus osgi is the key platform for
this and I've looked around there of
course small people doing different
competitive solutions and that's all
fine but I think this will create this
larger ecosystem for developer why you
as a Java developer natural fit to go in
and develop these applications
so that's my conclusions and I I would
stop here thank you all and if you have
any questions we are happy to answer
some cow that's from processed so it's a
it's a known specialized optimized for
these embedded environments yeah and
it's anybody else
okay though okay so thanks again for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
