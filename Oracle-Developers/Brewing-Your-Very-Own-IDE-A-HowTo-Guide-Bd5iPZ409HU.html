Berlin cough and I'm very glad you're
here I understand this is the last
session so I really appreciate you here
so in today we're going to be talking
about IntelliJ IDEA platform and how to
build a professional developer tools on
top of it so the whole start I would
like to tell you a little about history
of IntelliJ ADM everything started
how many of you oh yeah sorry
so in uh we got first release in 2000
first it was IntelliJ IDEA
1.0 and after that we have a major
release every year so and this year we
will have IntelliJ IDEA 14 preview is
already available so you can play with
it and tell us what you think so all
these years it was a the years of
refactorings motorisation in introducing
new features a lot of features so and
finally in 2009 we go to open source we
released the open source version of
IntelliJ IDEA called IntelliJ IDEA
Community Edition and we introduced
IntelliJ platform so this is a official
birthday now I would like to tell you
about what platform is at the very low
level we have a bigger container I don't
know how many of you have heard about
bigger container ok that's that's really
good this is what is because what is
bigger container bigger container is
inversion of control container for
components that uses dependency
injection button it's pretty comparable
to spring or Google juice in so how how
it works actually all components are
registered in plug-in XML files so and
at the very beginning we read all these
files and then register components to
pick a container
we have three types of components its
application components project
components in model components and they
all have the own life cycle for instance
application components are loaded at the
very beginning when you start IDE you
see splash and a little progress what
does it mean actually at at the very
beginning we load all the plugins in
plugin xml files and the second part we
actually registering and loading
application components so that's why you
have to wait a little and when you open
a project for instance he also can see a
model progress bar this is how we load
project components and now let's take a
look at a plugin xml structure it's
pretty simple when you start to develop
a plugin you have to create it in
provide name of your plugin simple than
unique ID description what is the plugin
about the inversion and then very useful
tag it's changed nodes so for instance
if you have a different versions of a
plug in it for users that will be useful
to take a look what you do and then you
can provide some information about you
it can be a company name or just a link
to your github repository doesn't matter
so here you can provide URL email logo
and so on
for the plugins we support dependencies
in at the moment we have two types of
dependencies first one is just a regular
it's for instance if you have a plug-in
and you plug in depends on another
plugin then if that other plug-in is not
enabled or is not presented in the
system your plug-in won't be loaded so
that's all for instance if that plug-in
just failed to load your plugin is as
well will be disabled
another type of dependencies is optional
dependency you can create XML file and
provide all components you would like to
register if and only if some plugin
exists and enabled so that that's easy
if a plugin does not include any model
dependency tags in its plugin XML it's
humid to be a legacy plug-in and it's
loaded only in IntelliJ IDEA all tomato
Community Edition and these are the
following models are currently available
in all products based on IntelliJ IDEA
platform so if you would like a plug-in
will be enabled in all ideas based on
top of IntelliJ IDEA platform you have
to define at least one dependency
I used to provide only one dependency to
come dot IntelliJ that modulus dot
platform and that's enough to make my
plug-in available on all IDs so here how
we register components for the pker
container there is three sections first
is application components and
it's everything is simple here you have
to provide some interface class class it
will be like a key for the picker
container and then implementation and
the same way you register project
components and model components
extension points what are extension
points an extension point is kind of as
a sort of plugin for a feature or any
data provider for a feature for instance
if you have a code completion you can
provide a data for code completion pop
up everywhere from different languages
you don't need to reinvent your code
completion pop up and everything so I
here's example how we can define
extension points and you have to provide
name and beam class and then you can
register non or many extensions in
everywhere in dependent plugins or in
your plugin as well so then let me tell
you about services we have concept of
services why do we need them so we have
a little problem with a picker container
pick a container lots companies at the
very beginning for instance when you
start your IDE you see that little
progress
that means we load almost every
application component and that's a
problem because that means that we load
that we load classes and class loading
is really very expensive so user has to
wait it's it's bad
services are loading on-demand and this
is good because most of application
components we don't use or use very
rarely so when you first time call a
service or ask for your service all
classes will be loaded so it's like
truly on-demand service and as picker
components we have three types for the
services its application project and
model this is example how we can ask for
a service for publication service and if
you need project a model service you
have to provide a project or a model as
a second parameter and here's this
example how to register such a services
so this application service is a good
example of extension point actually and
project services extension point as well
as model service no magic here so you
just provide the interface class and
implementation sometimes they equal so
okay how to support a programming
language this is the most interesting
part first of all language support in
IDE is kind of support of a number of
IDE features it's code completion
highlighting structure structure view
refactorings navigation and so on all
almost all of features consist of
language independent and language
specific parts and what you need to do
is just to implement a language specific
part with a small amount of effort and
the rest the language independent part
is provided for you by the ontology
platform
so first start point is to define
language it can be easily done - you
have to extend language class and
provide some really very basic
information like display name and easier
language case sensitive or not and here
we pass ID in a super constructor and
provide display name so and that's it
yeah
this class is a truly singleton class so
it's a good button to define languages
then we have to define a file type it's
also very easy task we just extend the
language file type and provide some
information about ID description for the
file type and default extension and also
we can provide I can for for this file
type and then we have to register file
type in file type Factory this can be
easily done by the code like present in
this example so and then we just
register a file type Factory in your
plugin XML file or somewhere else
and now real rocket science begins
because now it's a part for defining
lexer and parser and I believe that most
of you you know knows what is lexer and
parser so I just tell you the basics so
the lecture defines how the contents of
a file is broken into tokens and this is
example of we have expression like two
plus three and lexer returns us the
number of tokens like first number then
whitespace then plus separation then
again whitespace and finally number that
that's simple but writing a lecture is
not an easy task and in IntelliJ IDEA we
use G flex it is a lecture generator
library in how it can be done so
actually we write some flex files and
then run J flags and after that we have
something like that so we have generated
a Java class that that is scanner
lecture and everything in one and you
understand that this is bad idea to
write it manually it's better to use
some libraries like Jake's then we need
to define parser we need parser to build
AST st is a very known thing is the
abstract syntax tree and this is the way
we and not only we work with the code st
actually is a tree representation of
code so every node maps to some place in
your code
so this is a presentation of how st
looks like we have the same expression
two plus three but now we have on top
file and binary expression as a children
of file and then three children literal
plus and literal but it's not enough for
us because we would like to do some
intelligent thing in our IDE and st is
really not enough to do that we
introduce it psi what is psi psi is a
called program structure interface it's
built on top of AST and it adds
semantics and methods for manipulating
specific language constructs also it
provides referencing mechanism and they
think we use everywhere actually if you
type for instance in tell JD control be
to navigate somewhere its references if
you call find usages to find something
in XML file it's also references so it's
more than just a steam and then we when
we do some refactorings we need to
modify code somehow and this is just
perfect for code modifications and again
our example 2 + 3 in psi so here we have
my piece I file my psi binary expression
and two literals so this is really very
simple example and here we have three
files to define my C file my PC binary
expression my PC literal at
really a lot for so small construction
right and if your language is not so
simple
you have to define a lot of classes
firstly you have to define a lot of
interfaces and then their
implementations and yeah actually you
literally should describe everything so
and this is a good example how so just a
small part of what we have for the java
language so we have to define if
statements while statements annotations
annotations names values every keyword
every operation it's a lot it's it's a
hard work to do
all this stuff but honestly we don't
need to do this because recently we
introduced a tool for generate all this
stuff
it's called grammar kit it's a plug-in
for IntelliJ IDEA and it's develop it by
Gregory Raja and a colleague of mine and
initially it was created to support a
number of SQL dialects so how how it
works
it reads language grammar in BNF and
then it can create parser element types
all these C classes then it generates a
lexer for you and it also can generate
for module but right now it's working
progress so if you want to play with it
you can go to our github account and
take a look at this because all you need
to start programming your languages is
just to have a BNF file so that that's
it and at the moment
we have support for many languages and
formats with the grammar kid
this is darts weaved Jason seem a puppet
and many others they could good thing
about grammar kit it allows to easy
easily regenerate source code after
changes in BNF for instance yeah
actually a grammar kit allows tui to be
used as a just a jar file you can
absolutely is absolutely independent a
plug-in but it use some classes of the
platform because all the piece I stuff
is in a platform so in you have to
extend this somehow
but grammar kit has a special package
it's just a single jar file you can run
it and tell ok read this pmf and
generate me somehow ok yeah it's well
documented and you can ask if you have
any question and get a really quick
response because we're very interesting
in this library
options for the ground
well you can use it it's just a you know
historical moment we have a good support
for j-flex
so that's why we use it a lot so but it
does matter as I said you can use you
can write lectures like manually so it's
your choice yeah that's true and then
let me tell you a bit about IntelliJ
platform components so platform divided
in several parts the first part is core
in core you can find a virtual file
system in api's for lexer parcel psi and
referencing and it's really very
lightweight part of the platform here in
court we also have utility classes to
work with a concurrency collection
strings and so on and court does not
contain any UI so it's really
lightweight and also if you won't find
any specific language support here in
core so it's absolutely abstract and
then platform platform part contains
action system framework to work with the
actions any shortcuts toolbars
so this is all about user interaction
then UI framework with a lot of Swing
components with dialogues to Windows
pop-ups all this stuff then text editor
file structure view div and many many
more components actually in a platform
it's it's really heavyweight part of the
platform what are the extensions we have
first this is a spellchecker
it's very useful component you can use
any way in your plugin or any other
parts regular expressions images support
diagramming framework at the moment
diagram framework is not open source
because it depends on a library we can't
go open source we pay money for them and
that's why all the diagrams are in an
ultimate version of IntelliJ IDEA and
finally some deep merge tools and again
many other yep yep sure on ultimate vs.
community I assume you have some sort
licensing
that's part of the platform yeah well
we'll talk about the licensing a bit
later so okay you can ask that so and
also if you would like to create your
own IDE and use some Community Edition
plugins like version control you can do
it without any restrictions what we have
actually we have plug-ins for version
control it's gede mercurial subversion
and others we have plugins for build
systems like ant maven Gretel we have
plugin for issue tracker integration
right it has integration with a Utrecht
bugsy IRA and many others we have UI
designers in case if you want to play
with some rapid application development
right now open sourced only two of them
it's a swing UI design you're an Android
and we have terminal it's an ax console
in your IDE now let me show you what
what is a big difference between plugin
and product honestly the difference is
not so big everything started with a
everything starts with plug-in so plugin
is the start point in any case and but
product lets you remove what you don't
need and change what you don't like for
instance if you don't like some
components like find usages or code
completion you can absolutely change
them and create your yo ID
and product laws the product gives you
control over branding so you can change
product name your company name splashes
and stuff like that and both plugins and
products can use commercial license so
you can write a plug-in and start
earning money just right now yeah yeah
about product licensing internship or
from is apache2 licensed so answering
your question you can use any part of
the platform and do whatever you want if
you want something from ultimate you can
ask us and we will think about that
ultimate is mainly we have proprietary
code for some languages for some java ee
frameworks and such as components but if
we if you think it's reasonable we
sometimes just move parts from ultimate
to Community Edition okay now I show you
how to build a product first of all we
have to use ideal platform prefix this
is a start point you can create any and
this is a system property used as prefix
for names of plugin and application info
files it's set in default gvm options so
this is an example of how it can look
like then we have to create a product
plugin file it should be called like
your prefix then plug in dot XML for
example for Intel jet a community
edition we have idea plugins of XML
and this is the same format as regular
plugin XML I showed you just a few
minutes before in it can include chunks
of components from the platform then we
need to create application info file
again it's a prefix than application
info dot XML like for Community Edition
we have idea application in for that XML
and this is a single entry point for all
branding stuff so this is a example I
know can you see here something so
actually here we have like a company
name you can define your own some build
number and links to images for
application icon splash and so on then
how to build a product first of all
IntelliJ a project built with GPS GPS is
our own gun based build framework and if
you want to do it you just need to run
the gun script and that's it you can
define layout tasks for build structure
and of course layout has common and all
specific parts for Windows Linux and Mac
for example two we needed two just to
generate info files for Mac OS 6 and
then let me tell you about our special
tools we have an implant form they
really cool for instance exception
reporting if you create your own IDE you
probably would like to have information
about crashes and you can do it by just
providing your server name and
and handle it then we have system for
automatic updates and patches so if you
have a new version the users can be
notified that you have some updates or
new versions plug-in repository you can
use your own or you can use IntelliJ
jetbrains plug-in repository and finally
usage statistics it's it's a way users
can share with you how often they use
some features for instance we now almost
all about how users use our IDE how many
times they invoke code completion what
kind of project they use and so on of
course user have to agree to send this
statistic to us that most of about half
of users agree to send it and it's very
useful statistic so we can remove unused
features and improve popular features
all this information is defined in
application info file so this is a for
instance example of Google Android's -
they're based on top of IntelliJ IDEA
platform so here they define update oils
then some statistic server and other
things
and of course we would like the use from
time to time contribute to the platform
so it if you have your or some super
feature or you have a back fix to the
platform you're really very welcome
what you need is just to sign the
contributor License Agreement send us a
pull request on github and explain the
motivation for the change then at the
end I would like to tell you some
success stories for the products based
on Intel J platform the first of all its
force IntelliJ IDEA our multi platform
ID a multi-language ID then it's Ruby
mine
this is IDE for Ruby development and
Ruby on Rails Development PyCharm
spite remand junga ID oh this is Python
and yeah junk ID phpstorm and webstorm
phpstorm is a IDE for PHP development
and webstorm is focused on HTML
Javascript not GS in other technologies
they are really very lightweight and a
lot of HTML developers just prefer to
use webstorm comparing to IntelliJ IDEA
up code is a tool for is the IDE for RS
development and or six developers and
finally C line I know how many of you
have heard about sealion okay okay but
that's good three-person C Line is our
brand new C++ IDE
it's not released yet but we have a
public preview so if you're interesting
you can go to JetBrains calm and play
with it tell us what you like or what
you don't like
and Android studio Android studio is a
good example of collaboration with
Google as as maybe you heard Google just
created Android studio ide and based on
IntelliJ IDEA platform so it's a good
example when to open-source projects
started and there's no money involved in
the process but we have some good
results up source it's a good example of
using IntelliJ platform because app
source is a web-based code review tool
you can play with it at app source the
gel bands calm up source uses all almost
all features of the platform like
highlighting find usages indexing
version control but it doesn't use UI so
because it's web-based tool and yet it
doesn't use many platform UI components
young then it's a compiler for Kotlin if
you remember I described core part the
core part used to create such things
like a compilers and if you don't know
what cotton is cotton is statically
typed programming language targeting the
GBM and JavaScript and you can play with
it just online it's very promising and
finally MPs MPs is ID for the main
specific languages in M that the major
goal of MPs is tulo extending languages
so you can maybe
it's another way to do what you need not
to create a plug-in to IntelliJ or
creating your own language just to use
mps and define your own DSL so you can
find more information here so yeah and
finally that's it if you have any
questions I would love to answer so in
MPs actually you define your own DSL and
you then define the target for instance
it can be Java so you create your own
DSL and then everything compiles to Java
but you use your own language and you
have environment like IDE if you're
familiar with Utrecht
it's our issue tracker Utrecht is
written used by in MPs so we just define
it our own language to work with issues
with roles and so on and it's much much
easier to create such products okay yep
let's well the problem with jolly fix is
it's it's my opinion but it's not ready
for the real production for instance if
you look at IntelliJ IDEA editor this is
a component we what we point everything
is in the editor inside the editor we
point by our hands so and there is no
any good way to do it in Java fix yeah
but it works really slow so we've tried
it in a different version of Java fix
and they still promising it will be
faster and faster but it's good actually
the only thing good for in Java fix it's
of course a WebKit inside so that that's
awesome but we're not ready to switch to
Java fix come to that I just see
yesterday John X phase okay on general
data for the exit platform
mm-hmm ask him because I feared that
despite initiative as well petition load
something like a slakoth with sauce for
highlighting and so on and this work
pretty wrong I mean it was quite
responsive because Eclipse as explained
it to me
has the other thing like incremental
source code highlighting before that
stuff that you just get the same like an
intelligent that's why it should be
possible for you to gain that
performance level as well because what
else he was doing or at least I needed
shortly like happened fifty thousand
dollars or something like that
this is kind of a good estimate for for
social code and you are probably right I
have tried myself like other approaches
in Java packs which was pretty slow but
this answer
looked to me at least very promising so
MGM maybe maybe but we we actually try
it like every year after every measure
release and it's still not enough maybe
they we would just try that end of the
pole for example okay the problem is is
waiting to have this style subjects pain
and all that kind of things that you can
build upon about the topics this
phenomena available who these guys are
trying to do that kind of stuff so
probably looking good way to collaborate
I think people would test the same base
components at least this was promising
thing for me because I learned just two
days ago okay so maybe it will be a good
pull request from you to contribute to
the platform so okay okay are the
questions yep good pointers like a Hello
were examples that use the framework
yeah actually you could find a lot of
that examples for different purposes
because all the plugins for instance for
Community Edition are open sourced and
all you need is just to go to our
repository and that's actually enough
the best way actually is to take some
plugin and slightly modify it and so it
it will be a good start point so this is
more plugin question I see RJ's
exception reporting function is there a
way to one my plugin really causes an
exception to get reported to me yes this
is you can provide such exception
Eliezer actually I can show you later
how we can do this in our plugins so
it's possible so animal yep and with the
planet system I saw you
use a lot of XML files and when I
develop lots of plugins and ecosystem we
support refectory for that is relative
change the buggy name that changes and
sees everything in the other related XML
files as well or algorithm are you
talking about name or ID I mean just
properties private properties that I put
into the XML file and what I'm concerned
about XML file based plugging definition
is that how good is the refactoring
support it's pretty good because it
supports all java f koreans fully
qualified names and these can't change
it in my classes when I change that
plug-in identifier I use reference that
from editing the same project or module
source of animal you call it with
changing there as well do they have to
man
fancy and rename it there no you
of course it's supported yeah okay then
you should just show me this because
general ass okay yeah okay so thank you
so much and hope to see you again next
year maybe so ja one is over so you
would fly it home okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
