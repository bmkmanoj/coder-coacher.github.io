River we build metadata compilers mostly
for modernizing legacy applications but
monday we announced a WebSocket compiler
toolkit at the show and today we're
going to be talking about using
WebSockets in a programmatic way so so
here we are web sockets for the web 20
years after the web started if we look
back a little you know programming
sockets directly or an RPC with DCE or
even object-oriented socket programming
in korba this was really the way to
build applications within the enterprise
if if you wanted to do b2b that in those
days the companies would least t1 lines
to their partners to communicate and if
you really want to go over the internet
back then you'd have to talk to your
network administrator to try and forward
a port through the from the router
through the firewall and that was
practically unheard of you know next we
come to the web and the whole protocol
changes everything is communicating in
strings to the web server with HTML and
your marshaling your data in in XML or
JSON so that means you're doing
conversion to strings and then you've
got parsers to to convert them back so
here we are with WebSockets as part of
html5 it's stateful it's a full duplex
peer-to-peer and we'll talk about that
today low latency that means there's
barely any header the header on your
requests are only 2 214 bytes as opposed
to 122 k for a regular HTML request
there's a binary and string protocols so
you can decide what your app wants to
use and it all runs through through port
80 so
the first time in years you're going to
be able to have a full binary connection
to port 80 the way this works is your
connection starts out with a URL that
starts with WS web sockets and starts
out as an html5 request and it's
promoted to a full socket connection so
after you've done the connection in the
handshake you have the ability to do a
full bi-directional web socket type
connection what about a year ago we
build compilers and we were looking for
a way to put our compiler in the cloud
we needed a an RPC style connection and
we had to be able to stream binary when
we looked on the web we found this we
found really what is jsr 356 and this
book i think is the only book that
documents jsr 356 which is the Java
interface for web sockets and if you if
you kind of Google on the web there's
almost like two generations of web
sockets it's been around for you know
five or six years but the first
generation was when they were building
the protocol the frames and the the
proxy vendors so they were building this
protocol defining the wire the wire and
then the proxy vendors were able to
forward these requests and really it
wasn't until this specification came out
about three years ago that they're
starting to standardize the application
interface on top and so today what we're
going to look at is we're going to look
at a professional document style RPC
protocol over web sockets
this presentation is called programmatic
web sockets and you know if we'd been
that you've been up the show this week
you're seeing there's a lot of
annotation that's happening in Java they
have annotation for web sockets you know
I mean it's good for demos chat echo
type type programs but if you really
want to dig down under the covers you've
really got to be programming it and
that's what we're going to do today
we're going to show you you know how to
program to web sockets this is really
here we've taken our system and we've
tested it across these five web servers
and it's the same code so we've run the
same code across these five web servers
they're all shipping a JSR 356 web
sockets we've even taken the android
client we back ported it to java 6 now
they client they call it a client
there's still an endpoint there you can
still do bi-directional to an Android
device with this over this tyrus client
for android if we first you know look at
web sockets first we got to look at like
the threading model so like if you build
like a simple application request reply
it's going to have three threads so what
there is something called an endpoint in
web sockets and that's running on its
own threat so out of the box if you
build a simple program you're going to
have a server with one thread think of
it as a one thread endpoint and your
clients going to have two threads it's
going to have an endpoint thread and and
and you're mean application program and
this protocol there is no request reply
in the WebSocket jsr 356 specs so what
we're going to show you is how to is how
to synchronize if you want to run a
synchronous request to web sockets
if you well let me go back here to the
the protocol is pure is is is full
duplex peer-to-peer but in this
configuration you really couldn't do
peer to peer so like if you were to make
a request and then come back with the
response and then from that end point
make another request it wouldn't go
because the servers blocked he processes
these requests in cereal and you'd have
to return from the first request before
he'd take another request if you really
want to do peer-to-peer with WebSockets
and Java you need at least four threats
you need another threat on the server
and the way you know the way I think of
building these types of applications is
Israeli decide who's who's driving the
interface is that the client or is the
server little little story about this
about three or four years ago we were at
a client and we downloaded this
information tool and that tool on the on
the client side just had this agent and
we installed this agent in a in a window
server ran as an NT service and then we
just told it you know you know Oracle's
over there here's the net user name and
password and then we logged in to this
cloud portal and pretty quickly we were
sucking records out of Oracle and
inserting him into Salesforce and we
were in a secure environment we weren't
in a bank but we ran up in a big
corporation and we were thinking wow
what the heck just happened we just were
in the cloud application we pulled stuff
out of Oracle we put it in Salesforce
well tell you what happened is the agent
started out as a client and he went
through port 80 he said don't bother me
I'm just browsing and then the server
turns the connection around and then the
server's the client and the agent is the
server and now you're you're going into
the corporation in your polling data
this is easily done in in WebSockets
because it's bi-directional and you can
do
find interfaces directionally I today
I'm not really a big fan of the low
world or echo or chat so what we did was
we built a Hello with a little bit more
complexity so if you look at this you
know top line what we have is this is a
is just a metadata definition it's not
annotations and so we have this method
called hello that's returning an array
of strings and it has two arguments a
string hello and a boolean called throw
something and then this request also has
its own application exception so we're
trying to cover all all the grounds here
so this isn't I say it's not your father
shallow world it has a little more
complexity the next step is to break
down this request into asynchronous
requests and so if you look at this
example it it breaks down into four
requests for actually one request and
three responses so we have hello that
sends in the string hello and the
boolean throw something and that the
responses are the hello response which
is returning a string array we have the
hello exception which is the the
exception that we're defining in the
interface and then we also have like
this web socket exception and this is
our name it's not part of those two spec
there's nothing in jsr 356 to have the
server tell the client something went
wrong okay so these are the this is the
breakdown of how you take like a
synchronous request and break it down
into its pieces and we'll get into
showing you the code and how this works
the one piece of code i'm not going to
show you but you can after this you'll
see you can download this entire example
and run it but
we have a piece of code that's doing
this weight and this is what's
synchronizing the end point to the
applications threat and if I go through
this diagram what happens is the client
makes a request to the server and then
the client waits on the session calls
wait with a timeout on the server side
the request is is processed and the
response goes back to the endpoints
threat then the endpoint sends a notify
to the session and wakes up that that
client that's waiting and then the
response is is returned so now what
we've done is we've made a synchronous
request / / WebSockets there's a bunch
of ways to to send send data back and
forth and web sockets when I cover in
them all for the most part we're going
to talk about send object and in web
sockets there's they create a TCP
connection but their support for whether
you're going to be sending binary or
text as part of your application there's
also calls like send text and send
binary where you can send these clubs or
blobs directly or you can even access
the stream when you access like get send
stream you're getting an input output
stream if you get send writer you're
getting a reader writer character stream
now the books a little fuzzy on unsend
object you can only really send one
object if you had a fruit object you
could send the derived classes you know
apple peach pear but then you couldn't
create vegetable object so what we're
going to be talking today is a it's a
document style services pattern this is
a well-known pattern you have an
envelope and then in the envelope our
documents and the documents map to the
requests and in the documents are the
variables that you're passing back
I have this this is kind of like a
diagram to show you a kind of a life
cycle of of the requests and it starts
the client calls a WebSocket routine
called connect to server and on the
server side there's a call-out called on
open so that happens on your server and
then that returns and you have a you
have a WebSocket connection and then in
this case the application is calling
send object with an envelope and it goes
through you know encode decode and on
the server side there's something called
on message and then on message that
calls the method it goes on the server
side it processes that method response
is called send object to go back it goes
through inco decode and you end up
getting an on message in the end point
on the client that's where we were
showing you that sink was happening and
then too close you'll call disconnect
and then the server side gets a on close
call out there's there's a there's a
whole chapter on this in the book is
this URL and really the only reason I
put this slide in here is is that at
bank URL if you are doing restful type
services you can still do those kinds of
URLs and web sockets and have the server
side parse out the arguments and such
but they have they have a bunch of
different ways they have templates and
other type things that are part of the
standard for URLs ok so now we're going
to look at we're going to look at code
and we're going to start like from the
outside so we're going to talk about the
outside of the client my server and work
our way in through this code and you'll
be able to see what's happening this is
the client main and I've highlighted
some things here we got a call to
connect
and we'll show you that routine and then
you can see where we're calling hello
with the argument hello and throw
something false and that's going to
return an array of strings strings he
prints those out and then he's going to
call hello with a the throw something
true and that's going to throw an
exception be caught in hello exception
you're gonna print something and then
there's this this deployment exception
and this is a little weak this is still
early but they have this thing called
deployment exception and this is part of
connect and if the server is not even
running there wasn't even a listener
you're going to get a deployment
exception if your URL is bad you
misspelled something or there's some
kind of syntactic error in the URL you
get a deployment exception and if you
see your row oh if the handshake is bad
you give a deployment exception it's
almost like there should be like three
exceptions and so I think this is
something that they're going to have to
be working on because it's tough to
figure out what's up what's happening so
this is the client side of a low pretty
simple your client mean and this is the
server the server has these call-outs
and so the first one is like unopen so
if you had an application this is a good
place to call like a database connection
pool to get your database handle on
clothes would be where you return that
connection back to the pool and there's
also some error processing it can be
done here if you look at the
implementation if you remember the
signature there they're so low returns a
string takes a hello and a boolean
prints out checks for the boolean if the
boolean is true it's going to throw this
exception otherwise it's going to return
a string of four worlds so that's your
that's your application you can actually
link these two together and run them
we we talked about you know a send
object and the envelope and this is what
the envelope looks like this is you have
you have a method which is an
enumeration and then inside you'll have
the documents you'll have the hello
document which is the request you'll
have the response document which is the
strings you'll have the exception and in
this in the superclass is this other
exception this WebSocket exception for
unchecked unchecked exceptions in in web
services this would almost be called
like a choice object where that method
is pointing to the to the member with
that with the data these are the
documents so we have the you know the
hello document you can see the hello and
the throw something a response document
with the result and the exception with
the exception message and the throwable
now there's also this piece we got to
configure this thing so on the client
side and this is the connect method so
the connect method it takes this this
URL and he calls this container provider
and gets this container provider but
then he's also configuring in this build
kind of pattern the encoders and
decoders and as you see we have a Hello
binary stream encoder and decoder and
they're the same so the binary stream
encoder and decoder are the same piece
of code and then we have a text stream
encoder and decoder and so you're kind
of registering these on the client side
and then you're calling you know that on
that on that container or connect to
connect to server and that's going to
return your client session so that's the
client kind of the client configuration
in the connect code and this is all jsr
356 complaint code server side has the
same kind of thing it has these
application config
and you're configuring the server for
what encoders and decoders that you're
using and those are the those are the
same the same code and that's this
config endpoint all right so now we have
the this is the client stub and so you
can see this is the hello comes in with
the hello and the throw something and it
it creates a document and it creates an
envelope and when it created the
document and put the hello and something
in it and it rained an envelope and set
the method in the envelope and set the
document in the envelope and then you'll
see session get remote send object
that's that's a JSR 356 how to send an
object right also that encode exception
is is part of jsr 356 so if there was an
encode exception that would happen here
these typically only happen during
development and testing once you go in
production you shouldn't be seeing
encode like exceptions at the bottom you
can see the hell oh wait I told you to
download this example you can see this
typical just straightforward wait and
reply logic but wait returns the output
document and that gets the result the
string result and returns the result so
that's the that's how the stub is
synchronized if we no no we actually we
have a toolkit and this all gets
generated but you can that's something
you'd have to write if you were here if
you were building this by hand this
document style and we and and at the end
of the presentation you can see a URL to
download this whole application but
that's basically just doing a weight on
the session and then the endpoint is
calling notify when it when when the
response comes back this is the server
side and there's this on message this
happens whenever there's an RPC request
and right away this is calling a
dispatch routine but in this routine
also is where you have to catch
unchecked exceptions so if you call your
remote routine and it you know null
pointers it's going to end up back here
and then what this code is doing is is
creating this WebSocket exception and
it's taking that exception that's
putting it in the envelope and then
sending that exception back to the
client so when you build these
applications like I said you have to
build your own exception method for
unchecked exceptions and even decode
exception so in web sockets if you're on
the server side you get a decode error
it just prints it out you have to be
able to throw that back to the client to
let them know that you had a problem
with the envelope that went over so this
is the dispatch it comes in here with
the envelope and there's only one method
which is this hello and we get the
document out of the envelope we unpack
the hello and the throw something and
then you see there's just one line here
this imple hello is where we're calling
the implementation and that's returning
that's either going to return a result
or it's going to throw an exception and
then we create if it returns
successfully we would treat this
document we set the result in it we set
the method in the envelope and then we
set the
in the envelope otherwise were in the
hello exception and we set the we set
the method and we set the exception in
there and then the last line you can see
is session again just like the client
session get remote send object all right
so that was that was like the thing of
the full round-trip of the code except
for the marshaling and one of the things
good things about this specification is
really it hides what marshalling
technique you're using I mean you were
just seeing an envelope passed on both
sides well what we've what we've done is
really you can build a server that's a
multi-protocol server it can be
listening for binary requests or text
requests so in this exists in this slide
basically i'm showing you can have a
java application talking binary to a
server and you could have a JavaScript
application talking to the same server
in text if we drill a little deeper into
the marshaling on the binary side you
could encode in xdr i LP s n dot 1 or
google you know protocol buffers you can
pick what marshalling you want to use
for the binary protocol on the on the on
the tech side you know you just could be
using xml json or some some kind of
stringify logic you might have so this
is the is kind of the marshalling layer
and it's all you know handled through
this you know message hand or whole
hello envelope that's that's uh that's
what some registered these these
encoders decoders does anyone know XD
are any hands anyone no one okay all
right xdr is a it's a it's a it's
actually the marshalling technology
that's under Sun RPC the NFS
file system is built on sin RPC and
that's what it uses as as a marshaling
technology the beauty of xdr is the same
code that encodes decodes and that's how
everything keeps in sync it isn't like
you have to separate logics for encoding
and decoding if i look at this code
you'll see when it first comes in it
checks for decode xdr decode and if
that's true then he creates the hello
document and this is this is just one
document we're doing we're not going to
exhaustively look through these but
we're doing this one document and if it
comes in decode he creates the document
because he's decoding he doesn't have it
and then these next two blocks of code
are the hello string and the throw
something boolean so if you come in on
the end code side and you take the
request response and you you set
something into this thing thing to
another thing i want to mention if you
see thing it just means pointer that's a
it's a it's a pointer to a thing he sets
the hello into the into the thing to and
then he calls this thing XD our string
to pass that string over the wire and
then after that he sets back into the
requests the the set hello on the encode
side that wouldn't make sense does he
already has a bad decode it would and so
you can look at this code and you know
once you kind of get your head around
it's it's doing both things this is this
is XD are now what we did I know you
guys know JSON thought we did was we
built a XD are looking JSON Marshall are
and on decode it's using the JSON parser
it's the same thing the only difference
is is you'll see tags so you'll see like
the hello tag in the in the first black
colored string and then you can see the
throw something so it's it's it's adding
the
tags when it's creating the JSON or when
it's looking for that tag it's trying to
marshal there's also you'll see this
separator that's the comma so if you run
if you're on encode it's going to
produce a comma and decode it's going to
do nothing so again it's the same code
that does end coding and decoding and
this can get pretty complicated if you
were passing like arrays of beans that
are nested you know crazy crazy stuff it
handles it next thing I want to talk
about is you can have different kinds of
servers you can have session-based
servers or you can have a singleton
based servers session based server is
when you have your own implementation on
the back end so it's like you have your
own copy of the server and a singleton
server is where there's one
implementation of the class on the
backend and multiple threads are going
through that implementation so you've
got to be thread-safe so if we look at
the session server we have two clients
on the website you have to separate
implementation classes so you can you
know process your request and this is
very you know a very common pattern the
session session server this is what it
looks like if you're in the end point
and you're in on open that's where
you're going to create your session
implementation singleton server is is
basically you have one implementation on
the server and multiple threads are
going through that implementation so now
you're sharing something you're sharing
something on the back end and you've got
to be you've got to be thread-safe in
this in this pattern and this is
basically the straightforward singleton
singleton pattern where you're getting
an instance of that on the first request
and it will always be that same instance
on every other requests that's really
the summary what you have is now the
ability
to do you know full duplex low latency
communication right to port 80 we have
examples if you want to download this
hello zip you can get this full example
and you can run it client server you can
see what we're doing a weight and not
and stuff and if you're interested in
we've released this WebSocket compiler
toolkit it's free for small projects and
it's a great learning tool if you're
trying to figure this stuff out it's
actually bi-directional you can you can
defined RPC request in both directions
and will generate all the right code for
you any questions obviously we're we're
looking at a JavaScript client for this
but this is all right now Java and Java
support and currency war
you know I think it's come a long ways
it's funny when you google the internet
you kind of get like these two
generations of things you get people
that were real early in the showing
proprietary WebSocket stuff and talking
about proxies and then you're starting
to get you know people in the jsr 356
and we've been running this over the
internet through proxies we haven't had
a problem but I just don't know it's
it's really coming i mean the proxy
vendors are incented to get html5 to go
through there through their proxies and
it's been five or six years these guys
have been working on it so it looks like
it's getting pretty solid on the web
server side we've we've built this in
five different web servers and there's
no difference in the code so that was
really encouraging I mean we were
thinking there was going to be some kind
of uh you know kind of matrix on on the
support but it but that wasn't true yeah
you know I you know I don't I mean that
would really be up to them up to the web
server we haven't seen anything like
that we just know that you have a
continuous you have a continuous session
from the time you open the session to
close you have the same session and you
can store State on that on that session
you're not necessarily you can't depend
on being in the same thread and when
when you come in on multiple requests
there might be thread pooling whatever
but I really don't have any information
on on you know sessions it's kind of the
same as the as the web servers sessions
anyone else
you know we haven't we haven't gone
there yet it's supposed you know I we've
been at some sessions and some people
are talking about it whatever and we
haven't we haven't tested that we've
been not we've been programming this for
about a year just trying to get to this
show to do a release but that's one of
the things we're going to start looking
at is the is there is a URL like WSS but
we haven't we haven't experimented but
that yet I think so I think so I mean
definitely you know web servers like a
weblogic and stuff and that's probably
the next thing we're going to do is look
at that anything else he's just right on
time it's 12 so quicker than I thought
okay all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
