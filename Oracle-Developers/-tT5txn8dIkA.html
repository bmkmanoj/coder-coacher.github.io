Oracle code and Tokyo my name is Joe
Wong and part of the product management
team at Oracle and I specifically looked
after our mobile offering and also our
BOTS or check out platforms so today I'm
going to talk about chat pod and rise to
the chat box and its use in the
enterprise mobile application
development first of all this is just a
very standard disclaimer I'm going to
share some product information that's
not yet released so these product
information may change well so first of
all I think most of you have heard a
very famous term by the former Apple
founder Steve Jobs right he famous
famously said in 2009 that there's an
app for that
meaning that doesn't matter if you want
to do some banking transactions or talk
to your friends or making a phone call
there's an app for that right and as a
result there are millions and millions
of applications in Apple App Store
Google Play and design stores and so
forth however what that has led to is
what we call an app fatigue and
typically people interact with on
average about 20-25 application so they
actually these are the application they
actually open up and use on their mobile
device however 80% of time usually only
uses the top three applications and
messaging a messaging app such as line
is one top three and just maybe a show
of hand and hope interpreter can keep up
so how many of you use is line pretty
much everyone right exactly so line ten
to star is one of the three top mobile
applications that you use
and frankly majority of these
applications after you download these
applications would not be using it you
know roughly only 3% of the applications
that user download is continuing to be
used and chances are it's one of those
that messaging applications and frankly
the reason why messaging application is
really taking off part of it is allows
you to very quickly engage another
person and also the other thing is that
it doesn't require a user interface to
use a messaging application the best
interface frankly is no interface at all
there's nothing to learn to use a
messaging application simply just have
to talk into it or type into it
simplicity is the best and the reason is
that conversation the way I'm talking to
you or you talk to me is the most
natural form of communication that's why
these messaging applications one the key
things is so popular now one interesting
thing that has come out of this
messaging application phenomenon it's a
new technology and this new technology
it's called chat bot ok so what is the
chat bot a chat pod is defined as a
computer program that attempts to
maintain the conversation with a person
so in another word let's say use line as
an example when you type in and talk to
a chat bot in line it's as if you're
talking to a human being a word person
but instead it's a computer program that
replies to you that tries to maintain a
conversation that actually tries to do
work on your behalf
using the most simple interface which is
the conversation now would chat BOTS
really help right what is the the
that could really help one of the area
that can really help is very common
thing I'm sure you all have gone through
it before what we call hotline
experience in English basically is you
dial into an operator or company right
and and call into a company and then ask
for a product recommendation let's say I
want to buy a thermostat what is the
recommended model I should choose right
this is very common you would dial in
and typically you hear music give more
music and then finally right someone on
the other side of the not someone but
the system asks you to make a choice
press 1 for this 2 for this 3 for this
do you pick one you hear more music and
you ask for one more choice your music
and thinks for a while you hear more
music and finally the phone now says all
the agents are busy please hope right so
you're being asked to hold the line and
you hear music and on and on and on
right so this is unfortunately a very
common customer service or just a
hotline experience with a lot of the
companies because it takes a human being
to be actually having a real
conversation with you that's what
chatbot can really help ok so let me
show you how a chat bot can really help
with this situation so I'm going to
switch to my phone thank you great good
okay and I'm currently using a facebook
messenger for this demo but this could
be line
or it could be whatsapp it could be any
other type of application as well so
instead of a person calling in a hotline
calling into a phone number and ask for
product recommendation I can simply
allows you to do is a person comes in
and just type in get started to ask for
a product recommendation and as you can
see it's able to pick up my user ID from
me Joe from Facebook and facebook
Messenger and give me a personalized
experience then asking for what do you
want what do I want to do let's say I'm
interested to find out more about this
home automation system I pick that
choice and then it's smart enough to
then ask what part of the house do I
want to automate let's say I want to
automate my thermal step to control my
temperature in the house to control my
air conditioning summer is coming after
all now it's smart enough to ask me in
order to make the right recommendation
how large is the square footage for my
house so I picked two thousand square
feet now this is us
obviously in here we use square meters
or a different unit and then I'm able to
smart enough to make a recommendation
based on size and health now I can also
ask what is the weather it's compatible
with my existing air conditioning and
it's able to and this bot is able to go
to the backend system clos in the
information and confirm yes this is
compatible with my current air
conditioning system and do I want to
then get a quote or go to the website
that's I want to get a quote and it's
able to direct me to where I can find
out the pricing for the system it's a
very simple bot you know it takes
literally a measure or two to go through
rather than waiting on telephone line to
talk to a person so this is one of the
things that chap hawk can do to improve
this customer service and the hot line
experience
okay back to my apprentice in please
great thank you and because of this
because what you just saw the messaging
app that adoption of these messaging
applications has already surpassed usage
for social network applications so tot
the top basically out six of the top ten
applications that's using the world
today are messaging applications so as
you know here everyone pretty much uses
line in China we uses WeChat the United
States it's a Facebook Messenger and
then for Southeast Asia Latin America
its whatsapp so these are very popular
applications and they have greatly
surpassed the usage of the social
networks just in the last year or two
there are more than four billion users
around the world are using instant
messaging application so this usage of
the messaging application is really
exploding because of these promises now
talking about chatbot there are really
two types of chat bot there are some
chat bot value interacted with today all
right even with what is the line where
we reach out there are some existing bot
that's available today that you can
interact with most of them are what we
call task oriented it basically it gives
you a very structure interaction ask you
a question give you a menu and then you
select a choice and then goes through
the next question very structure the
interaction basically the home
automation bot I just demonstrated is an
example as a structured
task oriented bot most of the customers
most of the the person company that we
to start with the task before needed
chatbot however what's emerging was
coming the next generation the bot is
more data-driven is more predictive and
also more intelligent okay and that is
something that we want to focus on today
the intelligent bot and and that's
actually no state yeah thank you and
this is a what we want to talk about
today is what makes about intelligent
with the oracle intelligent bot okay so
the question is what really makes a bond
intelligent what do we mean by an
intelligent bot right even the de Botton
I just demonstrated intelligent what
makes a bot intelligent is the
capability in the bot to be able to do
natural language processing and machine
learning so what does that mean it means
that natural language processing allows
the intelligent bot to distill or
extract what user wants to do at a
simple sentence right without giving a
menu or structure you simply type a
sentence then the intelligent bot using
natural language processing is able to
understand what you're asking and
execute what you want to do on your
behalf
additionally what makes the bot
intelligent is machine learning so the
ability to learn from be able to
correctly understand what you say or
maybe the prediction is incorrect is
able to learn from that basically the
developer is able to train the bot to
understand how to understand the
end-user conversation
so that is what make upon intelligent
and that's at the core of natural
language processing and machine learning
okay now I'm going to demonstrate using
my iPhone and an example of intelligent
Oh
okay and here I have an example an
intelligent bot for a bank right this
bot allows me to do a variety of things
through a messenger interface so the
first thing I can do is check what is my
balance okay then it's smart enough to
know that I have different type of bank
accounts so I can say savings I can
checking for example I have checking
saving and credit card different type of
account big savings it tells me how much
money do I have in my savings account
but I can also ask a different way after
all there's in many ways in English or
in Japanese in any language to ask for
the same thing I can also ask how much
do I have
and it knows again I'm asking for how
much money in my account I select
savings and return my saving account so
again there are many ways many
variations for someone to ask a question
and what makes it bond intelligent what
the natural language process is it will
be able to handle different type of
questions but different ways that user
can ask a question another way I can ask
the question simply is how much do I
have in savings and I directly ask how
much do I have in savings it's able to
extract and understand I'm asking the
savings account in return the same
account balance directly again that's
part of the natural language processing
and machine learning at work again
another functionality it can execute is
say show me five most recent
okay then they're smart enough to again
know that I'm asking a different
question for what account go I want to
see these transactions and let's say I
want to see my saving the transactions
and then is able to return these
transactions by talking to the back-end
system it actually needs to ask me
whether I want to see payments deposit
withdrawal different type of
transactions and then it's able to do
that another thing that I can do with
this system is to payment another
functionality in order to do that I
simply say in this case I want to pay
someone
I hired a babysitter - you know babysit
my kit so I say pay the baby sitter
again another question is able to now
understand I want to execute a payment
transaction so ask me for which account
do I want to execute the payment from I
can select checking and then the next
question is how much I want a now
interesting question is well I could
have entered a dollar amount here but
what if I don't remember how much I have
my checking account and I honestly don't
remember me how many of us actually
remembers how much we have in our
checking account so I can simply at this
point as how much do I have
and in this case it's a different
completely different conversation flow
but it's able to understand well I want
to find out what my checking account
balances that give me our checking
account balance okay I see I have more
than two thousand American dollars so I
know that I can pay for my checking
account only need to pay my babysitter
for a hundred US dollars so I can enter
here it again intelligent bot then be
able to execute this transaction on this
behalf by connecting the backing system
and paid the babysitter hundred US
dollars okay some of the other things
that I can also ask just because
intelligent bot some of the
functionality we can support is I can
say if I lost my credit card I just type
in lost card then it's able to come back
with a set of instructions on what to do
in the case of launched heart then let
me ask a completely different question
right so let's say I want to add my
daughter as a beneficiary to this
account so it's a very simple question
and I can simply say can I add water too
okay they able to understand I'm asking
now a question of frequently asked
questions go back to the backend
knowledge base and pull back the
information so this is what intelligent
thought can do is it can handle a
variety of questions in the different
ways that you ask the question now now
I'm going to do another quick demo
hopefully this works
I don't know how me how many of you have
heard this new technology from Amazon
called Amazon dot or Alexa look okay so
I'm not sure Alexa is here yet but I'm
not sure you can see it as soon as I say
the Alexa name it wakes up right it's
kind of hard to see from from where
we're sitting
okay so I have Alexa here set up
connected to my bot this is again one of
the things that the Oracle intelligent
bought can do is to connect to youth
Alexa so rather than using a messaging
app I can just use my voice okay so
let's try this
Alexa asked Oracle bot listbox
there are nine box the Box chimes
underscore credo test retail bot travel
next gen financials BP underscore Bob
Holly bought I'll underscore custom
component Calvo bot pizza bot
okay so there's different kind of bot
that I've connected to my system all
night at 10:00 there are nine bought
debauch sorry underscore credo test
retail bot travel medicine financials BP
underscore Bob howdy bought L underscore
custom component telco but pizza bot
choose next gem financial
okay using this Jin financial show my
balances oh sorry there's some
interferences that's don't it that's the
oh is the danger with doing a demo
specialty voice is there could be
interference so let me start again
Alexa ask Oracle bot choose next-gen
financial okay using next-gen financials
show my balances for which account do
you want your balance the following are
your choices checking savings credit
card credit card the balance in your
credit card account for 3 5 2 3 4 2 3 1
2 3 4 5 2 3 9 is mine is 208 dollars and
eighty-eight since you are remaining
credit is four thousand seven hundred
ninety one dollars and twelve cents
Alexa stop okay there you go so without
even type anything I can use Alexa and
connect to the Oracle intelligent bot to
ask the same question okay back to the
slide please
okay so now the next question is and
trying to answer is how does it all
actually work right how that intelligent
bot actually works there are four key
components to the Oracle intelligent bot
the first part is what's called channel
configurator allows the Oracle in Laos
intelligent bot to connect to a variety
of messaging app clients
it could be connecting to facebook
Messenger could be connecting to lying
WeChat and so forth so for a lot of our
customers that have multi national
global users they all want to use
different type of messaging applications
channel configurator allows the central
platform to connect and support all of
these different messaging clients second
part is dialogue flow execution this
executes a conversation right so for
example in asking for balances there's a
sequence of how the questions should be
asked so the bot would guide a user
through the questions that needs to be
answered if that's not answered so the
second part is a dialogue flow execution
and included with that is ability for
developers of the bot to define the
conversation using a what we call a bot
builder user interface also in it is
what we call the state engine that holds
all the data that needed as a user goes
through a conversation the third part is
what we call custom component custom
component our component actually that
does work it's part of the a dialogue
flow right but as user goes through a
dialogue these cup
and components are executed to call the
back end system to do the actual work
so this is where actual work is done and
part of that is providing and for
example we have a SDK a software
development kit to call back-end API so
this is where for example in the banking
example when the data for balances comes
back it acts you actually executed a
custom component a custom component
called API the API called the back
back-end banking system to return the
data so this is the part that actually
calls the API the fourth part is the
artificial intelligent engine this is
where active learning comes in this is
where the system is able to
intelligently understand that different
ways the user could ask a question and
then the system can basically allow them
actually start the developer can then
train the system to understand the
different ways a question could be out
okay what makes the intelligent bot
intelligent is that a developer does not
have to program all the different ways
the user could ask the question instead
the developers simply need to list some
examples of how the question could be
asked it is this artificial intelligent
engine is able to use that limited set
of samples and understand that various
many many millions of ways a user could
be asking a question so that's what the
AI engine does so just a very simple
example let's say a command
transfer 100 US dollars from my default
account to Lidia for babysitting Lidia
is my name my babysitter
okay so what is what how does the system
actually works that the four component I
mentioned earlier the first thing is the
the artificial intelligent engine which
is a drive the intent system first
trying to interpret what does the user
actually wants to do and how can this be
mapped to a specific action so with this
sentence the intent the artificial
intelligent engine understand the intent
is to transfer money okay so intent is a
new terminology so what does intent
means it's a terminology used in chatbot
it basically allows the developer to
define what user intends to do or wants
to do in this case its money transfer
and what developer would do to train the
intent is by entering samples of how the
user could be asking this question for
this intent okay so what does that mean
it means that for example like a
developer we entered sent money to
account transfer pay money and so forth
that's how a developer would enter
samples were and and the terminology we
use here is utterance to train the
system what intent the user is asking
based on the question they're asking
okay and then based on this what
developer created were entered these
utterances or these sentences then
during runtime the system would then
interpret what based on these samples
were users asked actually asking the
second part to this to eya at this AI
engine and understanding what user is
asking is what we call entity and entity
is basically for lack of better term
like attributes you know the more common
programming terms attributes these are
different properties or activities
associated with a command so for example
I need to ask for balance or transfer
money it needs to know what type of
account it is so account type is an
entity so the second thing the AI engine
needs to extract out is the entity what
exactly from which account what type of
account does user wants to get the
information from and the user could be
specifying an account or not specify
account type if it doesn't specify
account type then my commerce the way I
design conversations will ask for the
account type however if the iia engine
is able to detect the user already enter
the account type in the sentence then
it's not going to ask that question
where it's not going to display these
choices it will simply run the command
in the backend and return the
information
and the third part is what we call
dialogue flow and this is where
developer comes in and design what the
conversation is like so it will that the
dialogue flow would manage the
conversation flow it will hold basically
the dialogue flow is a state engine it
holds
the different data that needed for the
conversation so as the conversation goes
through these different stages its able
to hold these data here's another way of
interpreting howdy does the artificial
intelligent flow works in that work on
intelligent bot the first part it has to
do with channel integration as you
remember the four components right the
first part is the channel integration or
channel configurator in this case it
could be a facebook messenger I entered
in or a line and in this case the Oracle
bot is what we'll call channel agnostic
it can work with any channels the second
thing is intent classification when
intent classification does again is to
undergo through the natural language
processing j'en and understand what user
intends to do the third part is from
what user entered extract out entities
or attributes of the request again in
the banking example would be the account
type the fourth part is dialogue
execution so not only guide the user
through a conversation but also called
it backend API to do the work and return
data and the banking example would be an
an API call to return the banking
balance back to the to the bot okay so
those are the four parts so exactly how
does that work so let's a
take a look let's see I'm going to
okay
so here I'm going to look at how a
developer actually developed this bot so
in this case it's the financial bot that
I demonstrated earlier so let's look at
how it's done okay okay
okay Samia
well maybe not this is what always
happens is in a demo is when you
actually need to use it it doesn't work
should be working I may be just running
low a little low on memories so
apologies maybe I can use this seems
like my network is not working
you see if I could all right again let
me try it again actually and you could
be on EPM that's why
okay so network is working let me try it
one more time
okay so my local environment is not
working I would need to switch to my
backup plan
okay
so I'm connecting the back-end backup
system so it may take a little time okay
good
and as a matter of fact you can see all
the different bought Amazon Alexa I read
out so let's see we can find the oops a
woke up again
okay good all right so remember the
first thing that a developer would need
to define in this case in a is intent
what does the end user wants to do so
here is where I would and this is the
user interface developer would go
through to define the different intent
what the end user will want to do in
this case asking for balances frequently
asked questions send money track
spending and transaction right so these
things are so for example checking
balances checking account for example
these are under the balances intent can
I ask my daughter to the beneficiary its
FAQ pay but babysitter that send money
for each of these intent what the
developer or in this case it may not be
have to be a developer could be a
business analyst who understand the type
of questions that you can use it could
be asking simply enter in these examples
right and one of the things that you
notice is one of the things I asked is
how much do I have right that's one of
the way that asks the original financial
bond it's actually not on the example
but it's able to understand am asking
balances because if they able to take
all these of examples go through the
artificial intelligence engine and make
a guess of what users intend to ask so
this is part of the artificial
intelligent engine comes in is to be
able to understand understand this and
what end-user can do here is basically
use this tester to test out the bot and
just do a since I have a little bit of
time I can just how much do I have so I
can basically test out
what the different so for example I can
test out the different ways and a user
could be asking and then the artificial
intelligent engine would take that and
rank it what are the likely intent the
user at the top three users like a to
ask and and reply right and in case I
don't want to do it now if the end user
gets incorrectly I'm sorry the
artificial engine interpreted
incorrectly that can simply select a
different intent an example what happens
is it goes in and update all of the
artificial intelligence or its engine
which is based on neural network it will
basically reset the neural network and
allow a next time when user ask that
question is going to favor a different
intent and that's what that train button
there actually does it retrained and
reset the neural network for the new one
based on the new information the second
part is entity extraction right
basically be able to extract out the
attributes so this is where the
developer would define the different
type of entities that would go into a
bot and the platform also provides a
number of out-of-the-box entities so for
example address is an out-of-the-box
entity you know a user could type in an
address what is the direction to this
place right and currency how much US
dollars were Japanese yen and so forth
so these are a different type of
entities or attributes that user could
define these red ones are the custom
ones the these ones in blue
you are the assistant provided one and
here you can then enter in the different
type of account types for example the
different values for this entity you can
even enter in synonyms or words that
have similar meaning so checking or
saving this is not a great example
saving could there may be another way to
save savings and that's where you enter
sending them in here this is probably
more important for East Asian languages
because a lot of times the same word may
have different meaning right so this is
where you enter it synonym is the third
place is where you define a conversation
right and currently the way that you
define conversation is through XML but
we're also delivering a UI dialogue to
do that and that basically defines not
only the conversation flow but also
executes the custom component and as you
recall custom component are the
component that actually does work and
calls the backend API and for example be
able to handle agents or a hand called
the back hand transaction and the last
part is the channel configurator and
channel configurator is where you will
be able to define the different channels
at the bottom support whether it's
through Facebook line and so forth okay
so very quickly this is how you would as
a developer define a bot in the using
the Oracle intelligent bot
okay and again the this is just a quick
summary the way that custom component
works is the oil co intelligent bought
platform will basically call a rest api
this rest api will be implemented in a
no container and that connects to the
back-end system to connector so this
part generally would be done were
executed in Oracle mobile cloud service
and that in turn caused a back-end
system to do the work so this just shows
the sequence of how intelligent ba
actually executed work and this is I
won't go through it but this is a more
detailed architecture diagram for
calling custom component to the backend
so just to summarize I mean most of odd
does very similar things and I think we
talked about there are some chatbot in
the market today most of art are similar
every one of them maybe does a few of
those things but what sets Oracle apart
is that we have a scalable runtime
architecture we have enterprise security
enterprise integration simple to use bot
designer we have machine learning that
works across different channels and you
should see how machine learning works we
also work very closely with Facebook and
other technology vendors okay that's it
I think I'm right on time so I apologize
I didn't leave a lot of questions but
maybe we could handle portion and I'll
be around and maybe I'll just hang out
in the podium for some question after
the call so with that I think let me
wrap up this talk and I'll be here again
to answer additional questions so that
the next speaker could be ready to set
up okay thank you very much thank you
for coming and hopefully this gives
everyone a quick overview of what the
chat pod is and also what a intelligent
bot would do
and different technology component that
goes into it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
