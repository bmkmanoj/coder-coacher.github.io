m2m what is M term used for what to keep
in mind when you're designing an MDM
solution about the architecture of an
interim solution we're going to talk a
little bit about what is our java
implementation look at a couple of
examples and also highlight some some of
the features of what we've done with the
concept board and then like I said at
the end ruffle one of those so to get
started my name's axel Huntsman
responsible for strategy and marketing
at malta mt m and I've brought with me
some colleagues today so with me is
andreas haggler he is responsible for
portfolio also one of the guys that make
sure that we get java into all of our
products also here is Thomas Lampert
he's the Java architect at gemalto he's
also on JCP executive committee so our
Java expert and the guy making sure that
everyone's put his name on a piece of
paper as they're walking in as Robert
Robert Schafer and he's based hands in
the Bay Area responsible for west coast
sales and yeah man on the ground him so
allow me to say a few words about
gemalto I hope most of you have heard
about us if not I trust most of you will
have one of our products very large
global company more than two billion
euro revenue employees and more than 43
companies and like I said probably most
people around the world are using one of
our products we make Gemalto score
businesses around smart card and secure
solutions so we produce government IDs
driver's licenses access Badgers banking
cards MX for example
we produce some cards and so those of
you using CDMA networks may not know the
SIM card too well but that's changing
and some card is a secure token to
access mobile networks and all in all I
think there's about one and a half to
two billion these smart cards and secure
tokens that we manufacture every year
and personalized so give everyone a
unique identity so that's a lot of
personalizations that we're doing every
second anyway three years ago gemalto
decided to get into the m2m business and
acquired a company called cinterion and
sent Aaron is basically an expert at
packaging cellular connectivity into an
industrial form factor that can be used
in m2m and the Internet of Things our
customers come from all sorts of
industries and I'll go into that in a
moment and combining tomatoes expertise
from the secure technologies and the mtm
industry we've taken our portfolio from
hardware we've extended that into the
SIM cards to make them ruggedized for
industrial applications we've added the
cloud expertise and personalization
over-the-air capability that Gemalto has
into the mtm business to offer cloud
services and finally we believe that
security is a really important component
when designing the Internet of Things in
the smart world that we all in visit so
we're bringing the security knowledge
that we have into the mtm business m2m a
lot of people is probably knew but mtm
is ready around us today so if we look
at the the world out there I think smart
meters is probably one topic that a lot
of people have heard about making meters
more intelligent getting the meter
reading out of the meter to the utility
so that they can do more accurate
building faster billing get more
visibility about what's happening in
their network digital signage connecting
these
mine's to upload video to update adverts
to update information and also to create
user interaction with these digital
signs but if you look around there's
more happening tracking and tracing of
anything expensive machinery you won't
believe how many caterpillar excavation
machines are getting stolen every day
there's expensive goods that are being
transported all around the world you
want to know where they are you want to
know what state they're in and you can
embed this technology to pass on that
information if we look at health care
you know this company that put cellular
connectivity in to pull boxes why so
every time the pulse box is opened
there's a signal that gets sent back to
the medical insurance company shows that
the patient is using his medication
still doesn't show whether he's actually
putting it in his mouth but at least
that he's opening the pill box every day
so compliance is another area where m TM
technology is being used e-mobility
people want to know how well the cars
been charged logistics transport a lot
of applications and every now and then
and I hope we've got some developers
here someone comes around the corner and
surprises me and when I heard that there
was someone that put connectivity into
trees and I know Gemalto Oracle's been
picking up on that a lot and been
talking about that as well so one of our
customers put connectivity in a tree why
trees aren't supposed to move and I'm
illegal deforestation in the Amazon
forest for example is a problem our
customer put in and there when the tree
moves this alerts and the authorities
and they can go out and find the people
that are illegally removing these trees
and arrest them so I hope some of you
have some smart ideas things that you
can do and come and surprise me so maybe
before we dig into more information
about what we've done with our core
technology what is an m10 module so I
should have one on me
somewhere in my pocket so it's small so
this is the what we're looking at this
is what we call an m2m module this is
basically a mobile phone packaged for
industrial applications it's an
easy-to-use form factor that can be
embedded into almost anything all these
use cases that i just showed be it in
health care beard and tracking beard and
metering use something like that to send
the data that they're collecting over
the air to some back-end systems and
what we've done is we've made it really
easy to use this mobile phone technology
for the Internet of Things we trying to
reduce complexity through things like
Java to make it really easy for our
customers to adopt the solution this
goes from minus 40 degrees to up to 88
moon 85 degrees so you know you might
run into a problem when you leave your
car your mobile phone in the car it gets
too hot this is designed to go up to
temperatures like that sorry centigrade
so I don't know what is 85 and
Fahrenheit must be around hundred and
almost 200 I guess so at the end of the
day what we're doing with this and if
you look at all these use cases as we're
trying to make processes more efficient
field forces the god and look at say say
you've got a vending machine you want to
know when it's empty and then send the
people out just before it gets empty
rather than sending them out all the
time driving around to see whether any
of these IMT whether the cooling failed
you want to get an alarm signal and this
helps you create efficient processes
so when we look at designing an m2m
solution one of the first things you do
is you want to develop a prototype and
then take it to the street so what we've
done is to make prototyping really easy
is to develop one of these boards and
we'll talk more about that later we've
connected this to the cloud and together
it enables we believe it can enable
developers to rapidly prototype what
used to be in the past two weeks to
prototype an idea down to a couple of
hours adding a couple of sensors it's
really connected to the cloud you can
start quickly the next step taking it to
the street or something like this this
is a terminal it's certified approved
you can sell this you can put an
application on there and sell it to
customers so that means within a couple
of days weeks you can go from
prototyping your idea to selling
something on the street the next step
when you want to go out and you want to
create small applications is something
like this where you do a highly
integrated design and create dedicated
applications so an example that I've
just put up here as vending machines i
just mentioned that you want to connect
your vending machine you want to know
how much is in it so that you can send
out someone to refill that so you've got
trucks that you need to manage a fleet
of trucks that are filling going out
refilling these vending machines maybe
you want to not only refill them but
you've got a field force that's managers
faults so you want to add them to your
system your business case has to grow
over time so maybe you had an idea
initially and you're thinking I can
improve that Java is one of the means
that you can use of updating upgrading
your business case your business model
your idea adding new cases to use cases
to it because the software can be
flexibly managed over the lifetime then
maybe you want to add another generation
of hardware so Java is great we believe
in Java because
you can easily use your software the
code you've written once across multiple
generations of devices the next step is
that you want to go global so hopefully
you're successful with the idea you want
to take what you've done and say the
u.s. you want to extend that maybe
across to Canada maybe to Europe so for
that you need scalable technologies and
so in the u.s. you might have started on
a cdma network evdo network you want to
go to 3G networks LTE is coming up so
you've got to make sure that you are
using technology that will be able to
scale across these different
technologies and will scale across
different operator networks when we're
looking at scalability you know when
you're working with these it's still
easy to put a sim card in there you're
probably only doing a couple of hundred
maybe a thousand takes a bit of time to
put them in thousands but if you're
going in the range where you'd want to
do a hundred thousand of these things
and you need to look at ways of managing
that connectivity easily so we've got
sim cards that can be soldered into the
application and we've got the solutions
to manage that flexibly over multiple
countries multiple mobile network
operators you want to make sure that
these sim cards aren't misused so that
people don't take that out of the mtm
application put it into their mobile
phone and start using it for voice calls
or even verse 22 value-added services
that are really expensive and you want
to have tools to monitor and detect when
things could go wrong and finally when
you designing your m2m system what we've
put made available are tools that enable
customers to focus on what is their core
competence so your core competence when
we look at this vending machine example
is selling cans of coke or sweets
whatever and smart processes modules
together
the cloud enable the customer to focus
on selling these products rather than
focusing on complex technology we've
made available through the cloud through
these tools capability to manage these
devices to deploy and manage this
application that's sitting in the
hardware of the lifetime of the hardware
and we've got tools to allow access for
example if you the I mentioned a fleet
of trucks refilling these machines or
you've got people that are servicing
these machines so you need to give them
access to different layers of
information in the cloud and this is
where the cloud is really useful in
scaling m2m applications finally without
security other people are going to know
when your your machines are running
empty maybe they're posting that on the
web you need security for the billing
part so these are really important
things to consider when designing
application typically when you Ray
typically you know when you've done one
product when you've done 10 nobody cares
but if you're going global and you've
got a hundred thousand units sitting out
there security starts becoming relevant
because people want to you know it's
about fame and glory sometimes so you
don't get fame and glory for hacking
into one thing but we have the tools to
help you ensure that your solutions
could be secure by design so I want to
hand over to my colleague andreas who's
going to talk a little bit about scaling
m2m ok so also thank you for joining us
in this late session today I would like
to detail further a little bit of what
axel already mentioned before and talk
about the scalability in machine to
machine so we have a we have great
history in dealing with m2m experts like
companies that take machine to machine
into mass production and when we when we
appeared here at the job one last year
for the first time we we felt that we
are lacking one of the
which is the interfacing between the
developer community and having having
having access to this community is a
great deal for us so we decided to
invest further and we you call it a
little gadget right so we came with this
little gadget where we say for somebody
who has a great idea and has never been
in touch with cellular for instance but
knows a lot about Java we have a tool
here that allows two to wrap it rapidly
prototype on some idea so for example if
if you take the deforestation as an
example when you say some guy who's as a
treat us typically not move and you add
a motion sensor to to this device and
then you can track movement and you can
see if the tree is falling and if
there's timber theft and then you say ok
but in the course of development you
realize there could be another
application which is I add a smoke
sensor so if there's a forest fire I can
also send in like like a fire
extinguishing helicopter or something
and this this platform is ideally suited
for that so you have an idea and you do
a rapid prototyping and then the next
level to it would be would be a what we
call a terminal or or smart app or
something like that where the
connectivity is packaged that means you
have you have something that is already
certified with a mobile network operator
typically around the world and you can
take it to market immediately meaning
you have demonstrated you your proof of
concept device to somebody who is
interested in taking it into into a
serial production you can then transfer
this into something that is already
certified and pre-approved the advantage
of that is that its cost optimized
because if you think about the next step
which is then a wireless module a
wireless module per se is not functional
you need to power it up you need to add
antenna you have additional components
that you need to add on a PCB and once
you're done you need to go through
certification 30 fication with FCC PDC
RB and AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon or or whichever
mno you
working with and that is a lot of
dollars to your idea so that's why we
have a three-stage approach into to
cellular which is a def board for
testing and trial that works out of the
box and comes with a developer zone
which I will show you in a few minutes
and then a terminal that is already
pre-approved and then a modular type of
device for mass production and this is
what our customers are doing with that
and and that's how the evolution works
in m2m so we have we have a couple of
customers who take a module of ours and
box type it and provided with different
types of interfaces that you may need we
call that terminal and that is one
example here on the left-hand side and
then there are other customers who then
have a higher degree of vertical ization
so in that case TPP when the customer of
ours who is specialized in vending
machines and then they add what is
vertically specific for instance the
decks or the MDB protocol in order to to
listen to the information that's going
on in a in a vending machine and then
the in the final stage we are dealing
with dedicated devices and we take the
example of Philips Respironics here so
they have made a desk device for
patients that have their suffering from
sleeping up near so in case your
breathing is irregular it will report
back to to the to the doctor and the
doctor can then decide if you if they
send to maddox or if you need to show
for our special care and then this is
related to hardware and on top of
hardware like every company in the
market we also have our cloud-based
platform the cloud-based platform is
helping you to
to transfer the data to a back-end
system where you can then analyze data
and the platform that we have is called
Centurions and the logic sends a logic
by the way based out of Austin is an
acquisition of our company that is 42
years old now and sensor logic is made
to normalize data so we understand that
today in the world there's a very
heterogeneous infrastructure like the
different types of platforms different
types of server back ends and then there
are different types of end devices like
here you can see the excavation machine
or or a forklift or truck and what sense
of logic provides is different API so
that you can generate the data take it
from the senzo bring it to the backend
and in the back end and analyze it and
make it available to your customer in
the end of the day and sends a logic on
top of that actually mentioned one of
our core business one of part of our DNA
is sim cards so sensor logic also
provides all the interfaces to to manage
sim cards as in monitoring the sanity
and the lifespan of a sim card or also
in looking into the future with with the
standardization ongoing in subscription
management then to update and change the
subscription that is on the sim card for
example so now comes the hardest part of
my presentation this is to explain why
java at a java one conference but i
would like to mention some of the key
points that made us pick java as the
embedded language for for products so
this cinterion acquisition of Gemalto
that axel mentioned is stemming from
from siemens from siemens mobile phones
and siemens mobile phones were pretty
popular at the time when there were
still feature phones in the market and
feature phones used java so it wasn't a
long shot for the wireless modules to
adopt Java as the language for for
embedded processing and by the time we
did that like 10 years ago for the first
time
we created a java profiles called I PNG
and in order to reduce the footprint of
the virtual machine and it was purely
targeted to cost optimize the
application because we said if you if
you look at the module it comes with
with a processor that is embedded and it
comes with embedded memory so how can we
expose that type of functionality to our
customers in order to get rid of the
additional coprocessor or the additional
memory that used to be on the board and
I was the initial driver and now if we
if we make a cut and say 10 years later
in 2013 the processing power of the of
the of the core technology has increased
by multiples I'm happy to see some of
our friends from welcome here and the
Qualcomm is a chipset technology that we
are using in our portfolio also with
Java and there's bears arm 11 process or
cortex a5 the gas heap of memory on the
module that we can then expose to the
application and also the the virtual
machine of Java today we're working with
Amy 32 is allowing for for multi applet
architectures so the flexibility to use
Java and the resources on wireless
module has increased by a huge factor
and and then we were we were looking for
something in one of the presentations
were called the lingua franca for for
embedded processing and we believe that
Java is best suited for that because
number one every engineer coming from
newest he can speak Java as a matter of
fact then there is there's development
tools there's a heap of development
tools and there's a huge community out
there there are sample code there is
standard testing possibilities there so
plenty of arguments that speak for java
and last not least jsr s that are used
in in the industry and that can be
reused in order to minimize the work
in the application programming so the
target for us was we are always talking
about the 50 billion connected devices
and we all know that it's not happening
today when we said it's only going to
happen if we have if we if we are able
to defragment the market and if we are
able to simplify the development in
machine to machine and Java is is the
ideal answer to that so if you look at
traditional m2m applications and the
traditional mtm application is a
dedicated device somebody has the idea
about one particular use case everything
is being hard coded and there is a
constant data exchange between the
device and the server and this is this
is how m2m grew up and the limitation of
that is those architectures are pretty
unfledged under obligation and you have
a new idea then you need to reprogram
the whole thing and by doing so you you
change your application you need to go
back to Emma knows for certification
very expensive very time-consuming and
opposed to the the monolithic
architectures that we saw in the past
Java is now is now enabling what we call
network devices and is adding a lot of
intelligence to the edge of the network
so in the past all data needed to be
transferred and then used in a back-end
and triggered some action or not so in
the future we see intelligent devices at
the edge that have the ability to
distinguish between relevant and
irrelevant data that are able to filter
data that are able to frame data in a
way it's required by by a back-end
system or two to allow access to mottled
parties through one connectivity so to
act as a smart gateway and what is also
what is specific in the cellular space
and I'm I'm saying that because not
everybody in the java community is a
cellular expert
the approval requirements that Weston
cellular technology is is is very very
tricky and Java is considered to be on
an application layer so it's
disconnected from the protocol stack
that is speaking to the network and that
means every modification that you do on
your device and that happens on Java
does not affect the certification that
you have with a network operator and
that gives you flexibility because
machine-to-machine devices are typically
deployed for a period of five or more
years and in those five or more years
there are changes in the environment and
you will we will need to account for
those changes and everything that
happens on top of Java and Java Leia is
is not violating the approval and
certification that you have with the
aminos so we were able to package all
this into real estate that you can see
here and is a good example our gate is
five Java module so it runs Java ME
embedded 302 basically this is a 3g cell
phone with all the functionality no
keypad and no no display of course it's
it's HSPA it's an HSPA module at seven
dot to Megan downlink and five dot seven
in uplink and like access said it's it's
ultra racket so we spend a lot of effort
in making it sustainable in terms of
temperature heat shock and we have also
we have also hardened the protocol stack
that means typically you are monitoring
an asset that is somewhere remote and
you have no access and you have nobody
to put hands on like if you think about
an excavation machine the guy who is
running the excavation machine is not a
cellular expert so it has to simply
function or your smart meter at home
because you don't even own it so you
cannot put hands on that unlike your
smartphone if your if your smart phone
gives you a blue screen you
set it and it's running again but with
what you cannot do that so we are
building in us all the functionality to
recover from failure or two to ignore a
little faults and or say the to protect
the flash file system so that it can
function for a period of five to ten
years because the flash file system is
typically the weak part of of such type
of device so Java again we said the
initial starting point was to reduce the
build of material to get rid of the
extra coprocessor to get rid of the
extra memory and to allow more efficient
development by using classes that are
already there and you don't need to
reinvent the wheel again also another
advantage of Java is that you create an
abstraction layer in your application
that makes you independent of the
underlying architecture in terms of
beads cellular be 2g 3g LTE cdma gsm you
you can ignore that pretty much you
build your application based on java and
the underlying architecture the
underlying technology becomes less
relevant and like like i also mentioned
already in the course of the life cycle
where they are changing requirements you
can you can you can respond to those
requirements by doing a modification on
a layer that is not violating approvals
that you have with your customer UMNO
summarizing that in one picture and it's
something i showed last year already but
i think it's a very nice illustration of
what we are doing typically there is an
existing back-end where you need to get
the relevant data from the application
and you have a couple of sensors that
you want to monitor and then there is a
number of business rules say define
thresholds and the type of reaction that
is following threshold and then you have
a communication control say how many
times does my asset that I want to
monitor report back to the
back-end system and how does it do it to
have a constant connection to have a
connection once a day do i switch off my
connection for instance we have where
for example tracking customers to say if
if the if the asset goes through a red
zone like say you have a transport
passing through Afghanistan you do not
want the cellular module to report to
the to the network and leave traces
where it is because cellular
communication is easily traceable so the
module itself can take a decision and
say okay now I'm entering the red zone I
will will store the location along the
way and once I'm out of the red zone I
will send all the bait data back to the
back on backbone then back end in the
interworking is the way the data is
formatted basically different type of
protocols clients for different
platforms and then of course last not
least the communication functionality
which is simple simply the interfacing
with the device and the Java ME that we
have on our modules gives you the
possibility to have different type of
mid lets responsible for collecting this
data in real time then aggregating the
data filtering the data reporting it
back to the backend system and managing
the communication between the back end
and the device so this is a this is the
the architecture of the future that we
envision
in m2m with based on Java and I would
like now to hand to our Java architect
Tomas who can give you more insights
about what type of Java way using how
we're using it and what specific
features are there Thank You andreas so
hello everybody so I would like to give
you some further details about our
latest version of Java modules so this
is actually our third generation of java
modules is the tucci and the 3g version
available the 3g version is also the one
which you find in the terminal and on
the concert port so these devices are
based on oregon chava wireless client 32
which basically means is a seal the sea
virtual machine with a hotspot compiler
and it's IM PNG which includes all the
important AP is like com connection
access or all the networking interfaces
it's also capable of running multiple
applications in parallel like my
colleague already mentioned there chay
over their application provisioning
included which allows you to remotely
install an update your MIT let's and
there's also some things which are in
addition additionally she not directly
relate to chava but these are
differences to our previous products you
can at the same time use the module from
internal java applications and from
external applications so this makes
sense in some setups where you have
independent applications working some
internal some external and you also have
some some IP services which means no I
talked about episodes later probably and
i'll talk more about the aps a technical
data so these are arm11 based running a
200 or 500 megahertz and we have five
megabytes of java Hebe or 10 megabytes
of july pin the other
this might not seem so much probably
compared to devices or platforms which
you know but compared to our first
generation of Java products which were
only five hundred kilobytes of Java heap
and a arm9 running at 200 megahertz and
still people could do a lot of
applications of this so we are really
looking forward to see what people do
with this new platform which from our
perspective is very very powerful and
has lots of memory and we are looking
forward to see some really nice
applications on this so I already
mentioned cldc and I am PNG there are
some additional standard Java API on
this platform which is chase are 177
security and Trust it's mainly the
cryptographic parts or gives you the
opportunity to easily encrypt or decrypt
any data which you might want to use of
your application it's also XML chase r
which is very popular to use XML s data
format for example to send over the air
so if this chase are you can easily
parse or put together some XML documents
here it also mentions the location API
does not mention the chase our number
the reason for this is because this is
only a subset of this chase our course
in this devices there is no gps so there
is no real location provider but you get
all the additional functionalities like
for example calculating some distances
between two waypoints and stuff like
that chase r75 well this is very popular
because this is the standard file access
chase are so of course it's also in here
security a very interesting topic I
think my colleagues already mentioned
security I learned in a in a talky on
channel one yesterday I think it was
that forty percent of the embedded
developers do not care about security I
don't know if this is true but I know
that we do care so apart from
connection or security comes in
different different levels first of all
it's of course HTTPS so for HTTPS this
is a standard API and IM PNG as you
might know but it strongly depends on a
TLS implementation which you have
underneath so we put in the latest TLS
implementation we could get to get
everything there you get the latest
ciphering suites you get client and
server authentication yes that's
practically it for TLS another level of
security is is the middle security
itself of course you want to make sure
that not any millets can run on your
devices so we are some certificated
midlet signing mechanism you can ensure
that only your mid let's run in your
devices so nobody else can put any other
midlet sin and minus and manipulate your
your for example power meter or whatever
you have to do this there are some
additional mechanisms which for example
allow you to totally lock the device
because normally you can access the
flash file system where a serial port
and of course in some cases you do not
want that so you can also lock this
functionality and you can only unlock it
with your keys again so the whole device
is pretty secure the data transmission
is secure the midlet is signed the
interfaces which could be used to
manipulate your devices are locked so if
you need this and if you want this you
can totally secure your device
as already mentioned before so there's
multi applications this is all so new
compared to our previous products and
this tests allowed to have a setup like
on this picture for example so there's
the application which serves the
vertical application for example some
power meter or something but in in
addition that can be also application
which serves an additional purpose like
the M agent which does the device
management in general or some bull shark
application so i will you split up your
application in the different parts or
you get some third-party application
could also be from us because we plan to
do some own applications here and
distribute them or put your whole device
together as you desire yeah so ap is
already mentioned API so of course there
are a lot of AP is in an IM PNG but
there are no API as an IM PNG to
actually access the hardware so there
are some proprietary API is included
into the platform which allow you to
access the hardware interfaces of the
devices this is mainly cheap I oh I
square CSPI so these are they interfaces
which you need to actually connect your
application specific hardware to our
module and this then create you whole
device yes but we provide for the for
development so we have a install CD so
to say which you did you get when you
get our product thence the CD does not
only include the documentation and some
examples it also includes a full
integration into the NetBeans and there
and the Eclipse IDE so when you install
a CD you can start right away you have
the device integrated into the Ides and
you just click the example for example
compile it and load it to the the module
so it's very easy to get started with
this so I think this was already my last
slide
right yes it was so thank you very much
and I'll hand over to okay the concept
board so as as Thomas mentioned the
concept board integrates one of the
modules that we just showed as the HS 6
it's a global module so it's got the job
ME embedded on board it's five band HSPA
which gives you 7.2 megabit in the
uplink and 5.7 megabit in the downlink
what we added as an arduino style
connector and as andreas said you know
the idea was that you don't need an
additional microprocessor so with this
board you don't need the arduino board
itself you can just add shields on top
and use the Java that we're making
available through the cellular baseband
you've got interfaces available as well
through our 232 or USB you power it up
by USB your you could alternatively add
a battery on top of it if you want to
make it proper mobile and you don't want
to be connected to a power socket the
antenna is already on board there's a
couple of buttons and a few LEDs and I
think someone back in Berlin actually
wrote an application to do like a Knight
Rider thing with the LEDs but so we'll
make that available yeah and there's a
sim card on board sim card holder you
can put your own sim card in there
depending on what you do what you do
you'll probably need the data tariffs
associated to it but give me your send
and sim card and there are api's to
input the pin and to get get the sim
card working
the concept board will be available
through our online store the demo shop
of gemalto the webshop of the Jamaat oh
we're going to be retailing at at ninety
nine euros chips globally for the first
/ first 100 people that register online
to get the board there's a ten-year-old
discount so we can be selling that at 89
euros to the first hundred people you've
got to be quick because I think there
was a lot of interest and we're going to
ruffle one later when you when you get
this we're going to make available a
developer account where you can exchange
with other developers will have more
sample code you can download the so that
the CD is available but typically this
would ship without the CD you'll be able
to download the user guides and all the
documentation through the portal the
board is we expect to ship in late
November so the ones that we've brought
here to the conference the one that
you're going to win is out of the
pre-production it's hot out of the
factory you'll have to update the
firmware and bear with us there may
still be one or two bugs in it we're
fixing for the proper ramp apps are the
ones that you order through the web shop
will ya be industrial grade and will be
working so we decided to use auto we
know because it's something that the
developer community knows we are we're
looking at a list of preferred arduino
shields that we believe will work well
with the board and we're going to make
that available in the developer portal
and we really believe that this makes it
easy to get started as andreas mentioned
the next step is then this this terminal
its will have several versions of this
terminal there'll be an EHS five
terminal so that the HS 6 is the
quadband HSPA that goes global and
there'll be a dual band that has the
smaller module in it which is either for
Europe or the US and there'll be a 2g
version available as well the different
variants so you'll have some that will
have the GP ours always into this
interface here but there'll be variants
for the USB interface and variance with
a land interface so as an example of
what deutsche bahn is done with the
portal with the java module of ours is
that they have integrated this not to
the train but to the train stations they
have remote train stations with poor
connectivity where they didn't want to
dig fiber into the ground or wires so
they're using this to display
information about train time arrivals
they're also using the voice capability
to make announcements to the people
waiting on the train station and so we
thought we'd ruffle one of these and
we'd really like to hear what you're
going to do with it this won't work is
not designed to work underwater it's
rugged designed to withstand heat shock
temperature but not water and so unless
you you find a way to make it work and
come and surprise me but I really want
to find out what you guys are going to
be doing with our technology and yeah
let's get to the time we raffle one
Robert have you got all the names is
there anyone that's that's in the room
that should be on the paper okay so
andreas can you check the box
and we'll get we've got a cual cut with
an Oracle representative that can pull
the winner out of the box and the
winners and rails taken it oh it's a
Japanese name that I don't but I cannot
officially obvious I'm not do we do it
again do it again okay that's very kind
we go again
Shawn Rasmussen yeah yes so we have a
winner let us know what you're doing
with it so before we get to the
questions up on the slide is some
contact information if you have further
questions let us after the session
you're welcome to contact us remember
most of you didn't win one but you can
order one and we'll be shipping late
November and you've got time over
Christmas to play around with it and
come up with some ideas yeah that's
often the floor any questions yes the
early access code because remember this
is pre-production that we've done and
we're busy working on a a portal where
we invite you to exchange your
experiences to help other developers get
started we will put up a fake use where
we're going to have sample code and
really have a community where you can
interact the code is required for these
boards to access that information so
it's inside this box you can't access it
yet unless you wanna box and they will
open up that to the broader community
and you won't need you won't need that
there'll be a tiered layer of access to
the portal 14 for the public and one way
you register and then you get access and
you can go to the website and access the
all that information more informations
yes
sorry the question is can we share
information about power consumption yeah
so
so maybe this is a good question for
andreas to answer about power
consumption I know we've got a customer
who's got something like eight year
battery operated but so sorry I cannot
answer the question out of the top of my
head but what you can do is you can
visit our website Jamal times I'm not
comment just add the product name like
EHS five and then you can download all
the information referring to that
because we have different power modes we
have idle mode sleep mode special power
saving modes because plenty of our
customers use all modules in a
battery-operated environment
I know we are strictly cellular yeah
well you re no extensions of course yeah
but typically we are we are we are
specializing in cellular connectivity
and we leave Wi-Fi to the specialists in
Wi-Fi other questions so the question is
if there is no strategy for non cellular
connections now we are like like I said
we are we consider ourselves as a
specialist in cellular technology and
typically we work with the system
integrators who then would add a jacent
technologies so there is no plan for us
to to go satellite other than satellite
positioning systems we support of course
we have modules that do location based
on gps gnss aloneness or or Galileo yes
please
so I Thomas should reread repeat the
question and an answer and so the
question was how are these api's which
you have today relate to the coming API
is in MBH for exam sorry well the api's
we have to today for the address access
are our own so these are the api's which
we invented around 10 years ago and but
actually they're very close to what the
get today s device X's IP is so it's
basically the same functionality should
not be too difficult to port any code
and but they're not 100% the same
further questions
no more questions okay then thank you
very much for attending and listening to
what we had to say and we're looking
forward to hearing about the crazy
things you're doing with our technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
