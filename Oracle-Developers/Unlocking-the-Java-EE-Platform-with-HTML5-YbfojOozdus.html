the Oracle organization within which I
work as a product manager on NetBeans
the topic of this session is based on
the fact that it's quite clear that over
the past years html5 has been
significantly revitalized html5
JavaScript CSS 3 multiple JavaScript
libraries it's it's a serious competitor
to say the very least to Java front ends
now what we're asking ourselves in this
session is what if anything can we as
Java developers gain from this
resurgence in HTML is there anything in
the html5 JavaScript CSS 3 universe that
is applicable and relevant and can be
integrated into our Java applications or
should we simply assume that hTML is the
future and we should give up on Java all
together now obviously our answer to
that is no otherwise you wouldn't be
here we're going to show you two ways in
which two key ways in which you can
unlock java ee two ways in which you can
integrate the rich functionality that
the HTML Javascript CSS world offers
into existing Java applications we're
going to show it in first of all in a
pure Java way so there's a number of new
features that have been added to the to
the Java EE ecosystem to integrate
better into the HTML world the second
scenario we're going to show is really
using HTML Javascript CSS from Thames on
top of java de backends because we are
obviously far more in favor of Java that
we are of HTML we're going to start with
the lead java scenario so a pure java
scenario in which we leverage as much as
is usefully possible of the HTML world
and that will be done by david
heffelfinger review is author of books
on java ee and as well as a video course
that you can follow he's going to show
how how that works
and then after that your hummus a
lecturer and developer in QA we're in
Germany is going to show the more HTML
Javascript centric approach to
integration of HTML into Java EE okay
one of the new features for jsf 2.2 if
you guys want to add burns taught this
money already know this but you can do
your markup in HTML and then use some
jss specific attributes to bind your
HTML widgets if you will to jsf and and
another really cool thing that java ee 7
brings to the table is WebSocket so i'm
going to be demo those features so one
of the really cool features that
NetBeans has has a bunch of sample
projects that we can use as a base for
our own projects so i'm going to
actually go ahead just an echo WebSocket
sample and if any of you guys were at
Danny cowards a session just before this
one this is going to look really
familiar I think he either road or he or
he took the sample from NetBeans to show
sledge script finish
the news somehow the
we tried that the baddest FEMA and the
troubles of one and we have we tried
with taken can but it looks it's bad and
it's good getting better sorry though
for that okay so here's a project I
haven't done anything yet but let's go
ahead and running all I did was open the
sample and the browser should be coming
up
it's deploying
of course when I was practicing this
didn't take this long okay here we r
those
we should be seeing the page that's
we're supposed to be saying in just a
minute there we go and that looks very
familiar to what danny caro was showing
you click here it goes to the WebSocket
endpoint you get back a response to the
deploys here so whatever is tight here
goes to a server comes back so let's
take a look at the source first the Java
source with Java guys here maximize this
this is a server end point all we need
to do set this annotation to a class and
that creates a WebSocket endpoint and
this method here annotated with on
message when it receives a message from
the browser it doesn't processing in
this example all we're doing is grabbing
the message and sending it back and
there are annotations for other
WebSocket events like on open on clothes
I'm just going to show so we can handle
those as well and if you guys saw Danny
cow is a presentation you already know
that ok so in addition to Java we have
some HTML and
I'm not very fond of JavaScript so the
sample already has most of the
JavaScript that I need to create array
there so that's good i don't have to
write it myself so i'm just going to
grab it from here now i mention that i'm
going to be using jss so let's go ahead
and add the jsf framework to the project
okay i created a facelets file in this
looks that XHTML now we don't want this
let me maximize we don't want this je je
SS specific text here we want playing
html5 so let's this is the name space
that we need okay and let's get rid of
this
okay now this is plain HTML if we want
the jsf API to process this text we need
to add GSS specific attributes that are
defined in this namespace so let's add a
couple
okay and let's add a form and one nice
thing that nipping says it's headed for
a long time actually but it's Fisher
that some people are not aware of is
this palette here that we can just drag
and drop so let's just add a form HTML
form okay and again we need a jss
specific attributes oh and my markup is
going to be very simple I'm not going to
be showing very fancy and web pages
we're going to be focusing on the back
end and the plumbing so having said that
we're not CSS knobs here this I'm not so
I'm just going to use a table for layout
okay three rows and I don't need a table
hair so i can go away let's add a couple
of labels here
and let's add a couple of simple fields
and drag and drop okay we don't need the
name attributes let's get rid of that
and so that jsf can process it we need a
jsf value and let's give it an ID ok and
then let's cut this whole thing put it
here it's going to be now we want to
bind this to a CD I named beam we don't
have one yet so let's go ahead and write
one java class very simple again just
call it person
okay so CBI has this model annotation
which is equivalent at equivalent to act
name and at request coats let's use that
let's generate the getters and setters
okay so back to our JSF page now we can
bind this to the properties on the class
that I just created
alright and we're going to need a submit
button let's grab one somewhere around
here there we go put it there and again
jss specific attribute now those of you
are familiar with JSF know that will
this will navigate to a page called
confirmation the XHTML so we don't have
one so let's go ahead and create it
and the confirmation page again is going
to be very simple we're just going to
output the first name on the last name
for the person being
okay so let's go ahead I should well
I've been working that me has been
updating the browser in the background
so here's the application so it's just
some values there submit everything
works so right now what I have is a jsf
application that it's using HTML as the
front end there's no jsf components so
in your team you have HTML designers
they like dreamweaver or whatever they
can just design their pages and you set
these attributes and everything works
fine you're not to use jss specific
components now let's go ahead and add a
WebSocket to the mix let's grab let's
grab all that javascript that was
generated by natives in a real
application we should put this on a J's
file but for now just copy and paste
will work fine just for this demo
purposes
let's put the hair
okay oops the browser is going to start
saying okay because I submitted so let's
close that for now if we look at the
HTML here at the bottom you'll see that
unload it invokes an init method and if
we look at it it is actually setting a
variable to a div that's an ID of output
and we don't have it so let's go ahead
and grab it it will help us for
debugging purposes okay right under the
table okay so let's hello let's actually
add let's add a button another button
right above the table in this case a
standard button let's just call it get
defaults and
Square invoke a javascript function
called do Sam I'm sorry I can't hear oh
thank you yep okay where did the button
go okay here we go here we go all right
all right Thomas um let's go ahead and
run this and see what's gone with my run
okay
afterthat see the wrong point it out
this i lost them yeah okay here we go
okay so that is communicating with the
WebSocket and point we're getting back
what we're sending so no surprises there
just making sure that everything is
working so now let's go ahead and modify
the Java code so let's say
ok
format that
now what we want to sign here is JSON
string in a real application we will use
JSON PETA java api for some json
processing but again for demo purposes
we're just going to hard code to Jason
I will do it okay again we need to run
again so that so the java changes kick
in try let's try this I still kinda
still the point
okay see
my upper girl
did I missile brace oh I did but it
should still out but though okay now
let's try it again
get default
it's not coming back the demo gods are
not with me let's see let's check the
JavaScript real quick wrong file
that looks fine to me let's see yeah to
send
oh I know I know it's Donna I know
what's going on this is a HTML that I
got from the other page if we look at
the curve from the sample every time you
click on the button getting both the
scent echo and here's where it binds to
JavaScript functions to the WebSocket
events and now it does this every time
you click the button now we don't want
to do that I would rather do it once
when the page loads and we have the
connection if you guys were at Danny's
presentations you guys saw that you can
stay open it just communicate back and
forth so what we need to do and what I
miss was we need to move this code to
the init function and now we can get rid
of sin echo we don't really need it okay
and now let's see there we go now we're
getting the JSON back okay so now the
last step is we want to populate this
fields with that JSON string that came
back so we have our own message
that will parse the Jason
now if I if I could control space here I
don't see the properties for the Jason
because javascript is dynamic so it
doesn't know however now that I use
first name for use control space here
first name shows up now and that means
it's aware that there's the first name
property that's not the one that I'm
going to use but i just wanted to show
that okay so now we go back here and the
fields are populated a click Submit and
we have proof that the jsf being a
populated with the data from that we got
from Jason from web socket okay now pass
it on to yeah
ok I will take over hello everybody my
name is Jana and I come from Munich
Germany I'm working for a software
engineering company would work for BMW
and other customers and in this
discussion server side java front and
technology or client side found in
technology we are discussing every day
and we are all java programmers and we
have our problems with javascript but
there is other conferences now at this
time I think and the people program
JavaScript like hell and the question is
how can we combine that and how can we
benefit from from the trend which is
already ongoing and you you can't say
now it's happening for my demo I choose
a simple application which I will
develop it's a search form known by
Google you can search the Java one
catalog it's a little bit side so that
you can see fancy css3 things and after
clicking on the search button you get a
result list and and the result list is
shown the logo disappears and the search
form goes up by now animation basically
this is the typical one page application
which you have when you look at google
mail or other applications such
applications often programmed not with
java in the back ends they often use PHP
it's terrible but we all know the world
is bad and this kind of application how
can we do this with java and this works
quite well netbeans has a fundamental
new support for developing browser
applications debugging an HTM file and
the five and JavaScript and the
application i want to show now consists
of a search form it's a sin
page and some JavaScript logic which
does the page exchange the page flow
implement the data binding to the view
you have seen in the sample before the
data binding goes on the server it's
programmed with expression language from
JS f you bind server attributes to a
page and it's templated and sent back to
the browser here it's totally different
we get Jason back like the last less
elected us a demo with the web sockets
and we map it to a oh I HTML page so
serve itself its classical je seven I
use truck CS and 8gb and then I
integrate to another service it's which
is a Pecha solar server it could be che
PA or any other integration technology
here this kind of application is
typically what we do in our business we
often build new applications on top of
existing services like Apache Solr or
other existing salvages we can integrate
and databases are only one part of the
story so let me try to develop with the
client first and here we have new
support in netbeans and this is makes
really fun to start with and for me I'm
not a JavaScript developer I prepared it
for the demo here and i have other
colleagues in my company which are
totally focused on JavaScript and
client-side development and for java
programmers how can this work and
netbeans is one nice way to do so i
start with a new project html5
application and i call it a search
netbeans has nice a support to download
javascript libraries and
want to use k query which is very common
library for executing rest web services
and four and for doing animated things
like page transitions and things like
that I want to use knockout j/s that's
basically the same we saw in the last
demo by when we bind the model element
on the server to the HTML page by using
L expressions when I use a root and
JavaScript only client have to bind the
properties back to my UI and this can be
done with knockout.js I don't know
anybody had heard of but this works a
library of twitter i also want to use
it's not exactly javascript i only want
to use to CSS stuff it gives me
responsive design this is also a thing
you maybe you didn't hurt heard about
but we when we we as java developer and
I teachers on the University of Applied
Science in Rosenheim near Munich swing
development a long time and we have a
special idea of layout management but
the web goes totally different they
think of columns and they think of
different devices and move the columns
for example on a big divisor of 12
columns on a small device of two columns
that's totally different the layout
management of a rich client for example
written in Java fix on so I click on
finish and that beast takes here
sometime the libraries are downloaded
and thanks NetBeans gods are hopefully
finish the see more it's normal now but
what what is this it downloads libraries
for you it creates a project with a
simple HTML page and the HTML the page
has also access to the libraries here
are the
minimized JavaScript files that were
using the Seymour and I name it Jay
search and I want to use that's a theme
that's a lie that is not automatically
done by netbeans i will use jquery and
to use jquery i have to import script
and I you want to use will use knockout
chairs not ojs and i will use bootstrap
which is the CSS style to style sheet i
showed you i talked about ok now let's
write a little bit HTML contact content
html5 have some nice features like
semantic things like header and footer
which we already know if we are server
side java programmer this thing things
we have done with facelet for years but
now you can also written in HTML 5 to
directly and get a little semantics yeah
I want to use a logo and I also want to
have a search form
for the search form it's basically
normal form you seen before it has input
field and a button and some IDs it's
prepared so I can easily write the
JavaScript code later for that it's it's
not possible to write everything in the
national team oh I have also result and
that's interesting here the result is
only a placeholder and that's typically
for it for single page application that
we fill the place holder with content
and this feeling will be done with
JavaScript later so our let's test the
page click on run
it also takes some time but i think
that's that's that's a little barking
mad beta preview version I hope this
okay here we are here we have a simple
input field we have a search partner we
have the footer arm now let's style on
the whole thing a little bit and I want
to have CSS and I've prepared some
serious as I don't but I think you you
don't want to see much CSS here because
we are develop are not designer but it's
impressive if you look at the CSS how
different the UI looks after inserting
such CSS text and the CSS references
some images and I have regards to images
for the dinner which I want to include
now and and copy it to copy it paste it
to my image folder the thing I have to
do now is to reference the style sheet
from my HTML file
okay the statute goes up netbeans as
Auto completion here that's nice and I
can save and if we see before we don't
have to deploy something new it's
automatically automatically done by
NetBeans that's very nice and this this
automatically synchronization you saw
also in the keynote at Sunday and it's a
very cool feature and very makes rapid
development possible so now we're at a
little JavaScript logic if I click on
search I will do something I will change
the content will display the results
will do a rest call and this is done
with JavaScript and for that case I
include a JavaScript file which called
search jas and it's basically has a
search function we all like classes and
interfaces and that's a terrible but
there are other other techniques on the
way Microsoft workings a heart on
typescript and I think the tool support
we're getting better in this way this
function should execute a HX corn and
desk that can be done with jquery with
this short jquery expression you execute
nature's call to the server and if you
are successful this function get calls
and it's basically basically basically
puts the chasing result of the chase and
result of the rest call in the result
element of our page and
another thing is now how would you
execute this function you can write code
image in your HTML file but that's not
good that's not a clean separation of
concern you can do another thing we
already saw you can the onload handler
defy you can define our onload handler
which is a function which is called when
the page is fully loaded and what I am
doing here I register change handler
with the sets an expression and then it
executes it executes the rest call it
executes the rest call if I click on
submit and fades out everything in LA
let's try to tap this I have to link the
script here ok click on save everything
is to automatically deploy it to our
rocks ok you have seen a nice animation
which is done by jquery and that's a
popular things people ligand and do a
lot of this fanciful front end stuff and
now we are ready to implement a server
and the server is totally je we can
benefit of the whole stack here and
that's very nice i will show you how to
write the server part of this
application i make a Mabel web
application made this quite popular it
gets me continuous integration and this
cord is the project is chase search
server
hey Bronson glassfish force 87
so here in that means you have a wizard
where you can create a restful web
service from a pattern and this is a
skeleton for your own simple web servers
you can truly also use user samples they
even showed on but you can easily
develop it from the schedule this dezod
that URL is search and my class name I
want to use search for Sade arrest for
rest and it returns me adjacent
representation of my data ok this
without generates two classes it
generates the rest webservice which is a
little bit crowded I can delete some
things here basically I want to have one
rest function which it's a name such and
gets a search expression and return some
chasing but I don't want to build chase
in by hand it's terrible I want to have
a mapping automatically to chase and so
I return a list of cata log entries
the list of catalog entry catalog
entries is a simple poacher I have to
create
and it has two properties a name and a
description
I use some need some boilerplate code
like constructors for the parameters and
I need getters and setters and that's
very nice to develop us with netbeans so
and I have prepared some mock
implementation which does it does create
to catalog entries put it in a list and
we'll turn the list to the caller and
magic happens here it's automatically
measured Marshall to to chase and it can
be accessed in JavaScript easily I do
not have to pass anything I can access
it directly now let's test machine yes
yeah yeah another class was generated
this is necessary if you develop your
arrest Chuck say s services on this
class basically defines a root path for
your application where your rest
services are and this class has to build
you find only once in that application
and there's some magic in the netbeans
generators and sometimes it fails if you
develop a project twice with the same
name II think so you have already
already an application and nothing is
generated be careful if you use the same
name for demo purposes it's all let's
try to start the server norm the server
has is it's a Jes over you you can write
servlets and you can ride chase F here
but I only want to have a message search
server is up let's try to start this
the server
okay that's normal server side java
development you know you have seen many
sessions I think it's a Java one
concerning this type of application the
deployment take some time I'm on a
virtual disk on my machine it's it's a
little bit slow but here we are the nice
thing in netbeans you have access to
your to your rest services and you can
click on search and test the service and
here we are the JSON representation is
visible and this data I will display to
your nicely to the client now we have
one fundamental problem when you use
rest web services you can't access the
whole internet with that the rest
service has to allow this and if I try
it with with my browser applications che
search I have a problem j search runs on
a debug port of the chrome plugin it's a
different port then the j search server
so i get a security violation and here
you see a new feature film from j ee 7
which they edit and have integrated in
netbeans it's a filter where you can
enter that access from other URLs is
accepted and that's a response filter
and is here set with with the result
that's needed otherwise you get security
violations but if it's easy to
I run again I have to redeploy here
because i added a fundamental class but
what deployment doesn't work at this
stage and now try such example the
server is now here ok and there comes
back to chasing and now we map it back
to the UI and this will be done
client-side not server-side that's a
fundamental difference from using jsf
the whole UI state the whole UI model
eyes in the browser that can be tricky
to debug and it's a refactoring
nightmare but many people develop such
applications and there are strong
libraries out there for example for for
charting yeah if star F X has a very
nice chart engine but you also have a
merchant chart engines with JavaScript
they look good there a little bit slow
but but look not really good so on I try
to map it back so back to the client I
use my JavaScript and I want to have a
view model view model is from a library
knockout yes they have observable arrays
and this observable array I access when
I have a successful rest call and what
the function here does it removes all
entries from the model and adds all
values from the result list and
but what what does it mean it now
changes a model in JavaScript and we
don't have them mapping to the UI now
and the mapping can be also written on
the mapping can be also written in HTML
direct we don't do not have to write us
any server code here and for that I have
prepared this code and if you look
cleanly left data bind annotations
attributes here and it looks a little
bit like chase a server-side but it's
totally JavaScript on the client side
and what this code does it binds to the
attribute your side and loops over the
content of the diff and adds this this
diff n times and binds to the link that
the property name and to the text the
description now click on save and we are
ready
yeah and let me conclude we are not java
conference and why why is this why I did
this team of this way the Chava words
the JavaScript world what is a is a
trend you can you can deny it's here and
there are other server backends like PHP
or other emerging technologies and all
what they do is they develop JavaScript
also Microsoft develops a lot of
JavaScript and sure you can develop such
a application very fast with Java fix I
did it the same application last year
after the Java one I clicked together
and I have animations and have data
binding it's totally nice with developed
the development model of Java fix but
not every customer allows you to have a
j 4n on the client that's a fact and if
you look at BWW are others say need pure
web application and that's an
interesting answer is I think if things
go best better in javascript and java
script goes more and an enterprise by
and the tools go better you you need
refactoring you need better tooling for
for that NetBeans is a very good first
step for that you can actually develop
such application and make sure I i want
to say they at the end for our company I
never would choose this architecture for
a whole enterprise application for now
we the biggest systems we developed our
jsf server side java technology but we
also seen a lot of problems the stages
on the server scalability issues
those synchronization problems and and
you have to integrate some JavaScript
logic like we've seen before and the mix
is very terrible to develop if you have
chase f javascript HTML CSS all together
and distribute it on a client on a
server in a wild way you it's it's
getting worse those this architecture
makes sense but don't make your next
enterprise application this way thank
you so just to very quickly summarize
cinelli david very quickly recap what
you did and then given is vertically
what you did and then we finish with
some questions from the group what I did
was I developed an application you seen
java ee but the front end was pure html5
now jsf components or anything like that
and integrated that front end with a
WebSocket server side endpoint what i
did i developed html5 the applicant
single page application with the rest
webservice for the data and the rest web
services je technology and the client is
totally developed in JavaScript well
mainly before question what what would
be the benefit of the one approach over
the other in your mind well what what I
did is beneficial if in your team you
have front-end developers that are very
good with javascript and HTML CSS wish
i'm not so that's why my page looks so
terrible but you know in a real in the
real world I wouldn't make the page
pretty the front end guy would you know
I just take care of the back end yeah i
think the benefit of this architecture
is a scalability you have a rest restful
server which can be totally stateless
which has no session
our client state and that's good for
cloud computing if you want to scale to
elastic scale air with a the dynamic
load distribute distribute you
distribution you need a stateless
technology and so this can be achieved
by having the for you I state in the
client and not to to use you i stayed on
the server any questions from anybody
yeah don't use JavaScript use Java you
can be yes who's Java figs and unitive i
can say i'm not a real JavaScript I you
have to ask any java experts but the
problem with javascript is basically in
it's not it has no type system so
refactoring does not work yeah and
that's one one thing we do every day we
try to reflect our code and and and that
gets a nightmare and this nightmare
comes if the application gets big and
testability is also a problem but there
are also clever people thinking of and
making on libraries for that things
getting better I think so if you're
talking about unit tests I don't really
have a good answer for you but actually
net means the latest version comes with
a very good JavaScript debugger so you
don't mind what I want to give that a
try 50 better right yeah now in fact as
soon as you've deployed the application
it is indeed it is in debug mode and you
can set breakpoints in the Java scripts
and refresh the browser and immediately
you can step through the code that's
definitely one answer yeah other
questions yes
of completion there
how much they came from that means
the question was about the about the
code snippets that you're honest use
throughout his demo which is which is
maybe what I recommend anyone to do when
you're doing them oh hey yeah it's
totally netbeans okay thank you very
much even more questions please let us
pass here thank you for coming that's
what I learn more about java ee would
net things to have a video for styles of
smoking luck there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
