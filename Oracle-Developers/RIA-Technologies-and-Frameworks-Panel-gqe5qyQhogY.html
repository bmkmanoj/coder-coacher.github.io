frameworks panel edition 2013 so we did
it last year and we got good feedback
and so many good things and questions
that we well just wanted to do it again
so let me just a short introduce the
cast of people who will answer all your
questions so starting a enough of
particle order so it's a unless Remy
right he's known as the groovy Griffin
guy so every time is groovy then we get
a garret better known as Han Solo
underscore the guy for really nice you
guys so probably he is javafx swing
hardcore person in tell folks how many
talks your doings this week it's about
seven alright let me get max cats so
developer at apria Oh max welcome we get
Kevin who's a glue html5 person
representing the Java user group from
Silicon Valley we myself I'm a hardcore
swing guy developing on top of NetBeans
platform and looking deep into new Java
effects rich cline things and then last
but not least last but not least our
content chair steven chen and that's me
on the back yeah probably I like your
jacket color choice there Kevin it's
very nice yeah yeah all right so we got
some backup questions just in case you
you don't have any for us so what we
like to know is perhaps we shop with a
Paul so who's using swing yeah well
swing rocks huh
who's using Java vex good html5 so it
seems everybody is using everything we
say sir so who's doing mobile things
okay desktop android android hang on
hang on android iphone linux box Kevin
all right we got the desktop hands I
think a couple of them yeah so desktop
Java desktop is not that they're a big
guy but they're yeah yeah yeah nobody
wants to talk about that all right so
any special framework so anybody doing
up into our CP that means platform
programming don't be shy Eclipse based
on Eclipse oh ok so i asked using SW key
is that is that you're using eclipse or
is it your building applications on top
of your clips ok of wine all right okay
yeah yeah ok so good so that's that's
good so what do you think Kevin how
about html5 versus negative on mobile
things so what do you pay for today so I
think it depends a lot on what kind of
application you're trying to build so
myself if I'm doing something
consumer-facing like the stuff we did it
just me we built all native it's really
painful but we built native apps in
android had a whole nother team did an
objective-c stuff building native apps
an iphone and then also then finally we
had an html5 responsive app for reaching
platforms you know like the windows
mobile blackberry and in desktop as well
so for me if you're if you know if that
UI is your bread and butter and you
really want
kind of the best experience and and
that's what's your differentiator I'm a
firm believer that that must be done
natively and I think max may disagree
but I think you know if you're building
administrative tools if you're building
in-house things if you're I don't know
you know if your core business is not
that application it's just supporting
software then I would I would you know
write it in html5 do something like
Cordova you know figure something out
you know the appcelerator titanium stuff
is really nice have used a bit of that
but so it really depends on the type of
app that you're doing what your targets
are and you know what you're trying to
achieve mex looks like you want to come
on yes actually I do agree ah no but it
a it very much depends on kind of a pure
building so if you need super
high-performance you know full access to
device API is complete than yeah you
should go with native so but we're
talking to you a bunch of largement
enterprises and businesses and they have
a huge demand to build apps right
internal apps and so they don't need
this super high performance and so in
this case and it's a perfect fit for
html5 and also a hybrid i'm right
because you can build one app and target
multiple platforms and so what we heard
is that it's okay to sacrifice a little
bit of the performance just a little bit
but then writing just one app that can
target multiple platforms okay so
they're okay with slightly less
performance but they can wipe one app
once and target multiple paths and again
they can write down pretty fast using
html5 technologies well you just real
briefly tell us what they can use to do
that and then we don't want to go too
much into that but as in tools yeah but
you can come on tell me what you guys
have to offer so so I run dev relations
for a pre that I oh it's a cloud
platform for creating mobile apps so
think of it as an ID running in the
browser so you've got a clip for example
to this is
set of tools visual tool source tools
for building mobile apps entirely in the
browser so nothing to download nothing
to install which makes it invariably
fast and easy you move seen cases where
you can build an app within a few hours
you know the same app would take you
days if not weeks to build in
traditional tools so I'd like to pull
the audience to see how many folks are
building things for mobile using web
technologies javascript HTML 5 that kind
of things anyone cool and what about
native are people doing native uh how
many folks are doing hybrid a little bit
of both that's that's kind of an
interesting approach right to do you
know some screens little sui in sense of
things in a hybrid approach I haven't
done much of that but I definitely think
there's there's some real value in doing
that and hopefully in some near future
the whole highway approach feel almost
go away like you know like PhoneGap
because you know once the browser's have
api Jax's device features in Firefox as
API is now to access the camera and so
on so you want to we need a hybrid
employed basic use just a browser api's
yeah yeah it's going to take time before
it's all standardized but I think I mean
that's what's going to happen in some
number of years all right
questions any questions from the
audience ideas remarks what was the
first technology GWT great so so the
question was about GWT and phonegap with
something called em wit and just you
know what do we think of these kind of
things I know GWT is kind of a nice
model it done a little bit of it but
it's sort of taking your java objects
that you have on the server and exposing
them out to the browser it's actually
pretty nice but I actually found it a
bit confusing you know where I couldn't
tell where I was at was I in the browser
was I you know but but yeah so doesn't
doesn't your stuff sit on Sapa phonegap
max yeah so we use phonegap so you get
the nu built you start with html5 mobile
app and then if you want well you can
publish it as a mobile web app and then
you can use phonegap two packages as a
native app and also of course get access
to all the API is if phonegap provides
so I mean phonegap is a great technology
you got it could you speak up speak up
was asking about dark got it I heard
google and that was it before so you're
curious about dart and what the panel's
thoughts I'll let someone else but I
definitely am very opinionated about
that but only well I don't know are we
racing all says for the second coming of
the browser Wars do we really want to
get again into that space I don't know
you guys have any idea I know that's not
problem that's really the only do we
have a surprise panelist who wants to
answer the question let me introduce
this is van riper he's the chief from
gtalk is that what you guys GD g GD g
leader for all the google developer
groups i was in sales i don't really
want to speak for the dart team but i do
know that the goal there is to try and
move the web forward trying to be you
know be able to write go beyond likes a
javascript to be able to write
enterprise like class applications for
the web and it does support cross
compiling to JavaScript so it will work
in any browser today I mean you can use
it to build applications for any browser
today but I think if their goal is not
the fragment thing so I mean I think
they'd be very open to working with
other browser vendors it's for support
and what if that doesn't happen I mean
they'll look at ways to make it work
like I said with cross compilation with
the JavaScript and so forth alright
thanks man yeah I guess that it's still
up in the air if it's going to work in
that way right the idea is to move this
thing forward but the same thing you
could say Microsoft thought that jscript
was the way to go and they skip Netscape
thought that Java plugins worth the way
to go and then the other guys thought
that they own
solution where the way to go and they
eventually got into trouble I mean isn't
that the way it always is is there's God
there's gotta be some competing things
and then some things become everyone
says oh this is the right thing and then
all the browser's adopted so you know so
I mean this is just the way it is right
alright so to talk about browsers so I'm
a desktop you think browser wins on
desktop as well or do you think javafx
or swing Java will will survive so I'll
take this this one so I think the answer
is actually similar to what these guys
were talking about for um native versus
HTML on mobile clients so if you're if
you're building a look at administrative
console are a fairly straightforward
form-based you I um there's nothing
wrong with using a web framework and you
know one of the Java either GWT or
javaserver faces are one of the
java-based frameworks for building a
user interface and that that does
simplify deployment if you're
distributing to a large number of folks
in the browser but then you get into a
lot of compatibility issues and you're
not going to get the nice graphical
performance you do from native or Java
client software I think the best use for
java client software and we see it used
a lot in for example folks doing complex
you is in medical air traffic control
even folks in the nasa and some of the
space programs are utilizing swing and
other technologies so anywhere you ought
to build a graphically rich user
interface something beyond based a
simple form based you I that's where
native and client java client technology
is really shine how many of you go folks
were in the keynote on Sunday just a
quick show of hands okay for the for
those of you who didn't see the keynote
one of the things we showed was a chess
user interface on a bunch of different
clients we showed in HTML we showed it
running on embedded devices and also
running on the desktop and
desktop client we were using javafx with
the new 3d support so it had you know
rich animations the actual chess pieces
did little picks our style graphics
where they were fighting each other with
clubs and big weapons and that's
something where if you if you tried to
do it in the browser it would take you a
lot longer and you wouldn't be able to
achieve the same graphical polish as you
can with a desktop desktop application
Jared comments well it was nearly
everything I can say to that so but I
agree just for the last part I think we
will see also 3d stuff in the browser
getting better right now it looks a
little bit crappy to me it works and you
see some nice demos but it's not really
the same quality like the JavaFX stuff
we saw the at the keynote yeah i mean i
think the web the web GL stuff is pretty
good but you know it's as far as getting
adoption and getting it out there
everywhere getting good performing in
plantations it's just yeah well I think
one of the big things which sets and I
know this is all on preview stuff so you
can access in the job aid early access
but I think one of the things which sets
both the java client api is like javafx
and the 3d support apart are for example
when we did the 3d support for javafx we
specifically designed it so folks
without a 3d background who didn't know
opengl who were not used two textures
and lighting and all these concepts
could easily create good looking
graphics animations so it abstract sawey
some of the complexity of the underlying
implementation and I think really the
only way you can get that is with client
frameworks when you're trying to do
something where you're standardizing it
and trying to make it work across a
bunch of browsers and operating systems
it's very hard to get that level of
Polish and development productivity that
you get from coding in a client language
so yeah I mean for the javafx definitely
agree me if it's something really
specialized definitely make sense but I
think in general if it's a business app
Enterprise out I mean I think most folks
are not going to be using javafx right i
mean just going to go with
html5 is that right yeah now especially
hmm so if you were going to distribute
an app for example build like a UI for
like a hotel reservation system you
definitely want to use in that case a an
html5 or Java server based technology
because you're going to want a whole
bunch of different people to be able to
use the application in their browser and
from mobile devices so that makes a lot
of sense yeah I mean just to me it just
feels like there's just so much push I
mean if you go if you come to this
conference I mean there's so much of
effects coverage and if you go to other
conferences like maybe like dell box so
much double effects but that doesn't
respond to how much javafx us out in the
world just a lot of push but very little
out there is that so we we I would yeah
yeah well there is to see a lot of
swinging applications out there so that
means the desktop application in Java is
still live so how much of that is yet to
be Java fix this is the question
what I'm saying is that people see some
people claim that swing is already dead
that javafx is is swing 2 0 that to me
is not yet the case because the effects
adoption is growing certainly but I
don't see NetBeans being rewritten in
traffics nor the other there are three
out of four major IDs which use which
took it swing exactly so that's part of
the reason why we in the recent javafx
release we added in the swing note
support so you can embed swing inside
applications one of the things which is
a pain point for lots of people
upgrading their apps and the NetBeans
team internally hit this as well is if
you have large complex controls built in
swing without the ability to keep those
while you're moving your application the
javafx it becomes very hard to upgrade
and take advantage of the new features
in javafx so the strategies less you
know drive people off swing swing will
be around it's part of the java standard
it's not going to go away but encourage
people to start taking advantage of the
new features and capabilities of javafx
in their existing swing apps and as they
migrate to that as the next big java
client framework and that person is
about well I will say that makes me more
confident about the strategy that
article is pushing now in the previous
years if you wanted to jump into Java
fix it was all or nothing whether it
works or not and we know how that turned
out to be because they say this is where
we burn the bridge and did you go javafx
is all the way now they are it that
they're willing to support swing in some
way compatibility ways you can even have
JFX components and swing components
using the same UI thread that's that's
something coming you in jdk 8 which is
really great that we certainly
encourages people to add a little bit of
a spice WB labja effects spice into the
existing legacy swing applications so
the migration path is much easier now
and I suspect that it will get much
easier as we get into the next year
don't we people are already doing that
so the one of the Dukes choice walk when
yours applications already has javafx
embedded on top of the NetBeans platform
application so the people are taking
that room there's a lot of interest in
emerging and going forwards and small
steps but trying to use the new
technologies and a backward compatible
way somehow so yeah well and I think
it's a another reason why it's not
adapting that fastest just because
javafx didn't had a good sad it is up
for years right and it was announced and
announced and announced and I just do
since two years before I never would
touch it but then they convinced me and
it's it's really good now in compared to
the old stuff so I think many people
hesitating because it's just okay they
suffered in the past and they have no
idea where it goes yeah but swingers old
all right so it's buried wasn't a matter
of if it's old or no this is another of
the end if they're too havior and the
features that you could have and the
things that probably probably were
missing for example we're still missing
and stand our date picker in swing but
they are there are so many open-source
options out there if you want to use a
date picker but in my case I used to
work for a company where we couldn't
make use on any open source project if
it wasn't provided by the JDK it just
didn't exist I know that some of you
guys may be in the same condition where
if it's not in the JDK then I'm so sorry
i don't i don't care if it's a very
liberal episodes license your manager
will simply say no thank you so that
will not be the case now going forward
and that that's what the problem is that
swing face it works perfectly well it
still works very well for me but if i
want some additional standard component
no such luck i have we got a question in
the yeah come on back there
okay so i'll repeat the you got the
question so the question was you know
we're kind of stuck between two da to
which is the officially supported
implementation and eight we're a lot of
the new javafx developments going on and
you know for folks who are reliant upon
8 features it sounds like you guys are
actually okay with what's out in 22 you
can't actually go to production on
something on eight yet and you know
that's pretty much true of a lot of the
java technologies the one of the things
we did recently with javafx is we
aligned it with the the JRE release
schedule both for patches and also for
the the big releases so the advantage of
that is now you get javafx directly in
the JRE so when you download Java 7 when
you download Java 8 it comes with javafx
installed and even starting a Java 8
it's on the bootstrap classpath so you
don't even need to change the class path
to access the JavaFX classes the
disadvantage as you pointed out is it's
now stuck on these same java train for
when you get patches when you get
updates and when you get major releases
so and the same thing applies like if
you want a bug fixed in the Jerry some
bugs you can vote up in the book system
and they'll make it into patches and
small releases throughout the year but
if you want any major features it's
going to happen in the next major
revision and for the most part the the
Java a feature set is pretty much locked
down at this point so you can test it in
the early access releases but you can't
actually depend on it for production
because we're still in the bug fix
product ization stage of those features
yeah just adding the appeal about that
now that most of the Java fix platform
is open source it could be the case that
you will be looking for a feature in Gen
FX 8 that may be possible to be ported
to jf x 2 now that the code is open
source somebody can actually do it
previously we were not able to do this
so this is a great thing to have so
there there is
fact a project trying to backport the
eight parts the open j of x 8 source is
running on top of seven so if anybody's
interested in that just go out there I
think it lives on github or bitbucket
and lend an overhand and keeping that up
to date so it's out there but it keeps
work so yeah anybody interested in
joining the effort so you can help sorry
that depends yeah absolutely yeah
depends on your company your customer
whatever yeah but it's probably it could
be an option for some people at least so
question there could you speak up a bit
Oh
see
so so I'll kind of try to summarize what
the question was so so basically he's
currently doing some work in flex at his
company and they're kind of evaluating
alternatives have some question about
whether or not html5 is mature enough
and people are actually using it and
then the questions or something about
javafx it wasn't sure exactly what he
said but yeah I think he was asking
about hooks to UM in the browser to
interact with other contents so I mean
just commenting on the the html5 stuff I
mean I think it's definitely very mature
very well adopted wouldn't I wouldn't
hold back on adopting any of that and
moving forward with that I mean I think
you know depending on what your target
audiences you know if you if you're
trying to support people who use IE 6
then maybe it's not a good idea but
you've got things like chrome frame that
will run chrome inside of IE 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 so
that you get the chrome experience and
that helps quite a bit there's projects
like moderniser that helped a lot with
telling you feature detection rather
than kind of user agent strings you know
sniffing that that help you determine
what features are actually available in
this browser so that it's a little bit
easier way of making a determination of
of making things work across the board
well but I mean I think a lot of that is
kind of old news and you know especially
with the the mobile push
you know with the the early WebKit big
push everything that's available there I
I wouldn't hold back at all you know I
wouldn't I wouldn't feel concerned that
the html5 was not kind of mature enough
or adopted enough the decisions more
about you know what kind of how
graphically wonderful your experience
needs to be that's a different you know
discussion how mochis how much a state
you want to keep or do you need to keep
on a client as well I mean just you I
mean totally agree but just you and I
mean if your app is data-driven content
driven I mean I think it's pretty simple
i mean html5 is a perfect fit now also
keep in mind that you know it's not
going to be just html5 you're probably
going to pick up a JavaScript framework
right so I mean that also something to
think about it's also like really really
tough when you want to do mobile and how
many different implementations you want
to do I think you know that's where
html5 is really something that can help
you get a lot done with little effort
but you know sometimes the results
aren't aren't necessarily what you want
yeah so you know I'm actually I actually
did quite a lot of flash development as
well back when Adobe dropped the hammer
even did a little android yeah yeah even
on Android I was i just finished
publishing a book on writing mobile you
eyes and flash and adobe went her killed
the entire thing said we are what ya
know it was quite it was quite painful
and dumb so i think at least my my
experience having done you know
obviously I'm the javafx guy in the
panel but I've done quite a bit of
JavaScript and html5 and flash
previously so just for your development
experience the closest match to what you
were using before with flash is going to
be javafx from a feature and development
style standpoint I don't know you know
it'd be hard to to give you guys
advice because we don't know exactly
what your UI looks like and what your
customers expect from the user
experience but I think your expectation
should be if you you know if you're used
to a certain development model and
efficiency and how you're building you
eyes would flash you'll get the closest
to that using JavaFX but you're going to
get advantages from switching to
something like html5 if your application
is simpler or you can reset expectations
about how much you do and if you can
read 20 lon on JavaScript and html5 in a
way where you don't lose to development
too much development efficiency there's
quite a lot more overhead developing
JavaScript applications and testing them
at different desktop browsers
specifically related to the question
about javafx and in browser integration
the way that Java fix integrates with
the browser is it deploys as an applet
inside of the browser a lot of people
get scared when we talk about applets
this is the newer applet model so it
works quite a lot better and it uses the
jnlp file is just like web start you can
interact with stuff on the page so you
can interact with JavaScript and bridge
objects across if you want to
communicate with things interacting on
the page and do it by directionally but
again it's not the most you know
seamless development experience you have
to write JavaScript you have to write
your JavaFX application and then hook
the two together what we're actually
recommending as a as a best practice for
folks who are distributing JavaFX
applications now is that they prefer
native application deployment as a way
of getting applications to end-users and
the advantage of that is that when you
ship as a native application you can for
example put it in the mac app store or
the Windows Store so you can actually
ship it using the desktop operating
stores it'll create bundles for
installers on the application so for
Macintosh will create a dmg file windows
a exe installer and Linux RPM bundles in
that way it also bundles the
java runtime that you're using with your
application so the end user get exactly
the same run time that you tested your
application with and from their
standpoint it's a pretty seamless it
installs like any other native
application so they can get up and
running immediately without any issues
right there was another question right
there that's all I had yeah okay so so I
actually had kind of just a question for
the panel so one of the things that I've
been doing recently I've been doing a
lot of of work on iOS so I've been doing
a lot of work and storyboards and nib
files and those of you who aren't
familiar it's it's a very kind of Dragon
drop your kind of doing layout
management kind of in a nice
drag-and-drop environment it goes a
little bit further than then what you do
maybe an Android wear you know all your
event handlers your kind of dragging
from this storyboard WYSIWYG and you're
dragging into code it recognizes methods
and it kind of does quite a bit and you
know that kind of stuff has been around
a really long time and I've always kind
of just said well you know that's not
there that's there for somebody else not
for me but in iOS world you're kind of
really I don't know you really have to
write it's really deeply part of the
tool and I'm actually I'm okay with it
like at first I was really kind of
thrown like what is this and I was like
how do I get away from this and how do I
stop doing this and I've actually been
pleasantly surprised I like it and I'm
wondering what folks on the panel think
and if we're going to be seeing more of
that and if if folks are going to be you
know if that's going to be more readily
used in you know android java effects in
those kind of areas i'm actually the
last
alright so I'll speak for other javafx
tooling we're actually investing a lot
in seen builder which is a GUI WYSIWYG
utility for building you eyes and it it
is it has limitations right so sometimes
you want to do things which you can do
faster in code that you can a WYSIWYG
editor but for a lot of situations for
doing mock-ups for building a quick user
interface it's quite helpful to
bootstrap development and I think I
think one of the important things is to
maintain some layer of abstraction
between what the tooling is doing and
what your code is doing so you don't
have to manually hack what's coming from
the GUI tooling but the same time it's
not code generating where you're
actually having to integrate code that
was one of the things the joys bothered
me about the early java client UI
frameworks as they they would generate
code and they would mangle your code and
that would ya so so I know you know the
just maybe when we use storyboards with
multiple developers we had a ton of
problems right so this is pretty much
one person was allowed to touch the
storyboard and you can add a one hour
email notification and I am like it kind
of lock on the file kind of a thing but
other than that I mean it's it's really
nice i like seeing my entire application
across a storyboard and every everywhere
i can go and what are all the options
and it is i'm not failure with the iOS
tooling but is it um binary storage for
the UI or how does it store the UI
definite it's actually an XML file I
think it's accent I mean it it looks to
be very similar to xml if it isn't human
edit of ultimo it's it's not really
because there's a lot of you you IDs in
there and so we end up doing a lot of
merge resolution in it and then often
redoing work when you have multiple
developers so that was the only like
major problem that I had with it but
okay I really yeah we had some guys who
were over X some flash developers the
room did you guys use mxml quite a bit
in your UIs yeah
okay so I think like if you look at the
up XML support and javafx I think they
did a pretty good job of keeping it at
least machine human readable and easily
mirja ball there's no funky you you IDs
or tags inside of it and it's what the
seeding builder tool generates is pretty
close to what you'd actually write if
you were doing the XML definition coding
by hand would you would you agree guard
yeah to be honest I'm not a big fan of
this FX and that stuff so you ask the
wrong guy I mean that's what I'm kind of
wondering is like people doing basic
applications and you know just doing
consumer data entry stuff and maybe but
maybe you want some drop shadows and
maybe you want you know various kind of
we have we had that discussion with some
customers and they told us that they
would love to have something like the
iOS stuff because you have this work
flows as far as i know i'm not that
familiar that but i think you can do
really click through your application in
the in the UI before you really coated
I've never successfully done it anywhere
else and been happy I've always okay
we'll give it a try i give it 30 minutes
and i kind of walk away but at least in
the iowa stuff I've been happy and I
just wondering if that's going to drive
innovation in other areas and other
people try to repeat that or if if we're
going to continue to do things so I
would love to see this this that you can
have more than one screen and switch
through the screens that would really be
nice and then in a scene bit of stuff
because they're nice and it gives you
you know lays out the whole app and then
drag and drop and it shows a control
flow of the various areas you go and the
tab bars where all they take you so it's
really nice ok so i guess here is it my
chance to look and talk that's going to
happen tomorrow is called j effects
tools of the trade where we discuss some
of these things and what I say we is
because hey I'm one of the other guys I
believe that each at the state of the
JFX tooling at this point is a little
bit of low-level what you're looking for
is a very high level
state of tooling where'd you just drag
and drawing things and it happens if i
remember correctly we had this tool
course in iOS but we also had this tool
for flex three or four years ago and was
i was really glad cannot recall the name
of this thing but it made you write your
application so easily just drag-and-drop
but that said the JFX we have that
capability it's possible but nobody's
list that I'm aware of is writing such
tool we are in the state of being able
to automate the production of an
application end to end but just
connecting the dots if you want to do it
with drag-and-drop well I guess that
somebody else will do it so so probably
could take a poll there were a couple of
hands of people using javafx so who's
using f xml and singular so anybody else
is coding the UI by hand yeah maybe 5050
yeah so okay seems like on the board
people who like seen builder and if XML
generation and people who love to kill
things by hand so yeah so no clear
winner there yeah it's funny too because
I'm the kind of guy who likes to avoid
that stuff as much as I can like
anything related to the UI like is
really not my area and so you think that
like the drag and drop stuff would be
like right where I want to go but
usually I end up fighting that more than
them enjoying that so I can get out
faster by doing it by hand usually but
the iOS stuff has been different so
pleasant surprise I think it depends on
the kind of you I you create so if you
create for example form based stuff or
with the standard components then I
agree that that is really a good
experience where you have this drag and
drop stuff but then if you start with
something customizing then most of the
times you have to code otherwise there's
no support and then it starts to mix it
up so so so I think I think you may be a
happy guy in the next scene builder
release where they add support for um
third party custom controls inside of
the tooling
yeah release two yeah yeah yeah I want
to get some advice from the GUI panel
here but first one to ask where the ATF
guy is that you not invited to the party
so my team with Java developers
responsible for sweep applications that
range from a j ee JSP based applications
to actually the primary application is a
swing base thick client and we will also
dip their toe into into mobile using
hybrid approach with phonegap and
they're all due for rewrites that
they're all ancient you is and
horrible-looking may be rewritten and so
hence the question for advice well what
we would prefer in the perfect world be
one you I technology that we could solve
mostly form-based these mostly
form-based screens as well as didn't get
on to mobile devices and the thick based
application also has a problem and that
has to communicate with a lot of
peripherals it's a cash register
software so it's got scanners and
barcode readers and and line pole
displays and credit card swipers so i
don't relish the opportunity to have to
write all that integration in javascript
you know writing HTML 5 screens and
integrating with all those devices and
JavaScript so I'd really like to do it
in javafx but if i pick job FX i'm
really limited and what a mobile devices
i can put on and management's all hot
and heavy on iOS so any suggestions from
the panel and what we should do or what
I should tell them to do well I can say
that if if you're talking to native
devices like the Dakar readers there's
no other way to go that used jbm because
you use JavaScript for the other use
html5 eventually you have to jump into
an applet assign applet so that you can
have access to the native resources so
if you're already doing that just go
full Java now
if JFX will be able to run in more
mobile devices not just raspberry pi or
some other enemy devices that will be
great now it's possible to do it is not
Oracle sponsor is called Rob OBM you can
run javafx on and on iOS there is some
other open source tools to do it on
Android not as as fully compatible if if
I'm not mistaking you record me if I'm
wrong but it's getting there now I would
suggest if possible again just go with
java you can start today by migrating
legacy swing applications and later add
a little bit of gfx spice do it with the
EC migration path of course my other
option for you will be give Griffin a
try that's precisely one of the things
that we provide in the framework and
easy migration path from swing to javafx
all right
further questions comments wishes wishes
okay oh yeah do you remember the Kino
from last year the 3d container terminal
when we announced we as s canoe we
announced up and dolphin Appa dolphin is
a library that allows you to connect
clients and servers the server it has to
be Java the client can be swing can be
traffic's will be also because we're
thinking about mobile support there's
also a client version that runs in
JavaScript so if you have a mobile
application that is employable as an
html5 application then you can use the
dolphin jes client to connect to the
java-based a dolphin server and it will
just work it's open source just search
for up and dolphin org and you know what
I'm talking about yeah sorry I think
it's actually a session on dolphin right
they said today or tomorrow tomorrow
there's a session on up and dolphin so
you can get more details about that too
I would say the offline web stuff is
really really hard I mean you know
there's a lot of tools out there for
making that possible but it's it's
really really challenging to do offline
stuff in the web I mean I've
successfully done some stuff but you
know doing that sync up later and
there's a lot of frameworks out there
but it's definitely like if you're
looking at the web and you want to do
offline stuff that's going to be
probably your biggest challenge yeah I
mean it's kind of a it's not simple
definitely I mean there are technologies
like index DB and sequel lights but are
you building as a
was it for mobile apps or just web apps
just regular web apps twin directives
are make it run in the browser without
any plugins desktop on
seems like going out yeah
definitely good look at the Varden stuff
as well VW atin yeah I mean essentially
there quit plus yeah GWT alright just a
final touch that your use case is
precisely one of the reasons why the up
and dolphin library was born to solve
this case further withers wishes
comments questions ok so how about the
wishes of the panel what are your wishes
for which things so what do you would
like to see happen for mobile things for
tablets for desktops java sex mobile
unleash so is John effects on iOS I
don't care who's behind it i just want
to see it happen so one of the things
which we did recently i can't officially
say anything about what we're doing
forum mobile support for java effects
but one of the things which we did
recently was we open sourced the javafx
I us and the JavaFX Android ports yeah
which we are working on internally but
yeah so we didn't make a lot of fanfare
about this but at the same time we open
sourced all of the javafx fits it
happens to be that we had these other
libraries and ports going on which also
went to the open source repository and
are out there and you can take advantage
of so when Andre was talking about robo
vm on doing javafx you is on I us that's
taking the open source javafx bits
running it on top of robo vm which
s compiles java code onto iOS devices
and it gives you a GUI solution for
running on iOS devices and the same
thing applies for Android but I would
the way I'd summarize the state of
running javafx on devices right now is
that we're continuing to evolve the
javafx platform and improve performance
on small embedded devices that's our
focus right now a side effect of doing
that is that it is quite suitable and
it's feasible to run it on consumer
tablets and phones but it's not
something we're currently supporting so
you'd have to look at somebody doing
open source or other third-party efforts
for running java effects on on tablets
and phones the other Gary now wishes
Maxwell's nothing he's happy smiling
water for the panel next time yes what
okay yeah improvement yeah well I tried
that stuff the robo p.m. stuff and to
figure out how it works and I just can't
say it works in principle but it's a
one-man show so the guys I think from
Denmark and it's he built this in within
two months by himself but it was so good
that I can compile my custom controls on
the iPad and it worked so let's hope it
get its get it's getting better because
he would like to found the company as
far as i know and searching for people
have been getting this ready so the plan
was i think to get it in the app store
by end of the year that's that's the
stuff i know so i hope this will happen
i think just to me the whole you know
javafx and mobile just feels like just
so challenging i mean you guys going
through so many difficulties and
challenges to get it on their mobile
devices just the question is why even do
that I mean there is you can do right
you can do a native iOS development
Android development you can use html5 on
gaps I mean wipe push java effects so
hard and you've got been pushing it
pushing it and there is really nothing
out there but MX I i'm going to let one
of our attendees answer that question
I mean why there's I mean there's so
much push to put javafx on mobile device
and just hasn't happened and there's so
many challenges to get it out there so
just why continue I think the flash guys
would answer really well to it i can
only answer for my team but we're
primarily java developers and and if we
can write if we can write all of our
domain logic and business logic in one
and one language and also write the GUI
logic in the same language I think
that's a big win for us if I have to
have additional guys that know different
skills to maintain the UI that's that's
a problem or just it's a management
problem and we've already got three
socialism with their iphone they
obviously in the html5 right so you know
the stuff that I did adjust me we had
three different teams and none of them
could do each other's work and then of
them could collaborate and trying to do
a small start-up with building three
products that all basically do the same
exact thing right
it's supported on Windows we have an
enterprise desktop application that's
supported on Windows and actually
solaris and on lenox and management
would like of course to be able to say
that we have an iOS client that maybe
doesn't do everything that the desktop
application does and we have one have an
android client and we'd like to do all
of this from the same code so I think
that's why in our organization the porch
really is to move to html5 because it'll
work on all these devices whether or not
the application will do all the things
that are existing application does now
so in our company there's two big
products one's using flex and the other
ones using a swing UI and the guys that
are on the Flex platform we're pretty
much all in on flex and when Adobe
dropped that now they're kind of
searching for something new and they
don't seem too keen on moving to java
effects because they want to support
other applications and FX isn't there so
that's why I think Oracle is pushing on
mobile devices because customers all are
moving towards having some kind of
version of their clients on mobile
platforms you know that makes sense but
I mean if you look at just traditionally
if you look at the web app right i mean
if you're your development team you had
java focused on the server side I mean
so that you know web developers on the
UI side so I mean he look back 15 years
that's been the case so you always had
web developers you know HTML javascript
developers and you always had Java folks
so I mean yeah I mean makes sense to
just use Java everywhere but I mean
again my question is whether it just
just make sense to just well just just
feels very difficult
Oh html5 yeah okay so we want to have
Java everywhere so program or anything
in Java on every device mobile embedded
desktop so so okay that's good so make
the future java SF one final comment
but me it's the same it's it's it's
really you know if you have an existing
Java team and you want that kind of
right once experience because you're
doing an administrative thing or you're
doing something that the UI and that
native performance is not what you have
to have it's really that decision of
running you know it's it's comparing
html5 on iOS versus javafx on iOS I
wouldn't try to compare yeah I mean
Jocelyn for the native iOS specific for
the question of an interpreted I believe
the robo vm stuff cross-compile so it's
actually running and um you know native
code when it ends up on device and even
we were looking at them ahead of time
compilation for small devices so it
would do a lot of the JIT optimizations
before I pushes the code down so there
are technical solutions to that specific
problem all right so I'll turn it back
over to ya so thanks for attending I
think was get good discussion good ideas
good questions and so maybe see you next
year enjoy HR 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
