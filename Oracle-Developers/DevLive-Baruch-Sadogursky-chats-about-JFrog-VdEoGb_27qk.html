you
so my special guest Baruch and I forgot
your last name
so the Gorske it's a I don't know how
you forget it's so simple it's like my
my last name there and and it's simpler
than mine yes
so it's you it's ye yeah right yeah yeah
well okay now we're even
no it's clear all right you did a
session today about true we have two
sessions but you didn't want about
docker images yes and you talked about
like patterns and antimatter exactly and
I'll guess which one do I want to know
about yes yes so and so what are the big
ones like the one I'll tell you what
this is this is a very weird talk
because it's like come on continuous
integration pipelines we do it for years
we did it in Java like 20 years ago
loading you the staff you know maven
emerged and and cruise control and other
antique CI servers we know the stuff
what there is to talk about just do it
in docker but there are a couple of
things that in docker that's from one
side and make it hard from you to make
it hard on you to do that I think and
from other side make it very easy for
you to do their own thing right right so
there are anti patterns like rebuilding
an image on every stage of continuous
integration pipeline it's very easy to
do there is a pattern of promoting
community binary which is very hard to
do in docker because of different you
know technicalities resolve itself so
all this talk was about trying to
convince people not to follow the easy
line to doing the real thing but instead
fighting for the hard way to do the
right thing that's mission well you know
when I think people get it because it's
very clear why's that bad practices are
bad and the good projects are good
the question is what they do with it
when they come back okay so which are
the big ones like the ones you would say
okay so here are here are the two do not
rebuild on every on every stage of your
continuous integration and delivery and
instead promote immutable binary that
was built only once okay and and as I
mentioned with docker particularly it's
easier sell said them I gave some I
explained why the easy path is dangerous
and gave some tips on how to do it right
so any big questions that people ask you
that you say yes so so there are
obviously questions on on them first of
all why I'm talking about that and I'll
have this question right because I'm not
from blocker right and and still this is
something that is very closely related
and I think that I have this right to
teach people or advice to people how to
do that just because that frog right we
we build those pipeline for a more than
a decade now and I think we learned from
our mistakes
there is nothing to be ashamed of from
our own mistakes on how to do it right
and then our experience when we come to
docker and then it's it's important
because a lot of people that do it with
docker are not necessarily have this
experience under their belt okay
and so you have a second session as yeah
yeah so the second session was a more of
a high-level overview of DevOps
processes in different organizations of
different sizes it's called DevOps and
scale a Greek tragedy in three acts and
and as in Greek strategy everybody dies
right I remember we kind of we put in
the Holyrood and a happy ending on top
of it okay you hear so that's all for
the proof oh yeah no I'm all right right
so and that's a token in which we cover
different stages in the life or for the
Feldman organization and what are the
unique challenges for applying DevOps
and how those organizations need to
behave in certain stages of their of
their life right so it's kind of this
scale concept is scale by itself and
different people find themselves
relating to different parts of this
scale and and I think it's both
entertaining and I hope useful talk
because we give some tips on what's
important in in particular periods in
this lifecycle of an organization it is
like a life cycle for example for a
developer I mean and what what what
would a developer need to know so we
kind of break it to three different
stages the one is what we call which one
is critical all of them right it depends
on your where you are at and there are
not so much of a shortcuts you really
don't have a really simple way to get
from one to another until you actually
grow into it right in most of the
organizations and they are small they
start with what we call a fire brigade
or bucket brigade or firefighters they
continuously fight those troubles that
emerge and and you know they're very
creative they're very resourceful and
this time they have all of them know
exactly what's going on they're
intimately familiar with the code and
with the process so it's very easy but
it's it's very unproductive a process of
firefighting all the time right and then
we grow into something that we call a
reactive ops or smoke alarm installers
in which once the the reserve fire and
we put it down we install smoke alarm
there and then when we guarantee that
this particular problem won't happen
again
right and eventually when you go through
this process you grew up to em to a
stage in which you can proactively
proactively fight those problems and
that the smoke in the bar which prevents
fires right in which you can actually
prevent fires by doing the right thing
and actually be able to
foresee those problems and fight them
before before they happen so it's kind
of a maturity journey it is it is it is
a balanced maturity model and it is
based on on a paper on an academic paper
that see a technology I did and it is
called DevOps maturity model okay it is
it is and so you're also working for
Jeff oh of course it's my t-shirt sure
so and so how so I know that j-rock has
bunch of tools that allowed to manage
them of that but it so explains a little
bit like what what can you do with so we
we are we are the binary pivot is how we
call ourselves and we we deal with
binaries we have a bunch of tools for a
accelerating your continuous deliver and
deployment process and by implementing a
universal and rapid DevOps approach to
manage your binary funds right and and
now we have artifactory which is a
universal a artifact repository and it
supports almost all the a technologies
out there for both development and
operations so this is like - which is
designed with DevOps in mind we know how
to manage those files and make them
integrate with each other by providing a
traceable metadata and then means to
utilize this metadata with queries with
small slings etc etc so you will be able
to say something give me the right Java
artifact that feeds into this operations
container being a Debian image or Debian
package or maybe document image that are
all intended to work together by knowing
the metadata that you put there when you
build up right so this those kind of
tools helping to bridge those silos of
Devon ops it's not a silver bullet you
cannot do devil's just by bringing the
right tools because the problem is in
completely different area it's it's
behavior
and and people and processes but tools
definitely help right tools are not all
that you need they are necessary and and
and our tools are promoting that another
tool that we have is a j4 bin tray which
is a universal distribution platform
think about a download center of company
like Oracle when you come and download
the tools and and the product and this
is what powers those donald centers
right so instead of trying to develop
your own and usually end up with not
very good solution just because that's
not the core business of the company so
usually you know it's it's kind of
lagging behind it's kind of on on a
shoulder of the main you know production
of the company but this is the face of
the company
right when you when you go and make
download the product this is what you
encounter right so this is another tool
that that that helps those companies
that have those artifacts that need to
be distributed and the latest addition
to our product suit is a Jeff rogue XY
which we are and the market as well and
our customers and users are extremely
excited about because that the first and
currently the only solution in the
market that provides you a universal
recursive binary impact on Alex's that's
kind of a lot of buzzwords but what it
means is that now a software is a kind
of Russian dolls you have a docker image
inside you have a Debian package inside
you have some tar.gz
inside you have a war file inside we
have a jar file now let's say these jar
file have a problem our license may be
not compliant a security vulnerability
discovered or maybe just have some
performance issues x-ray allows you to
know about those relationship about all
this component graph and then you can
ask questions like give me all the
components that are affected by this jar
file and you will know about all of them
all across your binary
which means on every stage in the
development in staging and production by
just looking at x-ray it's also
Universal so it supports all the older
formats and knows the relationship
between them so getting back to Java for
example we know that a war file it's not
just bunch of ones and zeros but instead
it's an archive in which there is a Lib
directory in which there are a bunch of
jars so we can discover them as well
because we know how war works right and
it also so it's Universal in that mal
and it's also very open so if you have a
database of the issues that you care
about maybe better a security
vulnerabilities database or maybe
another base of your performance issues
but we have no idea about this database
you can still connect it using a very
open REST API and then run this in
impact analysis that I mentioned on your
artifact with the questions that
actually matter to you okay okay yes
this is a lot of software PCs to manage
everything and finally all right yeah so
so I'm how are you connected them to the
cloud like if for example I'm a Java
developer and I want to use your
solution or part of your solution and I
want to use this cloud solution as well
that's that that's a great question and
and it's actually the question is not is
it better like if it so is it cloud
exclusive or not that's a great one yeah
no and and okay so so I would tell you
this also whatever works for you we do
and you have a continuous integration
pipeline continuous delivery pipeline it
might be implemented on Prem yeah right
you might have your a CI server Jenkins
installed on Prem you might have your a
binary faucet or ERT factory installed
on Prem x-rays is analyzing security and
licenses on Prem and then share for
puppet or whatever other promotion tool
that deploys everything on servers in
your data center and then of course your
binary post
should be on-prem and we give you that
option but also you might be on the edge
of today's IT and do everything on the
cloud right you might have a github as
your source repository you might have
some kind of a cloud CI server privacy I
draw my circle CI whatever you name it
you might have your deployment going to
the cloud you might have the artifacts
that you take out of your artifact
repository and then deploy them to a
cloud runtime platform if that's your
stack having on-prem artifact repository
doesn't make any sense it will make you
suddenly managing servers this is
something that you just right to avoid
and the locality is critical for your
continuous delivery pipeline both
because you need if you're advanced
repository is installing from that means
and your CI server is in the cloud it
will go back and forth downloading and
uploading artifacts all the time and
then again once you have them in your
artifact repository to promotion
you should get again to the cloud
doesn't make any sense so what we do is
not only we give you the ability to get
an artifact repository in the cloud we
also say choose the cloud that you need
and it's not just because you know we
have this ability so you can sort all a
different flavors of pink and just you
know whatever you feel right no this is
because having all the stack of the
continuing all the pipeline in one cloud
is critical locality matters a lot both
because Tron's Transcorp transfers are
slow but also because they are expensive
when you all your continuous integration
is in the same cloud you don't pay for
transfer or pay very little for transfer
but when you need to go out for example
because your artifact repository forced
you to be on Amazon
when the rest of your stack is on Oracle
cloud you know you pay a lot everything
is slow it always breaks bad idea so we
have to provide this piece of continuous
integration and delivery in the same
cloud when the rest of the Platt line is
and that means every cloud so now when
you I asked for this account for this
repository manager to be on the cloud
you can actually choose you can say my
stack is on Amazon I want any doors
factory table on Amazon my stake is on
Google cloud platform
I need my factory to be on cloud
platform it's on Asia I needed to be a
measure it's an Oracle and we're working
on getting the Oracle there as well so
you can say okay if every all the stack
is an Oracle you can get from the
factory on Oracle cloud platform as well
okay that's great that's great
yep yeah well we don't have a choice
right right yeah yeah yeah thank you bye
thank you for explaining everything um
thank you so much sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
