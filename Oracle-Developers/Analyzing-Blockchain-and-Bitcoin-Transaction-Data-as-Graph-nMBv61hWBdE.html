filing in so we'll just use this time
for introductions
welcome my name is Javier Lopez I work
for Oracle I'm a senior product manager
senior director of product management
for Oracle
joining me is Z woo who is architect and
what we're gonna cover today is
analyzing blockchain and Bitcoin
transaction data as a graph so before I
begin is show of hands anybody has
worked with graph databases graph
analytics interested in that okay that's
a few a few there so usually in the in
the area of analytics particularly with
machine learning graph graph graph
technology graph analytics is a
important technology playing a role
there so what we wanted to do here is
really look at how graphs graph
analytics can be applied to blockchain
data and the use case is primarily
Bitcoin transactions
so first Z and I are going to be
tag-teaming this going back and forth so
I'll just start out with the
introduction of the graph analytics
portion what we find in in our product
we'll be talking about the Oracle graph
database products is that graph
analytics is useful for a number of
particular business applications to
identify influencers to discover
patterns and big data to generate
recommendations and the way you drive
this is to take their big data or
relational data and represent it as a
graph because there's a graph but it has
these relationships and the connections
and allows you to analyze those
relationships so it's designed for
certain types of analysis that lend
themselves to things like identity
identity in fluency errors and graph
pattern detection as an example one of
our customers Santander Rio uses it for
improving their customer service so you
represent all of their customer
relationships or products or services or
people in places as a graph so this is
data that is in
in relational environments they bring it
into a graph in order to perform this
kind of analysis you wonder well why
can't it be done in a relational
environment well you see the kinds of
relationship types of analysis that are
done would involve many joints that
would bring the relational database to
its knees so another way to apply these
kinds of trend transactions is to
basically bring it into a graph model in
this case a very large graph database to
be able to perform these analytics graph
analytics efficiently so the the graph
databases that are used by our
particular financial customers can vary
either a Oracle database so the product
there is Oracle spatial and graph on the
Oracle database it could be on no sequel
environments or HBase environments so
the product use there is Oracle Big Data
spatial and graph and of course these
products are also available on the cloud
and that's really what we'll be using
here as you will be demonstrating is the
application of property graph analytics
on the Oracle cloud so graph databases
again just setting the scenes have a
number of features that are very
applicable to the problem that we've set
now here is there's they're scalable and
they're high-performance so there's a
number of tools out there machine
learning tools statistical tools that
can do graph analytics but the
fundamental issue that they have is they
can't scale so being able to have a
highly scalable graph database that can
then apply the graph analytics is very
very essential for some of these
applications being able to support
transactions a query language in this
case Oracle's introduced a property
graph query language which is a very
similar to sequel and has actually been
submitted to the ANSI standards group
for Standardization as an extension to
sequel of course graph analytics and
we'll show you some of those graph
analytics in a bit standard interfaces
and graph visualization because a lot of
those relationships are very visual in
nature or very intuitive in nature it's
very powerful to be able to represent
them in an
and a graph graph format and of course
integration with machine learning tools
because graph analytics provides some
types of analytics but there are others
that are that it can be better applied
in a machine learning tool environment
so being able to interact between graph
and machine learning tools using
technologies like spark so with regards
to blockchain blockchains a technology
that's been applied to Bitcoin but
essentially it's a it's a ledger
it's a permissioned collaborative
transparent replicated ledger shared
ledger and a lot easy my colleges are
now used in in finance in real estate
for managing transactions where there's
multiple parties to the transactions
they each have to see each other's a
ledger essentially so they need to be
open to those parties for visualization
and they need to be able to to follow a
particular sequence of activity hence
the the chain the concept of a chain
there so I'm going to switch it over to
Z who will illustrate how Bitcoin builds
on this blockchain technology and the
graphs for further analytics Thank You
Xavier can you hear me okay in the back
I'm eatin this away then okay let's
start with some of the basic terminology
before we do this raise your hand if you
own any bitcoins your cerium Knight
coins okay don't be shy so there's a few
important terms I'd like to describe
first you know blockchain the chain of
blocks I'm going to show you an example
of a chain of blocks Bitcoin as Xavier
said is an application of blocks again
it's cryptocurrency ico initial coin
offering is similar to IPO for stocks
okay so this is that you can find
thousands if not more different i ciose
BTC a bitcoin is a shorthand for Bitcoin
a Syrian ETH mud coin as you all know
with US dollars where the smallest unit
is a cent right one dollar equals a
hundred cents with Bitcoin the smallest
unit is not a single Bitcoin but rather
this Satoshi as you can see here there's
many many zeros this is not working well
many many zeros way before this in a one
BTC so this means that the chance to run
out of ptcs is pretty slim nons
number used once this is a very
important concept I'm going to do quite
a bit into you today sha-256 it's a hash
algorithm basically it's a secure hash
take an input say you know from Jeong to
marry ray Jones and two bitcoins to Mary
okay this is an input we can run this
sha-256 generate a signature signature
it has 256 bits so this kind of hash is
considered one way
meaning that you know if I give you a
hash right and ask you to figure out
what's the input that can generate the
hash is extremely difficult a few
important names the first name is Wade I
is believed to be one of the researchers
who came up with the theory behind the
cryptocurrency the second name is more
interesting Satoshi Nakamoto who who is
one of the guys who implement the POC of
bitcoins but we don't know we don't
truly know who that person is if you
happen to know let me know okay that
would be pretty interesting you know
there's a lot of theories that are there
one series the way I could be this
Nakamoto could be some other folks but
we don't really know for sure okay
mining traditionally one when we talk
about mining as you can see is that
there's a picture on the top right right
so people are digging right in yeah yeah
potential area you use shovels but not
but once you find some precious metal
you will feel really really happy with
to mine a Bitcoin is quite different
okay first of all let me define what the
Bitcoin mining is essentially is trying
to find a nonce number used once okay
such that if we take your input rate the
say input is a transaction from A to B
by s and some bitcoins to B we take that
as input we run hash sha-256 and we get
an output is trivial everybody can do
that
but then to make this hard right the
requirement is you need to find this
nonce number use the ones
okay so you take your input data you
append these novels okay you run this
hash algorithm twice such that the
output satisfies certain pattern and
what is this pattern the patterns really
simple is just the output number has to
be less than a certain value and what's
the purpose of this the purpose there
are two purposes
the primary purpose is to maintain the
integrity of the chain of blocks to find
the next block that can be appended to
the chain so you maintain the chamber of
blocks a side-effect is you know as you
can say if you are happen to be one of
the lucky guys if you can find this
lungs right you will be rewarded you
know right I think these days the reward
is 12.5 bitcoins if you can find another
way and generate the next block in
addition you get rewarded with the
transaction fees Bitcoin mining is
really really expensive okay so if you
happen to have a few CPU cores or a few
GPUs don't even bother with you know
mining bitcoins I have a picture here
on the bottom right so those are sort of
customized Hardware a they do nothing
but just hash okay hashing trillion
operations per second so if you really
want to be serious about Bitcoin mining
you know go to mountain there's a lot of
free you know winged array electricity
is a cost is low then you set up a farm
like that okay then you can make some
money
well mining itself is computationally
expensive right to find an ounce that is
satisfied this constrained in blue color
however once you find an ounce it's
trivial to validate so this is the
important part
it's very trivial
and there's this notion called proof of
walk POWs it's not a prison of war but
it was a proof of walk so together the
the block and the numbs you know is a
proof of walk everybody can take that
and run the hash to say hey okay the
output satisfies it in requirement boom
okay you find the next block
congratulations
so here is a pretty naive implementation
using piace qual okay you can use any
language you like and Nemea walks
through the steps the important part are
highlighted using blue color so we have
transaction on the top so you put your
transactions a a sends to bitcoins to be
and may be seized and some bitcoins to
2d so it's a piece of transaction data
and the goal is to find the nouns such
that outputs satisfy certain conditions
there's no really good way other than
brutal force you have to iterate through
all those possible mountains values so
as you can see there's a for loop here
in blue color font a is probably a bit
small but it is the the second blue line
essentially we are looking to 0-2 in
this just a random very a random integer
array and then we take this input we
invoke the hash algorithm the secure
hash twice now let me move this cursor a
little bit here right so we get this
output this is easy and the condition is
that the output has to start with three
zeros okay as you can imagine the more
zeros I demand at the beginning of the
output the harder the problem becomes in
this case if I take this transaction
data and then you know iterates through
all possible integer values way I found
an ounce of 451 in about two 20-minute
second of course this is extremely easy
a problem I gave to myself because I
only demand
the output which starts with three zeros
if I ask this output to be starting from
fifty zeros it will take me years years
and years so don't bother with you know
this kind of implementation but this
gives you an idea what this lining
really is so let me show a quick demo to
run this mining on Oracle public cloud
first of all you know I have a graph DB
instance running on OC I Oracle cloud
infrastructure there's a 12-2 database
running on the bell metal this is the IP
address okay so our logging already
sorry about it
what's going s
yeah this is our OCI I have an oracle
database database cloud service running
on OCA
and as you can see this is the IP
address and what I so the network just
crashed okay so anyway let me show you
how it works right so this is the piece
of code the PR sequel code I just showed
on the screen right and we have an input
here in the transaction data part we run
this okay
move to the right portion of the code
and we find an ounce okay I want to
highlight this portion right this is
generated sha-256 output so there are
three leading zeros okay
but this days in order to to find in the
next block in the chain the number of
needing zero is much much higher okay it
requires much much more computation
power switch back quickly
good
give me one sec
okay so blockchain is a channel of
blocks this is a really easy concept by
but Ness be a bit more specific so here
on the screen you see two blocks so on
the left is one block right you see the
block ID nuns and the data in this text
field it can putting all kinds of
transaction data and there's a hash of
this block the reason we put a hash in
years if you if you're going to touch
the data if you're going to mutate the
data the hash will change right as we
all know and so on the right hand side
you see another block it has the same
structure but there's a chain here it
has a pointer rate to the previous
blocks errors so this means if we even
touch one bit here on the left this hash
for this left block will change
obviously and then this guy will also
change so the hash for the second block
will also change so even if we only
touch one bit somewhere okay all the
following blocks we have different hash
and people we are know immediately so
this is why people are saying this this
is really immutable database if you
touch anything people can easily
identify right away okay so some people
saying that you know we can trust
watching right the immutability
contributes a lot to a logic scan to
that you know or trust
so to ask me why do we study blockchain
and bitcoins right this is really fun
technology there's a lot of uses of
bitcoins and of course the underlying
blockchain technologies and the most
importantly all Bitcoin transactions are
in public domain okay
actually if you ever start a Bitcoin
daemon on your laptop right so after a
few hours depending on your network
bandwidth you can pouring all those
transactions starting from 2009 every
single Bitcoin transaction will be on
your laptop and this really valuable
data set if you want to go deep into
analyzing real world transactions so
there's some happy stories about
bitcoins this young guy very bought $27
worth of bitcoins and then for his
master's thesis or paper and then he
forgot about it and later he bought a
very nice apartment in Oslo with the
Bitcoin monies so the key is that you
behold you forget entry but don't forget
the key and then then you want to be
able to use the Bitcoin there's a little
bit of sad story this is considered the
first that Bitcoin transactions right
people bought right to pieces using
10,000 bitcoins and I just checked the
bitcoins was about 8,000 US dollars so
if you think about it 10,000 bitcoins
for pieces and super super expensive
okay but there's a happy ending you know
later on people call this day may 22nd
Bitcoin pizza day okay so we have one
more holiday
so there are a lot of real uses of
bitcoins as an investment right if you
purchase Bitcoin a few years ago I guess
you must be really happy but recently
there's the quite a bit of Prior the
price fluctuations it's going up all the
way to near twenty thousand US dollars
and then came down to six thousand these
days is about in eight thousand so it's
highly volatile it's not really for
faint-hearted people and some people are
saying that this you know once quantum
computing becomes a real ray than this
thing made for a part well there's not
of financial purposes you can buy stuff
on Expedia you can use Bitcoin to buy a
chip you can also use bit going to pay
ransom well everybody got infected by
wanna cry okay well those guys demand
you pay in bitcoins you can also move
assets across borders I was in one of
the International Airport in Taiwan and
see a sign if you carry more than ten
thousand US dollars or equivalent of
that in new Taiwan dollars you have the
claim which is nuisance may we speak
going you don't need to claim anything
it's good at storing values why assuming
it doesn't go down you know to $1.00 per
Bitcoin okay and you know you can use it
to protect whales of course the
underlying blockchain technologies right
they have much wider applications smart
contract right IP protection but not the
dark side of bitcoins you know people
use it to buy drugs on the dark net and
if you're smart hacker you can build a
exploit and then demand whoever you know
gets infected by your virus demand those
people to pay using bitcoins okay
I talk about I want to cry they actually
sort of those hackers purchased the hack
from some Russian guys and then they
build a wrapper which is a wanna cry
okay and they demand you you know to pay
using bitcoins but they made a mistake
so Bitcoin address rate is sort of the
equivalent of account number so in wanna
cry they the virus only used a handful
of different Bitcoin addresses okay
so they really should have you know
created thousands if not tens of
thousands of different Bitcoin addresses
so now if you look at the slide here the
the the Bitcoin address in red way is
one of the payment address because the
the total number of payment addresses is
small so people can easily track you
know
well those bitcoins go in the future you
can also use Bitcoin to bribe very
important people okay so these tend to
get dark here now let's look at the
technical side what does a Bitcoin
transaction look like you navigate
day-to-day life right say I pay Javier
50 bucks right so this is a simple
transaction so money goes from my pocket
way and in to Javier's pocket so that to
people and a money flow Bitcoin
transaction can be a bit more
complicated right here we have a
transaction in tabular form you see a
hash you will see a lot of hash numbers
you won't see via people's names okay
from this lie down so everything is
pretty much higher so transaction has in
this case two inputs and the total
output value is this number right is
Satoshi
okay and the output to go to a Bitcoin
address so this particular transaction
has two input and one output so if we
represent this you know in a visual way
okay look at the transaction nine which
is the gray circle on the right hand
side it is taking two input the first
input is from transaction one and to be
exact the second output of transaction 1
becomes input to transaction I and the
transaction nine takes the second input
from transaction eight and specifically
is the first output of transaction eight
that goes into transaction nine and
transaction nine
we are spread the Tran the bitcoins into
three different addresses okay so in
general a Bitcoin transaction has a
multiple-input and multiple-output every
single Satoshi is accounted for so what
is the graph because this session is
about using graph graph database to
analyze Bitcoin and blockchain data so
the the thing we are looking at is a
graph right a graph is suggesting you
know vertices and edges
whatever this is right now but it says
are usually entities like people
individuals bank accounts right events
like Oracle code in Boston those are
usually modeled as vertices so the
interesting part is really the edges are
the relationships in Bitcoin transaction
the flow of Bitcoin are usually modeled
as an edge I think about him so that
transactions and Bitcoin addresses way
the Bitcoin flow from address to address
from transaction to child actions
so how do we model the Bitcoin
transaction as a graph very intuitively
we can just you know use this one as a
graph data model okay so this is one of
the graph data model a transaction
becomes a vertex and the money movement
right the Bitcoin movement becomes an
edge okay so here we have two types of
edges from transaction to transaction
and also from transaction to Bitcoin
address Bitcoin address again this
equivalent of the account number in our
day-to-day life however intuitive
intuitively I want to have a graph way
which model of a day-to-day life I say
we have you know different bank accounts
right we transfer money between bank
accounts what I really want is a dress
as a vertices and money flow between
those Bitcoin address so how do I
achieve that so if I look at this this
graph right so this transaction output
the Bitcoin from transaction 1 to
transaction 9 but transaction 1 also
goes to address X so I can look at this
relationship and then just to create
edges from address X to this transaction
okay now I'm getting a bit closer
however I still have transactions in my
graph now see how we get rid of that now
I can do a simple aggregation take one
transaction for example if there's three
input hey I can aggregate all those
bitcoins from all those input and then
spread out across the output essentially
is a Cartesian join okay so if I do this
I end up with a graph with just
addresses and the Bitcoin movement among
those edges so this is similar to our
day-to-day
bank account
and banking activities now how do we
contribute ray how do we compute the
contribution from address address x-ray
to any of the output addresses right so
here I'm using the formula essentially
you'd aggregate all this input and
spread out okay depending on the weight
so finally I I have this graph I need in
well the green rectangular representing
the vertices those Bitcoin addresses and
the edges as representing the Bitcoin
flow so now let's talk about end-to-end
flow okay how we wrangle the tank at the
data rate how we model this and then
load this as a graph into the graph
database visualize and run graph queries
so this is the pipeline we follow we
pass the data from Bitcoin transactions
as I mentioned when you start a Bitcoin
daemon and then in a few hours you get
about a hundred 50 gigabytes worth of
data containing every single transaction
and there's a bit of a data preparation
so this is a graph modeling part we
generate the graph out of that node not
the graph into our cost property graph
database and then this is a fun part of
akin to visualization to query and run
analytics so this is a pipeline let me
ask you a question which step consumes
the most amount of time yes please
absolutely thank you yeah this is
actually the ETL process usually is the
most time-consuming part so once you
have a graph on the rest just a mini
simple and in this pipeline this graph
generation graph data loading and
visualization and analytics this are
considered the functions of graph
database and we for this purpose write
for this application we use Oracle OC I
running on database cloud service
running on bare metal so you have a
choice of twelve two database or
eighteen one database at this moment I'm
going to switch back to Xavier okay I
just want to take a few minutes to
highlight some of the features of the
Oracle graph database that were used in
now in the workflow that see highlighted
there on that and so first a little bit
of the architecture of the the product
so basically the spatial graph database
can be can use either the Oracle
database or a big data source like a
patchy HBase or no sequel database the
next layer above it is a set of api's
blueprint api's to allow you to do graph
queries to the database the third layer
is the N is the in-memory analytics
layer also known as PGX
so we execute the the we execute graph
analytics in memory at that layer on
that so one way or we suck up the the
Bitcoin from the database with it's a
relational database in the cloud or a
patch eh base in the cloud into the
in-memory database and then run the
analytics or we'll run PG QL the queries
on that declarative query language and
on the right side are basically sources
the data can come from from various
various types of format we can use the
cytoscape visualization tool it's an
open source visualization tool that's
we'll be using here in this example to
visualize the graph
but also you can use apache spark to do
further analysis so you might get
results of say of centrality finding
centrality and the transactions pushing
those centrality results into a machine
learning because they generate more
signal for additional analytics and then
let's see so yeah this was done in the
Oracle database cloud service there's
also the Oracle Big Data cloud service
so if you're running it on on that
environment you can do that in a Big
Data environment in terms of the
analytics these are the Analects at the
these are built in analytics so we have
to roll your own that's one of the
advantages of having this product is you
have a suite of 40-plus analytics
engines that are built-in for detecting
communities centrality clustering all
the classic social network analysis
types of algorithms are embedded into
the product so you don't have to you
don't have to write them test them
support them they're already supported
in the product you just call them
through through one line of one line of
code and then we can also mutate the
graph to create a directed graph
simplify the graph of filtered great
filtered sub graphs as well we also
support for the scene patchy solar
because a lot of times when you're doing
particular a fan oolitic you have a
particular entity in mind so it might be
a particular identifier so you you want
to know where that is in your graph and
start your query from there in order to
do perhaps Dijkstra of path calculations
from there so you can use Apache with
scene or solar cloud to identify that
location in the larger graph and of
course visualization so in this case
we'll be showing cytoscape visualization
to the database and that can through the
SATA scape visualization you can run
your property graph analytics but you
can also your call your query call your
analytics or do your property graphic
queries we also support third-party
visualization tools tom sawyer cambridge
intelligence virtuoso and curious as
well
the pattern-matching PG QL query
language is sequel like again and myths
have been submitted to standardization
it's basically very effective for fraud
detection anomaly detection and sub
graph extraction so executing query
returned the results and then perhaps
doing an analytical routines on that and
for those of you that are data
scientists that work with notebooks we
provide a example in front-end but also
supports a different a notebook style
Fernandez as well they can visualize not
only in a graph format but also in pie
charts as well for graphics a variety of
api's apache tinker pop blueprints api
these are standard graph api s but also
some of the PL sequel java rest api is
we also have scripting environments for
groovy python and plug-ins for the the
tinker pop as well so as a just a brief
overview some of the features that we
leveraged I'll turn it back over to Z
who will conclude with how we undertook
the analysis of the big coin data Thank
You Xavier
so let me know share some of the details
in this pipeline right again there's a
ETL process by data preparation and then
we generate graph load the graph into
the proper graph database and finally
perform some graffiti relation query and
analytics ok
so there are all kinds of tools you can
use to do ETL to do data preparation you
can pick your favorite tool in this
particular case we used Oracle database
we pour the data from Bitcoin
transactions way the origin form we
stick them into Oracle database and then
we perform some joins right to calculate
the contribution from various Bitcoin
address to some other Bitcoin addresses
so this shows a table right that we used
behind the things the table is a bit
wrong address to to address table so you
will see that Bitcoin transaction ID
from a Bitcoin address to Bitcoin
address etc and now we have the Bitcoin
transaction data in a relational form we
computed ray the contribution ok the
Bitcoin flow from various Bitcoin
address to other Bitcoin addresses we
use a utility that we have in tropical
databases called convert our DBMS table
to a graph civilization format we called
opv and ope Oracle proper graph vertices
and edges so with a single line of call
you get a graph serialization format so
this just to give you an idea in this
small text box it shows a snippet of the
vertices in this particular format
similarly for edges ray edges a bit more
has a few more fields because edges will
have the aji ID from vertex a to vertex
ID in addition to properties we are
talking about property graph data model
where we can associate attributes or
properties properties just you know key
value pairs in this case a key value
pair can be the amount amount is the
name of the key that the numeric value
is the amount of bitcoins okay that is a
property you can associate with an edge
loaded up load up the graph the data
into Oracle database so this is running
on OC I Oracle cloud the API we use this
load data with psycho loader again is a
single API call data is in Oracle
database so here comes the fun part
why do we do graph because you can
visualize it you can see you can see the
data
okay so there's a you know on the
left-hand side you see the the dots the
green dots representing Bitcoin address
the edges representing the Bitcoin flow
here we are running one of the buting
algorithm called page rank every day we
use Google or Bing right how the results
are sorted way they are using variations
of PageRank so as you can see on the
Left right the thoughts the Quinta's
have different sizes basically if
PageRank value is high we used a bigger
bubble okay this gives you an idea what
bitcoin address are more important than
other bitcoin addresses on the right
hand side you see the money flow away
from right hand side to to the left okay
so there's the chain of Bitcoin movement
but somehow they all end up at this sink
okay so there's a lot of Bitcoin we move
you know over many steps okay
they all end up at a particular Bitcoin
address so with you know analytics with
the visualization you can easily
identify patterns like this
as I mentioned right the first step when
we do the ETL data cleansing right we
stick the data into Oracle relational
database so the source data is in
relation to form this means that we can
easily write a sequel query this is a
very simple one to find the top
transactions okay in the among orders
Bitcoin Bitcoin transactions I'm not
going into the details but we are
running this in parallel that's order by
there's a real number this is all easy
stuff but the output it you know gives
you a very good idea okay there's a
there's a five Bitcoin transactions
right identified using hash and their
total amount involved in those
transactions so this is a you know the
data contains one of the early blocks
back then the amount of transactions ray
is huge so look at this is 400,000 PTC's
okay in the in the top transactions we
can also run the analytical functions
like you know PageRank so here I'm using
the groovy running Java code snippets in
groovy how many people have used the
group here it's a very nice environment
I use it you know to to test the new API
is to try new things right the beauty
the beautiful part of the groovy is you
can just type in Java commands if you
make a typo which is just a fix it right
and then find again so it's very simple
here I'm showing you an example to run
PageRank and then pull out the top three
okay vertices with the highest pretty
rank values so this gives you a the most
influential Bitcoin addresses in this
graph and then we can used our API to
say hey this is a Bitcoin address the
tax ID we can pull out all the exact
Bitcoin address you can take this
Bitcoin address and do a Google and you
will find a lot of very interesting
information
Xavier mentioned the graph patent query
language so here we are using P gql to
find Bitcoin addresses with many cents
so Bitcoin address sometimes has receive
a lot of bitcoins sometimes they send a
lot of bitcoins to other addresses
sometimes they do both so this very
intuitive query language can easily and
efficiently identify the Bitcoin
addresses with many many cents and so
far right in all the slides you see a
lot of Bitcoin addresses you see a lot
of hashes do you see a readable human
name do you see John do you see Mary no
you don't see any of that right so in a
way is this is really anonymous however
you have to be careful because sometimes
by people we are post a messaging like
this right help me there's something
wrong with my transaction by a Bitcoin
transaction and they put a username here
so this sort of gives away some
information this particular username is
associated with certain Bitcoin
addresses and with visualization you can
identify really active addresses right
you can identify clusters in this case
there's so many a bitcoin moved into
this center right and you will identify
this interesting pattern right the money
flows in and goes to a one address right
the rest continues this patterns way
this is like a binary tree keeps going
for many steps ok ok to sum it up in
this talk we covered blockchain concepts
bitcoins may how we model that as graph
right although this is a specific for
bitcoins however the notion right the
concept how you model data as a graph
are you loaded into Oracle property
graph database how you can run analytics
run graph query visualization where this
this whole pipeline works for
for logistics for social network of
course right it applies to so many
different other areas okay now let's
open the floor for questions any
questions don't be shy yes please
yeah
right so the question was do people or
enterprises my are they going to use
blockchain in a private setup right do
they have to be public the answer is no
they don't have to be public and most
likely they're going to set up their own
blockchain services like an interest
keno Dre
there was a blockchain cloud service
from Oracle so that's really in a
controlled environment yes
so the question was how bitcoins stolen
right well with certain vendors like
coinbase right so those are clean
exchanges you can log in you pay money
you can buy bitcoins they manage your
cryptocurrency there okay and if a
hacker hacks in this system and if they
get hold of your private key okay
then they can consume the Bitcoin they
can transfer that can move the Bitcoin
to another address and yet another just
they can do this many many steps then it
becomes very hard to trace and the one
thing about Bitcoin address is you can
create as many Bitcoin addresses as you
wish
normally in our day to day life I have
maybe three bank accounts sweep and
account numbers but with bit wrong
address I can create a sweet sound so so
if you have that many it's really hard
to trace you can't you have to protect
your private key so some services they
have what right they physically move
ready the private key into a what that
is awful ah yes maybe one last question
for - so the question was about proof
walk yeah for my name purpose you need
to compute the NOx we need to solve the
cryptographic puzzle right come up with
the novels then your transactions the
set of transactions you who work
together with the time stand together
with announcer you used form a proof
walk so everybody can easily say hey you
know that's right again oh well the hash
matches and hash starts with certain
number of intervals congratulations you
did you did the you generated next block
from the chain yes then you broadcast
absolutely the the POWs proof work is
just a robust way to make sure the
integrity of the chain but if you have a
more controlled environment you don't
have to do that or there are many
different ways to to prove that you you
are maintaining the integrity of all
those transactions in your block chain
with that we have to sorry we can take a
question offline is we are standing
between you and nice and nice meal so
thank you thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
