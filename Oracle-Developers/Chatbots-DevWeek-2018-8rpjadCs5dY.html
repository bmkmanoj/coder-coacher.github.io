I'm your host Javed Mohammed here at
developer week in Auckland and I'm very
excited to have with us
Tessa Mero who is a developer evangelist
you know everyone that followed along
was able to successfully have a working
chat bot by the end of the workshop and
it was very wonderful and I used Cisco
spark API as a an example of how it
works and I kept it open to it's kind of
a similar process with other
collaboration api's as well okay
so what's kind of the if there's a in
terms of chat bots what an automation
like what where do you see things going
with chat BOTS a lot of people are
turning to once they realize oh this is
something that I can use and it's really
easy to implement
that's when more developer teams are and
is there kind of more of a sweet spot
for chat BOTS where so I guess the idea
behind any automation is to kind of take
out the boring and mundane things that
people have to do and and so so so where
does it work well and where and where
where does it you still need kind of a
high touch you know an environment
how you can have integrations if another
software that you are using and let's
say you're using like 30 different
projects of products as a developer
you're using practically everything
right so if it has an API you can create
an integration with a box so you can
automatically create a room and send
notifications let's say you know Google
spreadsheet a new spreadsheet was
created you'll get a notification for
that okay any last final part so where
do you think we are in terms of the
adoption of chatbots
is that still kind of like in the early
stages or why do you think you may have
from a maturity has been attending
workshops it's been a very new term for
a lot of people especially the word chat
ops which is you know using chat box for
all your developer or DevOps or
developer operations and processes so
definitely it's going to be more adapted
over a period of time we're still
heading towards that direction and and
hopefully it becomes a thing that every
team uses okay well it sounds like an
exciting future tesa thank you so much
for coming by for sure thank you very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
