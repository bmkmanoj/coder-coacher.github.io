let's develop a conference about
computers in microservices Java Java EE
JavaScript in DevOps and mobile mini
cool demos with its robotic arm getting
like an IOT workshop hands-on lab good
speakers the roots Douglas Crockford
Adam BN about Chris Richards
we're going to make it really big let's
go global
all around the world North America
Brazil Europe most radius Asia we're
going to call them you can call
developer world now developers code
Oracle coach Oracle toad all forms of
hood Oracle good good morning and
welcome to Oracle code Sydney good
morning everybody here in Sydney who is
here with us today in this room and good
morning to everybody who is following us
on the live stream
my name is Gerald pencil and I will be
the MC for today Oracle code is a great
great new event that Oracle has spun up
this year it's actually a 20-city event
that we rolled out globally as you just
saw in the video and we finally made it
to down under to Australia and we have
two more events going on after that in
Bangalore and soul if you have any
colleagues friends over there make sure
that they register as well please Oracle
code is a great event for developers I
hope that everybody in the room and the
audience here is a developer if not
that's fine too you may learn one or the
other things but we talk about
everything that developers want to hear
about today whether that's containers or
micro services DevOps open source
frameworks databases AI machine running
we got it all we have fantastic speakers
today throughout the entire day that
allow you to learn from their expertise
to network socialize with them but also
amongst all of you we would like to give
a special thanks to our sponsors that
make those twenty City Roadshow happen
thank you very very much for your
support to drive this to actually get
Oracle to speak to the developer
community
now one announcement that we made lately
that got very popular is that we
launched our products on the docker
Store as is you
easier than ever to actually get a
database in Oracle database up and
running by choice typing docker run or a
tool database and it will spin you up an
Oracle database you can find more about
this on developer or to come slash
docker
the database is not the only thing that
we have launched if you go to store comm
and you just type in Oracle you feel
will find a bunch of images that we have
made available for you to download and
then start building your software on
those containers but there's more we
actually also launched all our open
source software on the docker hub so you
can go over hop comm and look for those
and we have put the docker build files
onto our github repository so not only
can you download those images you can
actually look at the build files we have
extant them and so forth really really
exciting thing that we have done in
March we got a lot of good feedback
about that if you use docker certainly
check this out
last but not least if you do have a
mobile phone or smartphone as everybody
has these days and if you would like to
download our app please go ahead and do
so or two events 17 in the App Store if
you then look for articles it need
actually allows you to track the agenda
today so you can if it don't have
downloaded the agenda ready or printed
out you can actually look at it on your
mobile phone and follow it and also rate
the events please are the sessions
please that is very important for us and
equally important is if you happen to be
on social media on Twitter please use
the hashtag Oracle code today to eat as
much as possible we always get very
excited and follow the at Oracle devs
Twitter account it's a new account for
developers from Oracle where we post
developer related content now enough of
all of those slides now actually let's
get going right so we have a full day
ahead of us and I came over two days ago
and I thought of when we actually mapped
out the the 20 cities right and we were
like a case where we going to do this
and then we had Australia on there I was
like I do Australia and you know no
questions asked this is mine I go there
regardless what because I was thinking
you know coming to Australia
it's warm it's sunny you know everything
is easygoing great and I came over two
days ago and I'll you know as we were
flying into Sydney I saw clouds clouds
everywhere I was like hanging on
I can't happen I must have boarded the
wrong plane right to got up my boarding
pass look so Sydney I don't get it right
it's like it's somewhere in the northern
hemisphere oh hang on well actually yeah
we are here in wintertime and Sydney and
there are clouds everywhere so I thought
well why clouds crap right but actually
today we have a beautiful day which then
on the conscious eyes well who will come
on a beautiful day where luckily you all
showed up thank you very much for that
but actually my thought process goes
one-third and I thought why cloud is
actually an interesting question isn't
it also for developers
why cloud what's in there right why why
do we need it as a de buzzword etcetera
and I'm honestly not smart enough to
tell you so I got our luminary speaker
in today Peter Lorre who is the CEO and
chairman of Tudor PTY and he will tell
us why cloud is actually interesting
also for developers please come welcome
onstage Peter Lorre okay so let's let's
get me logged in so hopefully before
that's wrong password cool okay so I
hope you'll tolerate me what I'm
actually going to do I'm going to draw
this thing instead of presenting it on
slide deck which sounded like a great
idea right up until about half an hour
ago because now I've got to draw
everything that I'm talking about
so first up in the theme of the Twitter
stuff my Twitter account is that Lau RA
by all means tweet at me take photos do
whatever you can
I'm definitely up for a conversation and
I love this stuff so first up when we
get started let's talk a little bit
about me so I'm a electrical engineer by
training software developer Franco how
are you
right I'm the software developer by
necessity there's two parts to my
business so I do a whole bunch of work
for enterprise stuff which is
a little bit soul-destroying and then I
do a whole bunch of stuff for startups
and new ventures no sorts of things
which is sold restoring so I take a bit
of solar and drop it in here get some
money back tip it into the startup
community get some solar backs but a
soul economy that goes that way and a
money economy that goes this way but it
actually allows us to to transfer a few
different things between it so a lot of
the stuff that we're doing around a lot
of the continuous integration stuff and
everything we've been doing for 20 years
in the startup stuff and it starts to
come true to enterprise Enterprise back
down so so as I said I'm one of the I've
been doing software developments the
last twenty two years which makes me
feel a little very old and about halfway
through that software development stuff
I went off and did an MBA to work out
what went wrong with one of the
businesses I was in because we destroyed
what the business guys said and we were
doing awesome stuff we're doing
test-driven development this is in 2001
model driven architectures and
continuous integration live so we nailed
it technically we had the whole thing
sorted but it still went to crap I'm
pretty sure my letters say crap but it
still went to crap so we didn't be able
to work out what we're doing it turned
out to be contract management which is
fine but then we then we came back and
we started a business instead of doing
all sorts of different things so over
the last 20 years of doing the software
development is it there's a couple of
dynamics that have really really
frustrated me and it's part of the
reason I went into the business stuff so
the first one is that there's this
there's this business thing that we're
working on right and then there's part
of that business which is the tech stuff
so tech and from our not with a K with a
H maybe create and part of the stuff the
other part of the business from our
perspective is not thick but that's not
the way they think about us for whatever
now a big part of what we're actually
doing is a lot of the problems that we
have come in from the business into us
and before they were technical problems
for us there are actually business
decisions whoops and then also a lot of
stuff that we you know if we're speaking
honestly we create a fair bit a problem
for the business as well but the other
thing is that a lot of the solutions
that could possibly happen for the
business can come from us inside here
and a lot of the stuff that actually
solutions for our problems can come from
outside so I think that our focus is
actually not making a better tech
project not doing better tech things
we're actually supposed to be doing a
bit
which is the whole thing not just the
tech stuff so one of the horrible
dynamics I see is our very well executed
perfectly on time perfectly on budget
project that does the wrong thing right
but the project was excellent thank you
very much right and we celebrate that as
a great success and then throw it away
and do something else so that the
dynamic that I want to make sure that we
talk to and come back to touch on so the
presentation as was pointed out before
is actually white cloud so let's talk a
little bit about cloud right and I'm not
going to harp on cloud and in fact what
we're going to talk about is how to
justify the use of cloud we'll come to
that in a sec so just for definition
since we've got the
software-as-a-service stuff out here
whoops the platform as-a-service stuff
the infrastructure-as-a-service stuff
and basically it all boils down into
star as a service right and that's what
we're talking about with this stuff but
the question comes down to why do it
right and it's very easy to justify in a
cost perspective right and a lot of the
arguments you'll see are actually a cost
perspective on doing these things and
unsurprisingly like to draw this feels
like the whiteboard this is the only way
I can do a whiteboard for what 200
people as opposed to five people but um
let's use a little bit of a diagram here
right so if we say that the value of
what we're doing is here and we'll
nominally use dollars here the value is
there and the cost is here oops we're
sort of corrupting microeconomics to be
here but if the cost is there in the
benefit of what we are doing is the
difference between the cost and the
value right really really simple concept
the more bet the more value we deliver
the bigger that benefit is and the less
cost we spend the bigger the benefit it
is as well and one way of diagramming
that is to say and this is the way the
cloud is normally justified inside a
business right we have the cost then we
have the value and what we're actually
going to do is we're going to reduce the
cost of what we're doing which makes our
benefit bigger which is awesome
unfortunately and this is a dynamic I've
seen over the last 20 years is when we
reduce the cost in the IT department in
general we also tend to reduce the value
and if we need to think of anything to
remind us of that is SOS right there's a
perfectly good as something that comes
out if they release the operating system
we lock it down because we want to
reduce the number of people who can do
stupid things right so that's what
that's it's a cost driven thing and I
don't like the cost driven argument even
though it's so-so addresses are pretty
well inside the cloud stuff so costs
driven and we're all pretty that says
cross river and I promise right now
we're also the other side of the
argument is a value driven one so if
we're after a large amount of benefit
one way to do it is to reduce this one
but the other one is to actually
increase the value of what we deliver
right and as long as from a business
perspective at an abstract level as long
as we produce more value than a cost it
doesn't really matter if it increases
our costs with because we're sorting
supporting the business we're doing
better things right so what I'd like to
see inside a lot of IT departments and
in software development general this
holds across soft this hold across
startups the whole thing is that we
concentrate on creating creating value
and that value increases faster that our
cost increases we should be able to do
whatever we can right it's a strange
argument you need to be able to run it
properly but that's what I'm here to
help with we're trying to run this
argument properly because there's so
much valuable value and what we can do
if we've got all of these resources and
we can actually run at full pace rather
than being held back like we do an SME
right so if we're going to deliver more
value like this what we actually have to
do is deliver more things and the
mechanism through which we normally
deliver more things there's actually
more projects well projects so we need
to deliver more projects but that's a
bit tricky because we're already
delivering all the projects that were
allowed to well that's not quite true
but let's have a look at what we can
actually do when we're analyzing this so
a good friend of mine and Jason and I
Jason Loeb who's actually over in San
Fran at the moment into produções we
sat down we tried to work out how we
should attack this stuff and explain
what we can do so this is a model that
we came up with it's affectionately
called tic-tac don't so what we do is we
break all the projects that we currently
do into two axes the first one is effort
so we have low medium and high effort
projects and then we look at the value
that we actually get from each of those
projects so we have low medium and high
value projects
now the projects that definitely get
done inside these organizations are
these ones because there's a directive
that comes in from the administrator
there goes the phone directive that
comes in from the administer that says
here is three hundred million dollars
please build this project and you're
doing it because we know or what we
think we know we've modeled that it's
worth five hundred million dollars to
the business so please spend this much
money to provide this much value for us
okay and those those those projects are
done there's normally not complete but
they're done they're at least attempted
to be completed properly oh yeah see
some smiles across the room you know
I've been I'm the person who said to the
back of the room complaining that we um
we haven't really delivered the value
that we've done but it is it is good to
have a break from trying to deliver that
value here right so these projects get
done and there's also another class of
projects that get done it's up here
right it's the low effort high value
projects and the reason they get done is
because they basically can't stop people
like us from doing it I have a spare
weekend I'm going to work really really
hard this day so tomorrow I can build
some stuff because those developers will
put a lot of effort into being lazy
right now the other projects that gets
done quite ironically is the low effort
median value because you can't stop us
again and we've already done all the
easy stuff so let's do something mildly
harder or mildly not as valuable right
and the other projects that get done are
the low effort low value right so what's
driving our execution of these projects
over here is the amount of effort that
we need to put in and we've all done
this right it's a bash script that does
it or it's a pl/sql procedure I suppose
I can remember it's been a long time
trying or it's something that we've
built it up in a docker container or
something like that it's actually solved
the problem now it's as ugly as sin
right it's held together with sticky
tape and pipe cleaners but that's what
we're doing so and it delivers that
value and even if we've got it running
on the machine all you have to do this
anymore we used to have to have a spare
machine running under the desk with the
power switch sticky taped on right to
make sure it didn't get turned off but
now we can do that stuff in the cloud
and that's part of the value we're
trying to get to so these projects are
done and this projects is done now let's
just for completeness finish off these
boxes nobody wants to do
a value higher for project as much as we
turn them into those projects or a high
effort medium value or a medium effort
low values so they don't want to get
better want to be done right but what we
end up with is these two bits here right
which is a medium effort medium value
and medium effort high value now those
projects aren't attempted at the moment
right and it's worth us looking at why
those projects aren't attempted right
now they're valuable their tactical
projects generally and what's generally
happening is that there's a poor person
up here who is responsible for these
projects and someone from the business
turns up and says hey a lot of these
projects please it's very important for
us right we've got fifty thousand phones
we need to dump because the next
versions coming out we need to have a
tactical promotion on our portal please
and that they look at them and say no
we're not going to do it and why aren't
you going to do it it's very very
important to the business it's nowhere
near as important as these projects and
do you know how risky these projects are
the last thing I'm going to do is give
you resource or time or money from these
projects right so the argument comes
back basically from here from the
responsible person or the responsible
unit up here he says there are costs X
let's write over here a bit there are
cost risk resources and time issues with
this we're not doing it because of these
issues there is no way I'm going to
release the people that I trust touching
our system of record to come down and do
a tactical app with you because all
you're going to do is increase the risk
of our project over here and we were
told to do this by the board or by the
business you're not having those
resources I don't care how important it
is right so what we're going to try and
do is find a way to get to those
projects because if we're looking to do
more projects this is the source of more
projects and the interesting part about
this is that we don't have to do better
than our current way of doing these
projects up here we have to do better
than no project because they're not even
attempting those projects so if we can
even deliver a little bit of value there
where up do you know an amine so now
it's about us doing it
cost-effectively and time effectively
and resource effectively ok so let's
look a little bit at what these projects
look like
so we have a timeline here and from the
idea phase I'm going to try and draw
other you guys did all right
how about that okay from the idea
through to when the feasibility study
gets kicked off so this is time along
here and then the feasibility but
feasibility study takes a little bit of
time
right and then we go into depth and the
dev takes a little bit of time probably
longer than we said but it takes a
little bit of time right and then it
goes into production and this is where
it's actually used right so everybody
sort of agree with that there's a bit of
time up front you know I mean cool so
now if we just change colors a bit
because we can change colors we have a
look a little at the cost or the value
delivered to the business during this
time okay so while the idea is being
fought for to get a feasibility up study
up we have no value deliver to the
business right and we also have some
cost associated but we wear it elsewhere
and then we go into a feasibility study
which goes down like this for that
period of time yep so we're spending
money and we hope it's going to be worth
it right and then we go into Devon I
don't know about your projects but my 10
projects look a little bit like that
especially the ones I get thrown on all
right come down like that right so we
start spending some serious money
notably no value has gone to the
business yet right and then we deliver
the production because I don't know if
everybody knows this seems to be
surprised sometimes but we don't get
value through a perfectly executed
project we just don't we get value
through the execution or the use of a
perfect the results of a perfectly
executed project or even a partially
executed project right so hopefully it
comes up something like this and over
here it pays for itself
right sometimes it comes out like this
and we hope it pays for itself and
sometimes those seen ones come out like
that right that'll never pay for it
selves and then there's something to
keep coming down right ironically
they're all celebrated as a great
success right because the ones like this
everybody's culpable right but what
we're trying to do is get back to here
and on this diagram let me get above
this line that's when we're starting to
make money back to the business that's
when it starts to make sense right now
this thing here could be 10 years
or hopefully it doesn't take longer than
10 years to pay back but this it's no
it's worth noting that the best off
software itself actually spends a lot
longer in time than it does to take to
develop it right and the majority of
projects is another pet paid the
majority of projects because they're
trying to execute perfectly here we'll
throw all these features out that
actually undermine this and if you're
looking for a reason why DevOps turned
up that's probably a good reason why
DevOps turned up because the Ops guys
were sick of getting stitched up by the
project
let's get it's involved let's get us
playing right we want to do these things
you want to have non-functional
requirements looked after cool so if we
just change color again to a nice oracle
red if we look at the other projects
that are getting done up here right on
this chart you have on this chart it
actually looks like this right so we're
starting as soon as we have the idea or
as soon as we can get enough time to be
able to have the idea so save up enough
days or save up enough or just find a
weekend that's free and we execute it
and we execute more and we execute more
and we have to keep more and they always
a little bit of value but they delivered
straightaway so already we're a little
bit better off than we were here now for
no second note first under no
circumstances saying that this is how
every project can be done but if your
eyes are open for this project and we'll
show some other stuff with it but if
your eyes are open for this you can see
that there are more and more
opportunities to be able to do things
this way and if I get through this stuff
quickly I've got an example at the end
that shows you one okay but what we're
actually trying to do is we're trying to
get to our greens in appropriate color
for other devs in the round which is
everybody we're trying to get to these
ones right now in this diagram what
we're looking for is we'll do this one
first and then if that works then we'll
do the next one on top of it we'll go
again
and if the network next one works we'll
go again and if the next one works we'll
go again right so this way of doing we
if we X can attempt to execute these
projects by taking a bunch of these ones
and lining my back to back right so it's
executed the same way or a similar way
but our intent is different I just
suddenly feel a little bit more
achievable for everybody it's a bit of a
some nods thank you very much
right tough right right but so let's
look a little bit more into why we did
the feasibility study stuff so the bit
that's in here
let's change color again right so I
could I pick the same color
that's much fun right so let's look at
why we do the feasibility study here
right and it's part of it is around
project risk so project execution risk
so let's put execution in there kind of
project execution risk right which we'll
come back to later in fact I'm doing a
presentation around that this afternoon
but bring that back into context in a
second the other one is how do we know
we're building the right thing how do we
know we're building something that's
valuable for the business well the short
answer is that we don't know right and
even post feasibility study we're still
taking a punt so let's try it in a
different way and when I'm doing stuff
with startups I'm doing this
conversation all day every day when I go
into Enterprise it's all day every day
and it's about changing the perspective
on what we're doing ok so we are
currently here and we'd love to be over
here that's the land of milk and honey
with rainbows and unicorns and cats and
dogs living together we'd love to just
get there straight away as fast as we
could but that's not the way the
universe works and it's sort of like
physics works and it's not the way
development works we can't just jump
from there to here so what we have to do
is we have to make a decision to run
towards that right so we do the best we
can intergeneration right so I'm just
going to say two weeks because that's
the k2 the cadence that I find myself in
a lot across the board actually so we
take a two-week run at this goal that
we've got and by the time we've got
there guess what's happened the goals
moved the land of milk and honey is
somewhere else now right but that's ok
we knew that was going to happen right
we knew that going in so all we do is we
say that's fine we are now going to take
a two-week run in that direction so we
call our shot and execute it all right
and then by that time someone in sales
would come up with a wonderful idea or
the business is more than a beautiful
opportunity for us and it's moved again
so the land of milk and honey is not
here and it may well be is through our
understanding of the problem it's may
well be that through what we learnt
getting towards it but now we've got
away in a different direction that's ok
we knew that was coming so now we run in
that direct
and this time you might have got lucky
right so when we stopped here and
delivered and actually took it to
production put it in someone's hands it
doesn't have to be our end user but it
is in use by someone who's doing real
things with it we then we found out that
we actually got two right at that time
so we take a run at that one again
but as soon as we get there its moved
again right I'm just showing the pattern
it's drawn the same way every time as
well so we go that way and then it might
go here and we actually catch up with it
right now that doesn't mean we're done
that just means we're tracking
requirements really well now okay so it
could well move again but what we've
done here is we've actually taken a
robust method for going through and
working out what our requirements are by
delivering value to the business so if
we look at that versus time again it's
this to this to this right and we didn't
have to know what that idea was it has
to be talked about well enough to be
able to get us to climb over the
mountain that's there there's always a
mountain that we have to climb over and
we also have to bring people with us
including the business right if we don't
talk about what's happening over here in
the land of milk and honey right up here
then we just do whatever is easy around
this and we potter around and do
whatever scratches our itch or whatever
we need to get done so a decent script
to make it so I can't screw up this
particular task right but with a bit of
vision and a bit of conversation we can
start to get to that way now from the
machine learning people in the audience
or for the Matz people the audience or
the engineers in the audience this is a
dynamic optimization problem this is
straightforward right this is what this
is these are the hard problems but
they're well understood and the whole
point of it is to make sure we get
started so a couple of interesting
things pops out of this row first up it
doesn't really matter how well we define
where the land of milk and honey is
because we know it's going to change
right and also the first step towards
that is pretty much the same row we
don't need to panic about it needs to be
a good enough story to get us initial
funding but we're not asking for the
whole box and dice we just ask you to
some of it so the other thing is that
given that we don't have a lot of
control over where we are but also
seeing that we're following this process
that's going to follow what our
requirements are it's going to follow
the value that we're driven it
doesn't really matter where we start in
fact the biggest problem across the
board for the asylum projects be at
startups or B enterprises no they don't
start they sit in the room and try and
work out what we should be doing when in
fact what we can do is start and find
out what we should be doing by keeping
an eye on what we're doing so instead of
it being ready aim fire it's now ready
oops fire aim right so now we get
started and we learn from what we're
doing now we're super sensitive to aim
now we've got to make sure we're aiming
correctly because there's no point us
getting to here and saying yet yet we're
on target and then diligently delivering
the wrong thing if it's actually over
there now so we actually have to
construct stuff that we're doing that is
an incremental delivery of the product
it's actually us doing product
experiments to discover what the
requirements are right now I'm not going
to cover this here but if you want to
have a look go and find a book called
the Lean Startup it's plenty of places
you should be able to find it online and
you look talks in there about what a
Minimum Viable Product is now people
it's normally referred to as an MVP
right people normally screw up on the
minimal part and also the viable part
and also the product part right but just
remember that it's really about working
out whether we should build it properly
it's not about building part of it and
then we're using it right we are
learning about what we should be
developed developing here ok but there's
a longer story about that if you want
grab me afterwards I'm happy to have a
chat before any to whiteboard day right
so if we look at what we're actually
doing here we're doing we're in a spot
where each of these points and we're
calling our shot which is over here then
we're executing it then we're coming
back and going again calling a shot
executing coming back calling a shot
executing coming back calling that's
shot executing coming back does that
look familiar at all right I was
expecting some of the stand up with both
arms in the air and yell agile right but
that's our agile loop right we're all
about being able to execute it and the
cool thing about that is that this stuff
is entirely under our control our
ability to call our shot about what
we're going to do
our ability to execute it and our
ability to look at what we should be
doing next entirely under our control
and in fact if we work out that there is
no value in this area at all because
Oracle's released something here or you
can now get it for free and open-source
products or whatever and we work out
there is nothing but dragons in this
area we can take this skill Transplant
it and go at a different product and if
you think about it from a business
perspective that capability is what they
need to build because you're doing more
than one project we're talking about
doing many projects yeah so when I'm
talking about this in the startup area
we're talking about a robust business or
a robust skill set so it doesn't really
matter what happens to you right you can
adjust and move and for the agile people
in the room this is the other side of
the coin for agile and if you're looking
for it it's lean and it's lean startup
not Lean Six Sigma so they're different
things but they both come from the same
stuff so out of Toyota and then late
eighties early 90s okay so this present
this when I talk about six key things
later today I think I'm on second last
session or whatever it is that's what I
talked about is how to lock that in
especially in the context of dev cloud
right cool so the other problem that we
had way back up here as you can clearly
see in my diagrams right the other
problem that we had was around resources
and basically I'm not going to the the
person who's responsible for that
project I'm not going to release the
people who are this high who I trust to
go in and touch our system of Records
with two terabyte data sets I'm not
going to give you that person so we can
scream until we're blue in the face to
get them that we're basically not going
to get that person so we need to
construct something that is actually
going to let us do these projects
without having access to those people
okay so let's say that we've got our
system of Records here and won't name
them clear normally get myself into
trouble with naming them right so we've
got our systems of record systems of
record right here and what we'd like to
do is we'd like to have a team come in
and integrate with these systems maybe
know what the maybe just those three but
they won't let us touch it very
certainly won't give us a synonym in the
database
to it they might give us the ability to
read stuff from it or they might give us
an export it nod or something like that
but what we want to do is we want to
integrate integrate with it but remember
we can't get the resources we need right
we can't get the person who's allowed to
have those passwords so what we do is we
actually see you know what how about if
we put a layer in here that abstracted
that away right so this is our new
product and this is no system to record
one two three and four right
let's go s1 s2 s3 is 4 right what we
really want to do is you want to be able
to access that stuff so the problem is
is that we're not allowed to change this
and it moves about that fast and for the
further Gartner people in the room or
for the people who read Gartner and this
is a pacing architecture so that means
about that speed speed and we really
want these projects to reduce speed so
we're trying to attack those tactical
projects we talked about before
okay so let's contract construct
contract let's construct a safe place in
which to play right so we're literally
creating a sound pit here for people who
aren't this high maybe they're about
decide right so we do that by giving
their access through something like an
API gateway or API platform which is the
one that's currently in cloud road but
we consciously construct that not
because it's cool not because we need an
API gateway not because we we need three
kilos of api's or anything like that but
purely about delivering more projects
because then we can unleash our creative
power right we can unleash the things
that we're trying to get done and
execute them and that's why we're that's
why we're doing it and you know this
person is going to grow up to be that
high but we don't need them that high
we're actually constructing a safe place
right so obviously we're heading towards
api's in this thing so if you put an API
gateway there great we can now measure
how often they hit it when they hit it
and why they hit it and at what time of
the day they hit it and that sort of
thing which is normally the first
question that gets asked in an
integration scoping project so if we
literally drop some form of gateway
there on a service bus person so I'm a
big fan of Oracle service bus for
reasons that we might get to a little
bit later but if we go through and do
that and we
that in there right we now all know all
these metrics about how they're being
used right now we don't need to sit down
and have meetings we may be able to do
some network trickery so the people who
are using it don't even know it's coming
through that mechanism but we've
gathered a whole bunch of requirements
in a very clean way because we've
actually measured what happens instead
of sitting there and asking them what
they think that happens okay so now
we're also going to try and address the
whole let's do this faster thing so what
we can do is now if we know we're doing
hundreds of 100s maybe tens more project
to you but we're going to do tactical
projects and when I attack them in a
certain way what we can actually do is
say you know what if we're going to do
lots now I can justify having a cleaner
API around these systems because what
it's doing is it's letting you leave me
alone so I can concentrate on doing my
system of record stuff while you guys go
and play in those tactical apps right
I'm blessed by God because I have the
big project that came in from the
administer but now we can do these ones
here so we publish those api's through
here
which sounds great and it actually is
but it's great for a couple of reasons
first up ops gets this brand-new toy to
be able to handle things with right so
the ability to change which servers are
going to which which serve as certain
customers are going to all those sorts
of things can all be done through here
and granted you can do it through like a
layer five device or something like that
or an f5 obviously yeah but what you can
think of is the service bus is layer six
or a layer seven switch which is really
interesting so you can do content-based
routing you can route based on stuff
inside it it's a very very interesting
tool not just from a depth perspective
but from an ops perspective I want to
route all high value clients to the
server that we know is running
definitely and I want to route all the
low value clients well we can probably
just skip validation on them because of
low value or we put them to something
that's on scale that takes some time to
scale up or something like that
operational advantages the other thing
is that this thing brings this
ridiculous non-functional requirement
capability to us so this thing here
actually has your auth in there and it
has your single sign on it has you
unified identity stuff in there
it also has your denial of service
attack and everything like that
so it hits a lot of our n FRS and I'd
love to spend more time in that but I
probably can't given the time that
sitting in front of me but so what we've
got now is a nice pattern as well so
we've got the systems here that might be
an extra bit of business logic that sits
outside of one of our systems of record
because with the last thing we want to
do is crack open one of these things one
because we're not allowed to and the
other one is because it's risky these
things are well tested by the people who
provide it why the hell we'll be jump
into it right especially if we can just
wrap it around the outside and that
pattern holds up here right so if we
have another Lister logical gate way or
another actual gate way we can have apps
up here that make use of that stuff and
they can run even faster they can be the
mobile app that needs to be done in the
latest coolest thing right it can be one
that's just it's a progressive web app
or something like that right why do you
want to do it oh we've got a very very
tactical one-week promotion that we need
to run cool we'll just build one up use
these api's that we're publishing
through here if you misbehave we're
going to toss you out of the pool though
which is the same thing that happens
back here if we hit this thing too often
then instead of addressing that risk
through doing a whole bunch of testing
what you can do is just say whenever
this app it's too often we just shut
them off right just chuck them out of
the pool which opens us opens us the
ability to be able to be a good citizen
in this area without having to go
through months and months of testing
right so now we can do these tactical
ops up our production apps up here as
well great the next thing that's going
to happen to you is someone's going to
want to kill the project right so if
you're got if you're tracking this value
versus time thing and you've done this
right and you've done that and you've
done that and you've done this on the
fly so you've done about backing those
projects up back-to-back but you're
delivering value to the business the
best defense you have is to have
analytics in there so we know how often
people are using it we know when they're
using it we know roughly what they're
using it for so we know the value of
these projects that they're executing
we're going to kill your project Peter
okay are happy to do it here's the
report of who's using it so instead of
me calling the 800
he used this twice a day to deliver
value to the business how about you call
them right so this is analytics inside
your product as soon as you can as a
defense not to hit a non-functional
requirement but as a demonstrable
evidence of your delivering value to the
business and once you start doing that
you're going to start being able to do
more and more because it's literally
about building trust with the business
ok so Jeff will take a big step back if
if we actually are about delivering a
very good business in its entirety right
we can no longer just sit here and say
that we've diligently executed the
projects that live inside in here we
have to be able to deliver value back
out to the business and that's not only
through projects but it's through
informing them about what's working and
what's not but also we need to make sure
that we're communicating with the
business across this boundary to make
sure a they're not throwing problems our
way but be that they can just rule
things out of scope if it's not working
but the only way that decision gets made
is if we capture the data and we
actually watch what we're delivering
because data Trump's opinion at every
point ok so pulling it back to why cloud
so what I'd like to see is us using the
cloud purely for the value that we can
do with it because we're all
ridiculously overtrained for website to
database the website to data base to
report and we've got the factors of
production that we have right now we've
literally got an effectively infinite
size cloud that we complain right we
should be able to run around in these
things and we should be able to deliver
a whole bunch of value in it and through
these mechanisms and some other ones we
can talk about later you can start to
run the argument to be able to do this
and this is not about reducing the cost
of what we currently do it's about
increasing the value of what we're doing
which is this diagram here we're trying
to pull very hard that way and we might
pull that up but as long as we're
delivering a lot of value the business
is going to be happy with it and I'd
like to end it there I think so thank
you very much for listening hopefully
this is useful too
Wow
great session now we're not taking any
questions unfortunately right now but
you around the whole day aren't you yeah
well we do take questions for you don't
we so peter is actually doing a reddit
AMA at lunchtime today at 12 o'clock so
you know you can put all the nasty and
three key questions there on your edit
patrons we got Peter locked up for an
hour to actually answer them there was a
great session thanks very much
delivering value who and the audience is
actually developer cannot just see a
raise of hands quickly great and who is
actually I keep them up keep them up
sorry a little bit of exercise in the
morning and who is actually focusing on
delivering value when they program
something and now let's hope that all
this and say oh there another hands went
up okay great
well there is a little present for
people delivering value to the business
great thank you very much it's actually
funny because some of the projects I
come along during my day job I look at
it and it looks more like that I tease
about fashion really it's like picking
the latest and greatest whatever
buzzword is out there we just take you
know and then we just build a whole new
system around it we replace a perfectly
well system with it or not though it
doesn't matter right and then a year
later another buzzword is out there and
we start this all over again now one of
those buzz words also we had cloud right
now right when one of the other
buzzwords that is out there is micro
services right and actually since a
couple of years now micro services is
the go-to architecture etc you know and
everybody is rebuilding everything in
micro services that's nothing wrong with
that but you know sometimes I start
looking at it and I go like micro
services are such an open definition if
at all our definitions what actually is
a micro service and actually is there
such a thing as a micro service and you
know once again I'm not really the guy
who answers it so I got a really smart
guy in the room for you guys Chris
Richardson who has many many different
titles and does many many different
things I think one of the most famous
ones the studies do
of poachers in action and he will talk
now about why there is no such thing as
a micro service please welcome on stage
with me Chris Richardson give me a sack
is going to take me a while to get there
yeah hopefully don't spill any water on
the laptop and I don't have a clicker
does anyone up thank you sorry yes and
unfortunately I don't have hand-drawn
slides today I mean I was just so
impressed with that talk both the
content of it and also the means of
delivery it's just like wow so I've just
got traditional keynote slides so this
is my talk on micro services and I'm
really going to cover three main themes
so the first one is I'm going to define
what I mean by the micro service
architecture and I'm going to describe
it as a architectural style and along
the way I explain what an what an
architectural style is and I'm going to
describe how the micro service
architecture enables continuous delivery
of complex applications you know it's
really kind of key thing is that the
micro service architecture is all about
tackling complexity and it actually has
not so much to do with high scale and
then I'm going to finish up by talking
about why micro services really are not
a silver bullet and they actually come
with a lot of complexity and a lot of
complex design decisions that you have
to make and I'm going to describe a
pattern language that can help you use
the micro service language micro service
architecture more effectively so those
are the main topics and the talk a
little bit about me so I live in San
Francisco and I must say I actually
really appreciate the weather in Sydney
right now it's just cool
kind of like San Francisco weather so I
feel pretty much at home it makes the
change from where I was in China where
it was like a hundred degrees and
incredibly humid got my
in programming back in the mid to late
80s building Lisp system so Lisp of
course being at you know one of those AI
languages functional than
object-oriented ended up you know
building compilers garbage collectors
all the way up to stack to a DES
eventually I ended up programming in
Java and my book pojos in action came
out ten years ago so that was all about
building applications with spring and
hibernate and it's sort of great to see
that like the Spring Framework is you
know still four thirteen fourteen years
later it's still innovating which is
which is really cool and then I ended up
tinkering around with this obscure
service known as Amazon ec2 so I'm back
when Amazon was best known for selling
books and that evolved into a cloud
foundry the original one which was then
acquired by SpringSource and then be my
then we were ejected out into pivotal so
it's sort of part of that for a number
of years and the name cloud foundry
though not my technology still lives on
so these days I do everything you know
around microservices consulting and
training very you know kind of globally
these days I also have a startup we're
building an applicant we're building a
platform to simplify the development of
business applications that are built
using the micro service architecture and
I've got I'm working on a book which
actually tomorrow or today depending on
how you look at it u.s. time was going
to be the Manning deal of the day but if
you tweet you can get it I'm going to
have a raffle two for a free copy and
then there's also a discount code as
well mix Pat OCD apparently so anyway
here's the agenda I'm going to talk a
little bit about what we mean by
software architecture we sort of throw
this term architecture around a lot
without really defining it so I'm going
to sort of talk about some 20 year old
concepts around software architecture
then dig into the micro service
architecture compared with the
monolithic architecture and then talk
about the pattern language and how that
can help you apply the micro services I
could
much more effectively okay so so what if
you know software architecture you know
there's even conferences about that
where usually it's like hey I'm from
some internet company and here's my
latest supercool architecture that can
handle millions of transactions per
second and all that and that's kind of
at the level of the discussion that we
tend to have but if you go back and look
at some classic definitions of what we
mean by software architecture it's a set
of structures that you need to reason
about a system we're building a software
system and we need to kind of make
decisions and well just plain think
about it and it turns out that
architecture is a bunch of software
elements and relations or relationships
and those software elements have
properties which can actually just be as
simple as names like can't see the name
of a class name of a service etc join so
that that's sort of a classic definition
is a bunch of software elements and
relationships which can properties which
you can state more concisely as this
triple right elements relations and
properties but you know another way of
looking at it is that it's just a bunch
of boxes and lines right that architects
draw and in sort of PowerPoint decks and
so on so that you know so that's sort of
kind of a fairly abstract definition but
if you think about it with a real world
analogy you know you take the
architecture of this building right in
order to properly describe it you need
to look at it from different
perspectives right there's the
structural aspect to the building the
steel and the concrete there's also the
electrical aspect you know all the
wiring and so on plumbing heating other
sort of macare conditioning you know
those other aspects of the building so
in order to actually properly describe
its architecture you need multiple
blueprints right from different you know
from the perspective of different people
structural engineers electrical
engineers and so on so different
stakeholders and software is exactly the
same in order to describe the arts that
the architecture of a software system
you need to look at it from different
perspectives
and which another way of putting it is
sort of is different views and each view
in fact is the collection of elements
with relationships and properties so it
sort of were back back to that triple
again but to make it more concrete
there's a very classic view model four
plus one view model of software which
was first described by a guy whose last
name I can't pronounce philippe i'm back
in 1995 so his way of describing
architecture is as a set of four views
logical implementation process and
deployment and then there's the plus one
that are the scenarios so that's his
four plus one view model tanda is
incredibly effective way to describe and
communicate the architecture of a
software system so the logical view and
that sort of describes what we as
developers create so since we're
programming in an object-oriented
language its classes as and packages and
then the relations between them are
things like inheritance Association
dependency and so on so that that's the
logical view that's what we create and
then there's the implementation view
where the elements are modules you know
as in jar files and then there are
components which are collections of
modules which are the executables the
war files or I suppose the EF files or
the executable jar files once again the
dependencies are you know candlelight is
composed of and and depends upon so
that's the output of like our build
tools right so we go from the logical
view to the implementation view which is
our executable and it turns out that the
micro-service architecture is actually a
particular way of structuring the
implementation view so there is actually
a reason for explaining all this stuff
and then there's the process view which
are the components from the
implementation view at runtime so at a
single war file or a single executable
jar file at runtime will be a collection
of processes like a collection as
Tomcats or a collection of
bm's and so on and then the the
relations between those are the inter
process communication rest or messaging
or whatever protocol your application is
using and then finally you have the
deployment views which are the machines
that the processes from the process view
are running on so those are four really
useful views and if you're creating
architecture documentation it really
helps to structure it in this way
believe me I've seen so many of these
market textured diagrams where it's like
there's a bunch of boxes and I have
absolutely no idea what I'm looking at
so these views are well-defined kind of
visual notation and then there are the
scenarios so those show how for a given
request the elements of a particular
view collaborate to fulfill that request
and that could be classes collaborating
it could be components or it could be
processes or it could be machines you so
for each of your views you have a
collection of scenarios that just sort
of bring them to life so that's the four
plus one view but then the other concept
is an architectural style you know this
is another classic definition and it
talks about a vocabulary of components
and connectors is sort of different
people so they use slightly different
terminology but it's really elements in
relations and it's just basically
imposing the constraints on the sort of
pallet of components and relationships
that you can have and how they can fit
together classic example of an
architectural style is layers right
where it says that you have to organize
your components or your software
elements into a set of layers each layer
must have a well-defined set of
responsibilities and then there occurs
then there are severe constraints on the
dependencies between those layers if you
have relaxed layering it can depend on a
layer can depend on any of the layers
below it whereas if you have strict
layering it has to depend on the layer
immediately below it so that that's an
exact classic example of an
architectural style it gives you a set
of
elements and relations that you can
compose your architecture from and you
have to obey a set of rules when you do
it very analogous to building
architecture right if you go look around
this sort of Victorian or Greek or Roman
it is sort of a certain palette of sort
of design elements that those buildings
are constructed from that makes them
Victorian or Greek or Roman okay so
that's architecture architectural style
and it's like well who cares about this
right why does it matter and what's
really interesting is I think over the
years we've sort of kind of been
building applications with a single
architecture three layer kind of you
know presentation layer business tier
data tier and it's all sort of been in
the context of enterprise Java and this
architecture thing has sort of faded
into the background somewhat but we're
building more complex systems and in
particular with the micro service
architecture you start having to think
about architecture in a much more
explicit way so if you think about the
requirements for an application you can
can split them into two categories there
the functional requirements sort of what
it does the use cases and the stories
that it implements and those you can
implement using any four to any
architecture you want even a big ball of
mud it might not be pleasant but you can
actually do it but there's the second
set of requirements the non-functional
requirements or software quality
attributes or the illah fees and you
know which things like reliability
scalability sort of performance that's
not an ility that will demand and arity
but in order to achieve those you have
to take into account the architecture
that's that that's that's the critical
thing is you have to pick the
architecture that satisfies your
non-functional requirements there's
actually a long list of functional
non-functional requirements or elytis if
you go to Wikipedia it's not massive
long list but the three the first three
are the ones that I'm particularly
interested
maintainability testability and
deployability because those are the
attributes that directly impact your
development velocity you know today
we're all about sort of basically
delivering and delivering better
software faster you know that's kind of
the the thing that we're focused on
right and that's the motivation behind
DevOps agile continuous delivery and so
on and that's becoming really important
you know this is the argument that
businesses are needing to innovate
faster and what that means for us as
developers is that well we have to
deliver better software faster because
we're creating the platforms that
underpin the businesses right and in
particular you know we want to
significantly reduce lead time the
amount of time between when we commit
our change and when that change gets
into production ties that are very much
in with the previous talk and likewise
we want to significantly increase our
deployment frequency so if you think I
kind of think of software sort of
successful software development is
requiring three things one you need
continuous delivery or sort of your
operating some kind of SAS or internal
IT application continuous deployment
where you're constantly pushing changes
into production you want to organize
around small into small autonomous teams
because those are the teams that sort of
agile enough and can make decisions
quickly and can have you know a
practical stand up every morning in
order to get stuff done and then there's
the third component which is
architecture and that's where this whole
issue around monolithic versus
microservice architecture comes into
play so now if we think about sort of
the classic way that you know I we build
applications you know like pretty much
every app every java application that
i've built over the years and
relatively recently has had an
architecture that looked like this where
from a logical perspective its layers
and it's modular right so this is an
online store example so there's the
storefront UI that a web application
there's either generating HTML or
exposing a REST API then the business
tears the data accessed here's a
comprised of module could implement
specific bits of business functionality
catalog recommendations reviews orders
you know and so it would go on so we
have this wonderful logically logically
modular and layered architecture but
then when it comes to actually deploy
the application we package it up as a
single war file or I suppose air file
and that that's it so we sort of gone
from this modular system into this sort
of monolithic system and that's actually
as I mentioned earlier that this is the
implementation view we've got our
implementation view consists of this
single deployable or executable unit and
then then there will be multiple
instances of that from a process view
perspective so that's really the
definition of the monolithic
architecture is an architectural style
that structures the application from an
implementation view perspective as a
single executable component and this is
not a bad thing necessarily if your
application is small it can off it will
have or should have good maintainability
testability and deployability
it's not an anti-pattern to use a
monolithic architecture in the right
situations it works extremely well the
problem that you have is that if you
build a successful application it will
keep growing over time right
unsuccessful applications just sort of
die right and no one cares about them
but successful applications just grow
you know every day that the team of
developers is adding more lines of code
to the codebase and it's so it's getting
bigger you know
and if you are really successful the
development team grows as well so sort
of the rate of increase actually goes up
as well because your team is getting
bigger and bigger and then maybe you're
split into such into teams that are
focused on particular functional areas
and you but your application is just
sort of growing so it's gone from this
small manageable monolith to a very
large system you know you can easily run
into systems that are half a million
million or more lines of code developed
by quite a large team and eventually you
end up in a situation that I call
monolithic hell where any notion of
agility both from a development
perspective and a deployment perspective
becomes extremely difficult
so basically development just kind of
cruel zhalong you can no longer practice
sort of continuous delivery like we used
to and the business gets unhappy with
you and then not only that your
application is usually ends up being
built with a technology stack that is
increasingly obsolete but you can't
change it because you've got this
massive codebase and it's becoming just
it's not practical to do that so you end
up in a situation whether you're
ill-at-ease that impact your development
velocity are poor so you have poor
maintainability poor testability and
poor deploy ability so you're in this
unhappy place you you're not happy
business is not happy and so that's
where this micro service architecture
comes into play so it's an architectural
style that structures the application
from an implementation view perspective
as a set of loosely coupled services so
say a service is just a mini application
so many executable a mini war file
executable jar whatever you want
the Creeky criteria is that they are
loosely coupled for reasons are
explained and they're also organized
around business capabilities so each
service is performing a particular
business function so if you think about
you know what a business
does right it's got like in this online
store it does things like take orders it
manages inventory it manages delivery
and so on so those are your business
capabilities those you know this is a
concept from business architecture it's
a little nebulous didn't sort of pin
down exactly what a business capability
is but you know business architecture
architects know what that is so it's a
way of modeling your business and the
idea is that you roughly map those
business capabilities into a technical
architecture comprised of services
though we have an order service and
inventory management service a delivery
management service and and so on so you
can sort of show your architecture at a
service level to a business person and
it would relate to them and it would be
meaningful to them which is actually
kind of nice because if you're on the
team building a service the business can
appreciate the value of what you do
because it's implementing a particular
business function so that's good so one
thing to note is even though we call it
the micro service architecture which i
think is a terrible name because the
first thing you hear is micro the actual
size of the service is not kind of a
primary goal and in particular it
shouldn't you should not strive to have
tiny services you know I hear people a
few years ago people were saying they
should be a hundred lines of code other
people have said maybe more recently
2,000 lines of code or two weeks of code
I said to me those guidelines are
somewhat misleading because the goal is
to have a have a service for each
service is for it to implement a
meaningful slice of business
functionalities one of these so cool
business capabilities it should be
capable of being developed by a small
team you know they're so cool to Pizza
team those sort of appetites and pizzas
vary in sizes but you know like six to
eight people you know once again small
agile team and they should be able to do
it with minimal lead time so time from
commit to deploy with a high deployment
frequency as well and provided that you
satisfied those goals it doesn't exactly
matter how big your service is I mean
some of them might actually be smoke you
know a team might own a collection of
small services but some of them can be
quite substantial provided it satisfies
these requirements you know this is the
primary goal here and this is sort of
why you know kind of then the other
point which is where the title of this
talk comes from is for me Mike when I
say micro services it's really just a
shorthand for the phrase micro service
architecture kind of works better in a
sentence sometimes which is a form of
application architecture and so for me
this is the reason why there's no such
thing as a micro service right you only
ever think of an application as being
comprised of a set of services and so
you always have to have at least two for
it to be meaningful now to me that sort
of helped kind of clarify clarify the
definition especially when you hear
someone will say can I use a micro
service for this and it's like well not
really like a better question to ask is
can i structure my application using the
micro service architecture that's that's
a much more correct usage so lonely' a
lot of explanation but the end result is
when you architect your system using the
micro service architecture in particular
this online store you will end up with a
set of services so there will be a
catalog service that will be a web
application with a some kind of API
likewise a review at review service
order service and so on potentially tens
maybe hundreds some people even have
thousands of services like I think you
bar has more services than they do
developers which is slightly peculiar so
you have a set set of services each
service if it has data will have its own
private encapsulated data data day was
data store
doesn't mean it has its own private
database server so you don't have to
shock your DBAs by asking for an Oracle
license for every single service they
can share databases that's service
database service that's a capacity
planning issue but a key requirement is
that the the data that is owned by a
service is private to that servers
pretty much like the fields of a class
they're private and encapsulated you can
apply this functional decomposition to
the web application as well you can have
different web applications handling
different parts of the UI product search
and browse shopping cart product detail
page and so on and then you can have an
api gateway that acts as the facade into
the set of services so that it connects
so that collectively they can expose an
API to clients which could be third
party applications could be mobile
devices or they could be JavaScript
applications running in a browser so so
you know one thought is golly this is
pretty complicated right before we just
had a bunch of tomcat that were
load-balanced and look at all these
moving parts that we have to set up kind
of kind of manage and that that's kind
of a hint at the complexity that sort of
one of the downsides of the Micra
service architecture oh and I keep
forgetting yes you can have a messaging
gateway as well because maybe supply is
ascending you catalog updates using some
messaging based infrastructure so you
know so that that's kind of a quick
overview of the Micra service
architecture and the reason we're going
to do this is even though it's kind of
as a whole there's a lot of complexity
and a lot of moving parts it actually
gives us really good maintainability and
testability in the deploy ability
because if you're a developer working on
a team that owns a service
your universe really is that service yes
you're consuming the api's of other
services and you're exposing an API to
other services but your application is
going that your service is going to be
this rellis
a small body of code which will be easy
to maintain easy to test and also easy
to deploy so that's sort of the big
motivation for using this mic for
service architecture you know and to put
it another way is if you want to do
continuous delivery or continuous
deployment which is part of this whole
DevOps phenomenon if you're building a
large complex application it's very
likely that you will need to use the
micro service architecture and the
reason for that is sort of twofold
so one the micro service architecture
gives you an architecture that's
testable and deployable which is a key
key requirement on the architecture in
order to do continuous delivery
deployment continuous delivery in
particular relies very heavily on
automated testing so your software has
to be testable and large complex
monoliths usually are not testable in
any sort of practically easily very
practical way and then yeah also needs a
deploy ability because you're
potentially deploying into production
many times a day and it's usually not
practical to do that with a large
complex monolithic application unless
you try really really hard I mean there
are people who do that and then also
this architecture enables the teams to
be autonomous the idea is that each team
will own exclusively one or more
services which they can develop test
deploy and scale independently of the
other application in dependently of the
other services and the other teams so
that that just lets them get on and do
their own thing with maximal development
velocity without having to be held up in
tedious me to code tedious coordination
meetings with other teams and in
particular if you go back to the
database right you know if I'm on a team
and I want to change I need to change
the database schema if that schema is
private to me I can just change
whereas if there's ten of the teams who
are accessing that schema I'm going to
have to have meetings with those ten of
the teams and that the schema change is
going to have to fit in with that
schedule which will be where which will
slow me down and get in the way of
continuous delivery and just be
incredibly inefficient whoops Oh can I
go back yes there's a back key so this
is that you know some absolutely
fascinating numbers from the 27th 2017
DevOps survey where they should have
have some statistics showing the
performance of yes kind of
high-performing teams so if you're on a
high performing you know a high
performing IT organization you're
deploying into production many times a
day yeah Amazon had a statistic it where
they were deploying every 11.6 seconds
which is mind-blowing
you know the lead time for changes from
commit to deploy is less than an hour
Netflix had an example of 16 minutes for
one service and then they're moving fast
but not only that they're also moving in
a very safe way so they're not breaking
things so they have a shorter time to
recover from failures and also that
failure rate is much lower than sort of
medium or low performing teams Amazon
had a statistic that whether it was like
point zero zero one percent of their
deployments actually caused an outage so
it's all about moving fast and not
breaking things and then also in a micro
service architecture lets you evolve the
technology stack so when you're built
you're creating a new service which is
something you will do from time to time
you can pick a whole new technology
stack or if you're making changes
significant changes to an existing
service you can actually rewrite it it's
not going to be a hugely expensive
multi-year effort to do that
and not only that it lets you experiment
with new technologies and sort of fail
in a safe way so for example you know
you might have heard the goal anger
cool right because Google uses it and
and so you decide to implement a new
servicing golang and you you succeed and
building it but then you realize that
golang is sort of a 1990s version of C
and you want to actually use a
higher-level language actually one with
exceptions is why just don't get the
return code thing and go lang but that's
not a disaster
you've spent a you know a relatively
small amount of time successfully
building a service that's in production
using a technology stack that you have
decided is not a good fit for your
application and it's just like yeah we
well we learnt something right we
learned that we want to use a nice JVM
based language right and so next time we
need to make any major changes to it
with we rewrite it and that's really
important it lets you experiment and
fail in a safe way so listen really
really you know awesome benefits of
using the micro service architecture but
it really isn't a silver bullet you know
fred brooks the author of mythical
man-month
said back in late 1985 that you know
there's no silver bullet in software
engineering there's sort of no magical
technology that makes everything perfect
writers you know no rainbows and
unicorns and certainly that you know
that's true what's true with every
technology there's always downsides to
consider and it's particularly true with
the micro service architecture and by
far the biggest drawback of using micro
services is complexity you are now
building a distributed system so not
only do you have that you've got where
you have complexity of development
whereas before if one module wanted to
invoke another that was just a simple
method call
now it's into process communication you
know with rest G RPC or messaging
obviously those libraries that helped
with that but it's a bit more
complicated you have to deal with
partial failure the service you're
trained to invoke might not be available
you need to program explicitly for that
once again there are circuit breakers
the circuit breaker pattern and
libraries to help with that and then
also the fact that each service has its
own private data is a wonderful thing
but it's like how on earth do you
maintain data consistency and how on
earth do you do queries that involve
joins across these data across these
services as well and you know that's
actually worthy of a whole other talk
sort of a particular area of interest of
mine and that that's sort of what what
my startups doing as well event-driven
architectures testing is on the on the
one hand testing an individual service
because it's small is relatively
straightforward but making sure that the
services work together correctly is a
challenge and so they were testing
patterns for that as well so that's good
and frameworks like in particular start
just started using spring cloud contract
for testing servers to test for
verifying that services properly work
together and then deployment is sort of
complicated as well on one hand yes you
can deploy a service but on the other
hand there are now basically an order of
magnitude or two orders of magnitude
more applications in production so from
a sort of operational point of view
things are a bit more complicated the
nice thing is is that there are
automated deployment platform so it
could be docker orchestration frameworks
like well docker swarm kubernetes there
are clouds that automate your
deployments there are passes like Cloud
Foundry that do it as well so it's sort
of like yeah there's all this extra
complexity that you have to deal with
but on the other hand it's it's that
there are solutions or beliefs partial
solutions to this complexity whereas
your monolith
it's just complex and it's becoming more
and more complex everyday and there's
really no solution to that so but so
there is this you know but it's to adopt
the micro service architecture is not a
trivial undertaking so you have to ask
good microservice is a good fit for my
application do I have the prerequisites
in place have I am I good at automated
testing this comes up a lot when I work
with clients it's like hey we want to
use micro services how's your testing
why are we do it manually you need to
master automated testing because that's
sort of a critical foundation of modern
software development and if you want to
go fast you have to implement automated
testing automated provisioning is also
generally useful as well I don't think
it's quite as critical but you should
have that that in place too and then
also if you decide to use micro services
there's a whole bunch of issues that you
have to address around the composition
deployment testing observability and so
on and so you know the your choice is
whether to use it or not is somewhat you
know it really does depend on your
particular situation and so to help with
that I've created the micro service
pattern language I've been working on it
for sort of - 2 or 3 years now so it's a
collection of patterns that solve design
and architecture problems around the
micro service architecture and it can
help you make better decisions so a
pattern of course is a reusable solution
to a problem that occurs in a particular
contact and it was popularized by the
design patterns book that came out in
1994 which is a collection of
object-oriented design patterns and
patterns are actually really good
because the format of a pattern
encourages objectivity
so patterns obviously have a name you
know there's that you have to describe
the context which is the situation
within which you're trying to solve the
problem because the differ
situation what might actually require a
different solution you know pattern has
the problem of course that you have to
document the forces so these are the
issues that you have to address and
sometimes they're conflicting there's
the solution that's the essence of the
pattern of course but then there's the
resulting context and that has three
subsections you describe the benefit
which is usually what we all focus on
when we talk about technology or at
least technology we like it's awesome
and if it's technology we don't like we
just focus on the drawbacks right it
sucks but with the with the pattern
format you have to talk about all
through both of them benefits drawbacks
and then not only that you have to
describe the issues that you then have
to address if you've applied this
pattern because it turns out when you
pick up a pick a pattern you have now
created sort of you solve one problem
that you've created a set of hopefully
smaller problems for yourself
so this format forces you to describe
them and then your author then there's
this section of related patterns and
those are patterns that are alternative
ways of solving this very same problem
so the pattern points to its competitors
which is really useful it says well you
could use me but maybe you should use
that other pattern like the monolithic
architecture and then other then there
are related patterns that address the
issues that this pattern creates for
yourself so it's sort of it's a much
better framework for thinking about
technology and so this is the pattern
language so if you go to micro services
i/o you will see a much more readable
form of this you know there's some
critical patterns here right the core
patterns monolithic versus micro service
architecture and then if you pick the
micro service architecture everything
else solves problems within this
architecture so there are patterns
around decomposition how do i split my
system up into services there are
patterns around managing distributed
data how on earth do I
tane data consistency and and also do
querying and then there's sort of a
bunch of technical patterns that are not
quite as critical and interestingly
those are the ones that people are
mostly talking about today like patents
around deployment right cloud docker
yeah but these are sort of less
important than than the first three
patents there are a whole bunch of
patents around into process
communication because we're building a
distributed system and then there are
patterns around observability how you
know figuring out what on earth is going
on inside my cluster of services is
request bounced around
so like distributed tracing and log
aggregation a key pattern step so that's
pretty much my talk which is good
because I have just ran out of time
so in summary right the goal of
architecture is to satisfy
non-functional requirements and then
when you want to do continuous delivery
you have to pick the appropriate kind of
architecture so if you're building a
small system the monolithic architecture
is just fine probably if you're building
a large complex application you should
most likely use the microservice
architecture but once again it really
does depend on the specific situation
and then you can use the pattern
language to help you decide well should
I use the microservice architecture
should I use the monolithic architecture
and then if you do decide to use the
microservice architecture how do I solve
the plethora of design problems that I
have now created for myself so that's my
talk thank you for listening and I hope
that you found this useful and I was a
shameless plug discount code from my
book so thank you
thank you very very much Chris
great talk I have to ask now do we have
any NGO developers in the room oh yeah I
got one present Oh too far sorry please
further back for the girl developer
thank you very much so great right so we
have cloud we have micro services Tasha
rhythm death ops what's next right so we
had those different trends different
technologies different patterns if you
like and actually in what's an axis how
do we actually use all of those was
design and probably how do we actually
use all of those and build applications
and that's why I would like to introduce
my clicker doesn't work
can we forward one slide out there you
go oh maybe did work in too far that's
why I would like introduce Steve Tyndall
who actually tells us about how to use
how to build modern applications using
api's using micro services we also drive
into chat pods and AI please welcome on
stage
Steve 1000
so can everyone hear me good server on
the side of the room feeling seasick now
from watching that got them down yeah um
actually could we go to the slide show
the way you can I have that clicker back
now I've got the clicker I want it
before I can get sad I want to introduce
a good friend and colleague Franco Ichi
Muhammad sage Franco Franco and I are
going to do this presentation together
and it's going to be very much a
interactive presentation with lots of
demos hopefully not too many slides and
the goal of this session is really to
let you know tell you what how oracle
sees the developer space at the moment
what tools and platforms were building
in that space we're going to demo the
Oracle cloud and some of the developer
related products that we've brought to
market recently and show you a little
bit of how you know some practical
implementation or ways that we can do
and implement some of the architectures
that Chris and Peter have just been
talking about so this one's going to be
a bit more of a product focused session
you can't come to an Oracle conference
and not get at least one product session
so we're going to give some demos and
show you some of the tools that we've
been building so if you think back to
think back say even ten years ago the
way we develop applications is very
different wasn't and it's an exciting
time to be a developer there's so many
different tools and technologies and
capabilities and styles that we as
developers really are spoilt for choice
on how we go about building applications
there's frameworks that do a lot of work
for you there's new styles and and key
ideas where it hasn't necessarily got a
mature framework built out yet but you
get to play with a new capability that
someone's come up with it's just
fantastic and so varying what a
developer has at his disposal today to
pick up and start building the
applications and that really drives that
I guess the entrepreneurial or you know
build it fast fail fast test it and see
the mentality that both the two previous
guys have been talking about the tools
are there if you put your hands on them
and start playing fast and get things
done things have changed a lot in the
last ten or fifteen years and how we
develop applications and so we see a
shift and then we've got a few things
either kind of a shift from how they
used to be to what we see today and so
we'll just talk to those first of all as
we build applications previously no we
typically big application hard code you
know from you all the way through the
back end maybe touching one further down
to monolithic in style
we'll move today to much more dynamic
assembly of ideas suddenly do you know
you can take a concept that delivers one
piece of functionality in one framework
or technology and mesh it in with
another capability and blend experiences
from mobile and web and whatever else
and chatbot signors we'll see in a
second so it will move much more to a
style of blending together different
capabilities and moving them together to
form an application rather than actually
building an application the other thing
is development cycles I mean who
appreciated the concept Peter was
talking about in his first talk where he
was really saying you know the large big
project where you sit aside 18 months or
two years and three million dollars I
don't see too many organizations
embarking on that sort of project
anymore what we really are saying is
pick up the tools do something fast
prove it fast or fail fast if it works
take the next step and get going so you
know introducing this idea of zero dev
time build times where we're turning
around features even in hours days
whatever you know we have Sprint's that
might last a couple of days a couple of
weeks but always driving new fast
outcomes the other key different and
this is I think ties them with some
social aspects too there's a lot of you
know trend toward people not necessarily
coming to an office and working at their
desk but we're seeing much much more
distributed development teams I mean
gone are the days where I think you get
20 developers
stick them in a room and say you guys
you know in all that out for 18 months
until you build and deliver that project
we see development teams now spread
geographically do a lot you know and
teams coming together and working
together on different pieces of the
application or big pieces of the project
and blending lots of different
capabilities the whole idea with
polyglot and micro services is
developers can choose what technologies
they know and understand and get best
capability out of so this idea of a
polyglot environment where multiple
languages are supported in those
multiple languages and and platforms can
be brought together as we said in the
first point to build or assemble an
application is something that's really a
trend right now and and I think a very
good way of building applications so
we've talked about this about already
you know the big application with
thousands of lines of code and
delivering it all in one go is is not
what we will be seeing we're seeing much
much smaller components and the
Microsoft architecture that Chris talked
about is one such architecture for
designing and delivering that but we are
seeing people break applications up into
much much smaller pieces and of course
that also feeds into what Peter was
telling us about don't think this big
let's think this big get it working
prove it
succeed and then deliver our next piece
so breaking even the design and the idea
of how you're going to deliver them what
you're going to deliver into smaller
chunks where you can gain success very
very quickly sort of thing um a little
bit repeating myself but this next one
you're not we're not just building
another app because what is the app
today when you talk about an application
or a project that typically isn't an app
that the end-user
integrates with or sorry interacts with
there's typically multiple channel loon
there they might there might be a web
app you deliver it's probably a mobile
app a large part of what we're seeing
today is people interacting with chat
BOTS over something like facebook
Messenger so there isn't an app there is
a bunch of capability and technology
that we pull together and we allow our
users to interact with those
capabilities in a lot of different ways
and so there's not this concept of you
know that app calls these services and
that that's the application it's really
is a component idea and then the last
one which is the one we're going to
spend a fair bit of time talking about
today in this talk and demonstrating is
this idea of API first I'm sure that's
not a new term to most of you but at a
super high level what that means is
really understanding what are the
services that make up my application and
how they relate to the business and what
this application is going to deliver to
the business and thinking through what
are the needs of the business and how
can I design the services that that
serve that need and then once we work
out what services are required to
deliver that need in a parallel effort
we can go away and work out how to fine
tune those start developing them build
different channels that that consume
those service etcetera so really an API
first approach so in effect what Steve's
spoken about really shows how exciting
it is for developers and the
opportunities we have you could also
look at all of that and say there's a
lot for us to absorb there's a lot for
us to get right the good news is you can
see it's broken down into a half a dozen
areas and the thing that's cool about
those half a dozen areas is that you can
actually focus on this or focus on that
or focus on any one of those in parallel
to get self enabled all of those areas
really comes down to your own attitude
your own team approach of how you start
to absorb what's going on as you start
to absorb things from a DevOps
perspective you can start to practice it
with performance monitoring or you can
start to practice up with the API
management it's actually you don't need
to do it all you can just start to dip
your toe in any one of those areas and
as I'm suggesting in parallel across the
organization so you can see we are at a
point in the industry in the IT approach
that things are a lot more meaningful
focusing on how we can deliver value
much faster at a lower cost versus our
monolithic long time tightly bound
approach we've now got the ability to
start to experiment start to get a bit
of confidence in two or three areas and
bring it together so that's really what
we're going to be doing today is try and
show you what sort of journey what does
that journey look like how do we get
started
these are the key things that you know a
platform we think needs to have for you
to embrace all the things we've just
been talking about these are the there
are other things with six key things or
enable us if you like or groups of
technologies and capabilities that
developers need to be able to start
delivering these type of applications so
we're going to stop talking for a bit
now and start doing some demos and
you're going to reduce that Franco but
what I just wanted to say was that
you're going to see us pull out each of
these capabilities you see here through
the different capabilities and products
we show you in the Oracle cloud today
MSC forwards on you could look at any
one of those areas and say one is more
important than the other right whether
it's getting excited around docker
whether it's getting cited around API or
whether it's getting excited around
performance monitoring depending on your
outlook depending on where your
organization is you can easily come up
with the rhetoric to really drive the
other the point I'm making is all of
them are actually of value and the
question is how do you start on that
journey so you can touch each of those
the way we're going to do that today is
actually a journey that you will be able
to continue on after you've left this
talk how many people saw the Anki
racecar track outside there a few people
saw the racecar track that is an example
journey of DevOps API polyglot
performance monitoring chatbots
containers we actually spent 18 months
trying to work on
something that was a bit of play using
toys so we could articulate a journey we
got a lot out of that learning and so
what we're looking at doing now is to
show you how we can repeat that journey
but in another domain once again using
play using toys to actually help
articulate that I'd encourage you to hit
the URL Anke - Meldrick oracle au dot
out and that will actually be a place
you can go to repeat what we're talking
about here so Anki Meldrick we're using
some of the yankee toys again the focus
is on medical records and we've got this
crud application acting as a system of
record and you could say it's the
original monolithic app and we're going
to start to think about api's we're
going to start to think about micro
services we're going to try different
languages we're going to play with some
docker containers and a number of
flavors and we want to do all of those
things I've just articulated in short
experiences that we can socialize so we
can grow our collective IP there's a
couple of people here in the room that
have put a lot of effort into this dave
and carlos and arlene macadam if you see
that actually guys can you just stand up
so people can see you early these are
the guys that are the brains behind
making this work I can talk to you about
agile back and talk to you about MVP
they can talk about you know why
containers are more important than api's
or why devops is more important than
containers we all have those religious
arguments so I'd encourage you to have a
look at this and we're practicing that
you can see we've got the toys on the
right hand side we've got little robots
this high we've got a little bit Anke
cosmos we got wearables etc the other
organization I'll call out that have
actually participated on this journey
journey is Rubicon red
as well as Peter Lorre who have actually
got an example of their little micro
service and little apps interacting with
that how do I do so just hit that and
you can actually see why we've got this
here we're trying to articulate the
benefits of a digital platform what's
possible with a digital platform and
obviously API is DevOps it's easy to
look at those things as technical terms
but we're trying to make it meaningful
to bridge business and IT which is
really what Peter kicked us off with and
we've got a what I say a 15 minute
experience on how you can get started
with this Dave and Carlos have got a
hands-on lab later today if you can't
get on that hands-on lab you can do it
at home with the family and the other
thing to which we're encouraging is that
these api's will actually be hanging
around for a while so if you have got
some sort of idea around some sort of
demo or some sort of capability you can
actually play with these api's after the
event you can use it at a hackathon you
could use it at a workshop down the
track okay
we've actually called the project the
castle from the Australian movie the
castle so the idea is you know we've got
something that we're all really got a
lot of pride in and we're actually
trying to share this as an ecosystem to
grow the developer community to really
drive knowledge around DevOps api's
chatbots containers etc so we'll be
using this a lot there's three videos
that I hope you get started I encourage
you to look at them so that's a little
bit about the backdrop of Anki Meldrick
using the castle and the scenario here
is we're actually dealing with medical
records things like physicians patients
observations etc and we're not really
sure where this is going to go all we
know is
we know api's are important how we stand
up those api's are important and we know
there are a few key things which we'll
talk about the moment so Steve's going
to act as the API developer in a moment
he'll start with a little knowledge and
then I'll be acting as the person who
cares about getting some developer
capabilities stood up how do we get
those API stood up so people can access
them and then we'll talk about chatbots
as an example consumer piece of code to
access that and then there's performance
and monitoring as well so Steve we're
going to get into this now we're going
to take an API first approach and we're
actually going to start with some ideas
so what are those ideas will look like
so we've got the idea that we've got
some patients the patients need to have
appointments the appointments need to
actually relate to doctors the doctors
care about it we're capturing some
measures etc I won't spend too much time
here and I'm actually saying you don't
even need to get it right all you need
to do is get a picture up so you can
articulate it and get some get a
collective IP between a few people up
and going so you can start on that
journey once we we sort of validate the
ideas we then actually say well how do
we stand this thing up given we're
probably going to change our mind in
this fast-moving world I think I want to
do it with some
infrastructure-as-a-service
using traditional forms but then Steve
argues with me no no I want to do some
docker stuff I want to use containers
and I actually you know Steve's actually
caught up I need a user interface on
this I want to actually create something
there we're trying to break some of that
so what I'm trying to show you here is
we need a vehicle to actually help make
sure we don't bind things too quickly
and we get people to become aware
there's going to be many choices and
decisions and many directional changes
occurring on that and treat each one of
those those small pieces of work and
those small pieces of work could relate
to a micro service experience so you can
see what I'm talking about it's an
example of the knowledge behind what
Chris is spoken about and I'm applying
it with the knowledge that Peter Lorre
has already spoken about we're trying to
break things up and start to share a
collective IP so Steve I just want to
get these API stood up I just want them
out there is there anything I need to
consider franco before we lost them
think I think before we jump straight
into building api's I think it's really
important we understand first that with
lots of api's comes a need to manage
those api's and so we're going to do now
just before we show the first demo is
talk a little bit about what products
oracle has in this space around API
management and API design and so if your
management of course is a really
important part of the puzzle because if
you build api's you need a way to be
able to get those to your consumers you
need a way to secure those you need a
way to make sure that they're consumable
that people can log in and get access to
them that the right policies etc in
place you need to make sure that they're
deployed in a way that they can meet the
demand that you're expecting and of
course one of the most important things
and one of the ones was most under
looked at by developers I think is some
analytics so some building visibility
visibility of who's using my api's so
that again back to Peter's point how do
I be able to tell the business that what
sort of value we are delivering back to
the back to the business so
understanding who's using my API is and
what sort of benefit that's creating is
a really important part but as
developers we need to start to learn to
build into building our API so when you
look at what Oracle offers from the API
life cycle perspective there's two
components the component on the right
known as apiary was one of our
positions we're actually going to look
at Steve do his thinking his modeling
he's not sure if he's got it right but
it gives them the ability to stand
something up take a couple of steps back
and look at it and show it to other
people do some mock testing then on the
left hand side when we start to get the
secured consume monetized analyzed under
a governance model we've got this thing
called the API platform so it's when you
feel assured the shape of your API and
how you want it out there now enough
talk about this let's see if can you
tell me more about this API platform so
I'm going things pretty quickly but I'm
going to give you a demo first of a
three and how we build a building and
API in there but quickly this won't talk
about the API platform they've got a
platform is the web service a cloud
service I should say where you can
define your API and then deploy those
api's now make them available in a
developer portal after you've designed
them from a pre compute a pre and design
your API laughter that they get pushed
into the API platform where they do a
manager can log in and be responsible
for defining you know who has access to
the API what policy should get applied
to it etc so it's the runs it's the
management component of how you're going
to expose these API is out to the
outside world the documentation and
design that you build in a pre gets
linked to that so that when a developer
logs into the developer portal and tries
to start consuming that product I'll
come back this is a second basically the
documentation that you build around that
API once you've defined these api's and
put the right policies in place we set
up a bunch of gateways and these
gateways get deployed where the actual
physical service is being implemented
right so this is a distributed
architecture the Gateway could be
deployed on-premise could be deployed in
Oracle cloud in AWS wherever your
service implementations are the Gateway
gets deployed in front of those that's
the barrier that actually provides the
secure access to the service and the
policies and definitions and security
and everything that you defined in the
in the management portal
gets pushed down to that pot to those
gateways at runtime so the Gateway is
running next to your service and
securing that service and then
applications at runtime when they hit
that gateway they get a response through
the Gateway to the service and back to
the application there's no traffic going
up to that the administration portal
during runtime it's all directly for
that gateway and then of course those
gateways can get deployed out in many
places they can scale out you have
multiple instances of a gateway in one
place for scalability needs you can have
multiple gateways across geo regions
because you've got services located
across regions so you can really define
in any method you like how many gateways
you have and they all tie back into the
management console where you define
which api is get deployed to which which
gateway so that's a distributed
architecture for securing your API as
once you've built them but before we do
that what I want to do is kick off and
quickly show you the first part of the
process which is the design idea so how
would I would pick to the demo how would
I go about quickly starting to document
and design from my API so this is a
three dot IO you can go there today this
is our API design and documentation tool
you can sign up for a free account most
of what I'm going to show you right now
you can do in the free account so
there's a fair bit of functionality you
can you can start with straight away I'm
going to go ahead and sign in with
github so one of the first things I'll
point out is this this direct
integration with github
it'll as you're designing an API you can
check that directly into into a
repository it'll pull requests etc so
there's direct integration with github
so you can see here you link this
project to YouTube now what you're
seeing here is a the concept of this
product is you define your API in a
quite a nice English type language
there's two languages you can choose
from you can use something called the
API blueprint which I'll show you in a
second or of course you can use swagger
which I'm sure you're all fairly
familiar with already so swagger is the
language to define the API
and as you build your API your swagger
document or you go broop em over here
your documentation is being built for
you automatically over here on this
right-hand side so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you can we create
can we create a new one
just a simple we're going to create a
new API so let's do it
and I'm going to walk you through I'm
going to create a team API I'm going to
call it or our toad because that's the
event we're at I won't make it private
and here's where you can choose whether
you want to use API blue pearl swagger
I'm going to do API blueprint for now
but I'll show you some swagger in just a
minute
this gives me a new API and it gives me
a nice template that I can start working
with and I'm going to go ahead and say
let's do this is the developers is a
simple a bit of consuming let's say it's
we say you devs who attended Oracle code
excuse the spelling this is going to be
the any good feet that's a pretty good
for you normally to spelling life
developers collection we're going to say
list all developers and we're going to
do that at slash slash developers the
still lives okay and this API I want to
have a response of a 200 if it's
successful and here's what I want the
payload or the respond success
successful response to look like so
we'll just go and modify this really
quickly I'll do that so touchy mouse
practice for this man should not so
that's going to be tradesman never
blames his tools you know Wow uncle
misses
okay we're good now okay so this is
going to be what would you expect ID
call us 1 2 3 4 5 will have name and
we'll make this email okay so long that
doesn't matter either you notice as I
was typing here it actually was
validating the document as I go and it
says here I've got a valid document I go
ahead and save and I've created there a
really simple API and you'll notice over
here on the right-hand side my
documentation has been updated for me as
I go now I can go ahead here and let's
click on list all Deb's
and the first thing you'll see is that
built into this tool you for me we have
me having through a single thing is a
complete lock server running so at this
point I've had an idea I've written that
down and I've got some documentation
which explains that idea with just that
amount of work I can now begin to share
that idea with the rest of the
organization I can send out a link for
someone to consume this API I'll show
that in just a second I can share this
documentation people can begin to read
the API we begin to have a conversation
and this is the important point we can
have a conversation in my organization
about this API whether it serves the
need whether the payloads of the right
shape whether the mobile developers
think it's going to work for them and
then mobile app whether the chat bot you
know whether the API sir well the
payloads are small enough for a chat bot
we can begin to have a conversation
about whether the API works is going to
service on these before I even start
writing any code that's the whole point
so straight on here I can click on on a
mock server and you'll see this URL here
that's been generated for me I'm going
to go ahead and click try call the
resource
and that has given has done a HDB
requested at Mach server and give me
back a result now that's not just a
simulation that's a real HTTP server
posting that mock service you can hit it
I can take that copied up that URL there
put it in a browser a developer can call
it can start modeling you know a
prototype application around etc so in a
very short period of time I've described
an API and got a working mock server
that's returning data that we can begin
to start discussing and seeing if it'll
work for our organization so Steve if I
get it if I get this right if I've got
some flat file data somewhere I've got
ideas of things we're doing like you've
got a list of developers maybe locations
where where we're running Oracle code
literally in five to ten minutes I could
actually put that in there in that
format and start to have some REST API s
we can start to consume literally in ten
minutes that's the whole point very very
quick have something ready to consume
and that that's something that can be
consumed the point is that drives
knowledge and awareness of the API so
that you can prove its validity within
the organization before you've got your
team investing huge amounts of dollars
on actually implementing the service
we're having a conversation and a
validity check about whether that API is
going to do what we need to do the thing
which is really nice about what you're
saying is is it's starting to create
that line in the sand that common
language such that the people who are
caring about the system of record apps
and the people that are caring about the
consumable things in front can start to
actually have a conversation we can
start to actually work out the impedance
issues and work out what does that API
really need to look at exactly now just
before I finish this I want to show you
we have also modeled all of the anchor
bedrock API that we're going to use them
a demo and you can use in the hands-on
lab and later on they're all sitting
here this is the swagger document so
we've modeled them in swagger and the
tool has produced obviously the
documentation straight off that swagger
so what do you write an API plus
blueprint or whether you model in
swagger the result is identical over
here on the documentation you get is
identical so that's just an example of
what we've done in swagger and the echo
in a pre cool let's move on step because
we've got seven minutes left and so I
think we've got an extra 10 on top of
that I cast me so true it is now okay
can we go back to the slides
oh yeah okay so Steve's now talked about
the thought process the modeling process
the shaping of these things once we've
got an idea of that shape how do we
actually get it to the next point where
we need to start building these sorts of
things we're aware of this monolithic
approach and I don't want to save a
monolithic approaches back I actually
think it's got a strong place to play in
architecture but we're really
appreciating and valuing the idea behind
a microservices approach and whether you
go down one or the other the key thing
to do is to talk about it socializing
and help understand the ways and why for
the advantages and disadvantages of it
which has already been done very well by
Chris so let's talk about how do we get
onto this new journey this new approach
and the cool thing is it's an industry
momentum now to say we know things like
agile MVP
fast development is there and there's a
heap of developer tools that are open
source space that you can start to
assemble so you can start to practice
these techniques with continuous
integration continuous deployment
approach and the other thing I'm really
excited about is that there are many
language choices that all play an equal
citizen approach whether it's Ruby PHP
nodejs or Python with the key driver
behind this is we actually want to do a
fast deployment using this DevOps
capability so what I'm articulating here
is what we're
wanting to practice and we're practicing
that as part of our Enki metric journey
today what you're seeing here is we are
very excited about the container type
technologies out there using docker
we'll talk about that in a moment we do
appreciate that we actually want to be
able to take advantage of these services
to help our DevOps approach and the
fastest way to get this stood up is to
take advantage of what's possible in the
cloud so Steve let's go to a demo of
this now okay so what we're going to see
now is how are you would use the Oracle
developer cloud service to go go
implementing this API so we've developed
the API we now have got a development
team we've decided the API is going to
do what we want how what tools were
going over to us to get a development
team organized to actually start
implementing that and so I'm going to
show you something to develop a cloud
service and the application container
cloud service before we do that though I
actually just want to learn circulate
what we've got here is the Oracle cloud
console when you actually get into the
Oracle cloud capability the Oracle
public cloud capability you have a
variety of choices so all the things I
talked about with all of that open
source tooling and how it was assembled
to really do fast development Oracle's
got has got that packaged so you can
drive as part of that you get a choice
of what technology you want to consume
so you can see here we've got our old
tried and trued Oracle database but you
can also see we've got this thing called
compute so you can stand up whatever you
want on your operating systems you can
also see we've got my sequel there over
to the right
so you've got a choice whether you stand
up the Oracle database or my sequel in a
bit of compute or you consume these as a
platform as a service okay so you've got
a variety of choices the thing which I
like about this is you can go down one
route pull back and go down another
route you actually get the choice
of changing direction quickly and easily
there's these two things here to the
Container so this is Oracle's
implementation of you being able to
start to set up and start to utilize
docker containers we really heard a
little bit about that if you don't want
to do the setup with it we've also got
the docker container set up as a
consumable pa's service so all you do is
deploy your bit of PHP or you deploy
your bit of Python or nodejs
we're going to see that in a moment the
first thing we're going to do though is
have a look at this thing called but
develop a cloud service that enables me
to drive a fast of our development
process so this is the developer cloud
I've clicked on Frank oh yeah and you
can see your project there the castle
that's it I'll click on that and you can
walk us through what you want to show so
if you look here on the left hand side
you actually see a number of choices
that we can pick project code maven
releases snippets
merger quests issues agile build deploy
wiki we're going to go through a few of
these given the time the very first
thing you can see though is if you
scroll it Steve just scroll down you can
actually see the work that folks like
Carlos Dave Reid Arlene Mac Adam and
Jason low Jason low hi Jason who's
watching this out of San Francisco and
have actually been participating on on
the right hand side you can actually see
where the code is sitting where are the
git repositories whether they are
actually sitting as part of developer
cloud service whether they're sitting in
a git repository on Prem or somewhere in
the cloud or sitting in github there's
that plug-and-play approach I've also
got the ability to see all of that
activity here via a slack channel on my
phone I've just been away for two weeks
in the mountains of Timor I could
actually whenever I
got into rato Wi-Fi communications range
I could actually see how Ally was
working his butt off driving activity
there what we're going to do now before
we get into some of the code to steepen
you click on wiki which is where we
started this journey you can see we've
got a traditional wiki capability here
and you can start to see the original
set of thoughts of when we started to
create this and who was go back to team
members so you can actually start to see
when we started this journey you could
start to see some of the behavior some
of the some of the elements of what was
actually there etc and you can see Ali
added the document Dave Reed maintained
that we did some stuff and a lot of the
content there ended up on our ranking
Meldrick website so you can you click on
code for me and if you actually just hit
the pool down you can actually see here
all the code repositories feeds one of
those you can see the releases of where
they are I can actually go in and start
to look at that if you just hit the
pulldown Steve with the Meldrick they're
already okay can you just no I don't
want you to go there I want you to I
want to actually show off I did write a
little bit of code I want to show it off
so if we actually click on metric Python
gets down the second the bottom one and
let's go to my first Python there so you
can see my name's there and some
comments then I kept it really simple so
it was me appreciating the rest API that
folks like Carlos and Dave put up there
and the ability to interact with that
and hold on a minute
I just noticed an key metric Python
right up the top can you just go to the
top on that I was meant to be always
meant to be the only person who was
writing Python code on this so let's
have a look get and it looks like
someone's improved my code so I think
what I'm seeing is some software
bullying here people thinking my codes
not good enough
and they had and it looks like it was
Jason Lowe Jason I'm going to get you
when you come back oh let's have a look
at the anchor Meldrick api's so this is
the actual implementation of these
anchor measure of a POS so let's go down
and look at the server Jay s you can see
Carlos is put it in there and let's have
a look at Carlos's comments there's not
enough comments in there car lights
we're going to have a performance review
later on another typical know that okay
yeah and let's have a look at the
manifest JSON check out version version
four so we can actually see it's up and
running so the cool thing about what
we've got here is that you're seeing
lots of examples of what's possible from
those code repositories all being
applied to specific initiatives or
specific projects and we can actually
capture that let's click on issues so as
we're participating on what's going on
and I've already mentioned the team
someone like Allie can actually raise an
issue request and we can start to work
on it so you can actually start to see
while we're going regardless of where
Ali's working or where Dave's working or
Jason in San Francisco we can actually
see what's happening live let's go to
agile where we can actually see we set
up Sprint's with what's going on and
wait for this to come up let's just go
back to the backlog first and so you can
see for each of the Sprint's we can see
what actually occurred who's done it how
they're part of a story part of an epic
I'd like you to click on active Sprint's
so at a glance I can see who's working
on what and how things so you can see
we've got VJ working he's got a number
of things in progress we can actually
click on any of the respective sprints
or complete with Evan's Evan's showing
off so let's just go back up at the top
let's pick metric API v2
the last one there and you can see as a
developer it's as simple as just drag to
show how when you can drag and drop
those things so you can actually drag
and drop those things and that's how
quickly those this is representing the
current sprint and what tasks or
features or issues whether they've been
whether they're still to do or in
progress or have been completed so
really easy to manage and get a view of
where everyone's at let's finish off a
reports here and there's a number of
reports here they just come out of the
box so you can start to see how how
people are working how we're going
according to our our targets with what
we're actually doing let's click on
build Steve and let's have a look at
what what's possible we hear from a
build perspective yeah so these are the
different build jobs this is the part of
the tool where you would implement you
your CI CD you can build a complete
build scripts you can dissolve you can
design them customize them there's web
hooks so you can integrate external
build tasks with it when they can call
back into this then we poke around here
we can see here's our different build
jobs you've got will click on one here
called this is the employee app build I
think this is unrelated to the castle
but it's go would look at nonetheless we
can say there's been one successful
build of this we can click on the
console excuse me and then very quickly
get right down into the details of how
that was pulled together and and the
outcome and the fact it was built
successfully if I go back and actually
look at the Anki Meldrick one which is
this guy we can see there's been lots of
bill builds attempts couple of them
successful we can configure the build
and say what are the steps that are in
that in this particular case there's
only one step in this build it's a a
shell script that executes a script
which goes and does the build and the
deploy but we could have quite a complex
build sort of build steps here you can
add ant maven tasks Gradle tasks calls
out to node
you can even do sequel a sequel calls
etc so you could build quite a
sophisticated and complex build script
here there's triggers for these scripts
to get built to get triggered
automatically etc so you can set up here
on a schedule or trigger based
continuous build continuous integration
environment to deploy either just build
your application or to build and deploy
in this particular case we've got a
script to build the Yankee med rep app
and deploys it straight of the article
container cloud which I'll show you now
alternatively you could set up a
separate deploy step I won't show that
for the sake of time but you could have
a build step and deploy step in our case
our build step does the deploy as well
and we go to the application container
clamp episode that after that build you
just saw me show you as I said it builds
the application and pushes it straight
to the application container cloud so
let's click on that and see what that
looks like so again that's running in
the Oracle public cloud and just to
recap the arc the application container
cloud is a set of containers pre-built
for you you don't have to worry about
bringing your docker container yourself
it's a docker based container
infrastructure where you can just upload
in one go a zip file of your node app or
your Python app or your groovy app we
extract that execute some scripts you
put in in certain directories and deploy
your application it's running on the
cloud within a single step once that's
up and running here's the one we've bent
on belly zenki
Meldrick a POS that's running in a
docker container for you on the Oracle
cloud and once that's running the
management and scalability of that is
really really simple you can simply come
in and say instead of having one
instance and two gig of memory assigned
to these prisons I want to have you know
three instances and four gigs hit apply
and we do all the work to scale that out
put a load balancer in front of those
instances for you and and make the make
the application continue to service
requests in scale so in order from the
time of having an idea building some
code getting it deployed and running and
testing these are the these things are
there for you to be able to do that very
very quickly all the pieces are in place
for you to write your code and deploy
without you
having to do too much poking around
let's go back to the PowerPoint we're
being asked to wrap up Steve
so let's just flick through a few of the
slides I think you've got the ISM sorry
so we've just seen Steve take us through
the developer and application container
cloud so once you've got these api's one
of the things that trends we are seeing
is what's possible with BOTS whether
it's using something like Alexa audio or
using something like facebook Messenger
we're recognizing there's a high value
opportunity to start to use your abis in
some clever ways the first approach is
just to have a simple task oriented
approach I did have a demo but I think
we'll give it a mess now so the idea is
to really just start to get some simple
capabilities in there as you start to
get that the obvious roadmap of where
you want to take this is to take
advantage of what you've got from a
predictive and data-driven approach so
that's the definite roadmap of what's
possible there and from an Oracle
perspective we've got a capability
called the Oracle intelligent chat bot
service that actually helps you of that
journey using a multi-channel being able
to set up a dialogue with a machine
learning capability so what's that
architecture look like so in effect we
have the ability to configure that with
something like Facebook Messenger or a
lexer or your own sort of capability we
actually look for what the intent is and
the more usage there is we start to
understand what the intent is to work
out with what sort of entities you want
to deal with whether it's around
patients or appointments or observations
right through to working out what does
it mean for your system of record with
the api's so we that's a quick intro to
what's possible with bot
Steve let's do a wrap-up of what we've
seen today I think the overall point
Franco we're trying to make is that
apologies for the rushed in but the
Oracle cloud platform there's probably a
lot more services there and then you
realize it's looking something like 40
paid services available today there's a
broad range of services for developers
that are focused specifically for
develops around DevOps API management
mobility etc chatbots as we just talked
about of course the ones you probably do
know about from Oracle there's a bunch
of database and bi services integration
capabilities etc so there's a complete
platform of services available to
developers to log in and start building
applications very very rapidly yet so I
think I'll skip this because it really
is just focusing again on what we've
already talked about but one thing I
just want to wrap up is there's over 500
pre-built certified images you can run
the Oracle cloud today so we've we've
partnered with bit Nami I'm sure many of
you know bitNami but if there's a bit
Namie container you can run there's
three clicks from the bit naam of the
Oracle cloud market plate place all the
bit nominee marketplace click on that
and you can have that container running
on the Oracle cloud in three clicks so
that's something that allows you to
again get up get up and running very
very quickly if you want to run you know
docker or
low balances and all those sorts of
things that the capabilities and the
building piece of building blocks are
there for you to start building very
very quickly I'm going to skip this I'm
going to skip that apologies guys the
last thing I want to just leave you with
is you all will receive as being part of
this conference a $500 credit on the
Oracle cloud so you can hit this URL and
go there and get your your trial
experience on the Oracle cloud it's 300
us which translates to $500 us SS 400
you'll be in the Australian currency so
what we really want people to do is log
in and start playing with these things
so you could take if you're interested
you know and you attend the hands-on
labs today you can see how those api's
have been built and where they're
running you could use your cloud credit
login and implement those yourself in
the Oracle cloud so I think I'll leave
it there hopefully rust as it was you
a bit of an overview of what's possible
and thank you very much for your time
and thank you thank you thank you space
thanks a lot guys
yeah thanks for clicker so you got 10
minutes left actually 9 minutes before
the the actual session start so just
make this quick to wrap up we do have a
developer portal out there developer
door to come very very easy to remember
where you can actually find all sorts of
resources as a developer this is
actually continuously being approved to
just bookmark that and whenever you want
to you know what SDKs documentation and
so forth go over to develop at Oracle
comm social media if you aren't social
meaning any of those twitter facebook
youtube please follow us please engage
with us there as well thank you very
much one thing I want to point out we do
have the OBE labs out in the lounge just
when you pass through the doors oracle
by example labs we actually do have a
challenge going on today from noon till
5:00 p.m. the top three that participate
in those labs can actually win a price
so what it is it's a virtual event each
lab takes 10 to 15 minutes you can
register at any time out there or follow
this URL here just sign up with your
local laptop and then go through those
labs and set the top 3 by the end of
today will actually receive a price does
the booth out there in the code lounge
if you would like to get more
information about this right attend our
now so don't forget the mobile app so
said we have eight seven minutes left
now before the sessions actually start
the coach line is a lounge is open since
twenty minutes ago all the way to 6
o'clock and then the most important
thing here is from 6:00 to 7:00 we
actually throw a little party here we
have some beer and wine and hopefully
you can hang around to network last but
not least there is actually good news to
the trial that we have just team of
Steve and Franco we actually increase
this for Australia to $500 that's US
dollar so you actually get even more so
if you go out there
and there's a booth that says a lot of
the cloud trials and you sign up today
not only do you get five hundred US
dollars
sign up credit but you also get one of
those black t-shirts that we have out
there as well and with that I would like
to thank you very very much for
attending this keynote please have fun
in order to code today please hang
around and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
