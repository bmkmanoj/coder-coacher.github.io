yesterday that's because in fact we as
developers we can be to take care about
service but that doesn't mean that those
service doesn't exist if not right in
this case we will delegate the
responsibility of the service to the
cloud and I will stay focused to
programming and interesting aspect about
surveillance is that I only focus on
programming one function so I say to the
cloud please walk this function for me
and you will take care of the
server-side the benefit of that is that
server-side will take care to expand the
vessels I need for wounded several
surveillance version and stayed
available all the time but yes this is
amazing
the fact that no more servers is that we
will gonna make anymore season mean
things just stepping back a little bit
you know we from an evolution of people
going from data centers to cloud the
idea behind the cloud again is to
offload a lot of the infrastructure your
servers your networks so you don't have
to deal with spinning up a VM and
figuring about all the resources from
there we're going to the next level
which is serving us so again loading so
you can scale what is the need to move
to server lists we need to really good
one of the things that we when we use
serverless is when you want to reduce
the costs because being server less do
you only pay when the fruition is
running so I compare that when the
parking lot when you need to pay they
say ok you will pay one hour $12 for 1
hour parking lot when you only stay
there 5 minutes the equals du equals
need to pay itself overseas
so in this case we made a man I don't
know for it
Saints just for one second so you only
will pay for they say ten cents so this
is the first thing the people do need
taik about that then is so for example
how biggest is your bucket where I am
right now evaluating if me great to
serve Ernest or not but I haven't a
small back in that have only five
services so I say I really need to pay
every month one instance for my server
or maybe it's better for me me great to
service and then X is really specific
and particular cases when people use
server less and the most common is for
the tech that exists changes in a
database or 9s storage and process the
information that is therefore produce
something that we went one example about
a sriracha's for processing images for
example I propose that for a client that
needs to process Excel space that was
real biggest so we work something about
exhales files I have thousands of
records so we need a really big a server
for can made the process to all those
files like very files per week so why
don't we take our server with a cost of
$500 per month just for process these
files so in this case will be better
implement a several extortion the only
will be ejected when we detects the fire
so so basically is more event-driven
something interesting about startups
because at the beginning the startups
adopts herbalists because I was really
faster that I can create a fortune or
service that my applications we will a
consume when we are a startup we don't
have resource Elda at the beginning of
the project so we need to implement
something faster and use the less amount
of resource economic resource so many
startups start is started using Cerberus
so they use create them as small
services that will mean it for me the
MVP that is the minimum value of
proposals or their startup so maybe
these will be really interesting for
some rules about Cerberus because
exactly the focus is that we don't need
to take care about the server side and
always stay available but in the case of
Cerberus effort can make more powerful
they made that will run our project in a
docker image so that means that I need
to create a service with a docker image
that I will run inside that with
kubernetes for manage the elasticity of
my several sites so break a little bit
the rules but
give to the developers a little bit more
power for create their functions when we
develop server unless something that
happen is it when I am making one
function is I only have one file of code
so I cannot create things that is more
complex or I will create one object here
that I will use for parsing my
information and this is something that
really permit to us a different project
the next things that have several
positive definite serpent lese you know
solutions is that additionally the
solution say to you you only can program
in the Indies a cloud platform with like
them or only with nodejs
so you cannot choose your own program
and the essent project you can't you say
many languages you can use go you can
use Java or Python or no details and in
the future we will having more moisture
