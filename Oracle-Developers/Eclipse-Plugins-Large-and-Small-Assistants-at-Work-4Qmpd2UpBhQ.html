about eclipse plugin and how eclipse
plugin can assist me in my daily work as
a software developer my name is your
page ticker I'm from Switzerland as you
most probably assumed you two swiss army
knives on the slide the knives are a
metaphor for eclipse the left you see it
out of the box when you install it and
on the right is when you have additional
plugins installed I don't have many
slides my name my main part is live
demonstration of the various plugins but
first something funny lost Friday when I
traveled from Zurich to San Francisco it
was very early at the airport and so I
had some time so I walked around in the
air side center of the airport and then
I saw this big advertising screen but
screams not showing any other choice and
so I walked closer and they got curious
still you can't read it so I try to make
a photo now you see a problem calls the
program to stop working and the windows
will close the program and notify you if
a solution is available well I hope that
the windows the zurich airport traffic
control does not have any windows
systems they use because this would not
increase my confidence in the airport
authorities this message was displayed
for several hours and nobody cared so
let's start with my talk when I was
preparing this talk I asked myself which
plugins I should present my goal is not
to present the mainstream well-known
plugins like PMD fine also check style
like always present them more
not well known hidden pounds of plugins
so I made my selection and I hope that
you will find one or two plug-in which
also serve you well in your daily work
but before I demonstrate my favorite
plugins a few words about checkstyle PMD
and find box my personal view each
developed should use these plugins just
a quick survey who is using checkstyle
PMD or find box okay about the half so I
will just quickly go through the slides
checkstyle is a plug-in which checks
your source code agonda against a
defined set of rules so this source code
based and violations are directly shown
in the idd IDE as source code markers
for example we use checkstyle mandatory
ensure coding guidelines there is a
large set of predefined rules and you
can tailor the set of rules according
the needs of your project bindis somehow
similar to check them at all so
different again there is a set of
predefined rules some are the same as in
checks down some or different checks
then check some checks and checks more
the coding style and PMD checks motor
programming style and again violations
of these rules are marked as show source
code markers in the ID the same here you
have to tailor the rules that according
the needs of the project my first school
my personal favorite is find box Fanbox
analyzes the bytecode to find a wide
range of known java problems for example
null pointer dereference azure closet
defines equal but not hashcode the
potential box are shown in the source
code as markers and the description for
each park is given again here a large
set of the tech this is available and
you have to tailor and this set
according the needs of the project
now to the main part of my talk during
it during the preparation of this talk I
asked myself in which context i shall
present the plugins i think the most
common task we face as a developer is
not writing new code most of the time we
read and maintain code that someone else
wrote before and usually there is no
sufficient documentation available so I
searched for an open source
implementation and I found a suitable
implementation of the game of life I
hope that most of you are familiar with
the game of life just a very short recap
you have a grid with cells and there are
four different rules which you find from
generation to generation when a cell
will be born survives or when the cell
will die here you see the four different
rules a cell dies if there are less than
two or more than three adjoining cells
new cell is born matter when there is
exactly three adjoining cells and the
cells survives the next generation if
there are exactly two adjoining cells so
I just quickly demonstrate the
application now afterwards we will have
look at the source code you see the
application you see the grid which the
cells and the yellow ones here are the
active cells down here have controls for
example to trigger the next generation
will also be possible that i start the
worker thread in background on this
workers ready triggers the generation ok
so i quit this and let's have a look at
the source code
this is an installation of Eclipse
without any eclipse any plugins
installed so over here I have my java
project the source code and there are
different packages and in each package I
have various classes the first question
is where is the main clause so I
searched for a method declaration with
the name main and here it is let's have
a closer look you're an object is
created and this object is passed as an
argument on an applet frame when I
follow this one by opening the
Declaration we see that some set set up
code is you for the menu and down here
is a call applet in it i follow this one
again open declaration again some setup
code here and here is an interesting
part this class represents the tools at
the bottom of the screen so i follow
this one again open declaration again
some setup code interesting part is down
here here you see two actionlistener one
for the next open click and one for the
workers ready to start and stop so i'll
follow the next button and here's some
registering mechanism so i follow this
one and finally i end up in a method
which is called next in the class game
of life grid
so and here is that action is this rule
the four different rules are applied to
the grid so I go back by using the
toolbar to my main menu main method and
hear em when you observed my actions
very closely you saw that I was using
the mouse for all actions and for
example there are also shortcuts
available for example open declaration
is f3 or when I want to go back I can
use old and cures the left this isn't
something new one that is not surprising
when I would use the shortcuts that
would be much fast but the problem here
is to remember the corresponding
keyboard shortcuts so I quit this
Eclipse and restart it with an
additional plugin installed and will do
the same actions as I did before so the
first thing is I searched for a main
method main
and then I will to the open declaration
by using the mouse and now you see here
is no pop-up this pop-up tells me please
use the shortcut x3 I can do the same up
here for back it is old and kill as a
left so this plug-in reminds each time I
trigger an action by using the mouse
which shortcut it is when we have a look
at the Preferences of this plug-in this
plugin is called mouse feet you see that
i can define here what the clocking
should do when i use the mouse for
example remind the action keyboard
shortcut as you just saw do nothing or
here is an interesting one enforce the
action keyboard shortcut so I try this
and now when I use the mouse and say
open declaration it says no you have to
use the shortcut so I use the shortcut
the same applies when they use here the
back it says no please use the shortcut
so this plugin you can force me really
to learn the various keyboard shortcuts
so I switch back the setting because i
want to show some actions lift the nose
and ok now i don't remember the location
of the next method because there is that
action is so i searched for the next
method declaration again and here it is
eclipse provides also a feature for
bookmarks and they can add a bookmark
for example here by using the mouse and
say add bookmark and i have to provide a
name where the action is and the
bookmark is shown in the separated few
than here bookmarks can be very handy
because when i set the book
mark for example here then I I can
directly navigate to a bookmark by just
clicking in the book knocks you on the
bookmark so I don't have to search for a
clause so there are playful anymore but
there is also a drawback for example and
i set a bookmark i have to provide a
name and I if I don't provide a name I
can't set the bookmark other problem is
that I have to use the mouse to navigate
to a specific bookmark so fortunately
there is a plug-in which arrests these
two issues i restart my eclipse of an
additional plugin installed and i will
do the same as I did before so next
method
this time i set the bookmark pipe using
the keyboard i press cultural and be
this adds the bookmark at the current
line this bookmark is also shown in the
book box you book knocks you down here i
can press ctrl be again and this totals
the bookmark but i can also use old and
the number foreign number bookmarks for
example here i pressed all than turkey i
won this added a bookmark here number
one for example not a run down here if
the number three and i can now navigate
through the list of bookmarks by just
pressing ctrl n for the next bookmark or
ctrl p for the previous bookmark and for
the click bookmarks I can use shift old
and the number for example number one
for the quickbook not number one or
number three for the clickable clock
number three and this is very handy I
use bookmarks myself very often so let's
have a look at the rum time of the
application so i will set a breakpoint
here and run the application in the
debugger and then I press the next open
here and now I'm in the debugger and
they see over here my variables this is
the this pointer and here i see the
object there are different fields for
example here I have the grid a grid is a
two-dimensional arrays if the cells row
and column I can expand Roland and I see
the individual cells i also have a hash
table up here which holds the active
cells of the current state and here ever
also in hash table which holds the next
shape of the game of life
okay let's have a look at the first
active cell this is the cell with the
row number 14 and the column 25 and the
object ID is 13 13 so let's locate this
cell in the grid array so i go for the
14th row now here and it is the column
25 so i'll scroll down here this is
funny because the object ID is different
this is certain 51 and this up here is
certain certain so most probably i
interchange Row on the column so I will
look for the 25 element of the array and
then the 14th element and yes here it is
object ID sort inserting and this is the
same object as I see here in the hash
table the problem with this few is that
it shows an object hierarchy and in
memory I don't have a hierarchy I have
an object network and then the object is
referenced several times from other
object it is displayed at several
locations in the hierarchy and that this
is annoying and the only way to figure
this out is to look at the object ID
unfortunately there is a plug-in which
addresses this issue so iris not make
lips with an additional plugin installed
and they will do the same as I did
before
first I will go to my next method the
bright point is already there so I start
my debugger hit next and now here I see
again my variables here with the
different fields what I got here is a
debug visualization few and then I
opened it and see my objects on the heap
in a graphical representation that can
also expand this and then I see the
different elements for example I see the
current rate the grid and the next day
only I removed the next shade because
it's not be interesting expound the
current shape and then I see the five
active cells I can also expand the entry
of the hashmap n'ton I see the cell
object interesting thing is when I now
expand the grid arrays two-dimensional
array I directly see that this object
here is referenced from this column over
here this is column number three number
three and this one is sell at the
coordinates three and three I can also
do this with the second if another one
and then I see that this is referenced
come over a year and in this way I have
a nice representation on the objects
which are a bitch ass as the or in the
memory okay
now if this few have a little better
understanding about the dynamic of my
application that my few on the
application is still very limited for
example in the call stack I only see the
directly invoking method of the current
method I don't see any method which was
called before or will be called
afterwards and I always dreamed of a
tool which provides me a better
visualization of the dynamic of my
application for example in form of a UML
sequence diagram there is a feature in
Eclipse is called this call hierarchy
and call hierarchy shows obviously the
call hierarchy you see here the next
method is invoked or can be involved by
the next generation and the next
generation can either be evoked by the
run method of the workers thread or the
next button click but this view is a
static view it's not a few which is
based on the wrong time but now my
dreams have become true there is a
plug-in which provides a few that is
based on the wrong time so I restore my
eclipse with an additional plugin
installed
and I switch the perspective this plugin
is called diver and diver is a
post-mortem few on the ground time Trey
so I first have to record a trace so I
start my application I activist activate
the trace and then I for example start
the work respect for a few generations
and then I click the next button a few
times I stop the recording as you can
see here there are already some events
processed meanwhile I can close my
application and as soon as all events
are processed here I can have a look at
the trace so I open the trace and just
record it and they know that thread
number three is the interesting ones
though I activate this trace and now
here I have representation a graphical
representation of the execution of my
application I can also double click on
an element year and then it shows the
corresponding code location above this
plugin is smart enough to recognize the
control structures for example this try
block here I can collapse it order while
statement can also collapse and expound
it afterwards what you also see is that
this loop is executed three times and
currently I'm looking at the first
iteration but I can switch you to the
second iteration or to the third
iteration and then it will show the
corresponding iteration in this example
here there is no variation in the
messages or they will show you an
example of the works
which there are some variations so let's
go further explore next generation is a
little bit larger and here again I can
double-click on a message and then I see
the corresponding code location and
again I expand the next now I see the
sequence diagram of my next message
which i already showed you before there
is also an outline here which gives me a
better overview over the sequence
diagram so let's have a look at the
third while statement here you see that
in this file statement there is an if
statement I'll show you the code above
I'm sorry for this show you the code
above this is this vile state and then
here you have a if statement and only if
the if statement condition is true the
remove is called on the hashmap so let's
have a look at the sequence diagram you
see the vial statement this is the first
iteration of eight and here you see the
if statement and due to the fact that
the remove message is not sent here I
assume that they have statement the
condition was false so I say let's show
me the second iteration sorry
here this is the second iteration and
again you see that the remove message is
not sent so i go to the third one and
here you see that there is a difference
now the removed message is sent so i can
look at the iterations individually okay
but the problem here is actually I don't
see any values yes please mmm I don't
think that this is possible if this
blocking but i will show you a plug-in
afterwards which is capable for this yes
I can't hear you are too i will show you
a list with the plugins at the end of
the sessions okay okay the main problem
here is that don't see any values for
example of get neighbors i can expand
this but i only see the type of the
return but i don't see the actual value
and this is a pity but at least with
this plugin I can use the sequence
diagram I can take a snapshot and paste
it into my documentation the plug in
here this is called diver is a post
morton plugin or represents a
post-mortem view on my application but
in my personal view it lacks the
possibility to look at the values but
there is another plug-in which doesn't
have this problem so I restore my
eclipse with an additional plugin
installed and they will do the same as I
did before so first I will recall the
trace I start my application I start a
worker straight for a few generations
and then hit next a few times
okay now i can open the trace and the
few i've got here is quite similar to to
the debug perspective of eclipse in the
middle I of my source code and you see
the current line up here I have a call
stack i also have controls for step over
and step into and also i seee my locals
now i can execute the application step
by step you see that for example here
the value of this variable changes and
the interesting thing is this button
here step backwards so when I click on
step backwards I can execute my
application backwards for example I can
go to the store now I see here that the
value is null again and I step forward I
see that this is assigned I can also
have a look at the fields of this object
so let's let's have a look at the next
method so I switch to the next movement
and I can tell the plugin just roll to
the next level and then I can start
debugging from this location here as
well as I obviously can go back here you
see that this class has a generation
counter it just expand to sit here and
you see it currently it has the value
for when I step over the statement it
has the value 5 what you also see here
is a few variable history and this
history shows any value which was
assigned you the whole execution of the
application to this field
now I can just click on a single value
and then I see the corresponding code
location but not only the location of my
debugger changed I also traveled in time
because now I can start from this point
on forward or backward again I click for
example of the value 3 I see here that
this is call to the next method due to
the workers threat when i click on the
value 5 I see that this is caused you to
click on the next button and again I can
just start debugging from this point in
time let's have a look at the clear
method over here again I can step into
this then I see that clear is calling
said neighbor with zero as the parameter
I step into now I see here that the dis
is a cell and then open it I see the
number of neighbors is zero and again I
see all values which were ascending the
execution of the application for this
particular cell and again I can directly
click on a single value and this changes
the context of my debugger for example
this is from the next button clicked or
here I see that this is from the
neighbor what I also have here is not
only a variable history also have a
method history so when I opened this one
I see all invocations of the ink
neighbor and I can I'm sorry I can
directly again I can directly click on a
single line and this travels in time you
also see this over here is small
Timeline view and then I click
you see that the time changes each time
I click on it okay you see here that
pink neighbor is called 144 times and
maybe I just want to see the invocations
for the current object so I can feel
that is by defining here a filter so I
say that this is equal to an object ID
and then I apply this filter and now I
only have 10 invocations left and these
10 in locations are only for this a
defined sale over here again I can click
on it and you see that I actually travel
in time
what are the consequences when I use
this plugin well the first thing is I
don't need any break points anymore
because it just can set the cursor to
any location I want and then I can say
okay round 2 line either forward in time
or backward in time so I say backward in
time and Here I am the second thing is
that I don't need any break any log
statements anymore because here i have a
feature post execution lock and with
this feature i can introduce a log
statement after i recorded my
application for example i say i want to
happen I want to have a log statement
when I hit the line number 113 and the
remove is called for sell even can
access my locals here for example the
current cell
yeah super ok back again I press ok and
now I can apply this and then I see the
corresponding log statements and again I
can directly click on a log statement
and then I again travel in time and from
there on I can start debugging either
forward in time or backwards in time
however so let's do something different
let's do some refactoring I can't hear
you know super and try to fix this
ok
so
I hope it's better okay I'm sorry what
is so let's have a look at the next
method my personal view this method is
not very well structured so the first
thing I do is I extract some methods for
example here I introduce a method for
bring out the babies and I do another
one here buried that that's and yet
another one here calculate the number of
in a booth and again the last one this
one here prepare the grid so now I can
get rid of the locals here okay let's
have a look at this implementation as
you can see the rule is directly
implemented here in this game of life
grid class and my personal view it's not
a very good place I would prefer if this
rule is implemented into the cell itself
and not integrated so I add an
additional method to the class is is
that for the class cell and they move
the implementation from the grid to the
class here so and I will do the same for
the rule of down here this is for the
new baby so I at cell is pregnant again
I move the implementation directly here
so
now the code looks a little bit nicer
but as a good programmer I also provide
the javadoc of course so this returns
true if the cell is pregnant and this is
a lot of writing i also have to do this
for this method and desire to see that
this clause doesn't have any java talk
at all so i just press ctrl alt and che
and which our dog is created for me and
this is a starting point for the javadoc
and now i can enhance javadoc as needed
and the plugin i used here is Jay outer
doc now Jay at the dock is based on
tokens and replacements I'll show you
the preferences here you have a list of
tokens for example ads build create and
so on and this gets replaced with this
text over here Jay autodoc has also
templates for the various kinds of
methods for example get your set to
construct the returns void whatever I
just demonstrate this with the clear
method you see that the token clear is
not known to check out the dog so I
added okay clear and replacement is
clear there this is for a method as a
prefix I press ok then i deleted javadoc
on the press ctrl alt and try and hear
the Javadoc isn't because you can see it
replaced clear with the cliffs the
neighbor
okay to get this clear I don't say that
you have to use J outer dr generate all
the Javadoc lot for me it provides a
very good starting point to enhance the
travel doc with the semantics as needed
the plug-in does even more it enhances
the search menu as you can see here
under 50 search I can search through the
code for a missing javadoc or incomplete
javadoc and I will do this and you see
that's here we have different classes of
different elements which don't have any
Java doc for example here you see it is
a swim method there is Java doc but the
parameter is missing so i just press
ctrl Alt + J and the Javadoc is
completed with this additional text here
now can it enhance it and say this is
the zoom factor okay so as a good
programmer I also write test cases so i
will add a test case for my newly added
methods this is pregnant and is dead so
let's implement this cell object on the
test new cell and three dots of the
coordinates now i have to set the number
of neighbors this is a bite assert this
is that this returns to 40 neighbors the
cell is dead okay so let's run this
you see that is steady screen and is
pregnant fails due to that there is no
implementation here yet so i will also
test for other values 1 2 3 4 and is
that should return false for two and
three so I run this again yes is that is
still green and is pregnant still
falling so i will add the test cold here
again have to set a number of neighbors
first zero then served false out is oops
is pregnant
so let's test this okay all green so i
go for the other values on two three and
four and is pregnant I think it should
return true for two neighbors oops
obviously not r 3 i'm sorry okay all
green fine i know that there are better
ways to structure this case is then i
did here but this is not my point my
point is that i have to run the tests by
hand each time i change the code and
sometimes I'm lazy and I don't run the
code I don't run the tests and hope that
the integration server then we'll run
the test for me afterwards but
fortunately there is a small plug in
which release me from running the tests
by hand so I will do the same as I did
before first I go to the sailcloth then
I say are the test clause for the method
is pregnant and this dead you see here
that i already have here some source
code marker and again down here i have a
red bar which indicates something is
wrong and also in the problems you have
two errors which says assertion error or
not yet implemented obviously the tests
were executed in the background so i
will add the implementation here
so neighbor this is a byte 0 assert true
out is that and as soon as I save my
file you see that the source code marker
is gone at this one here also one is
still here so i will add the other
values 1 2 3 4 5 I see that this should
return false so here false i also add
the implementation here
insert false is pregnant and again for
other values 1 2 3 and 4 and it should
return true for three so now you see
that the bar down here turned green
means all tests are successfully and I
didn't have to run the test by myself
because the plug-in I used here is
infinite test and the infinite test is a
continuous test runner so each time I
change my coat infinite tests rounds all
my tests in background and directly
shows me the feedback if something is
wrong or not for example when i change
the correct implementation of is
pregnant to a faulty one and they save
this you see here the red bar and you
see here the assertion error in the
problems you and I think can double
click on it and I see that this
assertion here is causing the failing so
I change back my correct implementation
and then it turns green again okay let's
check the time okay I still have few
minutes left so i will show you another
plugin
sometimes I have to need that I need the
physical location of a of a file and for
this I usually go to the properties and
then I copy here this location ctrl-c I
start my Windows Explorer paste the line
remove the class name here and then
press ENTER and then I'm see this
element in the file system the same
applies when I have to open a common
she'll just paste the cough remove it
and then Here I am but there is an
easier way I installed here a plugin
which is called path tools and with two
well if this plugin I can directly
navigate to the physical location in
with the windows explorer it's also
possible that I open a common line the
same applies oh I'm directly in the
correct directory and this plugin also
provides the possibility that I can cope
and copy the path in various flavors for
example just the name half slashes or
backslashes it's also possible that they
can add constant commands as you can see
here for every command you want to go
for and this is very handy so let's
switch back I'm sorry let's switch back
to the presentation
here you see the various plugins i
showed you before the quick bookmark is
the plugin for the bookmarks infinite
test was one of the last ones this is
the continuous test runner Jay out the
dog is for the generation of the javadoc
Mouse feed is the plugin which reminds
you for the keyboard shortcuts deeper
crystallization is this graphical
representation of the heat half tools
was the last one diver was the one with
the sequence diagrams and cronin was the
plugin with the debug review this is
earn time-traveling typically or
postmortem debugger the plugins you see
here are open-source except one kronole
is a commercial tool but the license is
not very expensive when you're looking
for a particular plugin you can go to
the marketplace eclipse.org that's the
place where you will find all the
