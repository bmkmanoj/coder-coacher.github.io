New York City, I'm Bob Rhubart with the
Oracle Developer Community and my guests for this segment are Pratik Patel and Travis Reeder.
Gentlemen, welcome.
Thanks for having us.
Tell me about serverlessair.com.
Serverlessair.com is a new website and portal that I'm putting together
with videocasts and other resources around serverless technology.
I think it's really important to have resources like this,
specifically around serverless, because it's still very young,
there's a lot of action in the space right now,
the tech is moving along at a very fast pace.
So I think it'll be a great resource for people to kind of come and check out
what people are thinking what people are building and things like that.
What's Travis's role in all this?
Well, I'll let Travis introduce himself.
I'm Travis Reeder. I'm an architect at Oracle,
and I'm working  on the FN Project,
which is an open source serverless platform.
So you can take it and run it anywhere you want.
There are lots of different projects that have been spun up
in the last year or two around
serverless,
so that's why I think having something like serverlessair.com
and doing these interviews with the people who
actually build these projects is a great
idea,
so that people can get it, instead of second hand,
you get it straight from the horse's mouth.
I'm not saying that you're a horse, Travis.
Travis is not a horse.
One of the things that's going on in the serverless space
right now is that a lot of people have different opinions on what is &quot;serverless.&quot;
Right.
So tell us how you define &quot;serverless.&quot;
There are two sides to it.
There's the developer, and then there's the operator.
So I think there's two kind of groups of people.
For the developer, I think the easiest way to think of it is,
you don't think about servers.
There's a lot of servers there, but as a developer you're not using them,
you're not thinking about them, and the service provider takes
care of all that for you, scaling and all the management.
On the other side of things, the operators,
the people running those services, are dealing with a lot of servers,
They're there, you just don't think about them.
So serverless  is not truly serverless.
It's just in how you define the server.
Yeah. Like I said, as a developer, you don't really need to think about it at all.
You just use your tools, deploy it, and you forget about it at that point.
Right, let the magic infrastructure take care of all the busy work.
Yeah, the magic infrastructure.
So tell us a little bit more about the FN Project,
the project that you work on.
OK.
How did is start? How big is the team? What's the gestalt around FN Project?
So how is started was, my previous company was called Iron.io,
and we were building serverless  before serverless was a thing.
So  we were doing that for about seven years,
and then obviously some big companies
came around and started doing similar stuff
I've heard of that happening.
Yeah, and now serverless.
So last year our team joined Oracle to continue this project,
which is actually a fork of a previous
project we're working on called Iron Functions.
We continued that project.
The team is about 30-ish people right now.
I didn't realize there were that many people working on FN Project.
There's two sides of it.
There's a building out a service side of it, and the open source side of things.
So there's quite a few people.
There's over 50 contributors to the open source project on Github.
What's the license for FN Project?
It's the Apache 2.0 license.
The standard Apache 2.0 license, so you can use it however you wish, more or less.
Yeah, you can take it and set up your own private serverless cluster.
Is anybody currently offering a hosted FN Project service yet?
I know that you can take FN Project and run it on your own infrastructure,
or you can you know throw it up on Oracle cloud or AWS or whatever you want.
Is anybody offering a service yet for that?
Not yet.
We will hopefully be the first one unless someone beats us to it.
Ok, I got you.
Do you know approximately the timeframe?
Let's say hopefully this year.
Hopefully this year.
So hopefully in 2018 there'll be a hosted service
where we can just use the command line FN Project tools
and push it up to Oracle Cloud or whatever.
Yeah.  It should be a nice experience.
You know, the FN run and local development stuff.
Speaking of differences between our project, since it's open source,
you can run it locally and test locally and develop locally
and get like the full experience on your local machine,
and then when you deploy it you just you know it's all going to work.
It's just an FN deploy and choose your cloud or choose your service provider,
and it's up and running.
How can people find that on Github?
It's at http:/github.com/fnproject/fn
That's the main repo.
We also have http://fnproject.io/ if you want to go there.
You can link to it from there.
Tell us how FN Project is different than the other stuff that's out there.
Let's use a specific example like OpenWhisk,
which you're obviously familiar with.
The big difference is that the big providers aren't open source.
But if we want to compare the open source things, there's OpenWhisk,
there's OpenFaaS, which is another popular one.
And there's a couple others.
Compared to OpenWhisk, we've tried to keep it very simple.
You can get up and running really quick.
It's written in Go, so it's nice, just a
single binary that you can install and run.
OpenWhisk is a little bit more complicated to get going,
a little bit more complicated to use.
I think we have a really nice user experience.
Right, a nice experience there to get up and running
and basically start building with FN Project  very quickly.
Yeah, OpenWhisk has been around for a lot longer,
so they have a lot more or tooling, a lot more stuff around it, which is nice.
But hopefully we'll catch up to it at some point.
What platforms and programming languages does FN Project support for developers?,
Java, JavaScript, Go, etc?
We're container native, so you can actually write your functions in any
language, if you want, if you know how to package them up
and you know what the input and output's going to be,
then you can use whatever you want.
We have five or six FDKs, function developer kits,
that make first-class support for Node,  Java, Go, Ruby
I think I'm missing one there.
You don't support Perl yet? What's up, man?
We don't have the Perl FDK yet.
But you could write one in Perl as long as you...
So you can extend the FDK for any  programming platform/language that you want.
Yeah, we call it &quot;Bring Your Own Docker File.&quot;
OK.
In fact, if you're using the FN CLI tools and there's a Docker file there
we'll actually just use that Docker file.
So you can still use the tooling and stuff.
We won't know what language it is and do the extra stuff.
But if you use the CLI you don't even really have to know that you're using Docker.
Like if you don't bring your own Docker file and you use our CLI tool,
we'll generate nice boilerplate code for you  in whatever language.
We'll package it up in your container and you don't even have to
know that it's Docker underneath.
Yeah, it's a nice experience.
One of the challenges right now in the serverless space is because
it's so new that there are lots of different definitions of what serverless is.
There is the Serverless Manifesto, which  has a list of things that help define what serverless is.
But what do you say when people come to you and say,
&quot;The FN Project is not truly serverless because it's not like Amazon lambda,&quot;
&quot;it's not completely hosted and blah blah blah.&quot;
What do you say to those folks who say,
&quot;This isn't exactly serverless by the
definition in the Serverless Manifesto&quot;?
Again,  I think it's whichever role you're speaking from.
If you're the developer, for example, say a business took this and
wanted to set up a serverless service on their private cloud.
They could set it up and then their developers or
their employees can start using this thing.
And again,  they're not thinking about serverless.
I mean, behind lambda is a whole bunch of servers, right?
So the same thing, but now you can do it yourself.
You can set up your own lambda-like service using our product.
And eventually there will be the ability to just use,  for example,
the FN Project already hosted on Oracle cloud or wherever.
That's right.
So we can take that completely out of the equation,
where it's like you don't have to have your own set up
and your own servers that you manage blah blah blah.
You can, hopefully from the command-line, just do F and deploy and point it to
whatever your instance or token or key
is for the hosted instance in the cloud.
Exactly.
And it'll all be scalable.
One of the things in the Serverless Manifesto is that the lambdas or
the fast applications just auto-scaling...
Basically everything is done, right?
A lot of scaling load balancing, etc, etc.
So all that stuff will be there.
Absolutely.
And even if you use the open-source product, it does the same things.
It auto-scales the functions themselves independently of everything else.
So if one particular function is getting a lot of traffic,
the FNLB,  it's our special load balancer,
will actually start putting that one particular function
on multiple nodes until it can handle all the traffic
and then bring it down, too,when the traffic goes down.
So it will auto-scale up and scale down.
Yeah.
You may not be able to talk about this,
but I'll ask the question anyway.
One of the things with, for example, 
Amazon lambdas is that your function is
not necessarily hot or alive. It may go dormant.
What's the strategy that y'all are thinking around that?
Is it going to be that with FN, even its current incarnation,
do the fast apps go down and go dormant or they're always on?
Give us a little bit more detail around that
and what you're planning as it rolls out into the cloud.
Currently, if you're using hot functions we have the called function format,
which is actually one execution per request, which is slow,
but it's really easy to get started and to understand what's going on.
If you go to a hot format like our JSON format or our HTTP format,
then the function container will stay alive.
The default is 30 seconds and then it'll
kill it off
if it doesn't get any activity for 30 seconds.
So yeah, it'll stay up for 30 seconds, and we've done benchmarks
and it's it's very similar to the performance of your own API as well.
So it performs very well.
The hot functions, again, when you have a big cluster of them, too,
our load balancer will --
this is the main reason why we actually have our own load balancer --
any requests to a particular function will try to send that same
request to the same server, so it always hits a hot container if it's available.
As I said, if the traffic starts scaling up it will send it to two nodes.
Then you'll have two hot containers and then three,
and then once it can handle that it
won't start scaling anymore and it'll
scale back down once there's no more
traffic.
So we do have the concept of hot
containers and their performance is
really good.
I know that, for example for Node and for Go,
the hot versus cold isn't really that big a deal because
those things start up like that, right, and I think for the
folks who are interested in using this or any serverless implementation because
this issue is not specific and that, if you're using Java, it takes a
few seconds for the JVM to spin up get everything going.
Is there any tech or anything around that to mitigate that JVM startup
time so that when the first request comes to a cold instance that it pops open faster?
Because right now what people do, for example, is
like on AWS lambda, they'll just set up something which pings it so it's always warm.
Is there anything that y'all are planning to mitigate that kind of thing?
That's a tough problem because the whole concept of serverless is you don't want them running.
The whole idea is you're trying to share this
infrastructure amongst a whole bunch of
these functions and that kind of defeats the purpose.
But they do it because there's a long startup time.
In Java in particular that's not something we're in particular working on,
but we know the Java team is very aware of the serverless thing and they're working on
making the JVM itself start up a lot faster.
I think one team is working on a way to make it more like Go,  where you just kind of get
a binary and the JVM is built into it
and stuff and it can optimize and start
up really fast instead of loading up the whole thing.
It'll  only load up things it needs and stuff like that.
I guess with the modules in JDK 9 we can slim down the JVM,
make it really really small so you'd have to
load all these extraneous classes that you don't need.
That's a good first step.  There's a lot of work on their side
going into this Java thing,  because
of things like serverless becoming really popular.
What's the single most important thing for developers
to remember about serverless?
There are  no servers!
It's the magic infrastructure!
I think a lot of people get caught off guard by how simple it is when your developing.
They're like, &quot;Where's all the other stuff?&quot;
&quot;Where's my HTTP server?&quot;
&quot;My web or my app server and all the stuff that I have to plumb together?&quot;
I mean, just start with something really small and simple
and get it running and and go from there
and you'll realize that your code can be really simple.
I think that's probably the thing that people have to wrap there heads around.
If they come from a building APIs and apps before serverless,
it takes little bit to kind of wrap your head around what's going on.
Keep it simple is probably a big thing.
The K.I.S.S principle is good for any
question,  I think.
That's right, yeah, yeah.
Keep is simple, stupid. It doesn't matter what you're doing,
especially when you're in programming or tech, keep it simple.
I try to live by that rule.
I don't always follow it,  but yeah.
You heard it here first.
