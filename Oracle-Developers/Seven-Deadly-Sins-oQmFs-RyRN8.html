I'm quite a little bit impressed that's
an unusual number of people for war
stories talk but that's actually are you
are you going to hear today just let me
ask a quick few questions to get a grasp
of about you who's running java ee
project ok that's somehow expected who's
using latest glassfish for ok three ok
jboss later seven six five whoa anybody
below that ok the rest is using tomcat
our stuff like that ok websphere the
commercial ones congratulations feeling
with you i also have some contents for
you today ok let's see how how that all
comes together it yeah as I said it's
basically a war stories talk so we get
to have a good conversation going
hopefully shorts lied about me you
probably came across my nickname on
Twitter I'm my fear coming from Germany
working for a comparable a small company
we do independent software development
for customers and I work for a research
department that's called apply
technology research so the idea behind
that is not to sit in an ivory ivory
tower and draw some nice architecture
slides but just help out in our projects
and it happens to be that I'm around 30
to 40 projects a year and I'm assisting
them helping them as an architect as a
developer as a firefighter or whatever
so you probably have to handle one or
two projects and yeah the worst thing is
that people tend to know me when it's
too late or close to too late so I am
not really well no well known in the
company in general but all the big ones
know me so ok here we go
intentionally short the idea about that
talk came up a couple of years ago
actually so I was just looking for a
good way to categorize what I've seen
out there in the field and I wasn't
really willing to draw architecture
layers or whatever to guide you through
that and show you JS f code from our
projects which actually wouldn't be
possible at all because all of that
confidential stuff so i decided to
categorize that along the seven sins and
seven cents is so nice to have been so
many great visualizations about seven
cents but it all comes down to be family
friendly today so i mean it's not that I
wouldn't been willing to but it's
probably battle I get it who of you
didn't know that the main characters of
the Spongebob series actually were
modeled after the seven cents it's true
it's definitely true so here we go we're
talking a little bit about those phantom
funny guys today and I'll definitely
walk you through a little bit of
technology but please don't expect code
honest and open it's definitely not in
that torque today you're free and open
to ask questions if you have something I
would be curious to hear them and answer
them so let's go this usually is the
world how we see it as developers so
complicated probably especially if you
have to work in the complete stack from
top to bottom but it's only part of the
story isn't it I mean there's a lot more
behind that and I usually have to take a
look at the complete picture so it's
actually not only what we have at hand
on our day-to-day job but there's stuff
running that there's hardware there's
infrastructure that's networked and I
just recently got called for a project
which had some serious issues with
application performance how funny I mean
that never happened before on a Java EE
engine that anybody have you never had
performance issues
okay I see a lot of that so yeah it all
came down to some curious things a good
example we were running on a nice 46 bit
infrastructure latest Linux latest
application servers but somebody and I
don't know who that was put it 32 bit
jvm and production and they were running
at two gigabyte yeah cool coo coo coo
let's talk about lust so I mean this
little guy is always ready it's always
there he's his real cute person that has
that passionate desire right so whatever
comes up in new technology he's the one
picking it up and he'll stop at nothing
right scholar a month old let's get it
into production so that's exactly the
way spongebob is doing things and yeah
where do we see less than projects my
number one thing is the golden tab um I
know that most of you probably work on
an agile way so you try to prioritize we
do big projects and some of our
customers still use some less agile ways
to specify things and that ends up with
real big bunches of documentation and
nobody is willing to prioritize anything
and I want that on a fixed price basis
okay that's one of those few things
where I start looking at when I see
troubles coming up so I have a look at
the list of things we in our agile
projects we actually look for golden
tabs priority prioritize them away so
that we don't have a problem with them
afterwards if we have some time or money
left will do them then so my number one
tip for you is don't be done plastic I
at that point technology those are
necessary
features features that make them useful
and today should be fast and easy to use
but it's definitely not too special
budget stuff try to come down what is
really all about so get a good private
organization the drawback is we've been
starting in there aren't any metrics
flavors we all have different ideas
about it these his thing is fancy
linking heart but all the other things
are probably not that obvious so spend a
little bit of time on tip from me come
up with some metrics you probably all
know classes and gets the running I
still see a lot of other person has
actually tried earlier so in general
what never in might come across miss
that's layering interfaces whatever you
see in the face issue really
project today so it's a good shot
whatever you can imagine solutions
probably wish critical requirements
I love to say they're so you can check
that thing you're trying to use which
promises to solve your problem actually
it's just code project run by God my
labs favorite example is prime basis of
ok wife you on the others take a look
it's the number one component for
Jason's couple of years back they are
they were hardly know they were run by 0
1 match kind of thing so project me did
all that that's thinking in a while I
was like they used to make things to
probably know that was I decided to go
down the street making the days what we
basically did is we management is very
so we signed all the sources down to our
repository make sure even if you try to
use
treated as part of your project if
you're unsure it's not like you
shouldn't use it at all make good
decisions of my words that will appear I
cross that is that of having big
probably problems why am I really really
big troubles very little in memory never
been design just so like I know guys
decided to make role of frameworks area
so whatever is out there that stay
chilled and using yep
the security market yeah that's my hobby
horse horse that's what I expected that
was me somebody security refinement
screaming running away especially the
Java platform sound all that common
security libraries that promise to solve
everything a security is too basic for
most of things not race for years so
that's probably some basis but please
especially not various solid-state virus
he's the next Gary Gary answer this is
ripping things when I come projects
first person I guess the answer right so
nobody ever has written know that kind
of things you know that we're running
out of memory we tell that me down in
the response times be easy but nobody
election too careful designing working
application operator look to your
performance
okay mom I know that that happens to
fight a lot because projects are small
getting chip I believe something big
sites on the web the big problems that
they would take care for that so and I
always try to separate right no he okay
Oh WebSphere developer performers one
how long does it take to start up let's
talk about that server are they down to
five minutes already I don't know I
don't have to but actually did a
horrible first edge pro turns out we
have round trips from a raid upon the UI
that we're close to 60 seconds and you
know how web developers work license for
that so that'd be lovely
there are also other things are any of
you surprised okay quite a few yeah I've
seen that especially from just one hour
don't try checking stuffing I mean
obviously bunch of things human fix the
problems that is they have some decent
project product I really we had a proud
man so if anybody comes up try to push
you just let for the next machine on it
convince them to not cashing on so it's
awesome soft references caches like it
was warming all the time to fill out
some references thankfully could but the
cash had to be there because it was the
back of the rights management the next
is not only checked it but one and a
half
nearly every second so the cash is all
uses quarryville regular basis just too
small JB apne the database going crazy
now that's where we are free they care
about memory please knows how much
memory actually communications running
in mountains turn around I mean come on
that's unbelievable I me know which one
each no you probably but that's that's
where i met you at least two planes de
out of the box down first java 7u40 pass
the java Mission Control sweet in it to
get a nice memory whatever you like to
do if you switch off like recording mode
I know that's Lori you have to practice
on that one because it's not obvious but
it's worth it just to figure out what
people are doing echoes and the other
ideas napping comes with a new profile
so it's in there Donald and stuff it
includes probably glass fish or whatever
you could profile things like Wesley
yeah that's just captions or other nice
libraries and really suck up a lot of
member optimize their let's say things i
had another nice we have ice rich client
application and that consumes roughly
one-and-a-half gigabyte of ram with
neutral you was kind of product and that
they we're going to switch over to
probably working somebody so i think
that's that's simple map you know what
the question was they asked me to find
some fancy javion parametres two things
that don't try to push everything up
implications there try to make you feel
everything
they could probably they're getting
better in that last year's most them
they never did so please it's not the
fact that we're running in now that
makes the application comes in last
memory so there are plenty of really
into you know them what's the average
size 2 3 4 5 probable I guess um but
recently I've seen sessions grown up
yeah okay that happens actually was kind
of reference easy so I always recommend
having it goes along with that really
make that part of your development
process and I've responsible every
single way to and
we are all perfect things I believe
that's impossible but at least profiling
you should be able to use okay setia
lifetime slides are whatever interest
rtl sizes one of my favorite has
weakened rican to you about um it was
very comfortable with this is not his
knowledge about the application server
okay that's fine definitely people apart
so it takes you a while that's probably
the reason for this is back to base
class project just for how we're feeling
about those two things it took me quite
a long time find all the things to
change work of the ransom so do that
what else is being with parking breath
yeah ready nobody thank you okay you
shouldn't you're not allowed utility
I have that requirement once a week
somebody once for something it's more or
less much like but anyway not happen so
you say to them yourself sweetheart rap
you know what's wrong let's see you
don't want to know about that guy that
it made if it's true who's using spring
any together oh ok that's that they can
you better not because of spring but
because I think that it's not a good
thing makes to compare only complicate
technologies together into one snack
that doubles the amount of information
technology especially alone springside
me I'm finished with all that things
about stuff I know that trying to be
better come up then try to sell me for
what for reason security libraries or
security another thing is everything
runs on the Jimmy answers just are and
everything slang whatever and they put
all that mixing technologies
you know what I really advise you really
careful of the kinkos my most favorite
everything actually is no technology
work when was the last time you visit
these course monitor of the year one
year two years neither for you yes okay
one at least we do that with training on
the job if you're up younger and all the
developers we change teams we try to
keep track I know what most companies
believe that it's up to here is a person
in your spare time to learn about that
if you freaky like me that you've roped
into java you 24 hours a day rolling
brought from technology by the pool so i
definitely encourage just the right tool
for the right job thing I probably exam
you all know that I just want you Angela
room again just to make sure
we brought so cross that currency never
don't forget about maintainability
requirements that usually don't get
tests integration I don't know depends
there many projects we have some really
solvers they have totally different
meaning for maintainability one
application you shipped one customer
that actually was very rare lives like
product so basic thing to remember is
that cool I city is going back to that
plus the interfaces everybody I just
snow up there so sorry now it's English
actually better if y'all seen that
phantom samples from I don't know spring
mass that happens to me I actually able
to find so if that is no requirement to
it like this mr. crap yeah try to change
now remember somebody wants to call me
in as a resource probably it's not an
issue to point that out okay i'm here
i'm a person i have skills i have
knowledge of comedy shows and now what I
see is Chinese hardware the problem
he'll ever know really not but it's
still happening nah yeah I mean stand up
tell them it's worth we're not getting
short time it's not possible right so
same is true for any kind of
yes is gone agile no we're not accepting
mortgages just prioritize go down the
fight matrix help them to the side and
that actually turn out to be you good
example in general manager of expression
in mine really this country's so when
you can show that women need when they
are trying to do they would listen
project was calling for Jim person you
were the reason we talked about Jeremiah
license structure 101 somewhere they
have an incredible light weight fast for
architecture decisions management most
architecture million things with cycles
wrong names modularity forward my
picture it's worth to prevent everybody
from breaking rules
I probably have some like the fact that
life event on 87 deg love you for all of
you you think which probably would be
loved you see that all those vendors out
there especially big ones use this this
bemuses to that profit specific features
looking for sitting
up search for him or whatever forward as
Bobby there are names yet actually has
an x in project plan for weeknight
that's getting better over the years but
still to Graham what I'm so you can make
trying to keep draggin that features our
naughty nuts from Charles friends tell
everybody we're stopping here it's worth
it it's not laziness its instability its
refusing like city and makes it better
project so tell them we use oh that that
was stressed for companies that
everybody is probably not I start it's
probably getting worth yeah
he might came up with you the library
has a foot after it you probably have
some co-chair like you netherlands or
whatever so that use thing is still
there but you have to but also reveals
only doing that job is making you suffer
and that you're not aware about license
is a good thing to do gary is doing peer
reviews yes great thank you i drop point
um i have rough time introducing that it
not only is he Garrett knows Garrett
pura musica reviews so have a look at
that one that can definitely make it
work process to review code changes
before they go Sammy yes miss honey okay
no
so I highly encourage you if you're not
using that try to set up when I'm
talking about automation application how
to make sure 11 Richmond works and not
only from we know that we are also bunch
of classes bunch of features so this is
a good what I like the most and nobody
does security test is doing explicit
security test don't reviews that's what
happens not so you gotta go review
according to these where I'm talking
about for that unit test things not what
we have right scale just right yes the
right writes every love you unit just
honor the security features were them
their tools out there why are you IAM
wrap that make it possible for you to
have remain in that direction so you can
faciliate whatever darling we have some
offering terms of just test
make decisions in that team especially
if you're working in that agile set up
kind of things so it's not you that
doesn't care for the build when it's
broken fix it nobody else will do so
just be a little bit more responsible if
you're not already doing it let's take
it in front of our headquarter community
so that somehow sighs if you have any
questions I'm happy to receive them if
not that amis between you and coffee so
I just give you a couple of time nobody
thanks a lot here you yeah come on come
