New York City I'm Bob rue Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
one more interview with one of the
session presenters from today's event
this guy tell them who you are
Christian Shea dotnet guy at Oracle tell
me a little bit about your session what
did you talk about the session was how
to get the best performance with your
net application and how did how to write
highly available dotnet applications the
types of things that we focused on in
that session well one of the big ones I
guess one of the key takeaways from that
session was dealing with connections
because one of the most expensive things
you can ever do in an application in
general is make a connection to their
database so we talked about how to use
connection pools how to monitor
connection pools to to watch how they're
being used to make sure you've got
enough connections in them and how to
keep ahead of the garbage collector in
net because the garbage collector and
done that's responsible for throwing
things away and if you got a connection
in its set and it's not cleaning things
up fast enough the leaves connections
lying around that was just one example
of some of the performance questions we
we talked about and the other thing we
talked about was how to create highly
available applications so what that
means is if you've written an
application and everything's going great
and then the database goes down what
happens or if the network goes down do
the users get flooded with errors if you
want your app to be highly available
what you want is for the end user to not
even notice that the database went down
with an tcp/ip connection went down so
we talked about how to do that and one
of the things we talked about there was
a database feature called application
continuity an application continuity
which is a newer feature basically
replays if the database connection goes
down it basically connects to a
different instance of the database and
replays your transactions replays what
you're doing and basically does that all
behind the scenes so the end user
doesn't even know that the database went
down
and so we talked about it but that was a
lot of other things to help dotnet
developers write a highly performant
highly available application so let's
talk about that for a minute what does
Oracle cloud offer for dotnet developers
so one of the things that people did ask
me about my session you know is if I
want to get started with dotnet and I
you know I don't want to install the
database I just want to use a database
up in the cloud how can I do that or if
I want to take my dot in application and
I want to put it in the cloud in a
dotnet app server how can I do that
and so that's an easy question because
we've actually written white papers that
show how to do that step by step for
example we have Windows 2012 instances
available in Oracle compute on Windows
and so we have white papers that say
here's how you spin up windows in Oracle
compute and here's how you turn on the
app server and here's how you push your
app from Visual Studio up to that Nets
app server and on the database side how
do you configure SSH so you can have a
secure connection to the database how do
you create wallets another way to
authenticate to the database these are
all white papers that we wrote to make
it real easy you can just step by step
through it and basically get your dotnet
app running and the Oracle cloud right
away real easily what's on your calendar
you're going to be speaking anywhere
else good question actually I'm next
week I'm going to be in Washington DC
and I've already been doing this session
twice now so I did it in San Francisco
but we're adding another one then
watching TV so I'll be doing two
sessions and in Washington DC I'll
actually be doing a more beginner
session you know if someone's never used
net with Oracle before or not with
Oracle with any database you know what
are some how can they get going
using dotnet to write database
applications and as part of that demo
I'll also just go ahead and bring in the
cloud and say you know here's an app
server let's push your app up into the
into the cloud so you don't have to
install a database you don't have to
install an app server it's up in the
cloud so I'll kind of handle some
beginners to write an application put it
in the cloud connect to a database
and do it you know hopefully hopefully
it'll be really easy for them it will
also be reprising this session the best
practice session as well great well if
you're interested in attending that
session at work code in Washington DC or
any of the other sixteen cities left in
this series you'll find more information
at developer oracle.com slash code
you'll also find information on how you
can submit session proposals for Oracle
code events and you'll find a lot of
great content for developers thanks for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
