am a product manager in Oracle working
on NetBeans and with me I have your
honest viand I hit software architect
from Germany working also with netbeans
sometimes mostly so in this session
we're going to look at the topic of java
ee backends and javascript HTML 5 front
ends it seems in the past year is that
there's been a lot of interest in
javascript because javascript and it's
libraries have become richer providing
more features and you know css3 has
provided more dynamic and animation
related content and everyone seems to be
talking about javascript and HTML and
CSS and there are so many frameworks
popping out all the time like angular
and knockout and in the same way that
every other week a couple of years ago
there would be a new java ee framework
and new job e component library now it
seems like every other week there's a
new JavaScript framework so a lot of the
energy going on in the development world
seems to have shifted towards JavaScript
so without necessarily advocating
JavaScript as the perfect solution for
all situations we want to present to you
ways in which you can maintain your java
knowledge while still at the same time
leveraging the new power that javascript
and HTML and CSS brings so how can you
combine those different platforms and
what the what are the benefits of that
one immediate benefit that springs to
mind is that typically within an
organization you have java developers
and you have javascript developers and
it's pretty cool being able to combine
those different departments and
different skill sets together within the
same application and the extent to which
that is possible is what we want to talk
about in this session we're going to do
mainly this is pretty much the last bit
of text you're going to see you're going
to see some diagrams and for the rest
we're going to actually code so that you
see what this all means in practice
we'll start with looking
at the traditional way of creating java
ee applications just to provide a
context and the this this completely
typical standard MVC type structure
where you have a database on the one end
and you have a business tier which in
the Java EE world is defined by ejbs
typically and on the front end you have
a jsf and there are multiple component
libraries you could use but primefaces
is probably the most popular one in that
context and we're going to see a quick
demonstration of how these different
pieces fit together and then we switch
to your harness who will explain the
alternative approach via javascript and
HTML and you see a similar diagram but
then read down on the front end and the
back end stay staying essentially the
same and you see how that works in
practice so just as a frame of reference
the old traditional way of doing things
or not necessarily old but at least
traditional you can continue doing it
like this of course we have as a
starting point our glassfish server
started up which could be any kind of
server of course i'm just going to under
ploy what we have here we have a
database started up so i'm using a Derby
database here and we have various tables
in this database for example
manufacturing data so here are
manufacturers and we have customers in
the customer table and the relationships
between these and the task the typical
task with this kind of table is you want
to create a crud application at least as
a starting point and the nice thing
about Java EE is that it's relatively
easy for tools to at least provide the
skeleton the the starting point for this
because the specifications are very
clear about what should go where in
which specification so just to get
started we will have a maven application
and with a nice pump file defining all
of our project structure let's say we'll
use
it's a manufacturer manufacturer manager
I want to manage our manufacturer table
and our project is crated and here it is
we have a basic structure with an
index.html file we have Java EE on the
classpath and we have a pom file
defining our dependencies and so on
municipal maven working with a
manufacturer table of this kind and
working with Java EE the first natural
step you would take is to represent this
table in a Java class and this is
provided via the jpa the java
persistence annotation specification so
we can code this or we can just quickly
generate that class so we can generate
such a class directly from our database
so here is our database here is our
table and from the table we're going to
get a plain old java object we can
configure it to various ways specify
what kind of collections are used in the
code etc you can also come back to this
here and regenerate that manufacture a
class because more than likely our
database will change will add new
columns to remove columns from it so we
might want to come back and regenerate
the class and we can do that as well and
but anyway here is that class a and you
can see a long list of new dependencies
added to our to under stuff dependencies
which actually come from our pom file so
here is the maven palm which has now
been extended with new dependencies we
can look at it in a more graphic way and
see the relationships between the
different pieces and you can actually
print this out and send this to our
manager to prove how hard our work
actually is and how complex all the bits
and pieces are and here is the class so
here we go we have a plane Oh Java
object and essential
nothing is special here lots of getters
and setters but thanks to the Java EE
specifications the JPA specification and
the bean validation specification we
have a number of annotations for example
providing unnamed queries so we don't
have to refer in our code to SQL queries
which are kind of messy but instead we
can refer to these names instead we also
have rules defined via the bean
validation AP I saw the sides annotation
the column annotation so based on the
properties in the table these
annotations have been added into this
class and also suggested based on the
fact that what one of our columns is
called phone and another one is called
fax commented out is a suggestion for a
pattern so it's commented out so it's
just like oh if you want you can use
this so here's a pattern for recognizing
whether the users actually filled in a
phone value or effects value or an email
value so everything is here from the
point of view of the JPA specification
including the persistence XML file which
is the standardized way of defining the
connection with the database and things
like validation strategies and table
generation strategies the next step
would be from this to generate the next
level and we can go straight to the
front end which will generate the middle
tier as well by saying that you want JSF
pages from this entity classes so we add
this and from that you're going to see
here that a session beans so the
business logic will be generated but
also the front end will be generated and
it the front end we'll be using
primefaces components what you can see
also what is a typical question you
might have is well this is being
generated that's not so nice because I
want to have my own specific types of
logos and banners and whatever that's
fine you can customize a template so
each of the templates that are used at
this stage you can open and change and
you could customize it however you like
or if you're regenerating based on
changes in database you can regenerate
those two
and we will add to this primefaces and
we could it could be a faceless
richfaces we could be using jsps if you
want instead of facelets but nice thing
what facelets is that you can use CSS
and you say finish and the application
is generated so the applications front
end at this point so let's see some
background scaling is going on so we
have a manufacturer class that you had
in the beginning unchanged in addition
we have a controller class which is a
named which has unnamed annotation a
session scope so this is our ejb and
this also has a facade a further
providing further control over your data
and on the highest level we have our
primefaces components so if you use
prime faces you will know that there are
tags of this kind and we can read the
documentation that goes with it and the
final step is to deploy the application
so you know deploy it to the internal
browser so we don't have to switch out
of it and the server is up and the index
we're going to see the index XHTML first
with message hello from facelets as well
as links that go to the welcome page and
to a list of manufacture items so here
it's being displayed so here's the hello
from facelets just make this a bit
bigger and these two links and so here
all the when you factor items and this
is a prime faces application so this is
using a prime faces table and all of
these items you see here can be
maintained as well so we can chase these
so we can double click on them and get
further details and change these you can
see here we can correct new items you
can edit the selected item so when you
get a requirement to make
this kind of application you can say i
will need three months to do it and then
spend spend these five minutes doing it
instead and then spend the rest of the
time doing something different so this
is the traditional application using
java ee so back-end databases a
middle-tier ejbs front-end jsf and
primefaces so now we're going to see the
new alternative way that this can be
done and how to integrate JavaScript
into this back end of it thank you yeah
I'm a amazing very good wizards and
amazing stuff you will see it's much
harder to do this with angularjs from
the scratch I also use some Wizards here
I will not will not start with a note
pet yeah what will issue sure okay the
application i want to show is exactly
the database you've seen before and I
want to have a crud application only of
the customers the web style here's a
little bit different as a typical
Twitter bootstrap style are quite common
and the functionality is is is much more
limited that what you seen before in
primefaces it has currently knows what
sort of the tables and things like that
but that's yeah that's all possible with
html5 and JavaScript primefaces itself
it's written in prime in JavaScript so
the application can display customers
can you can update customers you can
edit information can delete the
customers and the architecture looks
like this quite similar to that what
we've seen before we have now a
stateless business here that's the
difference we have no representation of
the client state in the server that has
that's that's very popular because you
can scale
very good with this architecture jsf has
sometimes a little bits of drawback you
have a state on the server side and the
state can get big if you developers are
not aware of the problems you can you
can work around every every problem
chase f as well but mostly your
programmers which are when you have
problems which are not really
experienced they use pattern which leads
to a lot of session space and that's the
difference we have only a REST API to
the database and it runs on a je server
so in the first time I show you a
similar to curtain what what we have to
do to develop such a stateless Tia with
je and and tools like netbeans that's
very easy you don't have to program no
jsr the server side java representation
I think for enterprise customers that
would be the way to go and I work in
Munich for BMW and they exactly uses
architecture on the server side for for
their applications yes on the client
side i will use angularjs which you
heard about and i will not program its
by myself and I don't want use netbeans
at this point because programmers which
are the way which are like development
in JavaScript and and angular mostly
young people and they uses the hip new
tools and the hip new tools are Bauer
grunt and everything was runs about
animals of all kinds and I don't want it
to I will use the power as well and so I
use a different generator don't you use
netbeans i use young men it's a quite
common cheng again generator for angular
applications and in the end we put
everything together in a je application
so that you can distribute a single war
file to your customer and that's a nice
way that's a very nice way to develop
things and you see the html5 application
is quite separate it's quite good
separated from the rest if you have any
question I want to look at the source
code you find the source code at github
everything is working in this demo I'm I
have limited time I don't want to
develop every every part for example I
don't want to develop the edit form we
start with the customer list and and and
here we go the first thing I will do
similar to Guertin using maven
integration one word here netbeans is
very strong integrating with maven has
many tools have a lot of bugs with maven
integration I've I found none of them
here it works really well the name is
customer server and the customer server
uses glassfish that's always a good
point to start everything is bundled I
have not installed anything it's it's a
normal it's an honor installation after
you download classf ish so now I um yeah
let's let's start the server first
okay it takes some time the GlassFish
comes up and we have here hot deployment
what's really nice um and if I change
the name it's it's automatically
deployed here that's JavaScript to
developers very very like this feature
very and there are other tools as well
to to make this this is on the server
side this is not on the client side we
will switch to the client side later so
to expose rest web services you can also
use new tools but I'm sure if you try to
develop rest services on the enterprise
que je is a perfect choice there there
are many frameworks or if you want to
integrate in your held up if you if you
have to make it stable clustering
caching everything works is very where
we all done proven technology so that's
a funny with that I can directly exposed
web services from our data source and
now I use a sample data source which
comes with the NetBeans installation but
you you can connect to any other
databases well of you if you set set up
a data source here and I select the
customer table and was with it does it
generates jax-rs interfaces and entities
the good thing is both steps are just
separated so you can also generate
further entities and later your service
the service is perfect for rapidly rapid
prototyping here you see the customer
facade which all metals you need for
insert update delete
what I also really like is this section
where you can test your web services
directly in that means we have to start
first it builds again okay let's try a
test
that's okay redeploy
mmm glassfish has the problem
okay was successful deploy now it should
work let's try yes hit the page and then
I can test direct my on my web service
and you see the count of customers is
aid in the database and I can also tell
to find all methods which gives me xml
representation of of the database and
that's very good starting point for
begin with something you can actually
use this as a starting point for your
for your own applications and there's no
magic the generated stuff is quite
simple um when you look you only have of
the JPA entities generated that's the
code get ian shows and the nice thing is
they already a can marshal to chasten
and that's new we have X and L
marshaling annotations like the rigsum l
root element and this object can be
directly go go to the html5 page and
marshall is chasing automatically that's
a very nice thing when you call it in
the browser it's XML and our work system
works as well so and the other generated
class is as as as you see the rest facet
so um one more thing if you will try to
eat try it by yourself you have to deal
with one problem and the problem is on
course you need a cross-origin resource
sharing filter that means you can use
yeah
yeah yeah XML I would you be how could
be marshall / jason today's an
invitation yeah that is a question is um
how can how can the payload be rendered
in JSON citizen oh yeah that's a very
good question and glassfish I mean
you're not quite sure if it is for one
or force 40 had a new marshal in it and
the modular knows xml annotations and
marshes then jason from from the xml
annotated poachers yeah that's what's
the name you can we can change that
annotation in the manufacturer whatever
Stan what get you the source packages
extend next one so because customer for
cigars you can go down you can see that
you can either have X an algorithm yeah
that's both supported yes yes yes sir
okay that's one one thing I I have when
I develop html5 single page application
i'm normally in a different server
environment and a test serve on my
laptop if we see see now what I mean and
if you develop in on another tools you
have two URLs or you have two different
servers and the html5 stuff will
communicate with your server and it's
forbidden if you don't enable it it and
for that you you can you can directly
create a course sharing filter it only
sets some some header arguments and
without that you can't connect to this
back-end from some front-end like our
html5 client that we creating
yes okay now I can start again and
everything should should work for our
angular application okay let's start
with angular and i have here go i
typically a comment line and i will show
you the yeoman generator your yeoman
comes with plugins generator plugins
it's quite similar to maybe march types
and the yellow angular plugin is
maintained from the angular people it's
quite good and
so we we first I'm gonna empty directory
sorry we first have to create a
directory where we wear the coat fits in
it's called customer server customer
client sorry and here i will start again
with your angular and the your angular
generator askin question if i were with
CSS tools if I will have bootstrap yes
and some modules which angular provides
that the default here and it can
regenerate now I html5 project and the
night thing you can load this project
and netbeans and now we do do this
NetBeans has has a project html5
application with existing sources and
that's quite nice you can select you can
select here on the generated project
unlikely good finished and now i have
the project here if i try to run this
there comes an error error message
because the directory structure is not
fully compatible compatible with
netbeans at this moment the index.html
fits in in another directory
okay now I can start you see the
NetBeans chrome integration here um with
which you can debug your pages and can
break point a JavaScript code directly
in netbeans so you see I have some
problems with scripts and CSS that's
because my dependencies are not found
here as you see angular touch is not
found nothing is found and that's also a
thing limitation at this moment and that
means but but you can find a workaround
it's not not very complicated the
problem here is the dependency
management in a javascript application
in the angular application is typically
done with power a bower is a captain is
similar to maven and you can put your
dependencies here in a JSON file and
version it and you have also a new
feature and happens here important files
where you can say where are my Bower
components and to work around the
problems here I change the directory and
can directly call power install which
actually means download the whole
javascript stuff for me the every
library Annie jquery angular and
whatever and put it in a power
components directory here and now we
have here here the we fear the the
components if you get if i run again now
the app comes up that's a naked angular
yeoman generated app and that's a good
starting point to learn and to integrate
with your je application now I will
uses a starting point and changes a
little bit clean up something for
example I do not want to have contacts
here I will have a another name I delete
the footer and I have I also delete the
about controller for the about page at
the but I need to know about page at the
moment and the about view and clean up
here things a little bit and clean up
the main page delete it so now we know
we have a naked application it's the it
does nothing but it has everything on
board to develop angular every every
script script is in the main page every
library there everything what you need
to develop a simple angular happened now
I'll show you how this works we a single
page application contains of several
fragments HTML fragments for the views
and this fragments can be also generated
with a angular generator and it's called
route and for typically crutch customer
custom application we need 22 views on
two and two controllers 14 arm 14
ListView typically on 14 detail view is
getting showed up and I create one
customer list
and customer detail yes angular is a
model view controller framework so you
see here will be generated a page for
the controller viewer for the view and
javascript file for the controller and
what doesn't what this mean I show you
at the minute first I will have a button
to come to my new pages the main index
HTML 5 is my virus is mostly empty it's
a big import statement here and now I
will have a reference to my route which
is called customers and and it should go
to the customer list
now we have the button here and if I
click on the button this works already
yeah and this is not a server round trip
it's totally on the client yeah it's
very simple now but it's it's totally a
single page or web application now let's
look what we can do with this page on to
list to listen customers and here's the
structure we have the view the customer
the customer list view which is empty
and a customer this controller and the
customer list controller has some sample
code and I've prepared another sample
code which yeah which basically a very
simple thing it's a JSON array it's only
an array with two objects and each
object contains a name and an email and
that's all and the interesting thing in
this controller is the scope variable
this is co Binh angular combines a page
of you with date with logic or data and
if we put customers or whatever in the
scope we can access this variables in
the view it's similar to chase f backing
bean where you can access from your JSF
page on the attributes in the backing
bean and yeah we can try this I go to
the customer list page and and make some
HTML fragments here and use angular
angular expressions and that's also very
nice and familiar for us we will you we
have seen JSP we understand jsf and
angular looks a little bit similar
and I can access now everywhere ever in
the scope if I do this click on save
then I have to chasten of the adjacent
representation of my array and I want to
loop over the customers there's a
directive here you see netbeans also for
angular development like for jsf
development we have auto completion here
what's a knife thing and a will loop
over the customers and a right customer
in customers and then I can access with
customer dot name the name of my
customers and they appear here and I
don't want to show HTML programming here
so I've prepared something which is
basically exactly the same but makes a
table and make some styles and here we
are we have a list yeah that's the cheap
stuff every you usually find everywhere
as somebody who who does a HTML for you
ok the dynamic thing is here it's it's
the same you seen before yes so now i
will do not want to have static data
here so it's not funny this how to call
a rest service now the rest service for
real data and to call a rest service
it's quite simple you have to create
first a factory
and I created a factory a factory is a
object which are basically create
Singleton's and the code is now
generated and I can edit this code for
the factory
so and here here's an odd thing angular
has an object called dollar resource and
this dollar resource object is a
full-blown rest client and you can
configure also the rest client um if I
change would change my server a little
bit I I could avoid to to to set this
stuff you have only what you only have
to do is to provide a URL and to provide
what's what what's the names of your IDs
which becomes in your rest interface and
then you are ready everything in angular
is in a module the modular concept is
interesting because you can access
global variable everything must be fit
in a module and this module must be
known by our applications though I have
to edit to our global module list that's
the module dependencies of our
application and then you can use the
service and the name is customer service
and now go back to our controller
customer list controller I delete
everything here and say it's called
service start query maybe crisis you
systems with
no kid maybe chat window too
okay so okay now now i can say customer
service query and where does it come
here and that's also a nice construction
from angular angular has dependency
injection when you specify modules and
global global services you can inject in
every function you write an angular and
it's automatically provided here so i
inject the customer service and make a
query and here we are that's a
customer's of the database the other
stuff here in this application is 22 now
to to build a builder edit page create
page is quite similar so it would take
exactly the same time and we often
always finish with everything if you are
interested in the details you can look
at the solution at github the last thing
i want to show is now to combine this
application with our server and that's
really nice on your JavaScript developer
can now develop the customer client in
netbeans or they can use the command
line tools they are much too many tools
which can work work with the young man
generated angular stuff but in the end
you will provide a solution for your
customer and therefore we bundle
everything together and this can be done
with the main wall plugin
okay and here we are I say said we have
a resource which is bundled and the
resource directory is the app directory
we just created an outlined and and now
as a clean and built to my server
and can run the server
and now we have our applications I
written the GlassFish look at the URL we
are 80 80 and that's the GlassFish
application so and it's now je
application of war file which you can
which you can put in production like
every warfare before and it's a single
page angular application can you show
the front end in the maven project
structure the the front and in the maven
project search oh yes so where does that
web resources plugin where does it put
it with my other sources in me yeah he
and saw is the original sources and
copied and here they are copyright
direct in the in direct here at this
moment and there are some this arrows
the red arrows here are minor errors
because jquery here contains invalid
files there are some some files which
will be processed by magic it's not not
correct javascript in this files and at
this moment i cannot turn off the the
red light but but i think i'm sure in
the next version this will be will be
fixed so okay you have seen the heart's
a hard story to develop such a client by
yourself it's very popular and i think
it is a way for many applications you I
have to say most applications we develop
in unique for all customers are chase F
applications at the moment but you oui
oui java developer we have to find out
which which is a which kind of
application this this is quite good to
have a stateless servers it's
it's a real good thing for scalability
for development for decoupling and also
if you have separate companies which
develop the front end and the back end
this architecture has has its place but
it's it's it's not the architecture
which fits all or or or you should
switch immediately in every project to
angularjs and JavaScript development and
the other advantage of course is that
you could run that front end on the on
the phone or any other device now that
you're in HTML it could be deployed
anywhere it doesn't have to be part of
the Java EE application it can be the
separate application which you could run
on the on the browser so now you would
be accessing your java ee back-end from
from the device of your choice yes i'm
sorry
well mine I wouldn't be able to deploy
to a mobile device it wouldn't be able
to I'm not sure how I would it's not
it's not HTML yeah it would be purely
based on the browser on the desktop yes
it is it was shown at the beginning can
you share the URL of where the demo is
found yeah all the source code that
you've seen is in github and and I will
I will put this workflow where fiddle
everything together we'll also put up
with a video at youtube but it's not
ready but tomorrow at the end of the
tower 1 it will be available if you try
to look at repeat things yes take all
your various javascript all your
controller packs them up into a single
file that has those tendencies yes yes
yes they're grunt grunt scripts grant
tasks and they can minify everything and
pack together it's you it's that's a
typical JavaScript universum what I nee
what are used but I think this is one
thing that you'll find a disadvantage of
taking this route that there isn't the
unspecified and erds for front-end
development like there is for java ee
back end so you've got to figure out how
Bauer works together with grunt with
steel chairs with you know every other
week there's a new Jas how do you
integrate that into your existing
application you know that's a
significant problem I think with with
front-end development but it's at the
same time it's exciting because it's
it's own new and fresh and whatever but
it's not standardized anything can
anything that that you use could just
disappear next week as fast as it came
and and that's happened to you a lot of
JavaScript frameworks and libraries yes
does it support yes auntie does what
support us MP um how would you combine
JSON p with with angular when Jason
processing with angular
um I don't know yeah that's right you
can take them take them I could work so
it goes okay hi I can answer questions I
have work it for the same requirement
but the back end was Jason be I i have
used java ee 7 for application and using
Jason Java processing API to to convert
the output to Jason P the resource
mechanism library introduced in an
angularjs already ready to parse the
JSON and XML files so i don't have to do
anything with or edit library for for
angularjs and if you would like to use
the native jason inside your browser you
have the JSON library already integrated
with each browser because its standard
of w3c and there is two functions called
stringify and parts that convert from
json to string and string to Jason so
you can use it that's standard and
installed and every browser you can use
it thanks another question here
what do you mean mayor with framework
for web socket that's part of the html5
specification and today there was a demo
where they they did a chat in html5 and
and that's perfectly perfectly matches
with angular you can use web sockets in
your angular application but I'm not
aware of special support in angular for
web sockets I think this there's only
standard and you can use sure the html5
websocket classes to to make a chat
client also okay thank you very much for
coming and if you've more questions
please come up and we'll be happy to
chat with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
