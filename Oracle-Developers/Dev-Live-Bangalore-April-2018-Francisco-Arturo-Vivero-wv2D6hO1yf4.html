anzio again your Oracle code in
Bangalore and I'm joined by Francisco
Arturo
yes welcome Thank You Francisco you and
I actually first met up in Hyderabad
last week yeah actually you know what I
was doing a different talk about micro
services the Oracle wookie project but
here in Bangalore I'm doing something
completely different though somehow
related but are you talking about here
actually you just came from your session
right yeah I just came from a session it
finished 10 minutes ago
it's about Oracle event hope cloud
service which is managed kafka in the
Oracle cloud yeah ok cool so what was
the reaction like what was the actually
first describe a little bit more about
the session just you know what is the
Oracle cloud and what is you know Kafka
just to start out with the base of
course Kafka it is a distributed data
streaming platform basically you know so
it lets you handle big amounts of data
in real time that's what it does after
open source right it's an open source
project it was created by LinkedIn seven
or eight years ago but then it was open
source then it was taken by the Apache
foundation and now it's one of the most
popular open source projects out there
ok so I think the reaction was pretty
good especially because I I can see that
the developers here are very interested
in the topic so I got a lot of questions
I got a lot of interest and a full room
which was nice and my session is about
yeah I did a little explaining of the
concept of a Afghan and even driven an
architecture to then jump into the
product and really showcase deeply the
event hop shot service what what is it
for use cases architecture elites you
know how to get started with it my own
personal experience working with the
product so that that's basically what I
wanted to do in the session yeah
cool so what was the reaction like I
mean are developers using this a
developers already engaging with it yeah
pretty much I was surprised I got some
pretty technical questions you know
about the product and about how to use
it and about some troubleshooting which
means people are actually engaging with
it you know because they are running
into some roadblocks but but that's good
you know and some other people are
already using or are already familiar
with the concept of kafka you know but
it it was very good for them to realize
that Oracle has this even hopped up
service and that it's very easy to get
started with it
because this this component is this
kafka technology it is powerful you know
it it's powerful because it lets you
handle huge huge amounts of data you
know like some companies famous
companies that are using this this
platform are for example Netflix Airbnb
you know PayPal and and you know this
these companies handle very big flows of
that data very big streams in real time
so maybe you would think yeah it should
be complicated to get started with
something like Kaka but it actually
isn't especially with the even hot
service from Oracle it myself my
personal experience with a chart with
the developers it's in 10 to 15 minutes
you can you can get going and you can
already start testing some code towards
your Kafka platform and connecting your
applications so that's that's impressive
and I think that's that was very
well-received
that the message was very well received
by the by the people in the session so
it's simple and fast people can get up
running very very quickly yes very very
quickly and it's very intuitive I think
it's one of the newest services newest
offerings in the Oracle cloud in the
past portfolio so you can really see
that it has a lot of improvements it has
lessons learned you know better you I
yeah it's it's very good actually so you
mentioned earlier some other use cases I
know you just mentioned one before
what are some more use cases some
examples of implementations like you
know like what industry is what type of
applications would actually be using
this in our case in in my company Cisco
we have a couple of use cases where we
use these for example retail for example
from a suti color but also like the the
main one we have right now it with a
betting betting houses you know where
you place where some sports bets yeah
you place bets you know so so the access
scenario where you really need to be
able to handle the real-time stuff you
know because for example in sports the
game is flowing things are happening all
the time the score changes play your
goal Xena play goes out a goal is scored
and you complete bets on all of these
stuff and you as a customer as a bet or
you need to react you know if your team
just scored a touchdown
then maybe you place a bigger bet for
them to win the game you know you can
live do kumbhak life and if the if the
platform doesn't these things are
changing all the time
you know but something else about Kafka
is that it's an event log so it locks
the whole stream it lets you move move
back and forth in time you know if you
want to recall the data or replay the
data you can do it very easily which is
very difficult to do for example with
the traditional database that's the
distinction between
this service versus a traditional
database yeah of course because with
traditional database in these kind of
scenarios you know real-time
event-driven scenarios if you do the
traditional model then you're usually
working with cold cold data you know I
outdated data even if it's by seconds or
by minutes it makes a big difference you
know like in the betting example if if a
team just scored and you want to bet on
them you need to do it immediately
because the score can change right away
you know that me scores and then the the
kickoff comes and then that the other
team can score
in less than a minute you know and it
changes everything it changes the
context the complete context of the game
and yeah so this is where you need the
streaming platform this is where you
need to be able to access the data
immediately you know with no delay
that's the difference well where can
developers go for more resources to find
out about this yeah I think the
resources that we have in the Oracle the
Oracle cloud web pitcher are very good
it has tutorials videos I also shared
with the with the audience some extra
resources for example some vlogs from
the a-team the Oracle a-team some vlogs
from some trusted Oracle partners about
getting started with Kafka and with even
top cloud service of course Kafka is
also an open source project so there's a
lot of information I love code you know
a lot of resources out there so you can
you don't have to do it all by yourself
you can just download some of the read
these wrappers if you want to get
started for example with even tropical
service you just provision your service
you download some code base you start
working with it very quickly whichever
language you like like Java Scala an old
go you will find this very easily this
is the theme that keeps coming up this
kind of ease of use you know it's in the
cloud it's easy it's there I mean easier
if you're obviously in the business but
yeah
there's a theme that keeps coming up at
every single conversation we have so I'm
interested what some of the reactions
are from developers here at the
conference or even up in Hyderabad last
week yes you've obviously been about
yeah both of these conferences is you
know the room was you know full here I
can hardly hear you
yeah what are some of the conversations
actually that you've been having what I
mean people are engaged right it seems
like they're really engaged in this yeah
people are engaged I think it's it has
been very good that we are taking these
these topics in the conference you know
Kafka microservices IOT augmented
reality chat what people want to hear
about this but something good is that I
think when you hear about these topics
this okay that's cool technology but
it's like out of my reach you know as a
developer
it seems so complicated
it seemed so new you know but with a
cloud with the options we have right now
it's actually the other way around it's
totally within your reach you know you
just need to go in provision your
service and you can start using it in
very little time half an hour maybe 20
minutes and you're already using Afghan
you are already creating a chat water
they are already creating a micro
services as I showed last week with a
wiki project you know very little code
you actually don't need any
infrastructure because everything is in
the cloud we have serverless as well if
you want to do that so so as a developer
I think it's interesting times you know
it's you have access to a lot of cool
technology new technology but you don't
have to worry about a lot of stuff you
know like installing in your laptop or
getting a server or it's there it's
there for you to start using it great
super thank you very much Francisco for
coming over for our second conversation
and we will be back with more here at
Oracle code in Bangalore thank you bye
bye now thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
