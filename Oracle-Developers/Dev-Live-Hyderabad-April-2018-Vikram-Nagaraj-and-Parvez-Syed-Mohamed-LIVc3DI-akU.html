here at at Oracle code in Hyderabad and
and we're here to talk about augmented
reality I have two oracle engineers with
me here
so a Prabhas and Bikram welcome and so
what what is augmented reality so I'll
take that
so just a quick introduction I am the
director of product management for
mobile cloud service and we are the same
team that brought in the mobile backend
as a service we bought in chatbots last
year and we're coming up with something
called augmented reality cloud service
and it's pretty much you know when you
talk about augmented reality you have to
take a step forward into what's
happening to ask right after changing
apps are morphing and what's going to
happen in a few years is that you're
going to expect to see 3d objects in the
real world superimpose pretty much right
everywhere right and you know just as an
analogy right you could think about you
know think about things you are watching
on Netflix I and maybe you have you've
seen something called altered carbon
right and that the series just starts up
it shows a lot of augmented reality
experiences although that's pretty much
sci-fi it's probably not here for
another 10-15 years but we are getting
there right and that's awesome to
reality and I am pretty much focused on
the enterprise use cases for come to
reality
great okay hi Jim
so I am becoming a garage I work as a
senior manager in the sales consulting
centers at Oracle and so my team you
know we have people with various skills
and all across the Oracle cloud stack so
we build innovative demos that we can
take to customers across opportunities
and show how we can make innovation
happen using the Oracle cloud great ok
so we're gonna have some slides here to
articulate all this and we're gonna have
a demo so where do we go from here where
do we so should we talk about how to
build
okay yeah let's start with Lily naps
yeah so you know traditionally right we
build simple apps on on mobile
smartphones right now you have you have
a client app it will pretty much has a
few pages you interact with it by you
know by touch right and you know when
you when you think about alternate
reality what's happening is you know
there is no such concept of a mobile app
in that sense right now pretty much
expecting 3d objects in the real world
superimposed right and you're going to
interact with them by even asking it
direct you know questions right and
pretty much there's going to be an
animation the 3d objects is probably
going to morph and kind of give you some
information and you're gonna be able to
interact with it but much more much more
as a real-world sense right now you
probably just the same way you would
interact with a friend right so that's
the that's the end goal
so for these kind of experiences right
to make these 3d objects the process is
the same you use any other commercially
available tools to make 3d objects you
would use you know you you drink it you
would add textures to it you'd add
animations to it and triggers to it so
it's all the same thing but when it
comes to the mobile backend as a service
right to access all the information
that's in in assets in a system of
record of somewhere right that's where
things things need to be things are the
same for our reality apps too but over
alright these are 3d objects they get to
be pretty huge so they need to sit in
the cloud need to be downloaded based on
context right and on top of that right
when you want to trigger such an
augmented reality experience you're
hoping that you know the smart phone or
the heads-up display is able to
recognize what's in front of you to give
you context so you can kind of download
down to reality experience and interact
with it and you know there's this other
aspect of also being able to share you
experience in real time and we have
plans for that too I have one analogy
here which could be explained in simple
terms for example if you're walking
along the trails in the park and you
look up in the sky and you see a bird so
at that moment you're wondering you know
what kind of a bird is it is it an eagle
or a seagull or whatever so the
combination of the human eye and the
brain is actually deciphering what kind
of a bird
and it's getting information you know
whatever is available water whatever we
as a person knew about it and it's kind
of telling us that hey that is actually
an eagle let me know about it so we're
actually making the same thing happen
using the Oracle mobile platform today
so Oracle mobile phones have cameras
they can see things just the way Ric and
mobile phones have a lot of computing
power that is insufficient then we have
the Oracle cloud which has tremendous
computing power out there so the
combination of the mobile phone and
Oracle cloud can decipher what is the
image that the phone camera is seeing
and can tell is pretty much what kind of
about it is so in trigger actions based
on that right trigger information based
on that that's that's what we are trying
to build right now so I want to talk
about more use cases but I'm also
interested in what the feedback is here
from you know when you have
conversations here with these developers
what is their interest level and mcdhh a
so pretty much you know virtual reality
what has happened as you know there's a
lot of influence from the gaming world
right people started off paying Pokemon
go right and that has kind of you know
Moff down to becoming getting more and
more people involved in it right
they want to develop apps they want to
build apps oh I see a lot of excitement
I think the session that Nagaraja
become had today morning right was
pretty much fully packed right so
there's a lot of excitement here so it's
built in these apps fairly easy at the
moment it depends on what kind of
experiences you want to bring forward
there is an there's an element of a
learning curve for all developers right
and I think over the next few years you
know there's slowly grows marks on to
becoming more and more simple to kind of
build these expensive and that's exactly
the problem I want to solve ok great
emerging technology is always
interesting so we had a whole bunch of
people we didn't have time to take all
the questions for example so people are
always interested in trying to know what
we built how they built they want to
explore and learn more about what we
have to offer
super ok so can we see what our friend
here can do yeah sure
so I can actually talk about this
particular use case for sure so as
Purvis said augmented reality is really
hot in the industry and we expect a lot
of industries to transform using
augmented
reality over the the next few years or
indicate so but we want to actually pick
one particular use case where we thought
that AR is going to have a big impact
and we picked a field service so digital
field services the time term that we
coined at Oracle to refer to the
advancements in field service that we
can potentially take to our customers
leveraging the power of the Oracle cloud
leveraging the power of Oracle's IOT
cloud as well as Oracle mobile cloud
combined with augmented reality so what
we perceive is we believe that there are
four key stages to field service today
digital field service so the first thing
is you won't actually monitor an
equipment from a remote perspective
because not always it is practical or
cost-effective to send a service
personnel on site to check it out right
so today with IOT is no longer hype
today right you have several billions of
devices being connected to the Internet
ROI ot so with all the IOT data
available at our fingertips the
technician can pretty much monitor any
equipment such as the one that you see
out here that we built using Lego from a
remote perspective so what we're
actually focusing here as far as this
demo goes as so we are focusing on a
company that has several small grains or
forklifts deployed at very various
customer sites and so we are showcasing
a solution that where we can actually
optimize field service so we are showing
that using IOT cloud we can monitor an
equipment such as this a forklift from a
remote perspective using Oracle's IOT
cloud and a jet which is used to deliver
a web dashboard from a remote
perspective and then we are showing that
if the issue is really small and
commonplace such as updating the forum
where you don't really need a technician
to go on say to update the firmware if
we can do it remotely that could be done
as well using Oracle's cloud or if the
issue is complex not everything could be
resolved from a remote perspective if
the issue is complex for example a wire
has snapped
that's when you actually need a person
to go on site so that's when Oracle's
Field Service Cloud comes into play
together with Oracle's IOT cloud IOT
cloud basically identifies it's
intelligent enough to identify that a
power cable has snapped or a sensor
cable has snapped which is which is a
complex enough deal and then it locks a
ticket directly into Field Service Cloud
which identifies the nearest available
field technician with the right skills
to come and take a look at the asset so
we can show that all of this can happen
pretty much automatically without any
manual overhead in there and then when
the field personnel is on-site in front
of the equipment which is a forklift in
this case then we can use augmented
reality together with Oracle mobile
platform where the person can see the
IOT values and the circuitry inside the
the model and all that to help him you
know fix the issue in the shortest
amount of time possible with in the best
possible manner yeah we have okay what
are we going to see here Nia should we
also change this to full camera
okay sit down is it okay more into the
frame and all the way around he needs to
be there for the you have which its task
is to move object from one place to
another place so let me put this object
here and it ignites object and it moves
from one place to another based on a set
of instructions now this forklift has
got different sensors installed one is
this ultrasonic sensors and different
motors one is a base mode for our motor
and the lift motor so it's based on
instructions already fed to it it's
moving the object from one place to
another place it's detecting the object
the ultrasonic sensor is detecting the
object now now once it detects right
it's it lifts that are the object no and
it's performing the action
this move this movement is the set of
instructions is already fed to that
forklift now what happens is if there is
an system failure happens okay the
system failure happens means you like
let me pull out this wire here I pulled
out this wire there and now if you can
see that the light is gone here the
ultrasonic sensor has stopped working so
it's like anti system crash then the
once it cut it comes back to the normal
position and it will not detect the
object anymore
yeah so this shows that his life
so in the previous step I've removed
that cable right so now if I place this
here again the ultrasonic sensor which
detects has stopped working there is a
complete system failure happen here so
it will not pick that object anymore and
it'll not move it okay now there is a
complete system failure there should be
a ticket raised on top of it because
system is not working now this what we
have instructed this iot-cloud services
once there is a shoe there please write
to the ticket to the field service cloud
you know actually pretty much in real
time as soon as the wire has snapped IOT
is logging you ticket directly into
oracle field service cloud alerting that
virus snapped real-time technician is
identified in pretty much in real-time
was close to the location of the failure
and the person is already on the job is
on the way is dispatched here come and
fix it so can you show us what happens
when the field technician is here yes
now the notification will be sent to the
field technician saying that there is a
shoe
this is app for field engineer okay you
can see that if you can see the app
right there is a list of tickets for
this field engineer now as soon as you
plug that wire right there is a ticket
raised for this engineer and this
engineer can come to this location okay
and see the values okay now I'm going to
use this augmented reality to show you
the demo now that when the field
engineer is here right he can see if you
can see the 3d object has been
recognized as soon as I point my camera
to that object right you can see that
they are information onto the screen tap
screen so this can be done with any
variable device or any cam app in a in a
mobile phone so we have three
instructions here one is sensor
information one is the digital twin the
third one is a set of instructions to
repair that system as a field engineer I
want to know what is the information
what is what is going on with this
machinery so if you look at it right you
can see the battery information the
battery information and a gyro sensor
what is the angle of that hand
ro BOM now and different motor
information that as of know the motors
are not running so because there is an
issue everything is 0 the guy ro is 59
because the angle is at 59 and the
battery is eight point zero four okay
now the field engineer wants to know how
to fix that so you can do that using
augmented reality like send a set of
instructions which can this instructions
can load through a cloud service so if
you see this right the field engineer
will have a set of instruction to fix it
so basically bringing up the circuitry
beneath the machine so instead of having
to actually go through big catalogs to
understand how the circuitry inside the
air app is telling him how to assemble
and how to do
assemble the machine in real time this
is the real-time instructions yes very
good now you can see the entire digital
twin here where he will have a set of
instructions to load it like he can see
he can see how to assemble this entire
system also yeah Thank You Samba so I
think so so it's not just it's not just
one solution here so we have pretty much
shown that we can transform transform a
entire field so with using the Oracle
cloud today starting from remote
monitoring remote resolution optimized
dispatch all the way until on-site
resolution using augmented reality isn't
that cool that's amazing this is exactly
the use cases that our customers really
asking for right and you'll have some
proof of concepts made for them in due
course and we'll have live customers you
know we'll have live customer demos by
Oracle OpenWorld great yeah and of
course our field service is not the only
use case so we are working on multiple
other use cases as well tons of use
cases education right where students
want to interact and see a 3d object
right and there's construction there's a
nice IOT demo on how you would use
heads-up display by a made by the IOT
guys at work okay
and then a couple of other interesting
things that I read about as one is
furniture buying experience right oh
yeah the marketing experience a lot of
problems right it's Teddy there was
something on my LinkedIn feed which was
pretty much showing how you could buy
different flooring for your for your
house pretty much right so it's a real
difficult to kind of you know decide
what kind of flooring you need and it
becomes more complicated because you
can't really your brain can't actually
plays all these things in real time and
kind of either you can't actually make
that decision right so I augment reality
solves those problems yeah
so one other thing which is quite
uncommon of sports
have you read about AR in sports or not
yes bots is all about so if you consider
American foot
for example people so it's like so real
time you know so complex and you know
multiple ways of playing the game and
all that so players pretty much mark up
the rulebook and say this is our plan if
this is planet this is how we are going
to position ourselves you what is Plan B
this is how we are going to position
ourselves and attack the opponents
so if you're looking at using and
players already having a helmet which
has a wiser so if you can make it a
digital visor with information to lady
using augmented reality so they can
Earhart together with artificial
intelligence and all the power behind on
the Oracle cloud can instruct players
where to move how to move you know more
hat ten steps come back two steps 20
you're right I think several use case
it's extremely interesting yeah
really interesting all right great super
well guys thank you very much for coming
and you're here actually in the
developer lounge so if developers want
any more information they could just
stop by your booth you got a session
coming out today little bit about super
great well guys thank you very much stop
back again and we'll be back with more
interviews thanks bye-bye thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
