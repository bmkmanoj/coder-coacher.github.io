it's a bit too loud okay this session we
are going to you know give an update on
first kneel in Java API focus on
processing my name is kim inchul i am
the suspect vacation lead four days our
3724 test on processing api 1.1 in in
addict subtle you know also we joined
the top and you know he is a expert
group per member for the specification
so both of us would try to give you an
update on what we have been doing you
know through the API for JSON processing
and I assume that you guys you know
would have some knowledge about you know
today's on p 1.0 so we won't special we
want to not discuss so much of it will
only give us give you know what we have
been adding to the API to make in tests
on processing you know easier and i
talked about photo michelle that assists
photo of alex alex oh cool
you guys have seen this before I guess
so it's just effect that you know that
we are still working on the spec and
with don't promise anything at all at
the end of the toggle I would tell you
in order to actually get the sauce and
get download a final bill and everything
so you know you could use this is the
agenda and also google talk about you
know the new JSON specification a little
bit you know and then talk about the
operation that you could apply to it is
on array in just an object and Alex will
talk to tell you about you know Jason
pointer JSON patch seized on merge page
and I will come back to to talk about
you know how you could do queries in
which case on using dedicate each stream
operation and well as touch a little bit
about you know the kind of support that
we have you need to handle big JSON
I'm the RSC 771 59 replaces 4627 and as
the newest ace on standard nothing much
has been change you know it in despair
you know there are some Calif occasions
about in some of the minor details but
the most important change you know they
make is to just to to allow any Jason
values as the the root of it two
different document so so with that
changes you know we we need to add some
API you know to make it possible and i
will show you you know the kind of data
way we've been doing since we could you
know create a a JSON rule to know with
any value so his motive we restricted to
a JSON array or just an object anymore
so we have added you know several
methods to the factory crust to this
footy footy class JSON so in there we
have added a you know to create a value
from a string to create a value from
integer and also to create value from
other stuff like and long double the
integers in big decimals and of course
you know a wheel soul would get with big
changes to chase on Twitter and JSON
writer the inches on Twitter we also
added a new methods say value of which
returns a NHS on value not just isn't
always such as an object anymore and
similarly for it is on writer you could
write a any JSON value no to a file or
to talk to other stuff yeah so
so these are minor changes you know I
just want to a personal activity we have
been doing this and get it out of the
way I'm next now I want to talk about a
little bit about the operation that we
are getting to it is on the rail or JSON
object um we remember that you know in
JSON p 1.0 we allow user to create a
JSON array or JSON object but it isn't
outrageous an object and there are
immutable in the sense that once you
created it you cannot change it to do it
anymore so if you need to change
anything in the JSON array or JSON
object then the way you need to do is to
look at the operation like a
transformation so you apply the
operation to a JSON array in JSON object
and you look obtain different form
object that will resolve and which is
you know another immutable J's on our
way out is an object so to make this
possible you know that such
transformations would be really useful
and also it is in a critical you need to
implement which is on patch because it
is impressed you know apply some
operation to a existing JSON document
and eat the you could you could you know
if I the patient get you know a fun form
a JSON object bear and to implement you
know this low-level transformation to a
JSON array or as an author we used the
deputy in the Builder pattern so you
know Saudi the way it work is very
similar to a string in the stream filter
you know it will not look at the string
is also a in
object but if you need to do anything to
the string like you know change one of
the string character then you could use
in the computer to do so so we've you
know the similar idea you know we also
apply to the pitter patter into a JSON
array which is an object and so if you
start by creating a filter you know with
the existing JSON array or just an
object then you apply operations you
know for the builder is shell and once
you're done with all the operation then
then you you know a call to fill method
to return an immutable vocational racism
object so yes oh yeah yep let me give
you an example of you know how this
works the you know the original of lines
of the new stuff that we added to the
curtain avi so we first create a target
the JSON array and in this case so we
have a target that we would like to do
some for some reason on then you create
a filter you know from this target and
so so I'm the live here you know what
we're doing it actually we make a copy
of of the target India you know I
remember that that that a JSON array is
actually a lease okay but in it
immutable is ok so we create a mutable
list from the target in the Buddhist
cell and once we you know have the
builder in a wicked apprised of raisins
on the JSON or regular cell so in this
case no we apply the operation ed and we
get a new element to
to the array and you can also be praised
an element with a new value and you can
also remove a kiss on array element and
once you have done with the operation to
recall fill the bill would turn you know
whatever transform this into an
invertible list and which is the result
okay so in this way you know and we get
around the invisibility you know
property of HS on array and then you
know indeed that JSON page and you can
actually see how all of this works in
underneath this example is you know
works on a JSON array but you know
similarly you know you could also have
you know the operations on a JSON object
itself and in actually JSON object is in
the sim progeny JSON array because you
know in a TPA in a JSON object which is
if you did you know a implemented it is
a map and the live and you could already
you know change the value of a map
element but you know what we added to a
JSON object is we also allow you to
remove intuition in any JSON object yeah
but then all this you know is is it it's
done in the API with this active turn
over to addicts hello Thank agreement
okay yeah now we are going to start with
some new features of reality in the API
because yeah JSON be one the toe that
allows you to parse JSON files in
different ways but that's all so we are
now in decision one that one new
operations and one
this new operations is Jason pointer so
basically with this Jason pointer it's
as its name suggests is a pointer to
unsub document of a JSON document so
before these you if you need to get one
document inside of a document or one
concrete value you need to you know
navigate through all the JSON structure
get the file I saw you get the value and
yeah and the Sun but there is one Arab
see which is the rebbe see 6901 which
said what is a JSON pointer and why it's
used and when Jason pointers for getting
these values and basically yeah it isn't
strain Mary I'm saying it's very easy to
understand that it's for in this paper
in the fire isn't defined on a specific
value of specific sub document for
example if I have a document with with a
field which is a floor and then it has a
daughter of the document which is an
answer which has a name and you can do a
slash Alfred / name and this gets the
value of the name field also if you are
using a and array you need to set which
position of the array you want to get
and it's done by / and putting tigger
which is the position of your eye which
is zero is zero based I mean that's it
we want to get the the first element of
an array you do of a parent array /
parent / and tigger and you get the
value or the sub document inside this
ray also notice that since you are using
a / you need a way to set how is eNOS /
and / is with this tiled and one and
since tile now becomes a reserve a court
if you want to put the child in your
document you need to do the tile 0 that
this is something that it sets in the
specification in this way so yeah
you need it it's in this way and also
keep in mind that just some point it's
always absolute it doesn't i'll be in
relative things you cannot do point
point / and whatever you always need to
start with a slash if you're Jason
pointer expression doesn't start with in
/ you will get an exception it's
something that the specification point
so basically i get a dtap example of
comet in the apache Tommy in this case
and basically when you have a reader you
read the document and then when I want
to do is get the name of the author of a
comment and to do it it you know you
read the document and then you create
JSON pointer p + ug some pointer and you
set the JSON pointer expression in this
case of / álvaro / name as you can see
here this is a pointer or to the name
filled and finally when you want to get
the element you do in this case J some
name NP which is that the the JSON
pointers expression the getvalue commit
which is the doc when itself and this
returns the name this this case it will
return and Nick umbrage at Apache the
torque yeah yeah it is NBFC not this
impeach it should be a pea yeah it's
that some people but yeah it appear yeah
they were crazy so this is jason pointer
so the specification only allows you to
get information but we decided to
improve the jason processing api by also
holding you some way to apply operations
to a pointer so you can get a value from
the pointer but you also have for
example the ad
operation which is what you are doing
with the eighties I want to add
something in this document with this
pointer expression so you can use Jason
pointer to modify your documents by
adding by replacing or by removing
things so for example you want to remove
the frost sullivan of an arai you will
create the jason pointer with a /parent
0 / 0 and then called the remove passing
the documented but has all the old all
the values and then it will remove the
first element of the array for example
and it's very important because you know
you can use not just important not only
for getting body but also for modifying
your documents and as kim and said since
Jason objects are immutable this in fact
it's creating a new object so this is
something that it's like like strings
it's something that you need to keep in
mind that you are if your JSON documents
are so big you're you know duplicating
the memory usage yeah yeah yeah Jason
structure is the parent object of JSON
object and jason rae it i mean it it was
22 i use JSON structure to set that you
can use here in a JSON or I or a JSON
object it doesn't matter what you use
that it works but yeah it is the parent
is the parent class so in this case it's
again I have a document it's the same
document and I want to change the name
from antique umbrage at Apache the door
to an complex and it's all so I create I
read the common man at the comic
document i create the JSON pointer again
but now instead of calling get i call
replace i had the comet which is the
document and then i create a new JSON
document going Jason dot create value on
the garage and as you can see below the
document is changed from one thing to
another in fact this is Judy and in
memory will be two different up
but then you have a way to change your
JSON documents and this is something
that it's nothing is not set in the
specification we have implemented for
you in the in the specification so let
me show you a this in action now as you
can see i'm reading this file it is the
committal ji-sun this is comedy the
design is you know it's a simple it'll
get up commit with all the information
and yeah i'm reading the document read
the document here i create this
expression i get the value i bring the
value then i get a value from the an
array which is the dirt you know that
the are comical can comes from different
got two different competent finding here
the first commit I'm finally here i'm
printing that the old value of antique
umbrage with a male and the end of
umbrage with old email so i can run this
okay you can see that the name is get
then the first parent is get notice that
in this case the first part is also an
object this world this object and then
the outcome in which is the before I
remove I sorry i replace the name you
can see here that wait here see that the
out for in one place into still the DML
wand and in this case is without email
because it's what we have changed and
not is that we have not changed the
original object but we have created a
new one
but we are offering you more things and
this is jason patch and this is very
important if you are using or you're
implementing rest api's probably most of
you are using get for for getting
information post for creating
information delete for the rating
information and now comes a question how
you update your JSON documents in a REST
API most of you will say yeah we are
using put but if you read the
specification put says that it's a
create and update so this is the first
thing that you yeah when you implement
it is that you need to be able to create
and also update but it's not only this
problem the problem is that it says
putas for update but how you did you
have no other dog the new document there
and if you put an old in a field means
that you want to remove this film or
means that you want to nullify this film
or how you said how to move one sub
document from one parent to another
parent how you said this operation and
probably we say yeah well we have none
or own JSON format which does things and
yeah it's okay but the problem is that
maybe you are a team one team will
create some services with one format
other team will create the update
services with another format and you
know you don't have something standard
for update and this world Jason patch
fixes it fixes that it's an RFC 6902 we
have implemented this in JSON p and
basically what does is a standardized
update operation so now if you can use
JSON page and all your updates will be
exactly the same it doesn't matter if
your team is in in
distributed teams or in in the same
place but you know you don't talk with
them or anyway you have a standard way
to implement it it's a JSON document
prefer this reason it's called JSON
patch and you can create a sequence of
modifications to your document for
example you can test which means that
you said if some value exists or not you
can remove elements you can add element
you can replace elements you can move
something from someone from one document
to another document soft document to sub
document sorry and also you can copy
things and also the good thing is that
the rest api are under HTTP does this
HTTP method called HTTP patch which is
an application /a some patch + JSON so
you have a way to with using jax-rs for
example to know if you want to use the
put or you want to use the patch and
this is a an example in this case I have
a document I want to replace the author
name to antique umbrage and I want to
remove the email of the document notice
that I have op op is the reserved word
to say what operation you want to do
test remove ad etc in this case I'm
doing replace and remove then we have
the path this path is a JSON pointer
expression and then in case of our place
I need to provide the value to replace
so in fact what I'm doing if I apply
this JSON patch array to add to the
previous document is changing the name
and removing the email and this is how
you can do it it's you know you create
an array builder because as we've seen
Jason patch is an array then you create
the object you up the up with a replace
the path with off with alpha 0 /name and
the value was named you up the
expression into the path then you will
do the same for
or for remove and finally you create an
object called Jason patch you put the
JSON array with all the modifications
you want to do and then yeah I read the
document and I do a decent patch don't
apply to the comet which is the JSON
object and then all the modifications
are executed but you can also do
something more fashion or more fluent
which is instead of having to create
additional right manually we provide a
JSON page builder so instead of having
to you know create additional Ryan at
and remember if the op in case of a
remove it it's called to remove or not
or so on you can do but will the dot
replace this pointer with this value
remove this and then you do a dot apply
you put the JSON document and all the
modifications are done and return in the
form of a new JSON object but this is
what a specification set but we also
implement the reverse operation which is
ok I have these two documents and I want
to know what I have to apply to the one
document to be as equal as the other
document and this is really useful in
case of conflicts if you have a high
concurrent application that two people
can modify the same object and the
client side when they arrive the server
side will detect that there are two
objects that needs to be merged in some
way to one so it could be a way to
create the div and provide to the users
that say hey we detected a conflict we
have these two documents and this is
what we are going to apply and you agree
and you can your application you can put
a reply yes or no or not or whatever you
want to implement and I mean that you
have this open
Georgie in you use JSON processing API
I'm to the diff is JSON bastard if you
pass to JSON document and in case you
have here have the same example of
before with comet one which is the old
comment with the email and and with the
full name and then i have the comic book
which is without the mail and without
having the the name with the apt apache
the torque and yeah and it returns a
JSON array with you know with the old
operations to be executed let me show
you here
here is again I read the comment i
create the Builder with the with the
test which is say i want only 2 i'm
going to replace alpha / name this I
want to test that the mail is this one
if the main is not this then the patch
will not be executed I mean that the
page is always all executed or not
executed it's not it's consistent in
this way you mean that if some of these
operations felt then the patch is not
applied then we remove the first comment
and then apply the comet and again if
you here is I have both commit and I
would I I I want to do is the gift of
everything so I can run this again I'm
you can see here that the document has
been modified from let me check here has
modified the name as here it's done here
you can see that the name is modified
but also you can see that if you check
here let me check where it's shown there
is only one parent in the original where
two parents and now there is only one
parent comet and finally here you can
see the div within to commit and it says
that but you have done it replace only
the name in this case because in here I
used that the simple use yeah I mean
that you can use both documents
intuitive
but and I think that this may be our bad
news for you is that there is another FC
which is our c7 386 which is Jason merge
patch and this is another way of doing a
bunch impact it's simple that the phase
one but not as powerful as the first one
so it is something that you will need to
choose what you want what is just just
emerged spot well it's again a standard
way for an update operating but instead
of creating a new JSON object with some
syntax special syntax like saying I want
to execute the remove or wanted to it
yet it's like the same document that i
have with the fields that i want to add
nullifying the fields that i want to
remove and updating the fields that i
want to update so instead of creating a
new document what I'm doing is sending
the same document but with only the
modifications we want to apply I want to
see now it's very simple and again it
use this application JSON pack Jason so
what I am doing here is I have to commit
with shara learn HTML URL if I send a
document with sha no it means that I
want to remove the shuffle so the result
is that the document does not contain
the shop if I want for example to update
the URL what I will send is URL and the
new URL and then the Jason Jason match
patch knows that I want to change the
URL and you know merge the result
this is for how you can do it with file
you read the document you create an
object builder and then said okay i want
to add the Shah i'm going to create an
object with Sheffield with no value and
then i apply J Sommers patch dot the
comment which is the whole document and
the remove shot which is the document
that I want to apply and notice that
it's not as powerful as JSON bad because
if you want to nullify something you
cannot because from the JSON merge patch
purposed perspectives I know is a remove
so this is one thing that you can use to
choose between one or another it null
has sent in your document then you
cannot use JSON much patch for taking
your documents and again and this is not
in the specification but we added the
reverse operation which is like I have
to document and I want to see what is
the breath what is the different or the
J so much parts that I should apply from
going from json object one to json
object be again you can use use g so
much parks that d if you put the Whatcom
it and it will return the dash is no
let's see it in here
again i have here the comment i create a
shower doc going with noodle i apply the
match but and you will see that the
Sheffield is not there and also i have
here the new comment which is without
the i think the news new comedies
without the shell or no change the Alpha
name so basically it would say that you
have a new field with different value so
if i run here you can see that the face
document has not contained shy anymore
and the second one it says that if you
want to to get the new coming from the
commit one you need to change the Alpha
to this and also up this one but you
know what he has calculated
so for you know new operation that you
can apply its adult thank you Alex well
Jason is usually use you know to store
data and what people want to do is to do
queries on the data how can we do it
instead of inventing new syntax for
queries like a lot of people you know to
nowadays we want to use to queries with
energetic a stream operations and the
reason we can do it though is you know
like I say it is an object you know it's
really a map and a JSON array is a lease
so theoretically you know one container
just apply the stream of reason the
delicate is sufficient to elicit where
map and you know you could you know a
private person like select like map you
know like you know other stuff and you
know specifying what you want to do with
a London expression yeah I would help
example to show you how this can be done
and if you apply the TD case map
operation you also you know get
concurrent projects in for free because
you know it's the coach at 10 is dream
into a dream apparel stream then you
know you could have you know processing
done in terror what we need you know is
actually to have a way to collect
resolve not in another list or a map but
you know to closer without any JSON
array which is an object and that is you
know what what we do in in the API to
help the user to do queries with
ethically a stream or person but also be
able to collect we saw
was in JSON array of just an object so
we you know yeah we define a helper
class you know India we implement some
methods you know to yet you know so we
have a to JSON array and that is a
method that we turn a jdk collector that
collect the value in the JSON array and
similarly we also have been to JSON
object in which you know is a collector
to accumulate videos in the JSON object
but you know the collector would also
allow people to define other ways of
collecting thing like you which dream of
JSON values and you would like to you
know Boop the element in the value in
the depending on you know some some some
some of a boolean quantity then here you
could group or you know oil or nice
photo not yet not related it's not
rejected to boolean you could say in a
unit of group you know the values
depending on the values you know it
she'll like you know say you know from
12 to put in in one bracket from two to
three into another bracket and all that
kind of stuff so we also define a couple
of group by operation that let you
collect things yeah yeah you know it's
easier racial you within example so let
me to that will you help me to put the
term oh yeah there is the color
okay yeah okay let me see yeah but you
know I just want to talk to illustrate
you know what we can do with the
collector so I have a very simple
database you know only have three a free
objects you know and in each of the
object now I have a name have age gender
and all notes also the phone so you know
this is my contact list okay and yet the
first example you know is astray you
know how you could use to chase an array
okay so so in this particular example
you know say I want to retrieve all the
names of female contacts and I want the
result will return in a JSON array okay
so yes you know yeah I want to go over
this example in a little more detail
because you know it is free how you
could use the GDK stream of listen to
2.1 okay the naughty context you know is
it is an array and in the t-zone pavi
you knowed it isn't awake could be
anything so you know what we have here
is now we have a JSON array of adjacent
values not as object okay so we want to
apply another stream operation to a
Jason away then you know we want to make
sure that that that we get a JSON array
of JSON objects in temperatures on value
so the first
the method we call is to get value as
you know which is to turn a kid array or
JSON value into edges a way of JSON
object and and once we do that then we
you know in Italy is a list of JSON
object and we call this dream you know
method to get a stream know from this
list and and and we apply the first
filter operation to you know to the list
and it's also a filter operation works
on one of the JSON objects okay and so
they will only allow the object you
noted that is file you know this
condition to get through you know this
dream and so you know it would open only
allows thing to get in you know if the
gender is equal to F and once we you
know get a element of the JSON object
you know this satisfy this condition
then we you know do they will only want
to get the name I would wear not
interesting the rest of of the JSON
object so the map we know operation the
main Network actually that you not get a
property of fin OD JSON object and then
once you do that and then you this is to
get a stream okay but you know to
collect you know the result in a JSON
array then we call the you know the hilt
the color is also another Jason no
another CD key operation but you know it
takes a collector you know SI argument
so in this argument we actually you know
what as the GDK to put the stuff in a
JSON array okay how do I want to
set the foot went first
don't let them up my check out the whole
thing is easier yeah okay good right
all right okay
yeah so so yeah the associate and this
is actually the input data base and once
we apply you know the first query
operation to just on our way then what
it returns is just you know to just two
to fills you know and also we all need
to want to do we are only interested in
the name right now okay so this is how a
come to copy the sauce yeah okay okay
yeah okay okay
well
and similarly you know we also have a
collector to collect you know a JSON
array and I won't go over this in as
much detail but you know what you know
what i'm doing here is actually ok so
i'm still looking at this on our way and
it'll go to the chisholm up to json
object ok here is okay the collector to
json object you know so what we are
doing here is now we want to retrieve
the names of all the phones of female
contacts okay so but we would like to
present the result you know in a JSON
object that denote the name you know
with the key and then deity foams
nobility value okay so so you can do
that using a you know to json object
collector and the filter of personal is
just to filter out in the element that
you want and the collector would you
know take two arguments the first one is
Atlanta Express will let you specify the
key and the second argument is the land
every person you specify the value so
what you have here is no you have we saw
then you have a JSON object you know
don't you know her name well you never
do you know the note that the kind you
want if you look down to the 2d resolv
let me see ok so this yeah so but this
is you know what you get from the query
you know then you know you only have the
name and for the phone number name phone
number okay so
another example of any never called back
okay all right okay a group I you know
he's also an operation we support you
know in debt you know you could put a
stream of JSON object into to two groups
and then in each of the Gulf in any the
new code you know are specified what you
would like to to to could be by in also
limit let me look at this example engine
so here we have a collector and so we
want to good without the JSON object
into depending on the gender okay so so
the result is ok you know that the
resolution we have a it is an object you
know and we divide it into two goofy
know the first one is the f note then
with this already did you know they did
yeah this all these Jason objects in
their their female and the second one is
the one that it is Mel so yes so this is
how you could use this goodbye okay and
and the last you know example is quite
interesting in a way that you know we
could use college then we could also
apply us tipped is on page operation to
what week worry ok so in this chain if
you want to change you know it is on
document but you don't want to do it you
know by hand you want to you know change
something in the depend on the query
result so in this case say you know we
want to change the age you know of
everybody you know in created by one you
know so going to add 1 180 is no
gotta go potty you know get older so ah
ok let me see so we do this in couple of
steps okay we you know we do a query and
then we let me see how with this okay so
we still be to acquire II you know on
the database and we apply the Creator to
everybody take a sh you know fill in the
india and for each of the day they did
this is an object they contain you feel
we want to build a element of a JSON
patch okay so yeah so the way bit into
it you know is kind of tricky but you
know I I don't go over this intimate if
I want to show you the result of the
patch then once we and we collected
without you know in a patch then once we
have the patch we also apply the patch
to the original database to get Bobby
what you want so in this case let me
just show you yeah so you know so too so
you look at the output here you know the
patch with we don't you know to the Past
menu we actually create the pace of the
fry with the query and in this case you
know we are private we pry we apply a
replace operation and then we specify
the path you know the plate 122 the
patch and we also you know supply a new
value to the patch okay so so if we do
that then you know enter without is in a
very poor ticket holder by 11 year okay
so
so in this case we actually you know do
the query are create the patch then
apply the patch so in three step now you
can see it is actually quite powerful
you know if you want to change something
depending you know on on some condition
of the query and also depending on you
know you know the particular feel you
want to change to go back to this oh
yeah okay next I want to cover you know
people you know so far how to talks have
been doing about but not object models
in memory so you know so all these
queries all these days on patch you know
all the pointers you need to build a
JSON of your model furs and and you need
the whole JSON object you know in memory
but in some cases you know we are
dealing with big JSON data and so
putting the whole thing your memory is
you know in addition and also you can
protocol so we also have added some API
you know to support the new pictures and
data processing and are remembered in
season 3 1.0 we you know have already
have a passer let the path I could let
you you know past it doesn't feel one by
one and just keep what you want and
throw away the placing it on one but you
know it is in very low level in the
sense that you know they are token base
and you also need to to contract you
know a JSON array or JSON object
yourself and in this in this religion we
are getting your API to let a user build
a JSON object
JSON array from didn't passing and the
yet the good thing about the past though
you know is that it I love the
programmer to specify what they want to
see you know so so they don't need no
control the whole thing and presented to
you in a date with the program SAR the
one in a one object or one array then
just a good poet and so it's a full
model and it also works very well with
the JDK stream because in dream
operation they are also they are also
done no lazy person in the sense that
you know in stream of entity can stream
of person you only need you know they
only you know need to control patients
when they need metro okay so it somehow
work very well with this on a person
yeah so in the JSON possibly add the new
API you know to get an array to get it
out there and if we are also at the
beginning of a ray then we could also
pasti you know json parser to get it in
a race trim and once you have this
dreamed of course you can apply in order
to get occasion operation to it and
similarly you know we also have a method
to get the object stream and if didn't
you know a stream of reason you know if
you have decided that you already have
seen enough you want to skip the rest of
the stream of the way then we also have
way way too little too so so skip away
and skip object you know is it will have
it in the sauté you could skip dude in
the rest of the way or object okay this
is yeah this is what we lost em home
okay so this is how it works and is it
the whole book on your face simple right
it's just you know like you know 20
lines of code d let me see how it worked
okay so we create a station passer from
from the file you know in this
particular file a tangle of it from tip
have issues so this is all day in the
issue database for reals issues and you
know yep you so for the most recent oh
you know I put off another disk in your
memory you know in on the file but
usually you know you use under it from
the web 10 in oracle view you know will
babe and once you are in the passer you
know if you're at the beginning of it
away you know so you know this
particular database today so the
database what it is yeah yeah no I want
to see you know the file that file is so
ok here is yeah so you notice this is a
database of issues and a lot of field
here so I right now I just want to get a
title for all the d50 filter for all the
state is open so so yeah so in ott see
if you link a space i don't want to ok
so let it get to this sauce ok that one
all right yeah how to make a pic
no no I wanted the focus is why it is
probably okay and I okay so yeah so it
also like it is dream you know your time
at the beginning of a rate and you know
I could call that a rich dream to get
extreme then you know I met with to a
JSON object you know because it is
easier to work which is an object and it
is on value then I you know future it
you know I want to get the element that
is is you know the state is open to get
the issue that are open and I only want
to get the first five of it because I
don't want to look or the whole thing
and in the four ish is just printing out
you know what I got okay so so if you
look at that then okay so so this are
you Five Element you know that that that
I get one database yeah so the key point
though is you know that we we don't have
any stories for others started with on
one okay and so this is you know really
officially saying that that we don't
keep the stock we don't need and also in
applying the streams we don't read you
know the whole array oh we only fit you
know one array at a time and if you
limit the output tune of 25 then you
know we only 35 you know array elements
and I look at the it'll last you know
method we call is to skip away is that
we only you know get a fight and we are
not interesting the rest of the righted
whisk you off okay so so doing this you
know people allow you to process huge
JSON data we are running in the memory
issues and yeah so I think you know is
you know it's pretty powerful if I one
could use
the limit is is one of the sticky keys
no yeah you know in this particular case
you know the API only allowed you to get
a stream right and what you want to do
is dream you know it's all up to you
right right right so but you know but
you know like I say you know the a
theological stream also allow you to get
the whole whole array of object but not
the whole document though is only part
of it a small piece of the JSON document
and once you get an array then you know
you could actually look at the fields in
follows the way you know it is much
easier than hitting with the whole thing
into in those memory yeah I'm about done
you know so let me get this epic to put
the demo and yeah so he knows so it's
pretty much done you know it's I'm just
want to tell you about the status of our
specification and you know this one you
know it is a TCP specification of course
so we have quality to it early draft
review ok so in there you could download
the sauce and the panel rey and you
could you know play with it one and the
final release you know is we way out but
i think you know we should have a
problem we build next year yeah also
couple play today you could go if you
want to you know learn more about you
know what we are doing ok and we have a
project on capital net you know for to
introspect the case will work and here
you know yeah if you have questions or
you
comment or if you have you know anything
that you want to to us to look at that
you could work subscribe 222 to the user
areas and you know to you know our
casillas emails for those foot for
interest in building and also working
with sauce and you could go to the
reference information project also on
the bottom net and in here you could
actually undo the sauce is new in keep
format and build it yourself okay so
okay um questions yes
I can try and retain the reasonable
solid no longer or not what furniture
take the question yeah it's better than
yep I don't you come over here yeah yeah
any other questions you know could yeah
okay amor time so you know we hear any
question we could probably pick up line
when you do a group I haha before you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
