pros and cons for replacing swing with
JavaFX and existing applications
contrary to most sessions you see about
JavaFX
we're not going to start by showing you
scene builder and F XML and yellow
circles and 3d we're going to assume
that you have an existing application an
existing large application that's been
in production for some time so that you
have a very heavy investment in it and
that you would like to use some of the
goodness of Java FX and that you're
wondering which parts of Java effects
are the goodness that are relevant for
the applications that you've created
that's really the setup for for this
session stated in other words according
to the abstract you know Java SEC's
provides a whole bunch of promising
things on the UI layer not only which
parts are usable in our existing
applications not only how and what what
strategies but also just asking the
question is it ready and what does
really mean and and together with a
group of people who have actually been
trying this out in the real world and
you'll hear from our combined
experiences of course one is almost
automatically in a defensive position
when mentioning the desktop because
every single keynote at every single
conference that has anything to do with
programming of any kind assumes that
everyone is or will be or should be on
the tablet or on the mobile phone or in
the browser and I'm sure that I mean the
fact that we hear all of us probably
have some question marks to the that
kind of perspective but at the same time
all of us I'm sure are interested in
tablets and mobile phones and browsers
in combination with our desktop
applications that's what I've found in
interacting with a lot of desktop
developers I found very few desktop
developers you say we're going to dump
the desktop and move everything our
entire a traffic control
to a mobile phone in fact I've never
heard anyone say that but I've heard
people saying that's very same people
yes but there is a use case for the
tablet and the mobile phone and and the
browser in our in our scenarios so just
as a refresher perhaps a purpose but
just to go through some common use cases
so here we have Jeffy at Jukes Choice
Award winner by the way swing is the is
the largest winner of Dukes Choice Award
Dukes Choice Awards in the past year
past few years for this year I think
four or five last year for example last
year James Gosling's liquid robotics
application anyway
Jeffy network satellite of network
analysis application open send one of
the Dukes Choice Award winners from this
year musculoskeletal analysis prediction
of operation outcomes before the person
it gets carted into the surgery room
other applications for visualizing
various things the farm management
application Agra sends that one and
rejoice award last year that you're
going to see more about today scientific
applications not only the scientific
type program is not have access to a
server of course they're that they're
dealing with heavy data and so it's much
more logical for them to be on the
desktop here in this case a rat brain
analyzer very relevant in certain
sectors a traffic control system of
course this is always going to be a
desktop type application a prototype
application for the EU for police forces
around the EU they can enter data about
a particular weapon that's been found
and then find all the connected people
to that weapon and all the objects that
are connected to those people and make
an entire graph based on a particular
crime related object that's been found
NATO last year won our extras award a
traffic management the whole European
airspace is is managed through through
NATO's swing based system behind you see
another screenshot added again in the
biological world of course stock trading
high frequency trading banking in the
banking world desktop is very large
again in the back office of course you
don't see banking application
screenshots on the on the website of of
the various banks it's not interesting
for the end-user so it's hidden behind
the scenes so fair questions to ask so
we know that the desktop is prevalent
it's everywhere these questions to ask
am I going to ask him upfront
normally a session about JavaFX you see
wonderful things and wonderful promises
and your application will be wonderful
and slide 50 of the 50 slides is oh and
by the way this and that so we're going
to say up front these are the questions
that that we have and that we'd like to
answer first of all is Java effects
ready to be used
at all and what does really mean if it
means drawing a yellow circle in my
application and moving it from left to
right then that's not ready can we use
it if it's ready now you know maybe I
relied as the previous session in the
previous session was clear I relied on
Java FX one and then I had to rewrite my
application completely to Java FX 2
because of completely backward
incompatible change and how to mitigate
those risks how to buy into Java effects
but still be prepared for changes I'm
coming up secondly ok it's ready but is
it relevant for what I'm doing is all of
JavaFX relevant which parts are relevant
and what is the place of Java effects in
the application that I have so maybe I
don't have a very graphic oriented
application I have a banking application
so which parts of Java effects are
relevant there and finally assuming that
we say yes it's ready yes it's relevant
and we've chosen the pieces we want how
do we actually integrate those pieces
into our applications and the fact mixed
metaphor don't reinvent the wheel with
others have walked that road already so
we're going to go through three
scenarios first of all Shawn Phillips
showing a NASA oriented application
jukes Choice Award winner from this year
at even famous stars showing the
Agricenter project juste rester what
wonderful
and Rob Tchaikovsky with an application
that will probably be a winner next year
who knows but the common factor in these
particular applications are all swing
but commonality is they're all very
large in this very heavy investment in
swing and they're very large they're
based on the NetBeans platform and if
you want to know more about that we have
a session about that with a whole bunch
of people also some here and Bruce and
others talking about anything stat form
showing real examples and what you what
you gain from that so without further
ado we're going to switch to the first
use case Thank You Chen hi I'm Sean and
I just want to emphasize that the tool
and I'm about to describe and show you
has been in development for a little bit
over two years and it's been part of a
mission that's been development from a
software and data production standpoint
for five years and then and planning for
almost a decade so you can you can
imagine the trepidation that I faced
with trying to roll JavaFX into that
design that the original design had had
no inclination of job effects whatsoever
because it was a very very data in data
out process a very procedural this is a
Mission Control a tool it is in Mission
Operations at the Goddard Space Flight
Center in Maryland it will support a
November launch of 2014 for the MMS
mission the which measures the
magnetosphere it's very complicated the
Mission Operations setup I mean we're
talking I have here the the GSS
highlighted but there's all these other
boxes are very complicated and each one
of them are developed by different
groups there's a ton of automation in
there and a ton of communication so very
complicated and it's all to support the
general science
of how the heck does the magnetosphere
work how is it reconnecting and how long
do we have to live before it collapses
in a billion years or whatever we all
die from radiation okay so before job
effects there was just Java and swing I
needed a multi-platform
platform-independent solution it had to
be extendable to multiple missions
because it supports an onboard software
system called jion's which is not Java
but it's the all the ground system
processing for that and so I chose the
NetBeans platform because it was very
well suited to file management project
orientation files and services which is
resonates very strongly with the Mission
Operations model which is Witten and
NASA is typically data products in
there's some sort of procedures
validation data products out those data
parts go to some other subsystem but I
ran into a problem where the operators
who are the the the butts and the seats
every day day in the life they are
producing different data products and
they don't necessarily know if they're
good or bad they're relying very heavily
on automated QA from software like my
own but others to tell them that it's
good or bad it but if as most you
probably know just because you have
software that can tell you if it's good
or bad it's hard to convey the why why
is typically visually oriented so the
thought was okay well now that I know I
need some visual help here now's my
chance to use JavaFX because everybody
keeps saying how that's what it can do
and so what I found was that and I'm
gonna touch upon pros and cons in a
second but I found that using Java
effects really reduced my development
time to getting very rich interaction
out the door quickly and in a stable
fashion and I really can't I can't spend
enough time you know bragging about how
great drag-and-drop event handling and
manipulation is but also how much easier
they made clipboard maintenance that
sort of thing then from how swing was
done before and then of course the
concurrency packages that are part of
Java effects made doing that in a
not only easy but made the GUI highly
responsive which is absolutely critical
because when I'm talking about data I'm
talking six figures of doubles being
slung around as in multiple vectors
around the screen so I'm gonna switch
over to a view of the application real
quick so you can have a feel for what
the heck I'm talking about no it's not
what I do that's what I do okay give it
a second here okay so this is I pre
loaded some data here and what we have
on the left is a pure JavaFX scene with
a bunch of custom components I've built
very very easily built-in a lot of
drag-and-drop event handling I've
created a menu item which as you as it
detects and calculates of not only the
data from the the files the data
products but also the secondary
calculations adds those vectors as as
pure first-class members of the of the
data scene and so now I can drag these
and drop these into my charts and get a
sort of date of Explorer type thing for
instance I don't know why this would be
useful because I'm just a dumb developer
not a scientist but maybe inclination
over Y position is valuable here but
maybe I want to see that same thing but
instead of the Y position I want to see
it crossed against the x position and
clearly there's a difference you know
and if I want to take a quicker look I
can do that and adding all these
animations was so it was so easy to do
in Java FEX now where it gets a little
thorny is when you want to try to take
JavaFX type of event stuff and push it
back to the swing side on the right
that's not Java effects that's whirlwind
and most people probably recognize that
and that is OpenGL but it's also a swing
component and so I had to facilitate a
go-between to get communication back and
forth here's a time slider which is it's
it's time in the data these are all
orbits so to speak and I can I've
selected a certain time range but over
here give it a few seconds because it's
about to render
20,000 data points what we have is the
entire orbit system around the planet in
a specific mathematical frame and it's
highlighted the same orbit track that
we've that we've isolated right here so
but to do that it wasn't hard but it was
tedious and I'm gonna I want to get back
to that in a second but it is possible
and so if you if you have situations
where you have some some swing controls
you just can't part with and you want to
do new development job effects it can be
done and this is an example the platform
made up my life easier because the the
visual element served that that serves
as this visual tab here for the platform
actually doubled as my my controller
class and it facilitates observable type
communication between the two scenes
okay so to the pros and the cons highly
yes I can't talk enough about how easy
it is to make very reactive GUI scenes
with Java effects and of course the time
to do that is has not only been reduced
but the code footprint in terms of
maintenance is also reduced to do that
now reduced compared to what and that
gets me to my cons oh look at that
segues nicely
I can still do all those things with
Swing and I'm sure you all can attest to
that I I can't think of a single thing
that Java FEX provides that I can't do
with swing unless I qualify it by say do
it easily into it quickly so if that's
your goal if your goal is to reduce the
bottom line in terms of cost then you
should absolutely jump in and dive in
and look to start integrating java
effects into your your your tools
finally I really want to say that I was
a swing guy I remember swing becoming
the the technology and now I'm getting
beat over the head because apparently
it's not in a web browser so it's not
good although I can't imagine what my
customers would say if I said hey NASA
scientist your kness your next ground
system is going to be Firefox here here
we go you know give us a billion dollars
that's not going to work
and it won't work from an implication
standpoint but it was very fun and the
other point is just because the
application isn't running in a browser
doesn't mean it that it isn't
interacting with the web that's right
and that's an important distinction
that's right that's right it's we are in
a closed system
we can't fundamentally communicate
outside of a DMZ
it's not classified but for security
purposes we have to do it that way so we
can't really have web applications
there's no point however would that you
saw the amount of data it just doesn't
work in a browser and that's where Java
effects really steps up to the plate but
I just want to say that if we're gonna
get more adoption and we're gonna get
more people like yourselves but also the
kids coming out of school who think
who've been brainwashed by their other
friends that you know if it's not html5
it's crap but they what these are the
three things that I think we need to
drive at we need to if they need to
focus in JavaFX land on what ways they
can reduce cost if it's if it's so easy
to make something that's so great why
use another technology and I'd really
like it if they would pump some more
support into 3d maybe get a 3d maybe get
a Java FX version of world one that sort
of thing thank you very much now you
have to clap for everybody now so
too much here you go well my name is Tim
um I said if y'all already introduced I
am the lead developer architect of aggro
sense which is an open source farm
management platform module last year we
won the dukes Choice Awards which was
very nice so we are certain good company
I think place it to the mic I think it
wasn't working we just moved them around
all right it's no problem
all right can you hear me now yes yeah
all right
agura since I'm not going to repeat
everything well it's a farm management
application it's not only used for by
farmers it's also used by his fighters
my big industrial farms but also by by
standalone small farmers who want to
experiment with precision agriculture
because most equipment you can buy for a
tractor in your tractor itself it's the
fourth precision agriculture but there
are hardly any tools for them to support
them in doing anything useful with it so
that's why I Gerson steps in we want to
provide this support for precision
agriculture to as many farmers as
possible that's why we created
open-source application and we have a
standalone version for for small farmers
they can use it for free they can
experiment how precision agriculture
work they can read all the data
visualize it on a map and then do some
basic analysis with it
and sent the detailed instructions back
to the to the section oh there are also
some big industrial farms and big
advising companies around here and they
want to do have some support for
precision agriculture as well so what we
did we also created the client-server
version and also it has a web client and
mobile client but for this purpose we
will focus on the rich client because it
contains all the JavaFX so what do we
use we based our application on the
NetBeans platform which gave us a huge
advantage of not having to write all
those great features it already has like
a windowing system modularity we use the
job effects we half a year ago we had a
discussion with the development team is
it now time to move to Java fix and we
had some discussions about it what are
the pros what are the cons we did not
want to make the mistake of of people
who adopted in a Java fix one and had to
do it all over again so we were a bit
very about it but in the end we decided
that it was time to choose Java effects
as our mainstream technique for new
components and it didn't mean that we
had to replace everything we already had
because we could still use the spring
components but for the new components we
could just use Java effects and it
coexists very easily together well we
needed also to split the client and the
server and we discovered in a nice very
new framework it's not very mature but
it's called open dolphin it's built by
like new
it's very geared to watch JavaFX clients
and to have some synchronization with
the server and it really makes it easy
to apply a good MVC pattern by using
presentation models estimate as the
model part and because there they are
generic you can just move them back and
fourth and there are really easy binding
tools for it so it made it made out of
life really easy and it all it has some
nice features I will almost show you in
a minute on the server side that we just
use oriented DB for a graph database and
we use this because there is a lot of
data in in a farm
there's farms as fields and there's
tractors there's machinery that you can
attach to tractor there are crops and
everything is connected somehow but the
connections always change so we need to
be able to have some connections to
everything so a crop is related to a
field and the field is on a certain
location and it has a time aspect and so
that's that's why we used a graph
database and it's working really well
especially in combination with opened
often in the presentation box so this is
basically an how it works we have on the
bottom right we have the server and the
server uses open dolphin to communicate
with the client and it's it has a model
store which is basically a collection of
the presentation models and will be
synchronized between client and the
server so as soon as you start a client
session it will create a session on the
server as well so you can listen to all
the presentation modes in this model
store on the server side and you can do
all kinds of logic and it's also really
easy to sync two clients together
because you have the data of both
clients in one place so you can listen
to changes in one and propagate them to
the other client so I would like to show
you now suit
yeah here we have ever since and here on
the Left we have a Explorer so this is
what a farm looks like if there's a
workers collection units and fields and
I drag one fields on the map I created
one fields as you see we have a central
map component and we can switch between
several implementations backgrounds and
this one is Virtual Earth it's from Bing
Maps it contains some really nice very
detailed photos and it's very well if a
farmer he wants to draw his fields and
he needs to do have you see all the
ditches here the water pieces like this
oh I started another client like this
this this one is showing the same field
only with Open Street Map
so what I will now do is here and this
is swing this is the Explorer for you if
you we get from NetBeans platform is
really nice because you can organize
your data in notes and it will just be
shown in the Explorer this is our map
component which is also open source we
separated from echo sense so it can be
used by other applications as well you
can just add it as a dependency in your
NetBeans platform application and you
will end up having a map and you don't
need to add and to change your
application to have the map but you can
use the API you can implement it your
energy or geometrical interface which
basically says I have a geometry and as
soon as you implement this interface and
with your data object you can just drag
the object and onto the map and the
rules will show on the map here on the
right side we have a job effects and
form and as you can see when I start
removing it this part and this part is
all automatically synchronized with
children that's because we do not assist
and that netbeans application we do not
synchronize on notes but on the
presentation models so we use the data
to bind all the deforms well to the data
so if you change it and here you can see
the other client it's changed as well so
as soon as I start typing here my other
fields it will need some time but the
changes will be sent to the other client
as well and the really big advantage is
this for this is that when you are
working with the team on for example an
expert system and someone is changing
something you can see actually the
change happening and then you can shout
to your coworker hey don't touch that
field I'm working on this field or I'll
throw a pen to his head and say well
you're touching my fields and it really
works like like the Google Earth
document when you were editing together
you can really see where the other one
is where the other one is working you
can really prevent conflicts from
happening and another thing I would like
to show you is some code just weird Java
ones and we need season code this is one
basic set that we use for the Java fix
forum you saw on the other side we are
using make layout which has a job
effects version now as well and it made
us really easy to create very simple
forms because you can say well just wrap
two and after two components you add it
will wrap to the new line so it's very
trivial to add new forms so this is the
part where you add a label and the text
field and this is the binding so now we
bind the text field to the data object
and vice versa so you only need two
lines to do your binding and because you
bind on the data object if you have
another screen that's also bound to the
bit data object if you make
a change in one screen it will
automatically be updated in the other
screen it's wrong so this is very very
nice so we found out that we are much
more productive with using javac screens
than we are with in this way because
things like binding are much easier to
do in Japanese so time already
there we go well Rob triple askin with
Lynne incorporated where a freight
logistics firm based out of Seattle and
Anchorage and I'm gonna talk about our
experience in developing a freight
management application on the netbeans
rich client platform with JavaFX
and not Duke's choice of winner this
year wasn't even a few runner-up yeah
maybe next year so just a little bit
about myself
application architect at Linden I've
been there for about 10 years now and
I'm the technical lead for our Freight
planning and mat management application
FMS stands for Freight management system
very clever name and when a little bit
about linden linden owns more than 50
different operating companies that work
in different markets mostly and shipping
Freight to and from alaska although some
of the companies have worldwide
operations linden transports probably
our biggest company to trucking firm
then air cargo and air freight two of
the other big ones and then Alaska
Marine Lines which is our barge line so
we have to when we develop applications
we have to satisfy a pretty diverse
requirement base across all of those
companies so what what what's the
problem with that we're trying to solve
here well we want to help our customer
service agents and our warehouse
managers help our customers answer one
seemingly simple question and that's
where's my Freight
that guy had a bad day so we developed a
desktop application based on the
NetBeans rich client platform and in the
first version this application we had
two main modules one was called trace
which is for our customer service agents
to help track down where Freight is in
the history of the freight to see where
it had been in order to help our
customers out and then the other module
is called planning which is more for our
warehouse managers to see what all the
freight that was coming into their
warehouse from the various locations and
then the deliveries that they had to
make so they could plan accordingly for
resources trucks trailers personnel at
four houses and stuff like that so what
we're seeing right here is the planning
tab and the planning module in NetBeans
now I know people in the back aren't
able to read that and I'm pretty sure
people in the front aren't able to read
that either because I'm having a hard
time right here seeing what's actually
on this screen so this was developed
with guide components which is
third-party tools
swing swing components and I think
somebody got a little crazy with the
with the cheese whiz here because they
have like four or five levels of
different nested contain different
nested tree tables and so it's just a
massive amount of information that we're
attempting to show the user and it's
probably not really usable by anybody
other than Chuck Norris maybe definitely
not by our not by our users at-at Linden
so for this this next version of the
planning module that we're we want to
develop I'm gonna be looking at using
JavaFX because well there's a lot of
cool things you can do and ways that you
can represent the data what you can
create metaphors with Java effects to
model your the problem that you're
trying to solve and really
are only limited by your imagination now
at this point so a couple of goals here
were to use scene builder as much as
possible for the WYSIWYG design of slide
for that and then also used cascading
style sheets so I really wanted the
project stakeholders and the developers
on the project to kind of think outside
the box what what's possible to do when
developing these user interfaces so I
came up with a few concept screens just
to kind of get them thinking before we
set out and actually work on the design
the final product and so what we have
here is a screen that kind of looks like
on the top portion of what looks like a
airplane airport or train station
arrival board so this the managers could
see this would be for Anchorage and the
managers could see okay what are all the
trips that are coming in to my
destination along with the motor
transport rail highway boat arch and
then they could select a trip and down
below they actually see the shipments
that were on that trip and so all this
was pretty much used with stock
components out of the quarter JavaFX
libraries some of the components on the
top are out of the JAF extras project
which is an open source library so
that's this is one of the things and and
you can put effects on here that make
the you know give the the user interface
a real sense of realism like drop
shadows that gives the components really
a feeling a feeling of depth and and
realism then the second cut we had here
so refined a little bit more we have the
different modes of transport up on the
on the top of the UI somewhat like tabs
and we're able to apply these effects to
these components such as the reflections
or the slight glow around the Steamship
tab that's selected up there and then
also on the unit plans I'm not sure how
good it shows up on the screen but those
components are a little bit glossy and
translucent so you can kind of see
what's underneath them as Sean kind of
alluded to what
let's talk about his application this
stuff is doable in swing but is so
painful to do and it's pretty much baked
into the JavaFX framework and and using
scene builder it's really easy to apply
these sort of effects to the components
on the user interface so then moving to
scene builder here you can see that the
design of the application is getting
refined a little bit more but this is
our the WYSIWYG tool that we've been
using and behind the scenes it's
generating XML it's not generating Java
code so that's something that's a caveat
and I'll talk a little bit more about
that and integrating that with NetBeans
but basically you it's drag-and-drop you
got your component components over there
on the palette and these are the Java
effects core components out of the the
like Java fix library itself my biggest
gripe with scene builder 1.1 I'm not
sure if this is gonna change in 2.0 or
not but you can't add custom components
to the palette in this version the scene
builder so we've developed some custom
components we weren't able to drag and
drop them onto here same thing with the
components from the JAF extras libraries
we're not able to get those into the UI
here in scene builder so what we have to
do is we have to go manually add them to
the XML file and then which isn't too
hard to do we've been nice we could do
everything from scene builder but then
once those are in the XML file go back
in the scene builder it renders them
just like as if they had been dragged in
there so so given that scene builder
generates xml behind the scenes then how
do we get this Java FX user interface
into the NetBeans platform so the cool
thing about NetBeans it's a modular
architecture so we can change the
planning module of our application
without affecting you know the trace
module or any other mugs that we have
running in there so I was kind of
surprised at how easy it was to actually
add the the Java FX UI to the to the
NetBeans application
and it's probably hard to read but I'll
just paraphrase it really quickly you
have an XML loader class and Java FEX
and you pass it the path to your XML it
takes that reads it in and converts it
to a Java FX component there's a special
type of jpanel called a jfx panel which
can take as one of its arguments a Java
FX node or scene I guess it is and and
then once you put that Java fixed
component on the panel then you can add
that panel to your swing you I just like
you would any other Swing component so
pretty easy to do
so then finally here we have kind of the
finished product of this first the first
phase of our next version of our
planning module we have that Java FX UI
embedded now into the planning component
that was previously housing the the
nested J table user interface so that is
pretty much it for me my contact
information if anybody has any questions
about this I actually do Rob can you go
back one slide sir can you just for
everybody cuz I tell but can you
highlight what parts are still swing
that are visible and what are actually
just focus on that sure which is so on
the UI right now what you can't actually
see not very much of this is swing
anymore we stalled the menu up at the
top right there which is a regular J
menu and then the tabs themselves are
the part of the NetBeans top components
okay but in this case you could remove
that tip since you only have one or do
you need to have multiple and no we
still have our our trace our module is
dependent or service one and that one's
still using swing as its base by I
haven't
showing it here it's you can see it you
can see the tab up there but I haven't
shown that with the contents of that
desk so how many helpdesk O's are you
going to get from your customers saying
complaining about that being swing sort
of JavaFX I imagine why so I'll probably
become at once once this version goes
out I think will be a higher priority to
get start moving our other components
over to you know job effects and make
them more visual appealing and user
friendly for our for our users so there
you go
so what one reason why I find the
desktop so interesting is because
there's such a variation of things being
done with it I mean in one session we
have you know logistics for our
management Anessa
whereas in the world of the web you're
doing like probably you know 70% retail
and the rest is hotel reservations I
mean that and the other cool thing is
that that I mean there's this clear
synergy be it between at least the farm
management and logistics story except
that logistics story is probably you
know specific to linden but you know
there is so there's a logistics aspect
that that's relevant to farm management
and quite often when we were JavaOne and
and people with the same NetBeans
platform background meet they end up
exchanging features with each other
because I have the same the same basis
anyway are there questions
in addition here are all our contact
details tomorrow there's a session to
give some background on the container
part that was used in the in the various
job FX as scenes that were shown giving
a window system in a minor system
questions yes
now our application isn't doing a whole
lot of data crunching and updating the
UI and and and that's where things so we
haven't run into any performance issues
at this point with the the JFX panel I
have more problems with world wind
honestly and that's that's OpenGL so if
that tells you anything you know let me
first repeat the question the question
is the packaging how does one package
that the the JavaFX parts of the of the
swing Java flex application and is it is
it a feasible is there as feasible
solution for the for that yeah so what
we're doing with with our installer that
we're creating for our application is
we're actually bundling the with JDK 7
with the installer and then the
application uses that private Jerry for
its when it's run like speak up we have
built the standard NetBeans platform
installers we're using that and we build
in a check and it will check if it's the
right version of the JDK and it'll
provide links to update if you're not
and it's it's odd because as soon as you
you pack the JDK with your application
you're also responsible for updating it
and that's that's a bit of a downside
and because every security update you
need to what and monitor very very
tightly and provide a new version of
your application also with every
run Thailand yeah we and for our case we
have we have control over users machines
so we can if there is a jdk issue we can
push out a new version or a second so
another question back there yes and then
you know yes
well you guys using just basic
early customized render and
yeah that's a good question that's going
from swing to a data-rich swing user
interface to JavaFX how easy is it to
customize components like table-cell
renders and stuff like that so it's the
same sort of concept in Java affects you
you do the code you can do the coding in
the XML but then in Java if you need to
customize the tables for you know colors
or different texts or anything like that
you can you can plug in your own cell
renders and editors into that and so
that's something that we're gonna be
looking at doing as well as we continue
moving along with this project is to you
know make these tables a little more
user-friendly as far as giving feedback
to the user on shipments that might be
in jeopardy of getting delivered late or
something like that so we will be
developing those sort of tools for job
effects as well Christian oh yeah but
there was a very interesting I think tea
moment we saw a test effects developed
by the the group that presented the
previous session identity to connote
because it looks very interesting and up
till now it was swinging is hard to test
swing you eyes and well JavaFX you eyes
are also hard to test currently so what
are we doing we're not testing them
automatically we just do the user tests
but it would be very nice to have some
automatic automated unit tests for the
UI as well so you at least at least know
that the basic components are working
and the test effects look really really
nice but also with an abuse platform we
have a UI testing framework so the
question would be hard to combine that
framework with it with the test effects
and or maybe all we we wouldn't need the
test effects and we could move some time
we've got the component hierarchy to
find the JavaFX components contained
within the I think we won't do the
integration test ultimately
because well you can test one component
and you you know what to expect but
since it's a modular application you
never know what to expect and you never
know what configuration the user has so
you have to do some manual testing I'd
like to add though I'd like to add to
that though that on one of the the code
footprint when you're doing these types
of things in JavaFX it's much simpler
and smaller so so there's in my opinion
much less risk you know tighter little
smaller more concise bits of logic are
easier to test in general right
so you can take a little heart in that
so if you're if you're worried about
jumping in JavaFX because it's harder
test it's actually getting much simpler
code so you're out you'll be a lot much
a much better meantime for failure yes
another question up there the question
is actually one I mean this is this this
is the that this is the key question
what are the limitations and on are
those limitations such that well I'll
defer if anybody else would like to jump
in okay so I I have a lot of problems at
first using the charts with huge amounts
of data now what is huge
one man's huge is another man's a
trivial amount right but the charts that
you're seeing up here I'm sorry that I
showed up they are the standard to have
FX charts and I'm each acts each vector
has 20,000 doubles okay and so every
time I dragged a vector and dropped it
on an ACCI and then it picked that up
and then jacked it into the chart or
updated the chart it's jacking in 20,000
doubles against 20,000 other doubles
potentially whether it's I'm sampling in
time or as a function of the
vector so you're talking about 40,000
data points all doubles being cranked
into these these these scatter plots
that did not respond so well and so what
I found was on this machine as a as an
i7 core force it's not the best machine
world but it but the responsiveness was
like three four seconds okay just to get
those in after the drop action had
occurred and that's acceptable but then
what if you want more I mean honestly
20,000 data points is not it's not
enough for what we do that that that's
just to get started oh I you know and so
what if you wanted to automatically
chart or maybe six or seven different
classic views that are very standard in
the aerospace industry I originally
started trying to chart on eight charts
two axes each and so it came out to
something very close to two hundred
thousand data points and after I timed
it at something like two minutes it took
to render that's just not acceptable
and so the reason is because these
charts are all managed charts as part of
the scene graph so every single data
point is a managed node in overall scene
graph so you get all the nice animation
you get the automatic updates get all
the event handling you get it all for
free and everybody says that's why I
like Java effects except there's a cost
and so if if I had my way what I would
do I would create a version of these
charts which is an unmanaged version
maybe even a canvas face based version
maybe it's a mode that you can set it in
where when you what all when you add a
point to it it translates it to a canvas
and just jacks the pixels in that's it
and if you want special event handling
you got to do it yourself right I mean
something you know things like J free
char and some other swing based ones
have already started releasing
components that do that so it to answer
that question it caused me a lot of
consternation heartburn and eventually
the only solution I could really come up
with was I had
put in sampling rates I can't show keep
clipping on my screen I had to put in
sampling rates and then let the user say
I want one in ten one in five one in 40
and for some most applications that's
acceptable but there are going to be
situations where you just need one to
one he asked if I'm aware in a JavaFX
session about a swing project there haha
oh I
it's part of if you give you check out J
free charts they have a like a high data
density thing it's they just announced
it a few months ago but but I'm telling
it's not a job of X component it's still
a swing component now I'll so I'll tell
you this I worked with Karl dia who also
has a JavaFX author he couldn't make it
this year
he apologizes he lives in Maryland with
me and we kind of busted out a really
simple canvas scatter plot control and
it's really easy actually in Java
effects to do to just do a simple here's
a box two axes throw some pixels on the
screen
we were we were able to achieve 250,000
data points in less than a millisecond
in fact I couldn't eat it wasn't even
those it was measured in hundreds of
microseconds so you know it was
certainly rough and it wasn't production
quality but if you really are worried
about the the quantity of data you it
there are there are solutions but you're
gonna have to hand toll it for now the
low-level components in Java effects
they can handle a lot of data and they
are really really fast so it's it's a
matter of being aware of the amount of
data you're processing and choose the
proper components agreed I am not
criticizing the performance of Java FEX
just of the use case I tried to force
fit on those manage charts
what the question is what about tabular
data as an attack as in tablets or wait
Oh
I honestly haven't had to deal with
tabular data of any significant quantity
most most of my data has come in this
form and honestly the hard part is
getting that data in and out it's not
really a JavaFX thing per se you know
that's just a java thing and of course
so java 7 and then eventually I can't
use Java 8 because I have a code freeze
in April but Java 8 has all those that
stream processing where you can do these
things in parallel it I don't really
think you're going to have a problem I
think if you do it right you'll separate
that out of the JavaFX world and then
just use the nice concurrency support
that Java X has to load rows as they
appear
it's the question is with the logistics
app how does the tabular data scale
yeah we're not working with a huge
amount of tabulated tabular data either
we're talking about maybe a couple
thousand rows which you know my opinion
isn't a whole lot so we haven't seen any
performance issues with with tables and
JavaFX bunch of no questions coming okay
so on the left here yeah
those are yourself isn't it right we
have a 500 by 30,000
i-i've had to deal with that in swing
and it was easily solvable right the
concern is that each cell is a node in
JavaFX and I don't know some of you have
their gun in some of the other job
effects sessions but you know the number
nodes increases in a scene graph that
performance decreases yes the concern
but no we personally haven't run into
that that issue yet
that's why I'm here
yep in the back there
just try to change its extension and
superplex to one the JFX handles
sort of trying to figure out how it
looks from there and back or three guys
with
we
so the question is are we going to do we
try extending extending jpanel for
example extend jfx panel men try to
support the job flex components over
that way so from from our point of view
we haven't done that we pretty much are
starting from scratch with that that one
at one tab that I was showing there but
for the other module that we had the
customer service module is a possibility
that we would look at you know doing a
piecemeal where we tried converting
widgets over one at a time but I'm not
sure if we go the route of just you know
creating a jfx panel and then that or if
we're gonna you know do something up in
and seem milder and then just you know
throw it into the you I think everyone
has an interesting approach as well we
try to do this for a few components that
in the end it was just much easier to
just create them again because there is
not it's very granular the application
because everything is nicely packed in
modules and and screens so it's not a
whole lot of code you need to refactor
so if you want to change one component
it's just it's just a few fields it's
not hundreds of fields another thing
that you've said before is that as you
add new features those new features of
Java effects yeah and you and you're not
going back and changing all the swing to
Java effects but only when you're
actually working on the particular
component that is we believe all the
because they mixed so well and you can
even have a you know the the taps
screens in your in your property screens
you can have one tab being Java affects
the other on swing then another one Java
effects and you can even add a new
version of of existing functionality and
just show it in parallel to the existing
swing function and I think what we need
is CSS stylesheets for Java effects to
make Java FX look more like Swing
and that book maybe helped the adoption
for the end-user
to greater gradually provide the I can
yeah okay yes question there Eric it was
being executed in the application thread
in the JavaFX land because all the
actions were occurring in the JavaFX
scene so I didn't really have to go
outside of that so but yes and no it did
not lock it up you know I I set
background you know the equivalent of a
runnable for that it so it's run later
it's I don't I don't the code in front
of me it's really it's stupid simple I
mean but it's it's a little bit of a
pain because you have to take that into
account whenever you have any
manipulations and unfortunately because
you're in a different thread you have
you know to have taken know Kyle's
situations like well do I have access to
this variable do I have to declare it
final that sort of thing well it's not
20,000 it's like 19,000 you know it's
not that bad but uh but you can take all
that into account in your and if you're
smart you can encapsulate that very
easily in your standard getter setter
type model and then it's all taken care
of and so that's kind of the approach
that I took but I also I didn't do full
replacements like these Fine Young
Cannibals over here I I approached it
where all my components were jfx panels
I create I create Java effects
components and then I have a separate
class layer which is just a jfx panel
which which facilitates just that so I
have Java X components that don't know
anything about swing and of course my
swing components they never know
anything about Java effects I always
keep the I know everything type stuff in
the JFX panel class so that's my model
and
seem to be working for what I have to do
okay I'm sorry I think we need to wrap
up if there are more questions please
feel free to come up and talk directly
with the panel thank you very much for
coming thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
