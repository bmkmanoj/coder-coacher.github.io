life here that article fold on a
Thursday afternoon here I was going to
say it but the weather was like outside
but I've been out but I had it cold
so anyway Mike thank you so much for
coming all the way from Austin Thank You
Java how are you finding London London
is fantastic I had the opportunity to
land yesterday anthro early in the
morning I got some sleep ok night I've
had a great dinner ok and I'm ready to
Galen had had our first hands-on lab
today ok so we're gonna so obviously a
hands-on lab is like with us a couple of
hours it was a couple hours a couple of
hours so what do you do in a hands-on
lab I mean it's just uh well the
hands-on lab really came as an idea when
I spoke it at Oracle code in Austin I
had a lot of people I spoke about a
little bit more advanced topic about
docker and in that case it was how to
how to create a private docker registry
right but but people came in I had 50
people in the class or the presentation
and I asked how many people you know had
heard of docker and quite a few maybe
had heard of docker and how many people
have actually had hands-on with docker
and three people so three out of 50 had
actually touched docker so I spent a lot
of the time there you kind of Reece
whistling what I was talking about
bringing it down into the basics so what
we found is that people really want to
understand what docker is what
containers are what even just the basics
however they have been pages at all and
so we created a hands-on lab it takes a
person from zero and brings them up and
actually at the end of the lab they have
actually done created a container deploy
to container you know and things like
that that's what the hands-on labs all
about is really getting first-hand
experience with working with docker okay
and if somebody missed the chance to be
in the hands-on lab today
are there other article code events that
you'll be doing this I'd yeah so we
personally I'm going to do Berlin German
which is next Monday on the 24th right
and then then we go to Prague after that
okay and I check on the 20 on that
Friday there it is the following Friday
right so we're going to do it there and
then we are we're planning also on a
couple others you know later in the year
around Sydney
potentially and in Bangalore in Bengal
oh okay all right so you came over with
acquisition from Jenkins from stock
engine yeah how's that how's that been
so this so it's interesting going from
us I actually chance to interview Bob
Dylan and Turco das right just very
interesting hearing about the
entrepreneurs journey but I was just can
I guess every person has their own
explaining so just only what it's like
going from a small startup to the so a
company decides of article well I I
really enjoyed our time at stack
engineer I think the team there had has
actually done some prior ventures so we
have a very cohesive team and we're
located in Austin uh-huh and then we
were SEC engine was acquired in 2015 but
we were we were working in the docker
space for a good while prior to that so
coming you know coming into Oracle RIT
you know a startup it always in works
with limited resources and you don't
necessarily have have the reach that you
do and I think what I really enjoyed
about Oracle is just the reach and and
the fact that the company is making an
extreme investment in not only cloud but
also all aspects of new application
development including containers so the
the amount of investment that the
company is doing the the prioritization
of these technologies I think is a real
kick so imagine if you would if you you
know your kid and you have you have a
some toys limited number of toys and you
get adopted by a family that has a whole
toy store similar to what what an
analogy
yes I want to be a kid again I know
uh-huh all right okay so that's amazing
and you've actually also come out with
the product itself the container cloud
service yeah you want to talk a little
bit about that sure so we took the
existing product with sac engine product
that we had shipping at that time and we
made it into Oracle container cloud
service which is a cloud service it's
like a pass type environment a container
service that's on the Oracle public
cloud and in fact today you know I
notice we're you know we're pushing for
folks to get to trial the free sign up
and you know the container service is
included in the cloud so yeah so if
people want to check it out they can
just go to developer Oracle comm slash
code I think it is and you should use it
I think you can look up the trial signup
on there it's also on cloud.oracle.com
unclouded
you wanted a simple place and slash
container is specifically for container
class service all right then okay there
Mike so it's going to be great I think
we're going to be seeing each other in
Berlin and Prague also I I think it's a
really good any for any parting words
you want to share I guess in terms of
with the with the developers who are
either here or the ones who are tuning
in through the live cast so we watch
this later so I think one of the most
important things that I've learned in my
journeys in talking to people that have
worked with existing Oracle technologies
like Oracle Java or WebLogic or database
database uh-huh is that there's an
interesting containers but they haven't
made yet the journey the bridge to look
at those and I was extremely excited
yesterday when in docker con in my
hometown of Austin we announced Oracle
announced availability of some of those
images like web logic and database on
the docker store great so those are
available today to be able to pull those
images off the docker store and use them
as docker containers straight away I
thought that was very exciting and so I
think the ability to
for folks that have have used the some
Oracle technologies now want to start
using some of the newer technologies
this is a good bridge for us to help
them get you know started with docker
and containers okay well Mike thank you
so much for coming by and for sharing
well thank you John</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
