New York City I'm Babu Bart with the
Oracle technology Network with another
in a series of live dev live interviews
my guest is Chris Richardson he fresh
from his keynote address this morning
Chris thanks for coming by
are you very welcome tell me why there
is no such thing as a Microsoft I mean
won't Martin Fowler be surprised at that
I'm hoping that Martin would agree so I
think in reality the term micro-services
is really a shorthand for the micro
service architecture and which is
actually a way of structuring your
application and so in that sense even
though microservice or the word that you
can put an s on or take an S off in
reality it's really the architecture of
your system and so as such it doesn't
make sense to think of a micro-service
in isolation and it's sort of the
inspiration it's for in a sense for this
talk was just a whole bunch of
conversations I've had where people have
gone can I use a micro service for this
thinking let me just have a service or
is this a micro service whereas in
reality is more the meaningful question
is is the Micra service architecture a
good fit for my application I've talked
to people who have pointed out that from
their perspective that micro services is
nothing more for micro service
architecture is nothing more than the
way service-oriented architecture should
have been done in the first place I'd
most ly agree with that you know I think
it's sort of like this you think about
so alright like at a high level it's
have a bunch of services which is
another way of it's just a form of a
distributed system but what happened is
Sol went off in a particular direction
where you got to have an ESB and you got
to have you got to spend a bunch of
money and you got to use complex
heavyweight protocols and leased from
outside the so a community it kind of
got this incredibly bad reputation is
just complicated and not quite right so
and then then ironically I actually
don't like the term micro service I said
this in my keynote where the first thing
you hear is micro right which means that
this makes it sound like services must
be small like tiny and which then led to
people same hundred lines of code two
weeks worth of work a rest endpoint it's
created so much confusion and so I would
like ideally you should just it would be
nice to just use the term
service-oriented architecture except
that would not sell right you know it
really is it really because so I have
such negative connotations it need in
order to get the attention that it
deserves this architectural style needed
a new label this afternoon you're doing
a very special thing for those of you
who aren't able to make it to New York
for this event or to hear Chris's
keynote address you're going to be doing
a reddit asking me anything session
that's coming up at 1:00 p.m. this
afternoon have you ever done anything
like this book I have not I am I'm
actually super curious to see what it's
like what sort of questions do you
typically get about micro services and
your particular perspective on micro
services what was what let's say that
the most frequently asked question you
get about micro services
well I mean I suppose the questions all
over the place like actually right off
to the keynote someone asked me well
what about the the presentation layer
how the micro-services fit into the
architecture of a wet of sort of a
front-end web application because often
they're talked about in the context of
back-end services and then it's in in
reality you can functionally decompose
the front-end as well into a set of
smaller web application so that you know
that that's an extremely common question
and then other than that it's more like
you get questions on on definition what
what is the micro servers architecture
right and or what is a micro service and
so it's sort of they're all over the
place
well we'll see what kind of questions
you get this afternoon for more detail
on that follow at Oracle devs on Twitter
we'll be tweeting out information on how
you can actually access that reddit AMA
session for more information about
Oracle code events coming up in there is
another 17 cities left in this tour go
