The Container native application
development workshop in this lab we're
gonna containerize our first java micro
service and to do this we're gonna
assume the persona of our DevOps
engineer chip chips gonna do a couple
things in this lab first he's gonna
connect out the github and fork our Java
micro service code base next he'll
connect into worker and build his first
workflow inside of the workflow will
create several pipeline steps to build
test and publish this code base into the
docker registry to begin with today
we're going to use our Linux client
image just as a baseline so everyone can
have the same experience in lab and
we're gonna start by connecting two into
github inside of github we're gonna sign
in to our own personal account and we
show you how to create one of these
accounts if you don't have one but for
the sake of time today I'm just going to
connect in as myself and the first thing
I'm gonna do is fork the Twitter feed
micro service codebase so go ahead and
click the fork button
now what's worked we can open
new tab and we're gonna connect into
worker if you don't have a worker
account we show you how to create that
as well but for the sake of time today I
will connectiveness myself
now once inside worker one of the things
that you're gonna want to check is that
your settings are configured correctly
so you'll go to your settings tab and
get connections and make sure that
you're connected to your github account
where you fork the code earlier after
that we're gonna add an application
we're gonna select github as a
repository we're gonna choose our
Twitter feed codebase and click Next
we'll keep our defaults here and finally
we'll click create
alright we have our first application
now if we click on the workflows tab we
can see that workers tying into github
and we're gonna actually now build our
first pipeline step
so our pipelines
this case will be called push release
all right now as we move forward we're
gonna add a new step to a workflow and
this time we're gonna select our push
release pipeline now we're gonna go back
out to github and one of the things
we're gonna do is create a new file this
will be our configuration file called
worker DML it'll contain all the steps
that we need to execute for our pipeline
application a couple things to notice
here you notice the very first piece
there the very first step is called a
box what this is doing is reaching out
to docker he'll have been telling it to
grab the open JDK image and that's we're
going to use as our starting point for
creating this container next we're gonna
execute a build and you may remember
seeing this on our page and our build is
simply gonna install maven into the box
and then do a maven clean assembly on
our code base itself now if we scroll
down the page and hit commit this file
worker will actually monitor github and
it'll spawn this workflow to execute as
soon as it sees a new commit so to view
this execution taking place we can
actually click on our runs tab and we
can see the build running now this build
will fail because we haven't configured
our push release yet but we just wanted
you to see it
executing or see its tie-in from worker
to get now at any point in time you can
click into the build itself and you can
see the various steps that you defined
in your yem will file
now to proceed to our push release one
of the things we're going to need to do
is set up some environment variables
that will enable us to connect into
docker hub there's six variables that
we'll need to create here
and once created we can proceed into a
new tab and actually connect into docker
hub itself if you don't have an account
we show you how to create one but if you
do have an account you simply need to
login
and create a new repository a repository
name will be Twitter - feed
and here we can see it's created once
it's created let's go back into github
and we're gonna go back into our yeah
mol file and add a few steps so we'll
click on the pencil icon there and we're
gonna paste in some more execution code
in this case we're gonna paste in what
we want to happen for our push release
now one of the things that I want you to
notice here is that we do have a command
in there called internal docker push
this is a command written inside of
worker that will take everything and
push it up into a new image on docker
hub now we're going to commit our
changes and we'll go back to worker and
watch this run once again
there's our build here's our push
release executing and we can see it
pushed everything up into docker hub
successfully and if we go back to docker
hub and just refresh the page real quick
or click on the tags we can see that we
have a new image up there that's 318
megabytes that concludes lab 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
