this morning and thank you so much for
oracle for bringing all these people
together I am Justin Herman and I work
for an organization called the u.s.
General Services Administration which
has anybody heard of GSA before all
right yeah we are the government agency
for government agencies that helped work
across government in order to support we
think of other agencies as our customers
I work for an organization called the
technology transformation service which
again is a subset of GSA that focuses
specifically on bringing agencies
together and creating shared solutions
around technology and practical
application of innovations within that
and actually we can get into it
immediately is so what we're talking
about today and so hey this is going to
be probably the least technical
presentation you're going to hear today
there's going to be a lot of colors
involved I am NOT super coder number one
nor am I the best data scientist in the
world
what I have is business cases and I have
business needs and opportunities for
anybody in this room to participate in
them and ones that you might not have
heard about it before because it's brand
new in fact this is the current headline
news that's up there right now and no
side deck it existed yet for this
program so we put some together we're
going to talk about this kind of walk
you through how we got to where we are
today and hopefully get some feedback
and discussion going on what else we can
do together on this so specifically
within GSA's technology transformation
service I work for a new program called
the emerging citizen technology program
which specifically is leading
coordinating government-wide programs
around artificial intelligence for
citizen services virtual and augmented
reality as well as social technology so
I kind of work for black mirror for
government if you're familiar with that
show who's seen black mirror before
pratense every time someone's like I saw
an episode of black mirror about this in
fact I can't even enjoy it for that very
purpose but the idea is what do you
think of what I do or
or what we do when you think about
public services that do not involve
websites specifically public facing ones
that citizens are interacting with and
that's my new purview and this is the
first project which just as a teaser
will we'll get to it eventually
so what I do and what I have is this
emerging citizen tech program is I
combined between the three of them unite
around 1,500 federal technologists and
growing every day
everyone from the CIA to the post office
and everybody in between is who we bring
together and oftentimes again it's
creating the networks and the programs
that unite career public servants ones
who have 10 20 or more years left in
their Federal service and we when we
work across the board like that we're
able to identify what are those real
trends what are those business needs
that individually agencies have and then
we analyze that and that's what we when
we create the new policies that's when
we create the new shared services to
address what ultimately comes from the
individual participation of all of these
government agencies and just to note and
it'd be a whole nother presentation is
that's just one small subsection of what
we cover and you'll see actually some of
the other programs that we have
throughout the course of the
presentation so specific things that we
have to answer it's like how many people
have worked with the government before
so often they say well you know
government lags behind and we're afraid
of change and things like that it's not
exactly like that all the time because
we do have as you know of different
standards which in which we're trying to
employ emerging technologies that have
to be met often time businesses and
especially the ones who are new to the
space don't have an understanding of
what all those different little
subsections and policies that we have to
follow is which is why often times we
have a breaking point so that's why one
of the things that I do is not just work
with government agencies but come out
talk to companies or private sector
needs and try to communicate so you know
all the subtle nuances of how to get
from point A to point B and getting your
technology into the hands of age
season the hands of citizens so
specifically I try to look at what makes
it more effective we work with agencies
on developing performance analysis
systems you know performance measurement
etc how do we make it more transparent
record-keeping archiving things like
that and also accessibility not just
multilingual or multi-platform platform
services but right down to plain
language and this as you can imagine
these three tenets are very challenging
oftentimes for government agencies when
you're dealing with interacting with the
public or creating accessible websites
so that's what we help agencies with and
of course we have to look at things like
the federal Records Act Freedom of
Information Act Americans with
Disabilities Act and through all those
things that some people look as hurdles
if public services aren't looking at
these standards and we aren't adhering
to it nobody else will and so what we do
is we take all of the best technology
that we see in the private sector we
look and we match it with what are the
things that we have to adhere to and
then whether it's creating training
resources toolkits policies no matter
what it is we then work together to
deliver on that now an example of this
is the US public participation playbook
which was a standard where we had I
think it was about ten different things
that any US government agency could look
at in order to improve their engagement
with the public whether it's irregular
excess to open data there pretty
Universal things and what we were able
to do is get I forgot the number up
there but I know that is a lot of
government agencies that signed on and
have their logos on it so when we talk
about often a difficulty in bringing
government together around emerging tech
it is very possible when done the right
way so the story of how I'm getting back
to the the artificial intelligent
personal assistant pilot that we just
launched is one of the things we have is
the u.s. digital registry which I mean
how do you know that a government
website is a legitimately government
website well it ends in like governing
often time
you know there's there's certain basic
key giveaways but right now there are
tens of thousands of publicly managed
federal government sites everything from
on sacre de github twitter facebook
across the board and traditionally there
was no way to actually people could
verify independently that things were
officially government accounts so we
built this thing called the u.s. digital
registry which is an API generating
repository to do just that and at that
time I think we thought we had like
three or four thousand different daily
active public facing accounts and then
we found out we had ten thousand at that
quickly got to ten thousand now this is
ten thousand sparklers and but as you
know the data behind that is explosive
because it's actually we started gauging
about a million daily citizen
interactions like comments questions
shares and actually more the problem was
is there was a it was an emergency that
happened in one of the states earlier in
this year and people were going online
to try to ask for help but then it was
like 30,000 people today and so the
question became it was easy for us to
put up ways in which to track that but
how do you make that digestible how do
you make that operational these were the
challenges because the in a way the
success of digital government itself and
the initiatives that we had created the
new burden which is a much you know much
more information that we could possibly
and meaningfully process in a short a
period of time so looking at the backend
what we did so this is actually what the
inside of the registry looks like and as
you can see you know whether it's by
platform you're able to go in now we're
able to track again every citizen
interaction that happens I never I never
even knew until we had this how popular
voice of America's in Burma sometimes
it's more popular than the White House
and NASA combined on a daily basis it's
that sort of analysis that until we had
this API generating repository we were
never able to capture this much
information
but again so the quiet men also of
course we're able to do track every
single post in real time that comes out
and from the government in every
language around the world again much
much stuff more than we could possibly
handle at that particular time so then
the challenge could be alright so what
are we doing with this data then what
are what are we making it useful for
because it's not just those public
facing accounts that we had also in our
office we have analytics usa.gov that
anybody heard of that before
basically this track so people all the
web traffic that's going on for websites
around the government so you can see of
course usually the top pages as where's
my refund during tax season sometimes if
there's a hurricane National Weather
Service will go to the top again it is a
voluminous source of data that we are
now able to capture we're able to put in
a nice spreadsheet not a spreadsheet but
a nice dashboard like this but when
combining it with that other data source
from the registry the potential that we
saw was staggering on it I mean also in
our office we have data gov has anyone
heard of data.gov before it's the
repository so you see a growing trend
here is that we started identifying and
realizing that we've gotten to the point
where we had so much data it's so much
potential around it and so what can we
do next right down to also the search
program the search bar is the government
agencies use that's in our office as
well and so at our fingertips was just
really voluminous amounts of data and
what could we do well how can we make
that actionable and digestible and new
ways the idea specifically and I don't
have it this mapped out in the slide is
we would call the no wrong door approach
that right now it's like you if you need
to access a public service you might
call on the phone you might send an
email you might post a question on
Facebook you can you know there's no
shortage of things but ultimately it all
goes to their own little silos in the
background and maybe if somebody's
generous enough to share spreadsheet
with somebody else they can see that
what we want to do in our goal is to
create a unified back end and that
whether you call whether you do any of
this it all goes into the same system
that then makes it actionable and
digestible and it becomes there is no
wrong door in which a citizen can seek
to access a public service and not only
is there a new wrong door but that each
one each large or small is treated
meaningfully and equally so this was the
concept we started bandying around so we
went to agencies and so we launched the
emerging citizen technology group which
now has we have about 200 just active
daily federal Managers on this
particularly you always thought okay in
our goals of trying to move into that
that future of having that unified
backend which also something that we're
working on is bringing into the
enterprise a eye augmentation of call
centers there's all these small cases
that we've looked at that are a part of
building the pieces of the puzzle in
place and opening up that data and
making it actionable so one of the
things that we talked about there'd be
an easy win is because we have all that
we we can break it down every time
somebody's trying to ask a question how
they're trying to ask it and through all
these different platforms we've gotten
to realize that what we needed is our
more automation and more self-service
capabilities because the future of
accessing public services is not going
through websites again going to the back
thing of working in everything but
websites in that sense it so what we
wanted to do is use all of that data
that we had use the business cases that
we have and start putting automated
self-service programs into home smart
assistants so that is actually what got
announced on Friday and was in the news
we show today that we now have a pilot
program that's launched with about
twenty four government agencies right
now to start using their data in order
to within a month or so put to market in
Amazon Alexa Microsoft Cortana
um ballistic yeah there's a larger list
on there but ultimately this isn't again
we have to be agnostic to who we're
working with on this so anybody can
actually do this and like the last
presentation he said what you got to do
is you got to work in the open that is
what we're seeking to do on this because
right now there is no government
resources that exist to guide people
into this future of personal and home
assistance and devices like that so we
have to create it and how we've chosen
to create it is through rapid pilot
programs that essentially step by step
push government agencies into the pool
and then we discover along the way okay
these are the different requirements
that we have in order to get to the next
phase so right now what we're working on
is it's simple read-only use of publicly
available data in simplest terms it will
employ a natural language processing of
course but it's not like you're getting
a personalized service specifically for
you that would be phase two in order to
get to Phase two we're going to need
policy we're going to need resources
we're going to need guidance and the way
that we're going to get there is through
phase one which is the first step so
it's iterative pilot development in
order to drive that into that future so
again and I said this before and you
probably gathered right now I'm not
super coder number one but what we have
and what we've been working on now for
months is the refinement of business
cases in the federal government of what
are those things that because one of the
things quickly people say is like well
Justin are you chasing the tail of you
know new technology and or it's
difficult sometimes because again people
will think that you're going into
something because it's the latest and
greatest and often times a couple times
with agencies we've got to tell them you
see you're acting like your problem is
that you're not using this technology
yet when you should have a problem
that's well-defined that just so happens
to possibly be addressable through AI or
machine learning or through virtual and
augmented reality and then that's
something that we can better test so
we've had a series of workshops over the
last like say four months
in fact and the first one that we had on
this our big partner on it who came in
and talked to agencies was Oracle
surprisingly enough that's why I'm here
today
to return the favor of course but the
idea again is that these advances and
what we're going to be working on it's
not going to come from government
leading the way on this what is our job
to do is to refine those business cases
open this up and so anyone in this room
can help provide the solution to that
and hopefully profit and I call it
actually the golden triad or golden
triangle where it's our data your
solutions measurably help citizens if we
can connect all three of those that is a
very good day for us in that sense and
so what we actually have now in the
business side in each agency so then is
good is unique on this and because a lot
of times people are looking for a
standard responsive well how do I take
care of this how do I get into that but
the reality is that of course even
within some offices there's different
unique business needs and so we're in
the process now of refining refining
refining and that's actually the first
stage of this pilot program because the
other two of course being first is to us
to identify and refine those business
cases to is to make sure that the data
supports a solution to that problem that
we have actually because the easiest
part after that is actually building the
damn things which ultimately could
probably be done with two pizzas in a
six pack over a weekend so and a lot of
it we even said so some agencies wanted
to rush forward with it and we had to
say no that's one thing for like you to
get somebody to do it for you or it
rushes off over the weekend but for us
to establish through a pilot go through
the necessary due processes communicate
that publicly have 24 agencies at once
doing it across five platforms that's
going to send a message that's going to
send a message that we are here we're
making an investment in this space we
know what we're doing and we're ready to
work with people on it and now we could
also be a trusted responsible partner in
working on this
so that is the plan one of the methods
that we're actually looking at for
achieving this and there's obviously
many more because one is we do pilot
programs like we have right now another
thing of course we can look at is prizes
and competitions does anybody ever
participate in like a hackathon or a
data jam or some some Palooza of some
nature alright and a lot of it too and
the frustrations you hear often of
course is that it's either people feel
it's people trying to get free work or
there was no lasting outcomes out of it
I mean there's common criticisms that
you can hear on this but so luckily
challenge gov which brings together
agencies to much better improve their
outcomes and processes for prizes and
competitions exists and it actually is
in our office as well so what we're able
to do and increasingly agencies are
looking at how can we leverage the prize
and competition model to open it up for
civic innovators in order to provide
these different solutions one of the
ways and I think particularly this is
going to be important is because there's
so few proofs of concept there's I mean
when it comes to the let's say Amazon
elects or Google assistant an agency
hasn't done this yet so there's no way
and what I don't know about your
organization's but the first thing when
we try to do something new people ask
well where is an example of where this
has been done before so it's
increasingly data oh it's kind of
difficult right now so will we have to
do is prime the pump in over the way and
one of the ways to do that is a prize or
competition in order to just show
through proofs of concept what's
possible once we have those done were
able to develop analytics frameworks
around it for a performance for
accessibility etc and then that provides
the critical element pieces that then
allow managers to more significantly
invest budget which I'm sure it's
private sector people you would prefer
if people paid money for things
he's smiling over there he knows what
I'm talking about all right so so what's
next and actually we've been going
through a little bit more quickly than I
saw it
so what's next is we're looking at this
is one small subsection this pilot which
we hope to get done in like a month or
so really was just the first stage and
it's actually not the only thing we're
also looking at introducing immediately
again ai augmentation of call centers
which will then open up that level
because again and it's not replacing per
se and like a question we often get is
you know around automation replacing
people's jobs well we're looking at
right now is just things that we were
never capable of doing so it's helping
people it's AI for augmentation to allow
managers to be able to to crunch things
that they've never were able to before
I'll give you an example of a business
case just around call centers that kind
of makes it clear so figure in federal
call centers there's two tiers of
questions first here commonly asked
stuff and in fact 70% of the questions
that often get received by agencies is
the same ten questions that the second
tier is subject matter expertise
questions that require somebody with
that to be able to help now we see what
we see is like sometimes as much as
thirty only thirty five percent of the
tier two questions get gone to
completion because people are bogged
down with things that should be
automatically answered for them so
that's the particular case that we're
looking at with this is how can we take
that 70 percent of citizen questions or
comments or needs and automate that as
much as possible so that when it does is
it frees up the humans to cover the in
depth things that had did not happen
before between that our other pilot what
we're really looking for is we're
actually spending and connecting with
agencies as much as we can to get people
in the same room to find out what's
available and what's legitimate some
challenges we face of course than this I
is so I just mentioned the call center
example so you bring in a company
and all of a sudden they try to sell you
everything and it usually is a AI with a
human interface that is a it's always a
woman as well the interface we see
there's like general ways in which
people try to sell and market these
products but it's not following whatever
we have discrete business cases in which
we're able to then slowly build up our
capabilities on it so we need to
basically create more opportunities to
bring business in together with
government one of the ways that I'm
hoping to do this so we now have just a
monthly in-person forum for federal
agencies to come together to share and
talk about where the field of AI for
citizen services is going what we're
going to hope to be announcing soon not
announcing but just to implement is for
every other month to invite industry
into GSA so you can meet the people
working on it within government you can
share what's new what's going on with
your companies and it doesn't become
some guessing game where you're hunting
through business cards and trying to
stitch together who does what but again
that we have that partnership between
government and industry working and
building together because also just as
much as government needs these
technologies in my conversations with
companies they desperately want
practical use cases oftentimes a number
of times talk to companies who have
something that could only be seen in the
the prism of entertainment or in our
domain or other things and so the idea
that public services are daily used this
is something incredibly practical that
will serve a purpose in somebody's life
is a very attractive model for them so
that's the thing we want to make it as
easy for you to get involved in this
space so then you've got great wins out
it because when you when we win on this
as well and that ideas hopefully will in
once we've done this talk if anybody can
share anything on that you're more than
welcome to so that being said what can
we do together a lot of what we do when
we're when we're talking and bringing
agencies together with
companies he's discussing well but I
always that so so what's your appetite
for more of this yes you have a
presentation yes you have something to
share but this is this is so new for us
and there's so much need in fact just by
getting into this I'm pretty sure I'm
not going to have a slow week for for a
good long time because there's no
resources that exist and you know
there's nothing but business need on our
end for it so the question of course
then becomes what is the best way that
we can move forward and judiciously do
that of course within all the bounds of
proprietary that we that we have to
follow and I don't know the answer to
that yet because and I'm hoping we can
be surprised on that because again it is
only together is how we're going to be
able to move forward on this in a good
way and I promise you we have no
shortage of support to able to launch
pilot organize agencies really whatever
is needed we have it at our disposal to
do it so if we have a nice little nice
little saying that may live a thousand
years and never sit on a panel talking
about the future of tomorrow what we
damn well should have delivered today
and so I put that challenge to the
people who are here today to talk about
this because this is real we are moving
forward we want to invest in this we
need you at the table in order to do it
so that being said is there any
questions on anything I've talked about
or covered or even the details of the
pilot itself or anything in general I've
never talked on this before so I'm still
trying to engage facial expressions on
various things I'm saying yes
so this is the this is the exact thing
that we're trying to build or identify
what's in place part of it I is that
there could be mechanism for some even
larger companies you would understand
this is that sometimes the answer is
already in your house and it's the fact
of that you know but the federal
government's a pretty big place so what
we're trying to look at is a identifying
what already exists
what can we strengthen what can we
expand or what has to be created in
general and I mean part of it too is is
a Oracle code day bringing people
together we're getting to share all this
stuff for the first time now and go
directly to you to talk about it more
organizer there there was one one
company that we talked to and I said so
what's your appetite for for leading in
this space and they go what we do and we
do an annual conference on one of this
event every year and I was like are you
kidding okay I'll try to remember that
in 365 days but what are we doing right
now we like what what are those
sustained investments of time and
leadership because like I said it just
it doesn't exist too much right now
we're not in an organized way and so
again we can bring people to the table
we can bring ideas business cases but we
need companies also to come to that
table all right yes sir
yes well that's exactly what we're doing
so emergency alerts things like that so
we're getting in that process now but
again the idea ultimately is that we
might never have to build something
again because all of a sudden once
there's proof of concepts out there
people have an understanding that this
is possible they'll know that we are we
will make the data available we will
customize an API whatever is really
needed to do that as long as it's
presented as you know we need this done
a lot of times people make assumptions
about what government can and can't do
and that's a limiting factor again
because like if you came and you're like
hey I'd love to have an alert system and
do this I need this framed a certain way
I bet you that person's you would make
their day you know what I mean if they
got to change things up a little bit and
be able to show the practical use I mean
that's fantastic but oftentimes what
people will do is either say well things
are the way they are and they're not
going to change or this is just this
isn't formulated how I need it to be
formulated without thinking on the other
side of the computer is people you know
I mean or are people just like you or
you know or may who or be so happy to
work with you and make the changes on
that so yeah that's the this is the type
of thing that's coming and hopefully out
of it there'll be a greater
understanding on both sides for that I
mean because maybe the findings that
we'll have at the end of the pilot is
say that we don't have to be submitting
this stuff that we've successfully proof
of concept it and opened it for for
anybody to do it it's like the model
with with whether people be like oh well
why isn't the weather service lead on
this every single weather app that
exists relies on National Weather
Service data so it's like the business
cases and their per se because people
who are already using it there
in fact everybody who uses I mean
everybody in this room uses National
Weather Service data every single day
and oftentimes will go and be like okay
to use government data every day like
most people won't raise their hand
that's actually the best is if we could
open stuff up and make solutions so
voluminous like you can't even avoid
them if you need them and there's
multiple different ways that you can
access it there's no wrong door to it
that's the best outcome all right is
there any more questions what about this
guy right here yeah all right ok he's
promised me a softball question yes yes
so actually what you can do is my email
is Justin Herman at gsa.gov but
ultimately again we want to create ways
in which you have regular access to this
and that agencies are making it
available so it's not having to email
through May but you can directly go
through the source and that's something
that of course people have been working
on for years and we just hope to make
that more available in new ways awesome
so any other questions I or we can leave
like 10 minutes early
no this is this is hot and new in fact
it would that headline that I showed you
is the current headline and so yeah so
this is like I said this has been
incredibly new and we are just launching
this as well and so if there's even
ideas on how to improve the pilot itself
we can change that on the spot really
whatever we have to do to tee this up
for a success and even if a success and
I said it is that Google and Amazon and
all of them reject every one of our
concepts that will still give us
learning opportunities in order to go
back and kick the tires on it so
ultimately the success of this pilot
isn't just going to be what we bring to
market but it's that creating that
roadmap and creating that baseline
capability that we can then build from
and build from yes yeah well though so
we don't handle personally identifiable
information so the data that you're
specifically talking about would not be
included in this that being said in
future iterations if you wanted to say
like where's my tax return update my
health benefits or where my VA benefits
that will require levels of
personalization we are not touching that
yet because again we want to very
methodically go about this so that
people know that we're doing due process
and they can see it because we're doing
this in the transparent manner and that
there's all opportunity for people to
raise the questions and make sure that
we're covering all the bases on it but
that's actually going to be some great
some great level of services once we get
get to that as well I mean ultimately
because what we're doing right now is
what's going to be pumped into your
self-driving cars this is going to be in
the devices
and this is inevitable one of the
easiest things actually was was deciding
to launch this because the need
identified by government agencies was so
overwhelming I thought I'd be lucky if
six agencies came for I don't know if
you've heard lately there's changes
going on and so I thought if I could get
even six agencies and they're probably
gonna be my friends and I'm gonna have
to like wrangle them in to get be like
we'll be part of this that would have
been huge I stopped counting after two
dozen because it's like I said is
there's such a clear case for this more
so actually I felt terrible because here
I thought I was trying to do something
innovative and then once again I feel
like I'm actually already behind on this
and it reads like why didn't we do this
last year and again well part of it too
is that the availability of technology
from the private sector that allows this
to be possible basically is allowing us
to tackle these problems for the first
time and that's what makes it so
exciting that's why we have to develop
in the open on this because we want to
make sure that as the private sector
technology grows we grow with it in
anything that we can do again is
providing helpful business cases use
cases policies guidance we're going to
do one organization that I sit on now is
the National Science Technology Council
subcommittee for machine learning in AI
said anybody read the report preparing
for an AI future that came from the
White House all right so I'd actually
say to check out and Google the National
Science Technology Council committee for
machine learning and AI and read some of
the reports that have come out because
what that body is is the head of AI
machine learning for each government
agency on the steering committee so we
get together and it's like the head for
State Department DoD the I see myself
apartment of Transportation and what
we're working together right now in
Zwolle AI for citizen services the thin
sliver of what we know is a much deeper
deck
I we're all covering one of the bases
and we're all trying to basically
identify what are the next steps for it
yes the National Science and Technology
Council Subcommittee on machine learning
and AI actually in Africa one of the
great challenges that we also have it's
terminology because every company's got
their own clever spin on how they want
to frame things and so generally if I'm
talking with a business the first five
minutes is just like okay what do you
call this what do you call that because
it's also common terms so you could have
a conversation with somebody and happy
having two different conversations in
their mind and that's one of the things
that they ask in government often
they're like we should be pursuing
universal standards for this like okay
not today
success is that obviously probably you
know I mean it's not our role to do but
that's one of the challenges of course
we face is the differences in
terminology here I know when I first
shared this with my team that we were
working on this there was a huge debate
about what is AI that went on and I was
like I can't believe you know they mean
that this is happening it's like so the
way we like we want to strip the the
terminology from it like when we went to
South by Southwest this year and in the
expo eighty percent of the Expo that
they had itself by Southwest was either
AI empowered software virtual or
augmented reality it was enough where
you get the idea that what software is
being created that doesn't have an AI
component to it large or small so some
people actually say it's super
superfluous we shouldn't even we should
just be referring to software we just be
referring to whatever and just make the
assumption that there's AI to one
varying degree or another included in
everything again these are conversations
that we've got to have but it can't
distract from the fact that we are
moving forward on this and want to start
cranking out practical applications
all right so no more questions left no
more I saw an episode of black mirror on
this before because that'd be the first
time all right awesome well thank you so
much everyone thank you again Oracle for
coming today for having us come today
and hopefully if you have any questions
just let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
