who've managed by mean this was
admittedly a bit far out there for
presentation so but it's good to see
some of you here this presentation is
going to be about how you can build your
own autonomous robotic vehicle and the
various techniques I used to build that
particular one that's over there and
yeah so that you can do the same thing
yourself so that is coffee is named
coffee because he runs java and then he
looks a bit like wall-e with this laser
rangefinder so of course he had to be
called coffee and I did this project for
fun to do it with my kids I mean that
was the idea anyways my kids hated so
you know from that point of view maybe
not such a stellar success but yeah so
this is a coffee running autonomously an
earlier version of coffee and you're
going to hear my my son scream in
Swedish that he doesn't want coffee to
be anyway anywhere near him I don't
think we hear anything but yeah anyways
so yeah it was he's bit terrified I
think he most probably a little bit too
young when we did this project so was
five so can't really blame him but yeah
it was very close that I couldn't get
coffee in here and because Swiss an
airline basically said well kindly note
that it looks like a tank and therefore
the authorities that the airport might
reach a different decision and Swiss has
an airline kind of guarantee anything on
our end so and it's ridiculous it's like
yeah of course so I had to reconfigure
him he doesn't use tracks here at
javaone because the friction between the
tracks and mats were too much so
he doesn't look as cool but you know he
can still work you know do his thing ok
so there are two main goals with this
presentation the first one is share the
fun because it is hilarious fun to have
your Java applications or programs run
around in the physical reality and
interact with things it's it's hilarious
especially when you have bugs I mean you
really do get to see the bugs so so so
that's a lot of fun and it's not really
that hard anymore and so key message
here is that you can go home and build
these yourselves and I'm going to
provide very pragmatic pointers about
where to go what to buy things like that
I'm the second key messages this all
becomes so much easier when you're using
flight recorder so I used it for fun and
it turns out it was best thing ever for
this project so i'm going to talk about
that and it's unsupported in jdk nine so
what I'm going to show you are
unsupported api's just so you know in
jail ek9 they are going to change so
they will be supported and it would be a
slightly different set of API is much
easier to use but it is just so so very
useful that I thought you know I just
want to share this now and then you're
on your own if you use them but you know
they are useful and yeah so to
disclaimers robotics is not my field of
expertise I did this for fun I'm
hobbyist there are probably other ways
you can do this probably much better and
the second disclaimer is I will be
mentioning different companies by name
that is to be pragmatic to just tell you
where you can get stuff these companies
are not by enemies endorsed by Oracle I
don't get any compensation whatsoever
from them I'm you know these are good
stuff that I think is worth knowing
about when you build these things
so mostly sensors engines and stuff like
that okay and since I usually say more
than I intend I have this safe harbor
slide which is mandatory if you're
talking about future functionality in
the Java platform and i don't think i am
going to but i might so just for safety
I i'm putting that there so this is the
agenda i'm going to be talking first
about building hardware for for java and
you know what versions of Java there
might be and that you might want to
consider for your project I'm going to
be talking about designing stuff for for
3d printing because there are several
things in them that are 3d printed I
will be talking about how to record
sensor and actuator information into the
flight recorder i will also maybe talk a
little bit about some unsupportive
functionality in Mission Control that
you can use to plug this into and then
I'm going to talk about some of the
results and some future ideas work that
I would like to have time for but never
ever will I think we'll see so the
brains and nobody can escape the
Raspberry Pi revolution I mean you all
know like like II know that there is
these miniature full full a full size
full computers credit card sized I mean
credit card sized index why not set and
they are thicker than a credit card they
have quite a lot of memory so 1 gig of
ram a powerful for core arm processor
and they run linux and you get these
pretty cheap so and you have all the
ports you could could need so you have
GPIO port see on purpose I o ports you
have serial ports everything you would
need to build your hardware project in
coffee there is a raspberry pi 2 so 0.9
gigahertz quadrant v7 there is now
raspberry PI's 3 which has built-in
wireless and and one point to eat
carrots quad and then there is this
smaller small form factor
raspberry pi is zero which just has a
single core so i used the raspberry pi
for for the brains and there are several
reasons why and this slide is describes
one reason so when you build your
embedded system you can select between
java SE embedded or Java ME embedded and
Java ME embedded is optimized for small
devices so devices with less than one
Meg as a 108 k they have really pleasant
libraries for for communicating with the
hardware I mean there are more
object-oriented inning in a way then
then the thin layer that you otherwise
need to use thin Jane I layer then you
have java SE embedded you get teared
compilation you get your relational GC
you get multi core support you get to
use Java Nigel concurrency you have the
flight recorder but you need to access
the hardware through this small thin
native library called wiring wearing pie
so the Java libraries pie for j is using
another library underneath and that's
sort of the trade-off of course I work
with job s embedded so that's what I'm
going to use if for nothing else flight
recorder then we need to have sensors we
have a brain we need to have some
sensors and since we are going to be
running java i avoided or tended to
avoid sensors that required timing
sensitive decoding in java because yeah
you get to GC then you're screwed so
sometimes that's not really possible
sometimes you have this sensor that you
just want to use anyway and then there
are several different paths you can take
one is to write your own library in c
and and to the decoding there use it as
a module and
that's something that I did not for that
project but for another project when I
wanted to use a Korean sensor that had
humidity and temperature and had its own
one wire protocol so you know that's
that's certainly doable or you can use a
pic or some other thing like an Arduino
Nano to do the decoding and then use ITC
or some other protocol to read the
results so for instance at home I have
nor do I new nano decoding pulse width
modulation signals from radio receiver
and then I can read from that arduino
nano using I to see and you know do the
decoding somewhere else right so in
coffee for that thing you don't need any
of this I mean you have I to see a
module that you can use in raspbian and
that's what you need i'm using well i'm
using stereo as well but cereal and and
i just see that's all you need so don't
need to write any native code for this
to work so the sensory sing coffee is a
laser rangefinder and this is so cool
you can get a laser rangefinder for 89
bucks now I mean this was unthinkable a
couple of years ago so so this one is
from a company called lighter light but
they they've been acquired by Garmin so
you can't buy them right now I think
they said that there would be a new
laser rangefinder available later this
year but a lighter light v3 so it should
be available very soon and that thing
talks I to see so you know you just wire
it up and use it very easy and then i'm
using a breakout board from Adafruit
which is an IMU breakup board inertial
measurement unit and it contains a
magnetometer an accelerometer gyro send
a barometer in one very small package so
this is something that you can use to
for instance make sure that you turn
exactly the number of degrees you want
to get to turn and and you can use it
for controlling it even I used to use
the accelerometers for for you know
deciding when to go into autonomous mode
I just switch it over so that you know
you got G downwards in the wrong axis
and you know that was a signal for you
to start running autonomously or you
know when I lift it fast it goes off of
autonomous mode because that means i had
a pocket it ran into the wall or
something lift it up it stops for right
now I I'm not using it for that but yeah
certainly possible then I have a GPS in
in it the GPS I'm talking to over cereal
there are some things that you need to
do with raspbian to to to make that work
but i'll talk about that later and then
i have a camera as well so there's a
camera module so that i can get images
right now I'm just streaming whatever I
see I'm not processing the image at all
i'm relying on the laser rangefinder for
navigation ok so then you of course want
it to do something you won't have
actuators in the robot and there are
several different ones that you might
want to consider servos is the most
popular one so it's the same thing with
service service as with sensors you
really want to have something that
doesn't require you to do timing
sensitive encoding of signals in java
for the same reason so there is for
instance this chip from nxp
semiconductors the pc a 96 85 it
contains its own timer so it can
generate pulse width modulation signals
you just configure it you know I want
the signal to go high at this time I
want it to be this long and I want you
to go down afterwards and then it's just
going to generate that signal until is
tell it to do something different which
is excellent when you're running java
then you want motors and for motorists
you need to start considering what your
demands are for the robot
speed how fast do you want it to turn
what torque requirements do you have
this thing is overpowered so it's crazy
overpowered you could put it anywhere
and it's just going to tear itself out
of it so you might not need to go that
far but you know you you there there i
am i'm using metal gear motors so you
can select the gear ratio you know there
are several different ones availables
just you know spend a little time
considering what your requirements are
going to be do some calculations and
then just sitting at the motor then you
need to control the motors and there are
several different ways there too you can
use an h-bridge simple motor controller
breakout board for instance or built
yourself those are usually using just
high low you need to sort of control
them yourself right then you have other
ones that are a little bit more
expensive a little bit more complicated
but they have built in quadrature
encoders and built-in PID controller so
heat has its own control loop built in
which is a time saver so I have one of
those in there i started with having a
quad H bridges 44 so 14 for the motors
and two for the motors and one for the
claw because you can of course operate
that flow as well but now i'm using one
of those slightly more complicated motor
controllers for controlling the the
motors and using quadrature encoders the
video you saw in the beginning that
scared the living daylights out of my
son and you didn't hear that audio
unfortunately but if you would have you
would have heard me laughing so that's
how bad parent I am you know scaring
kids is fun but but that one wasn't
using quadrature encoders at all so you
don't need it but it's much better when
you start looking at things
I can slam simultaneous location and
mapping algorithms then you at least
have a pretty good idea of how far
you've you've gone okay motors in coffee
i'm using at 25 millimeters 12 volt
high-powered below the metal gear motors
with quadrature encoders probably an
overkill then for for the claw I'm just
using the build the the thing that came
with make block going to be talking
about make look a bit little bit later
motor controllers talked about that the
servos i just took to cheap service and
i put the laser rangefinder on them so i
have one servo 44 tilt and 14 pan that's
it works fairly well i mean again these
are cheap cheap service if you buy one
of those three thousand dollar laser
rangefinders it's probably going to have
mirrors in it and have a something
spinning and and and it's going to be
much more precise but that was not my
budget for this project so i'm telling
you how to do this on the cheap okay so
one thing that might be worth noting is
that servos usually have an operating
voltage of five volts if some are
specified to work on six volts as well
and you usually get more torque and you
get em or angular speed so it might be a
good idea to actually have a step down
like regulator for 4 6 volts in your
robot as well so that you can run your
service on six months then for
generating the pulse width so for
generating the signals that you control
the servers a service with I have this
at a fruit 16-channel pwm and breakout
boards i'm not using 16 channels but you
know hey never know might want to have a
cannon on it or something shooting kids
know so then of course you want to
wiring why
everything up and one thing that I wish
I knew before starting all this starting
building things is that those little
things that you used to connect service
are called du Pont connectors so instead
of buying prepackaged you know server
cables of a certain size that's no quite
the dollar you can buy hundreds of
connectors for three dollars on ebay and
then build your own cables as many as
you want to so that's a much better idea
just built by crimp tool and go make
your own cables you get them exactly the
size you want to and it's much much much
cheaper since I fly radio-controlled
aircraft and helicopters and stuff I
wanted to be able to use my standard
batteries so I put xt60 connectors on
them so another pragmatic hint from this
session is when you solder these put
them together first hmm then solder it
will cause your way less pain otherwise
they get you know this misaligned and
too hot so and you can nerd out in terms
of connectors and connectors have a new
circuit boards it's quite fun if you're
a nerdy person so I'm using a lot of
different connectors that one over there
is you know the kind that you usually
have on your PC builds for pw ms and
fans so i'm using all of these side for
you know where they are best and and
this ties very well into my OCD you can
have little sorting boxes with with the
you know connectors for everything so at
home I have connectors capacitors
everything sorted by and by you know
that year okay prototyping with make
blocking so make block is this I think
it was an way crowdsourced thing so it's
like the next generation mechana thing
it says these really smart aluminium
profiles that you can put together and
you have tracks and wheels so it's very
easy to build things like robots and
toys using this so that's what I bought
and so my kids hated the the previous
thing so I built them a radio-controlled
version instead which was much more
appreciated so I think it's a thing
about control the kids want to be able
to control stuff and play with them if
it just runs around all day on its own
it's like so they they just don't get
that so so that's my daughter driving
for that I think it was the very first
time she drove it so she was doing well
now designing parts for 3d printing
nowadays it's actually you have tools
for free really good parametric model
model modelers that you can use for 444
building these things so autodesk fusion
360 is free for hobbyists and you can
just use it which is brilliant so one
thing I learned the hard way to continue
with the pragmatic tips was that of
course you want to parameterize things
that you you want to change afterwards
so things like the server width or is
the server height and similar things you
want to have parameters for that and of
course I did that but I never during the
design phase tried them out so of course
I wanted to have a slightly bigger servo
and of course I change the parameter and
of course everything broke because the
constraints weren't right so if you do
this and try this out when your mobile
you're going to save quite a lot of time
right then you need to design around the
current limits of 3d printing so today
fused filament fabrication is the normal
state of the art sort of printing for
for things that you actually want to use
and just look at and and it has some
limits so the way it works is that the
printer deposits plastic or whatever
material you are using a layer after
layer and if you have a design
that requires you to print into thin air
at some point of course that will not
work so you know it don't just put
things into thin air and exactly the way
you imagined it so there are two things
you can do you can either design around
these limitations and if you do other
people complete your designs because not
everybody has a dual extruder printer so
that is the best thing to do the other
one is to use that you will extruder
printer I have one and use material
called polyvinyl alcohol which is
soluble in water so you can actually
print on top of that material and then
just put into water wait a very very
long time for the material to dissolve
and and and then you have your more
advanced design so I do that sometimes
but very seldomly because I want other
people to be able to print my designs
also printing today is a very slow
process it takes quite some time so it's
actually well worth it i think too when
you build something a little bit more
advanced where you have lots of
different components that need to work
together i think it's a very good idea
to do some mock-ups right so you you lay
out where you have your your geometrical
constraints if for example to the
leftist is where I have my connectors on
one of my custom boards that i use in
coffee then to the right is the make
block aluminium profiles and I model
those so that I could see that
everything fits together and everything
works together before printing it
because printing it you know just the
top is 20 hour thing right so you want
to know that you you that this works so
this is what it looks like inside of the
modeling tool when you have when you're
trying to fit things together and see
what it looks like so i did actually
model you know most of the stuff and
oftentimes you can find models readily
available for you that can just use so
if you have a raspberry pi 2 you can
find a raspberry pi 2 model that you can
just put into your design and see that
everything fits okay so 3d printing yes
takes quite some time the one on the
upper left the top again took 20 hours
to print on fine other parts of the
robot took less but but you know it
still takes some time if the bottom
plate took several hours to print so
these are the parts that makes out the
the brunt of the robot so you have
somewhere to put your ass beep I to
somewhere to slide in your special
special circuit board and you have
little button so that it can control the
the LCD on the back and give it to
commands so even a little holder so that
i can do demos without him running away
okay so let's say you want to do a
project like this a good way to start is
to start small try one chip at a time go
for the I don't know the gyros the
accelerometers whatever you you you find
is the fun ship of the day and then read
the specifications because if you go
online look at blogs you're going to
utilize half of what's available in that
chip I mean my experience is that that
that you there is so much more they can
do if you just read the specs so with
the specifications it's like in the back
of good old Commodore 64 days you know
it's all about peak and poke that's what
you're going to do you're going to
reading stuff from from it and you're
going to be putting values in it to do
things and just read the specifications
to see what you can do it's very well
worth it and also be mindful of logic
and power levels because the Raspberry
Pi is 3.3 volts not five so you know be
careful
and you can buy power converters you can
build them yourself but yeah most of the
things that I I mean you can usually
find things that do what you want at 3.3
volts so it's not a big deal and then
build a little library of abstractions
so if you have a GPS built little
library with with the talks to the gps
the the way you would want to talk to it
in code and you know pretty soon you're
going to have this library of nice
little a black abstractions then you can
go top down again you know start with I
have a tank I wanted to be able to go at
a certain speed and turn and you know
you build that those abstractions from
the top down you know when you do this
in raspbian you might need to label some
modules the i2c protocol isn't enabled
by default and so you need to enable
colonel sport for it that's pretty
easily done and to use the UART port on
the raspberry you need to modify the
boot command line too because it's used
as a terminal so you can just connect
the terminal straight to those pins if
you want to and will be available for
young butta but i wanted to use them for
my for my gps so so that's what you need
to do hmm also own more than one SD card
because you know you might release the
blue smoke out of raspberry in your SD
card might become might happen true
story so you know I've killed one so far
it's pretty good track record since I've
been doing this for a few years now but
but own more than one and once you have
configured the SD card with everything
you need like your SEM your your java
version that you love you have
everything on your SD card you know back
it up back that image up as soon as
you're done so you can start from there
next time
then use an SEM you know standard Java
development please the raspberry pi is
very powerful so you can actually run
things on top of it you can just run B
and C in C into it and even develop you
know on the Raspberry Pi that's how
powerful it is so so that's certainly
possible so Rama desktop if you want to
you can run your ID and your tooling
straight on the Raspberry Pi I think
I've probably done most of the coding on
my Mac so I'm not on the raspberry but
I'm be switching so you know once I've
done the big change to everything you
know I sink the code I run with the new
code and then I have a an eclipse and I
just do minor changes straight off of
the the new code but if I want to code
bulk it's probably not going to happen
on the restroom but it does simplify the
whole run at compile cycle right so
flight recorder on the Raspberry Pi so
flight recorder contains an unsupported
API will be supported in jeddah canine
but in dedicate its unsupported for
creating custom events and this I can't
stress how useful this is this is I mean
when I when I started doing this it's
like the whole game changed it's not
that hard to use JMC is not available in
arm so you can run it locally but
current jamesy on another computer and
just hook up and you can also use the
amex controls just publish a few mbeans
that publish your model and you know
then it can can control it radio control
it remote control the thing if you want
to so I did a few yay make is ambience
but that was only for these the demos I
didn't actually use it when when
developing the robot is just there for
fun now so these are the events I have
and the most important one is
laser scans so getting point information
but I have engine changes I have the
laser scans both one overarching for for
the actual scan so I have a timed event
that tells me how long the actual laser
scan took you know one scan then I have
the individual points that I got from
this from the scan I have events for
navigation so goals and targets I have a
vent for planning so and that I know how
my crazy algorithms for a casting etc
takes so that I don't run into troubles
trouble 11 trying to decide what to do
so here's an example the laser
rangefinders scan event and for those of
you who went to my my presentation
earlier today you can see that it's
slightly more complicated in the old API
but the important thing here is the
relational key so the relational key is
used to connect different kinds of
events together tie them up together so
in this case I'm having asked an ID for
which I can associate all my points to a
certain scan and I'm using that later in
which control to be able to see discrete
scans okay then this is also an
important thing to note company in
comparison to the to the to the new API
and you actually needed to have a public
getter or have the field public that was
necessary in the previous API it's not
no longer necessary in the new one but
back then it was so if you don't get
things to work mmm this might be it
here's the scan point nothing special or
strange you know you get the X you get
to the Y local coffee coordinates and
and then you have the scan ID that
everything is associated with then
generating events is very easy um but
I'm used utilizing a technique that is
not no longer necessary in jeddah canine
by the way but in this case I'm actually
reusing the vent because I know that is
can is always going to be from one one
thread the entire scan you know they can
be initiated from different threads but
one in scan it is going to be done fully
in one thread which means that I can
actually reuse that event so I'm I'm em
for the scan implementation I just said
it and then for every point that I get
I'm just resetting the event and then
setting the data into the vent and then
committing it so a small optimization
that is no longer necessary enjoyed ek9
here is an example command line I'm
starting with commercial features a
flight recorder and the gym ex-agent up
that's it if you want to do this through
command line only or if you want to dump
the recorder with with J command you can
find out how to do that on my blog or
the documentation so then I went further
so I integrated this with Mission
Control which is of course it's even
more unsupported but useful so if you're
interested in how to build that kind of
integration come talk to me afterwards
but I basically built a custom component
that is always going to be a slave of
other components so whatever I selecting
the master component is going to be
forwarded to that slave so I can see the
exact scan and and that is the important
thing right because when I was
developing the algorithms for doing
feature extraction and the algorithms
for for deciding what to do what goes to
pick out I was doing that entirely out
of old data I let the run the robot run
and it was pretty stupid at the time
through my apartment and then I had to
run I had data real sample data from the
laser rangefinder so what I did then is
to just fire up my Mac you know my
development environment on the Mac I was
running the algorithms just inside of
Mission Control instead looking and
seeing what kind of you know results I
would get from my my ray casting you
know does it make sense
you know is the goal it is picking out
of this data sensible and I never I
didn't need to run the robot after that
I mean that was it and once I was done
developing the algorithms just straight
in the client yeah then I just copied
them to the robot and good yeah sure it
works cool so you know seriously use
using flight recorder for this is just
such a wonderful thing okay so I thought
I'd do a few demos so I have coffee here
and it's been on for a while so much
around battery why see how much how L is
doing we'll see he is booted and he's
telling me his IP address please don't
hack him and I'm not going to point him
at you David because I mean I will be
shooting late lasers now and I shouldn't
be shooting them in I height at people I
think so first thing that I'm gonna do
is that I'm going to just ssh into him
and then i'm going to start being see
yes and then I'm just going to hook up
the in situ him
here we go so this is actually you know
my robot time inside inside his brain
now ha and we'll see let me do this Oh
kafi know what did I call that and start
coffee maybe start coffee no oh ok
so now I'm starting coffee so it's an
attention up and ready to scan so I
built this really simple just something
something to to check what's going on on
his side of things that normally not
running with this UI at all but just for
demo purposes it might be fun to have so
I'm going to do a scan out of the
environment and so that's what he's
seeing and he's decided to have a gold
point you know nearing the corner there
and that's where he wants to go when
he's running autonomously and he's
actually running with with various
levels of granularity and depending on
you know how close Easter things and how
how much he thinks he needs more
information he might resort to making a
slower scan when he's running full ahead
of course he doesn't really have time to
scan very very finely right so I'm going
to start Mission Control here and that's
just used I took the liberty to build a
plug in 4 for the console as well so we
can run coffee from here you know
remotely over jmx if you want to and we
can initiate scans and it's all
connected to the same model so if I do
start in driving autonomously which is
going to be crazy he's going to get
really upset now but if if we subscribe
to the model data you're going to see
whatever stuff is doing now and yeah I'm
not getting any closer what's happening
right
so I'm going to stop him right there so
of course Jay mix for control is
probably you know quite fine that's what
you you know having ambien operations
it's not such a big deal you don't do
them that often pick getting a little
bit of data is probably fine too getting
thousands and thousands and thousands
and thousands of scan points Oh jmx this
poor little robot is probably not such a
good idea so what I did was that I built
this integration with Mission Control
the flight recorder so I'm going to open
some whatever we'll see what it is let
me see guess you see that okay so I
built this user interface which by the
way is really quite easy because there
is a built-in GUI builder in Mission
Control so if you want to build and
customize the user interface all you
need to do is to start the GUI builder
and then you can you know rearrange the
user interface to your heart's content
so for instance if you hate dials you
know some people do then you can get rid
of the dials but anyways so this is the
user interface so what I did was I let
it roam around this is my apartment at
home I have lots of scans he's getting
closer you know here and you can see you
know the points from the scans but I
also built so that I can test my
algorithms so if i wanted to render the
raycast that i'm using for deciding
where to go that is pretty easy and if i
wanted to render the features that I've
found for my feature detection you know
I can just try out my algorithms on all
the sample data that I have and of
course at the sample data when you put
laser rangefinder on
cheap servo is coming to be pretty noisy
but but it works fairly well so for
instance here we have this cell is
discovered that we do have a corner over
there and coffee tries to avoid corners
when it gets too close to them so you
can see that there is a bit of a no-go
zone there in the the raycast and I take
my features and then I do a raycast on
pretty fine grained to see what I hit so
i have no go zones around every point
and then he he he finds his way so this
kind of integration with with with
Mission Control of course the the scan
visualizer is custom-built but the
tables and everything around that is not
so if i wanted to do things like let's
say that i wanted to redesign this so
window show view designer have the
design view Maya flight recorder here
and i have my my my my you I here let's
say that I wanted to show the durations
force can for instance that might be
interesting then I could go to my little
scam page here stop it all and say that
yeah you know I want to redesign this I
want to have have some column here which
is the duration from the scan oh I
actually already had that from the demo
but let's enable it so that's how you
would do that and you can see how much
time the scans usually take so fine
grained scans take a little bit longer
about a second and the shorter ones take
about four hundred milliseconds okay so
let's see how we were doing on time I
won't have some time for questions later
so I'll stop there and move over to that
hey did I okay so one final demo done
that last night when everybody was
preparing the pavilion the exhibition
hall I went up there and I I let him run
in fully autonomous mode up there among
all the you know cases and stuff so this
is him running on on fully autonomous
mode without tracks with wheels and
running about avoiding things even
avoiding things I thought would get him
into trouble like the legs of you'll see
later like I thought he would crash into
that but he actually discovered it and
he's taking it a bit easy when it gets
very close to stuff and there he goes
well I should probably go out of here
and then he continues so lets him
running on 0.3 of the speed so he can
run more than three times faster then of
course you have the issue with him not
maybe discovering things until it's too
late so you need to have more safety ok
so the results of the project it was
very fun for me it was really boring and
scary to my kids kids seem to like
control so you know the radio controlled
model version that I did was very much
more appreciated and I think it's an age
thing they probably like this more when
they get a little bit older so what I
would like to do with him that I didn't
have time for would be to implement a
full simultaneous location and mapping
algorithm so that he can map out you
know the world as he's traveling through
it he does feature extraction out you
know that's a big good start but fast
slam two or something would be really
cool to to implement the thing that I
really want to do is a fully autonomous
thermal glider because when you have a
thermal glider the way you notice that
you have upwind is yet you can see that
it starts tilting outwards from from
where the wind is and desires could
easily discover that and start
navigating towards that wind so I you
know that's something that I want to do
I'm going to take this put it in a
thermal glider and probably ask
permission from the authorities before I
you know have it raw roam roam around
Switzerland but yep then again the time
changed the time schedule changed
because I you know I got twins they are
now nine months and they destroy all the
spare time I have so you know it's this
is put on hold for now yeah ok so for
additional resources on on on Mission
Control flight recorder unsupported
serviceability ap ice in the JVM that I
probably shouldn't be talking about etc
you can go to my blog I put my design
something u verse I just started doing
that like a couple of months ago and
there's been thousands downloads so
that's really cool
yes and Mission Control is an oracle com
Mission Control and my twitter name is
hurt and I think that's that's it cool
so questions yeah
well I couldn't okay so the question was
you know in robotics you have could have
quite a lot of sensors and immense
amounts of data that you need to record
and and what would happen then and this
is what flight record was built for to
be able to handle those kinds of data
because you can imagine in a JVM the
number of times you synchronize on a
monitor for instance you can imagine the
frequency that happens in right that's
going to be way more than you can
produce sensor data right so so it's
actually quite good at handling very
large amounts of data the flight
recorder how do you get the data from
the robot yeah Oh real time no no no no
so that's right I wouldn't even begin to
try to process that in real time and do
something with it at least not from from
from the raspberry I mean it would it
wouldn't be able to it's great for
collecting with the data and for
visualizing the data so you can use
Mission Control to visualize the data
and and draw your own conclusions about
how well you're you're not 12 you're
you're here algorithms are working so so
it's very good for finding problems
submersible no I want to apply not a
submersible no I I have that as an idea
when I was kid but now now I want them
to fly so next project is definitely
going to fly not sure if it's going to
be quadcopter my brother is very much
into quadcopters and build stuff for
quad copters so but I would like to
build a thermal glider that's what I
would want to do any other questions
previous slide this one oh okay sure any
other questions so you're all gonna go
home now the budget my wife might see
this so we can talk later yeah sorry oh
the battery so i overdosed it on LEDs so
I don't well depends I don't know you
it's been up there for an hour now so
just running the raspberry on batteries
does you know doesn't take that much
juice it's the their engines when you
start running them that take take the
brunt of the I haven't actually run it
for an hour but I think it should yeah
maybe maybe we can try later I'll have
it on the in the pub yeah right so I
wish I had a better one so currently
it's really stupid all its trying to do
is to maximize the amount of travel time
it gets without having to do any major
turns so I'm using a rake offs algorithm
I just threw something together so what
I'm doing is I do a feature analysis of
all my points so that I find the walls
and I find the corners and one I have
done that I have a no-go zone exclusion
zone around each point and then I start
raycasting I don't know if anybody has
done this before I just raycast throw
out race see what I hit right and if I
do hit something
you know close to me that's I don't want
to go there I want to go something
somewhere far so and that's the the
choices it makes now so it tries to
avoid corners when it gets close to
corners but in the future I hope to have
a fully working a simultaneous location
of mapping algorithm running on him I'm
probably going to need to do some
optimizations because the rate costing
currently takes a bit of time so I'll
eat it it or to optimize what I have it
currently a little bit yeah so that's
what I'm doing today and if you want to
know how I do the feature extraction we
can talk later because i'm going to
delete bit of time in the whiteboard any
other questions
how many iterations depends on how you
define iterations because I've done
small smaller modifications over time so
for instance I've exchanged the h-bridge
for more powerful and more more featured
motor controller I've changed the
engines to have quadrature encoders so
I've done little modifications but the
main 3d printed parts they are the city
I've done one and that's why I say you
know having modeling the different parts
that you are going to be using inside
saves you quite a lot of time in the end
you know if you can just see that
everything fits together before you
start sprinting you start printing you
you save time in the end so that's what
i recommend and i might have built him
differently now that i know more about
3d design but yeah looks like an f-117
little bit if you know no but i think
it's nice it works well ok cool any
other questions ok cool thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
