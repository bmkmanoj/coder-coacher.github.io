and a little bit of a developer at
Oracle I worked on the Duke chess piece
design as well as the Duke chess
animation we're not going to go over
modeling those pieces today those take a
little bit more time but I will be
giving simpler examples a little bit
about my background my studied animation
at the UCLA film school got a Master of
Fine Arts in animation and then it
worked for Disney Animation and
DreamWorks Animation as a character
technical director Disney for almost
seven years and DreamWorks for about a
year and a half and then yeah someone at
Sun said hey you were starting an
animation project at Sun Microsystems
and I thought what and he said no really
we're starting an animation project at
Sun Microsystems so it was an experiment
to a kind of research project that I
joined worked on that for about two and
a half years and then transitioned over
to Java effects and we brought over some
of the ideas that we learned from doing
3d animation at Sun to Java effects 3d
so let's get started yeah there it is
okay so hey did you see that previous
slide I thought it's kind of funny that
uh looks like they're modeling looks
like they're modeling a mesh I just
thought I mean it's just a standard
slide that comes with the slide Vic but
I thought hey neat they did one of my
slides for me so general disclaimer I
don't sue me for anything that I say
don't sue Oracle for anything that I say
okay so what's the agenda today we're
talking we're gonna talk about modeling
creating UV maps texturing and then
lighting so what does Java effects 3d
you've probably how many of you have
been to the other Java fix 3d talks by
Kevin and Chen by Joe and Alex so this
is the first 3d talk you've been to
so this is gonna be a little bit
different than the other talks the other
talks dive more into code we will look
at a little bit of code but we'll only
look at enough code that you'll think
well isn't there a better way to do this
and then I'll show you what the better
way is I mean coding is cool but for
certain things you probably want to you
know try something else besides coding
and I'll explain why but
JavaFX 3d is a general-purpose 3d
graphics library for Java effects and
meshes materials on lights are three of
the new features and so we'll be
covering mesh geometry materials and the
light node the other talks covered the
other topics such as camera node sub
scene 3d picking LD helper so we're not
going to be covering that today but
they've actually recorded those talks by
Kevin Ken Joe and Alex so you can find
those online maybe in a you know
hopefully not too long they're recording
all these talks actually which is really
great so if you want to go back through
you know something that I covered in
terms of the modeling techniques you can
look at that online afterwards ok so
what are some of the use cases they're a
whole bunch actually in fact we showed
one last year if you saw the demo at the
keynote in Java 1 2012 we showed like a
shipping container port visualizing that
we worked with Navis a shipping company
on that so inventory process
visualizations science charting CAD cam
medical marketing architecture mission
planning training and even entertainment
so let's model a simple pyramid with
code and this is going to be really
simple not too much code here you just
specify your points you know the
coordinates in 3d space X Y Z and then
you just say which of these points to
use to make triangles and I left
something out intentionally
see this TC here those are texture
coordinates that you normally specify
those but we're not going to cover that
yet because I haven't talked about it
yet so just think about it this without
the texture coordinates so literally
it's just saying hey this pyramid is
made up of this triangle this triangle
this triangle this triangle is this
triangle and in fact it turns out to be
only six triangles four for the sides
and two for the bottoms triangle mesh
only supports triangles however we do
have a more general purpose polygon mesh
as an example class in the 3d viewer
project which is definitely worth
checking out it's in our T experiments
if you download Java fix 3d so which is
part of the JDK by the way so let's play
a game today the game that we're gonna
play is kirigami not origami and
actually look this up on Wikipedia so
origami is that paper folding thing that
you guys know about we're usually don't
make any cuts to the paper and you don't
use any glue or anything it's just pure
paper folding but kirigami is a kind of
a variation on that where you can cut
the paper and you can kind of glue it
together and stuff like that
so it's a it's a little bit more
flexible so we're gonna play that game
with this piece of paper over here okay
so this is a texture that I created to
help us play this game and understand
how modeling and UV mapping work I'm
gonna cover UV mapping in a very simple
sense over here but this is actually a
mesh you can see the triangle that makes
up this mesh here let me bring up
NetBeans while we're talking and oh yeah
so you can see these are the triangles
that make up that mesh and this is a
code and we are going to add in some
very simple texture coordinates here
so as you can see this plane is made up
of four vertices for texture coordinates
and in fact the texture coordinates are
in exactly the same places of vertices
so it's really simple this round and all
we're doing is we're saying hey use
vertex zero and texture coordinates zero
use vertex one and texture coordinate
one and then you know basically it's
forming two triangles as you can see
here and the vertices the indices for
the vertices and the indices for the
texture coordinates are exactly the same
that's why it's 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 3 3
those are the only two faces there are
two triangles really simple so let's go
ahead and look at that in the 3d viewer
over here so you guys really should
check out 3d viewer it's um it's very
very handy and let me just get the file
let's see this one is plane here we go
oops there we go yeah so 3d viewer is
nice because you can rotate things
around you can you know zoom in and out
you can pan you can look at in wireframe
so it's like super handy and it really
is very useful here let's see yeah we'll
play with the lighting later actually in
fact let me just turn these off so it
goes to default lighting right now
that's the default lighting okay
so let's keep on talking about let's
keep on playing this kirigami game let's
put in one fold so pretty simple right I
just put in one fold but the code gets a
little bit more complex so these are the
triangles that make up
that paper but you can see oh look it's
kind of gotten a little bit bigger and
that's because there are now four
triangles instead of two even though
it's basically the same piece of paper
so to speak and now there are six
vertices and six TV coordinates but
guess what
I put the UV coordinates in exactly the
same position set of vertices so it's
really easy to read the code again zero
zero that's the same the vertex and UV
coordinates same place 1 1 2 2 that's
face number zero because it's made up of
4 triangles and let's look at it in oops
let's look at it in the 3d viewer again
so let me bring up my 3d viewer let me
drag and drop a folded plane and by the
way one thing I should say is it's this
3d viewer is pretty handy because you
can actually export out Java code so
whatever you drag and drop into here you
can save it of this Java or F XML
pretty cool huh anyways yeah so here is
the folded plane and let's get in the
wireframe so you can see it's three no
four triangles that make up that plane
and yeah as you can see the codes
getting a little bit longer it's still
still pretty readable you know it helps
that the vertices and the UVs are
exactly the same now let's play the game
a little more let's fold the paper a
little more we're only going to use this
portion of the paper down here but we're
forming a unopen prism so there it is
it's six triangles now oh boy the codes
getting a little bit longer but it's
still pretty simple I mean of the
vertices in the UVs almost correspond
except when they meet up at the at the
edge that they wrap around so it's not
too bad so let's again look at this in
3d okay let's drop our open prism here
we go there we go
yeah not too bad still pretty simple
okay let's keep going
okay so let's model an open box and
we're only going to use this portion of
the paper here or basically cutting away
the sides and then folding it up that's
what the triangles look like and oh it's
getting a little bit longer so so you
can see here it's it's a really simple
piece of geometry obviously there's only
eight triangles now there's eight
vertices and ten UV coordinates but yeah
the codes getting a little bit longer
and still it's not even a closed box so
you know you can model a closed prism
and a closed box but the code starts
getting longer and longer and we haven't
even modeled Duke yet you know so the
question is armed only with the text
editor
3d modeling can get a little bit
challenging now just a little tell you a
story so I started with 3d in the early
90s and back in 1992 our lab got a SGI
skywriter I don't know how many of you
still how many still have heard of
silicon graphics all right yeah
oh man silicon graphics used to be the
coolest company in my opinion and we got
this computer that was at least as big
as a refrigerator and it was really
exciting and yeah so I got to learn 3d
on that but we didn't have a 3d
modelling program so when it came time
to modeling I actually modeled in this
program called Emacs and it was pretty
hard
and for this one demo we had this
interactive character and even before
Microsoft Connect the other guys had
this camera setup that basically
recognized your body parts and made
decisions or
and the character actually reacted to
that but I had to model the entire
character in Emacs and it was really
painful so is there a better way yes
there is a better way so there's a whole
bunch of 3d modeling tools now blender
Lightwave Maya Softimage 3d studio max
cheetah 3d cinema 4d Moto's Sketchup
ZBrush and a lot more and we'll be
covering two of those tools today
blender which is free and open source
and maya it's used a lot in film
television game science education etc
and you know what blender is actually
really nice I started learning it for
this talk because some guys at work said
well you know you can only do modeling
if you buy this $3500 package and I said
no there's there's another way so I
thought you know I'm gonna try blender
myself so I can let you guys know how to
use it and it's actually it's really
nice I wish I had this back in the early
90s it would have saved me a lot of
trouble I mean you know back in the
early 90s these really good modeling
programs they cost like up to $30,000
for like alias studio and now I can get
something that's really powerful and
good for completely free so let me show
you how to use it today
I mean Maya's good too and I mean are
there any blender users out there I
don't want to offend anybody yeah okay
that's awesome so you guys are probably
way ahead of me in modeling but uh
hopefully I can teach you a few tips and
tricks in general but you know Maya's
kind of like you know a very fancy car
right you know has a lot of bells and
whistles and stuff like that a blender
is like a very good car but not like a
fancy fancy car but they both get you
from point A to point B it's just that
blender costs you a lot less and at the
end of this talk we will be giving away
free licenses of blender and GIMP yeah
so 3d file formats so how do you
transfer data between 3d tools and
applications so there's a whole bunch of
file formats well three of the most pop
probably colada FBX and obj colada has
the advantage of being an open XML
standard FBX is kind of like semi open
kind of sort of they provide an SDK it's
widely used it's it's good but it's kind
of like the semi open thing that's not
standardized so I wish they'd
standardize it I have an open standard
and you kind of have to dig a little bit
to read it without the SDK but anyways
it's still good and obj it's it's an
ancient format but it still works and
everybody still uses it it doesn't
handle animation or anything like that
but just for polygon models it still
works and thanks to a partnership with
AMD we plan to officially support colada
for Java FX it turns out that someone
else is actually working on an FBX
importer if your guys are interested I
do any of you guys use colada or if the
X out there
obj okay that's cool yeah I mean they're
all they're all good formats definitely
but yeah definitely is for forgetting
data in and out of programs and into
other programs okay so it turns out that
the principles of modeling are are
basically the same in most modeling
tools there's a few modeling tools that
use very different ways of thinking but
blender and Maya in terms of their
philosophy in terms of modeling is very
very similar so we use blend we'll cover
some of the techniques some of the basic
techniques in 3d modeling are selecting
vertices edges faces moving those
vertices edges and faces loop cuts
extruding faces and subdivision so I'll
talk about some of that today at time
for a demo okay so this is blender this
is what it looks like when you start it
up and when you start up you just see a
cube it turns out that a cube is not a
bad place to start it's kind of like
rock soup where
you know have you heard of rock soup you
start with just a rock and then like you
add a few extra pieces of vegetable and
stuff and it turns into an amazing soup
well it's kind of the same deal you
start with just a cube and you can just
add a few things here and there and it
turns into something else
so to start with today I'll be just
modeling um a cactus yes a cactus and
it's for a very good reason because I'm
going to teach you about topology what
topology I think is good for a cactus
what topology is not so good for a
cactus and in in the process I'll teach
you some of the modeling okay so the
first thing I did not that it matters
since you won't see my hand moving my
keyboard and mouse but if you are would
like to use the settings I did I
actually set it to use settings that are
basically Maya type settings and the
reason I did that is because it's just
what I'm used to
in terms of the keyboard shortcuts and
the if you aren't familiar at all with
any tool and you'd like to use similar
kind of viewing controls as we do in
Java FX 3d you may want to switch to
Maya to start with because we tend to
use kind of Maya ish controls in Java FX
3d for like the 3d viewer and stuff like
that but yeah so let's go ahead and get
started here so if you look over here I
am looking at the 3d view so this little
icon over here in the lower left-hand
corner this will let you switch between
various types of windows but the most
useful I believe is a 3d view let's zoom
in on this cube and you can look at this
cube in object mode or edit mode or I'll
also be covering even the sculpt mode
and there are some other modes but I'm
not going to be covering anything other
than these three today okay so just move
this monitor a bit
so looking at the object mode you can
look at it as wireframe as solid as
we're not going to be covering texturing
or UV and blender I'll just be covering
modeling today so those are the two
we'll look at and you can switch between
translate rotate and scale manipulators
they're pretty intuitive in fact looks
like they kind of copied Maya but
anyways that's cool and let's see where
is that mode that I'm looking for edit
mode yeah if you're in edit mode and you
click on this cube over here it'll see
kind of through the object in the
transparent manner so you can pick
things in the back so let's go ahead and
start picking some things and moving
them around so I'm gonna go into
translate mode I can move these vertices
around I can move a couple at a time I
can grab these sets of vertices up here
and I can scale them so yeah or I can
even rotate a group of vertices so what
we're going to do is we're going to
model a cactus really really quickly and
then talk about the topology of that
cactus so I'm gonna select the face I'm
gonna go to face I'm gonna extrude this
face which just means to extrude out
that geometry I'm gonna extrude it again
I'm going to extrude it again and yeah
one more time why not and then I'm going
to extrude it again and yet again
extrude it again extrude it this way
extrude it this way and extrude it this
way now if you can imagine the amount of
code that you would need to make this
happen as just pure code even something
as simple as this very blocky cactus it
would be pretty painful but you may say
wow this cactus looks really blocky it
kind of looks ugly I thought you're
modeling a cactus well guess what
there's this handy dandy thing called
Catmull clark subdivision surfaces and
how many of you have heard of
subdivision surfaces before cool for
those of you who haven't haven't heard
of NURBS splines cool okay let me cover
you know since it's kind of new
territory for a bunch of folks let me
cover the basics right here and I'll
just come with my since so I can keep
the another session up okay so in in 3d
and even 2d there's this concept of
NURBS curves and what you do with NURBS
curves is you can specify TVs holes you
can specify a curve with basically
control vertices that form a Hall so
that's what I'm doing right here I'm
moving the points around on this hall
and there's only like one two three four
five six points but they specify a nice
smooth curve so this is a this is a
NURBS curve the same concept xsplit the
same concept applies in 3d where you can
specify a nice smooth surface
control vertices and hull there we go
actually yeah let me just hold on I want
to see both at the same time to show you
what I'm talking about
display nerves hall display NURBS CV so
there's only 16 points here right by
using these 16 points you can specify a
nice smooth surface and it's actually
very very handy and as you notice the
surface doesn't actually necessarily go
through all of the points let me just
try to make it more extreme so you can
see what's happening yeah so this is a
NURBS surface oh yeah the wireframe view
is a little bit easier to see so with
just 16 points I'm specifying a smooth
continuous surface now if you take that
to the next level and for example use a
polygon mesh it turns out that you can
use a polygon mesh too semester Phi a
smoother surface which is extremely
handy so I'm gonna get rid of this NURBS
surface because NURBS surfaces while
there are really great and used a lot in
automotive and manufacturing can only be
four sided so in other words you can't
have a five five sided NURBS surface you
have to use basically various blending
techniques between those patches and it
gets pretty complicated but with
polygons it turns out that Catmull
Clarke subdivision surfaces has very
simple very similar properties to NURBS
surfaces but super easy to use so this
is a subdivided cube so let's say I move
the points of this cube around like this
with just eight points I can specify an
interesting surface and you can imagine
if I use more than eight points I can
specify an even more interesting surface
so
and this is just with eight points so
the idea is to use a few control points
to control something that's a lot more
has the appearance of being a lot more
complicated and again this stone or
whatever that I just modeled is just
specified by eight control points that's
it thanks to the magic of subdivision
surfaces so guess what we're gonna do
we're gonna take this ugly cactus and
we're gonna turn it into a nicer cactus
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
into object mode and we're gonna go over
this handy-dandy tool icon over here on
the right side and we're gonna add a
modifier and the automata far we're
gonna add is subdivision surface wow
look at that it's looking better already
in fact we're gonna increase the
resolution or increase the resolution
even more why not increase the
resolution even more and you're like hey
wait a second you know it's not smooth
well you know what you can change the
shading to be smooth so there's a cactus
right there but you may say wait but the
bottom it looks like it's too smooth
what do you do well there's a couple
things you can do first of all if you're
using a more advanced set of subdivision
surfaces you can you can add creasing
without adding extra control points but
with the basic set of subdivision
surfaces that's in blender you can still
control that by let's go to edit mode so
you can still see that ugly cactus
sitting on the outside it's called the
the control polygon or a control hull
and you can say hey what if we insert
now where is that Luke cut and slide
that's what the called in this program
you can basically insert some resolution
here and by inserting some resolution
doo-doo-doo-doo you can control how hard
the curvature is it's at certain points
for example so let's say I inserted some
resolution over here
I can control the curvature of this
cactus and you know it starting to look
kind of like a cactus it's not not too
bad not too shabby however I actually
wouldn't recommend modeling a cactus
this way even if you spent more time
pulling and pushing points which is fine
you can always do that and the reason
why I wouldn't recommend it is because
the topology doesn't lend itself well to
the kinds of things that you want to do
later with it let's just make the view
resolution and render resolution too and
let's just apply this what that means is
I'm going to basically bake these
changes into my cactus now let's look at
it in edit mode and you can see it's a
lot higher resolution than was before we
wouldn't want to code this by hand
the problem is cactuses cacti rather
like let's say you have this you pick an
edge and you say I want to select the
loop and I'm gonna basically scale it
out because if you look at a cactus it
kind of has these uh it's not like it's
not like a fire hydrant
let me select another edge
and I'm gonna move this out over here so
it kind of has these serrated kind of
look to it but the problem is if you try
to do that with this type of setup
you're going to run into a problem
because of the way your topology is laid
out so in the interest of time I'm not
going to go through all the possible
permutations but let me just quickly
show you an alternative let's start from
the simple cube again
okay that's good a component mode face
extrude they're useful extrude extrude
extrude and extrude yet again I would
recommend thinking about the flow of
your topology so what I mean by that is
and this isn't like the ultimate cactus
but this is kind of like version 2 of my
cactus think about the flow even if it's
a little bit more work think about the
flow which by the way is extremely
important if you want to model a
character like Duke or something flow
becomes a pretty big deal
so think about the flow and yeah it's a
little bit more work to kind of turn
these things around there we go
select this face over here extrude it
and yes I'm gonna have to do that again
but I'm gonna try to do it really
quickly because we got a lot more stuff
to cover doot doot doot doot doot
extrude it turn it and if you model a
character you'll be doing a lot of stuff
okay so a little bit wide over there
but if we go back to object mode and we
go back to this modifier here and the
modifier I'm adding is subdivision
surface and I'm adding a cat mole Clark
you can see that the flow is better for
adding more detail now this isn't the
ultimate cactus but interest of time I'm
going to go to the next topic okay so
that is a quick tutorial of modeling and
blender and you're like wait a second
how do you get this into Java fix I will
cover that so you export that as an obj
file and you say hey how about we save
it in demos and we save it as my cat
this export obj okay bring up my 3d
viewer okay so we go over to that
directory and we drag and drop our
cactus tada there's our cactus
actually let me turn off wireframe there
it is and it's we haven't smooth that
said it's not smooth but yeah pretty
easy workflow huh so what I'm trying to
what I want to inspire you to do today's
feel like hey you know what I can grab
this program which I'll give you the
link for at the end it's very simple but
blender.org I can grab it and I can
start modeling things that I need for
whatever project or UI that I need and I
can just drag and drop it into 3d viewer
and then later I can integrate it into
my application in a more specific way
but I want to inspire you to try
modeling it's not it's not as scary as
it seems so there's that blending
tutorial okay now we're gonna model
something really quickly if my and
because we don't have a lot of time I'm
gonna model it really fast but I wanted
to show you kind of hard surface
modeling so we're gonna model a very
simple airplane and guess what we're
gonna start with yes we're gonna just
start with a cube kind of like rock soup
all you need is a cube I'm not going to
go through all the steps and you're in
the interest of time but uh I'm just
starting with the cube here principals
are actually the same as blender except
that with blender you can get started
for free and it's actually got a I've
played with the modeling tools I
actually like them I'm surprised that
what you can get for free nowadays it's
kind of a I just wish that I just wish I
had it back in 1992 because uh modeling
with blender is a lot more fun than
modeling with Emacs a lot more fun and
it's like wow it's amazing it's like it
I won't say the whole story now but
basically it used to be a proprietary
system
that was basically bought out and then
I'm inserting edge loops by the way and
they made it free to everybody and I
mean I do prefer Maya for animation and
stuff like that and a lot of other
people do too but modeling in blender
I'd say you know I was actually
extremely impressed with it extremely
impressed okay so what I'm gonna do here
I'm gonna use the same technique that we
just covered earlier I'm going to
extrude it but I'm gonna extrude it in
hmm that's interesting huh and then I'm
gonna Street it out and then to help you
see what I'm doing I'm actually gonna
create a duplicate on the other side but
I'm gonna actually create it as an
instance so it'll look like I'm modeling
something that's on both sides I'm just
pushing and pulling vertices here the
same thing I was doing in blender pretty
easy and I'm gonna model you a simple
paper airplane okay let's see what I can
do really quickly okay so let's see here
let's bring this guy down and in a
little bit to do I'm gonna extrude again
exactly the same thing I did in blender
extremely useful operation and you know
actually everything that I've done so
far is something is the same are the
same techniques I've used in blender
same techniques pretty easy stuff and
let's see let's add some angle to this
wing to make it look interesting and
let's extrude again and again this is
exactly what I was doing with the cactus
I'm just scaling that face
okay let's see let's see okay I'm going
to extrude this again I'm going to
extrude this inward actually and then
I'm gonna kind of extrude it in and then
up slightly again exact same thing I was
in with the cactus not rocket science
and I'm going to extrude yet again
yeah and it is a kind of a rocket ship
paper airplane so I gotta add some
engines right and guess what I'm gonna
use extrude that's amazingly useful it
is just this one simple tool can get you
a whole lot and I really want to
encourage you it's not it's not as scary
as it seems you know give it a try I
think you'll like it let's see here
let's push and pull some of these points
around to make the Momo more interesting
in shape it's kind of like it's
basically like sculpting and you know my
favorite book in elementary school was
this Star Wars cutout book where you can
cut out these perforated they're already
perforated you could basically cut out
these ships and then fold them together
oh that was so much fun I hope they
still have that because my son will like
it when he grows up but it's basically
the same idea you're just like it's just
like working with that kind of stuff and
you can make rockets but it's not rocket
science it's gonna be really simple
because I actually have to UV this as
well and that's gonna take me ya have to
work really fast to do that but okay so
what we're gonna do is the other side
over here I'm just going to delete that
and then I'm going to duplicate it for
real and oops before I do that actually
the me um it was called freeze
transforms freezing transforms basically
clears out some of the values deleting
history clears out some of the junk that
it junk information that it kept while
you were building it I'm gonna duplicate
this I'm gonna scale it by negative one
you don't need to know all the details
of what I'm doing I'm just
preparing this for to be merged together
I'm combining these two merging all the
vertices together and I base I can't
teach you everything in a in one hour
but I'll try to cover as much as I can
now selecting these faces and guess what
I'm going to do I'm going to extrude yes
to make a cockpit yeah I think that'll
work as a cockpit scale it in
yeah that'll work okay so here's a
simple paper airplane modeled in like
five minutes so and imagine we could do
with like five hours you know okay I
didn't and save this let's say this is
airship model okay so what we want to do
is we want to what's called delete
history clears out some of the junk and
we also want to lock normals for export
so let's go ahead and export this out
again airship locked normal now let's
bring it over into 3d door let's make
sure it works okay and uh JavaFX assets
maya demo okay java fix there you are
tada there it is and i actually could
have modeled this in blender as well but
i can work a little bit faster in maya
so and here's the wireframe mode of that
okay
next topic okay UV mapping principles so
UV map you've seen that before already
that's what we're doing in kirigami in
fact the folding of that paper was
actually the same as folding the UV map
so when you make a UV map you got to
think about keeping that map similar in
proportion to the mesh faces that can
share a continuous features should be
adjacent to each other fishes that are
more prominently visible should use more
lap and faces that are not visible can
use a small area symmetrical models can
benefit from overlapping UV maps the UV
maps have traditionally been powers of
two like 256 by 256 or 1024 by 1024
that's changing now but some of
more limited Hardware still like square
textures that are powers of two so
traditionally you VR to still stay with
that and the UV map should occupy as
much of the space as possible while
minimizing Distortion
okay so there's some miss concepts
misconceptions about UV so some are UV
mapping Direction corresponds to a
direction in 3d space that's not in
general and if I flip the V up and down
what am I talking about when I say V I
am talking about this direction over
here on the UV map is V this direction
over here on the UV map is U so there's
this misconception that if I flip this
up and down and if I turn this object
upside down then it's gonna be the same
result and it isn't if I had more time I
would show you why but let's keep going
and there is a conception that UV
mapping is not fun it is really fun just
think of the kirigami game that we
played in the beginning that's all it
basically is just basically folding over
think about folding paper that's
basically what UV mapping is so I was
gonna say let's try UV mapping the
pyramid but shucks let's go ahead and
just try UV mapping that airplane yeah
okay so here we go I'm gonna try to work
as fast as I can so basically remember I
told you about that Star Wars book that
I really liked when I was in elementary
school where I could basically cut out
these pieces of paper and actually make
them into pretty convincing models of of
Star Wars ships that's basically the
same idea here with UV mapping I'm
basically going to you know let me
modify a few things here to make it
slightly easier to UV map
I wouldn't do this if I had more time
but since I don't have a lot of time
when we try to show you as much as I can
as quickly as possible okay basically UV
mapping one technique to DV maps is
projection and when you project it's
easier to get the correct result if the
surfaces you're projecting on to make
sense in that space I know that's a
mouthful I'll show you what I mean in
just a moment I promise and again this
extra step I mean it does make it look
kind of nicer too but wouldn't be
necessary if I had more time which I
want to show you as much as possible so
I'm just making it slightly easier to UV
map okay let's say this model again did
it to do when a work as fast as possible
here okay so the idea behind UV mapping
is you basically want to make it
possible to cut these things out on
paper and then put them back together
just like those Star Wars
cutouts I was talking about what that I
had in the book when I had when it was a
little kid and yeah it was a lot of fun
so I'm basically specifying which faces
I want to be part of this paper cut out
so to speak think back to the game we
played in the beginning where we were
basically taking a piece of paper and
folding it into different shapes that's
what we're doing here
essentially you'll see what I mean in
just a moment
let me just make sure I've selected all
the right faces okay that looks pretty
good
oh thank you very much I really
appreciate that
thank you create sets quick slick sit
I'm gonna call this top so basically
this will select uh-oh oh snap
I'm gonna undo hopefully I'll get by
selection back something didn't work
with the Quick Looks it it's okay I did
undo and I got it back okay let's just
go ahead and you start UV mapping UV
mapping is the idea that you basically
want to lay these out on a piece of
paper so if you publish this as a book
you could give it out to kids and they
could cut it out and put this thing back
together Wow look at that see kids could
cut that out and start putting this
plane together if it were a paper cut
out pretty neat huh I think it's pretty
neat anyways we'll move this aside for
now cuz we got to do the bottom okay so
again I want to essentially just think
about giving this pattern to kids to cut
out on paper so they can build this ship
and just play with it as a toy so I'm
gonna create a pattern for the bottom
trying to work as fast as I can in here
so I can show you as much as possible
okay there we go
bless you there we go got the top and
the bottom okay now I'm gonna get the
wings the back wings
yeah you know what I'm running out of
time here I'm just gonna do the Hail
Mary pass I'm gonna use automatic
mapping which doesn't produce as good
results but I just want to show you as
much as I can so automatic mapping just
takes a guess it's not as pretty as I
what I as what I did before but but I
will use regular mapping for this good
to do create UVs
okay so as you can see what I've done is
basically
made it so if you cut these things out
on paper essentially I mean not exactly
but if you basically cut these things
out you could kind of give it to a kid
and they could cut it on on paper but
the real purpose is for texture mapping
and like I said before these UV maps
don't need to occupy exactly the same
space oh here so this is the bottom of
the plane so it can occupy less space
than the top and I'm preparing this for
texture mapping these are the engines
these are wings and other bits I'll just
stick them all over here there they go
okay let me save this out and let's do
some super quick texture mapping okay UV
mapped you know what feel free to ask me
questions while I'm texture mapping this
anyone have any questions it's not as
scary as it seems I mean like sure I'm
working a little bit faster than I might
normally work but okay UV map in order
to texture this you want to save this
out and something that makes sense when
you export it out to a program like
photoshop or gimp so I'm gonna make a UV
snapshot I'm basically taking a picture
of this and let's call this airship UV
so what I'm doing is I am saving this
out as a square texture
and then I'm gonna open up GIMP which
I'll also give up for free at the end so
the motivation behind all this is you
know you're creating some Java fix app
in 3d and you need some kind of custom
things like let's say you want a compass
or let's say you want you know some
other kind of object in 3d well guess
what you can model it for free and which
is really amazing because back in 1992
this stuff cost like a lot of money and
the fact that you can get it for free
now is pretty crazy the demo D assets
images no assets my demo images there it
is okay
okay I'm gonna do an automatic texture
just food we can get something audio
really quickly let's see I'm gonna
create a new layer
alright let's create a super quick
texture
yeah there we go something really fast
we can stick on the ship I'm gonna save
this out as airship dot PNG
yes yes it did and I would show you that
in more detail if you want to come up
afterwards yeah they were there let me
show you two on black really quickly
let's see four wrong color or there we
go yeah so the idea is if you had more
time you could paint this make it look
nice you know make it look nice and
fancy and again free program GIMP but
let's load this texture onto here so the
way to do that is to create a you know
in my you create a shader in blender I'm
sure the concepts are very similar
feel free to ask any questions I welcome
any questions this is how we created the
Duke chess pieces and actually created
the physical chess pieces from the Maya
model I thought I saved it but it is it
still oh thank you oops where where am I
here kind of lost my um oh yeah there it
is thank you very much
and we're going to stick this on here
and
you know not the best UV map I've ever
created or not the best texture map ever
created but he'll suffice for time and
then I'll save this out and six textured
and we'll drag and drop it into the 3d
viewer and let's call that a wrap
anybody have any questions feel free to
ask tada
modeled UV mapped and textured in like
20 minutes
yes it's an automatic texture that I but
you know it gives you the idea if you
spent more time you could make it look
like anything you wanted to and you can
do this for I mean seriously
back in the early 90s you had to pay
like fifty thousand dollars for an SGI
computer and thirty thousand dollars for
software now I can get it you can get a
standard laptop at Staples for like five
hundred bucks and get blender and here
let me give you the links as I promised
let's skip some of this technical
mumbo-jumbo
yeah www.blender.org as promised I will
give you blender for free and gimp
completely for free if you want to
follow me on Twitter
brand new to Twitter I've sent my first
four tweets this past week announcing
the 3d talks my own Twitter account
which I've actually never used is JavaFX
artist but I plan to eventually tweet on
that if you want to connect with me on
Facebook feel free John not you not FX
and thank you very much for coming
feel free to come up and ask any
questions afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
