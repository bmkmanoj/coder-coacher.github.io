Atlanta I'm Bob Probert with the Oracle
technology Network and I'm here with
Sean Phillips Sean was a keynote speaker
at today's event good morning Sean is
good to see you again
good morning that's new now new and see
that's I'm not keeping any track of time
whatsoever tell me a little bit about
your keynote presentation this morning
well I was thrilled the amount of people
there it was standing room only and not
to brag but it was they were bringing in
chairs from other rooms to try to
facilitate it great great turnout the
keynote presentation itself was an
attempt to show not just the the
aerospace part of the software that I
developed along with a lot of the folks
at my company AI solutions but to show
how you could apply those techniques the
data visualization the data analysis
techniques and frankly the inspirational
parts of it to other domains we tried to
push certain technologies we tried to
cover
JavaFX that's what we use for the
visualization the the java eight the
multi-core support the parallelism that
comes with that but but then also we
showed using the oracle cloud actually
specifically the bare metal instances
which is our high performance highly
available course systems that allow me
to do all these computations vast
amounts of computations in parallel and
then filter it and return it and we
return that data and then we plotted it
on a tablet so all those things you saw
in the videos online before right we
showed parts of that and then we showed
a logical extension where we took some
of that and got it down on our tablet
and we were able to do that using thanks
to Oracle's bare-metal cloud services
and gluon that's a that's a great
company in the Java FX ecosystem they
provided me with api's and support to
build both a mobile client and a give me
remote access to Oracle's bare-metal
system using to rate the eyes well great
well and they helped me a lot so thanks
guys I really appreciate it so
you have what might be the coolest
software development job in the world
okay a little bit about how you got
started developing software for NASA and
the space program how I got started
working for my current position was I
was doing that which might be the second
most coolest job I did a 3d battle space
simulation for the Air Force I'm not
joking
so you know planes tanks and automobiles
flying around shooting at each other and
trying to my job was to make literally
an OpenGL visualization of that and then
it would it would latch onto all these
simulations in these actual systems
computing these things and then I would
like render what it was supposed to be
it was like kind of like a video game
you know it was pretty fun so you know
after a while I realized that I was
crying sick and tired of you know trying
to help make casualties go up or down so
to speak so I I started looking for
something a little bit more beneficial
to everything and and I saw this opening
with my current company AI solutions to
work directly within NASA facilities on
these missions and I thought I can do
this why not and so so anybody listening
you know that you can do this you know
you can help you can contribute directly
to to great organizations like NASA but
also humanity in general so let's rewind
your movie a little bit farther back oh
boy how did you there Hammond diapers
there you are died last week well maybe
we go a little bit for our government
how did you where did you start in your
career as a software developer what was
the what was the genesis of that what
was that first moment in your life when
you thought gee this is what I want to
do man I don't know the exact date I
don't know the exact moment but I I
always wanted to play video games and I
you know I just I became fascinated
watching folks running computer games on
there at the time you know all these old
computers it was there was a lot of
Hoops here to jump through to run
anything let alone a video game
but when I saw all the voodoo
incantations that they did
it and then suddenly this green screen
Wheel of Fortune game came up or are
like yeah I'm an elk one of the first
computer games I ever played was a wheel
of fortune or jeopardy jeopardy it was
Jeopardy okay yeah okay uh and I thought
my god this is something I can do and I
kind of fortunately my father had the
wit the foresight and wisdom to to see
that in me and he he scraped together
enough money to get me a real computer
you know Tandy 1000 which dates me a
little bit but uh
and then I I just started messing with
it and I quickly found out I can't get
my games to run things are hard and so I
had to dig down in and when I had to
start writing like little spats trips
scripts this write to that and and then
when I real and I finally got my stuff
to work it occurred to me there's this
whole dimension of capability that you
can do amazing things with video games
that I can control and I can learn and I
can master and I want to say I think I
was twelve twelve thirteen I just
started harassing my my teachers at
school my junior high in high school I
started jumping into these like
programming classes early and I and and
one of my first assignment I had to come
up with a real-world application to
write whichever you know back then was
just text like stuff him and I was I
just got moved up to the to the varsity
baseball team and I was a benchwarmer
because of that you know the boy among
men literally and so I was doing the
books and I got so sick and tired of
manually calculating batting averages I
wrote my first batting average booking
tool in turbo Pascal on an Apple 2e the
Wozniak Edition had an extra sitting
Hertz or mega yeah thanks sir a couple
extra Hertz
the point was um and when it when I
actually started using that I realized
oh my god this is this is what I'm going
to do so I just knew at that point from
junior high are just into high school
and on I just knew so post high school
of you went to college yes what's your
degree it well I have a master's degree
in computer science on so it a lot of
the stuff I showed was you know
aerospace it's not computer science but
the reality is
and now more than ever almost every
industry translates eventually back into
software you know you know I mean even
even yeah aerospace obviously it really
is it's math that manifests as in the
form of software and code and so it
doesn't seem like a computer science
person a lot of the people that come to
this conference they're going to they're
going to be coming from that concierge
type background and they're not going to
think I can do something like that
absolutely you can we need you these
groups my companies like my my company
organizations like NASA spacefaring
nations and governments they need people
like us to bring what we know and apply
it to their problem set so what advice
would you give the young people who are
thinking about getting a dis off for
development that's that's easy pick
something that you love first don't get
into programming to get into programming
I remember when I was in college in in
the mid to late 90s mostly and there was
this mad rush for people going into
college to join computer science because
of the money you know and they got about
halfway through it and they hated their
life because they didn't like
programming they didn't like this they
didn't like that they got in for the
wrong reasons but I'm convinced that
many of those people would have stayed
if they had found something that they
love to do with it and then learning the
Comp Sci part learning the programming
the networking blah blah blah that stuff
would have just come naturally at that
point and so young kids and I I would
recommend I actually recommend against
having young young children do this
because they're at some age people start
to learn to think abstractly right
there's a reason we don't teach boolean
algebra in like fourth grade
well he's not enough my school I went to
a public school so maybe some private
schools do but it's you know kids don't
think abstractly quite yet yeah
everything's face value for them that's
why as parents we can totally lie to
them and get away with it you know yes
there's a tooth fairy
he creeps into your room in the middle
of night hahaha but seriously I
right around 12 years old 13 years old
they're starting to think about things
abstractly they're starting to recognize
benefits of doing things one way versus
another
that's a great time to get them started
but make sure you have them start with
something that they love the obvious
vector is video games yeah I mean it's
just it's a no-brainer and and so all
the reasons we told our parents oh yeah
we play video games because it makes our
mind quicker or hand-eye coordination
now we have kind of like a good reason
an actual good excuse to have them yes
play video games because it could it
could really easily translate into a
whole whole host of technical career
paths
well well Shawn it's great talking to
you again at free time a good luck in
the future I'd obviously obeyed
following along good you know see what's
happening with your work with NASA and
JPL and if you want more information
about the Oracle code events visit
developer developer oracle.com
slash code there are I think six or
eight events left in the Oracle code
series it's moving to South America and
the asia-pacific region but you'll have
a chance to check those out there's also
all of the presentations from the
previous 10 or 12 events are available
via that site so developer dot
oracle.com slash code check it out i'm
bob report for the Oracle technology
Network thanks for watching and stay
