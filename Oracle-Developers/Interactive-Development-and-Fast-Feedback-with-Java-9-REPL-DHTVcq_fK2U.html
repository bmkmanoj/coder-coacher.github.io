interactive development and fast
feedback loops with java nine ripple so
i'm going to talk a bit about ripple in
general just for a few minutes and then
we'll get into what j shell provides and
what are some of the things we can do so
let's start out with a little bit about
why we want to do this and then we'll
get into details about what we can
actually do with it so what is a rebel
rebel stands for read evaluate print
loop and reevaluate print loop is really
about taking a piece of code reading it
as as we type it and then evaluate that
piece of code and then print the output
and then loop back to continue doing
that so it essentially is a very nice
way for us to figure out if a piece of
code is going to work or what does it do
I'm a huge fan of a very small
development cycle I I can't imagine
writing code for more than a few seconds
before I want to know if that code is
working I remember a few decades ago as
a very young programmer knowing almost
nothing I walked into a more experienced
developers office and I saw this
developer I have many many many screens
of code and and I looked at that and the
developer up probably said I've written
all this code now i'm getting ready to
compile it and I thought to myself
either this person is a genius or is
stupid and I had to wait for a few
decades to figure it out now so the
point really is we can't be working with
zero feedback feedback is something we
do in fact the human mind the human
brain is probably one of the most
phenomenal things out there it's a
constant feedback loop we respond to
feedback so quickly just amazing and
that's what we do that's what makes us
human needs to respond to these
feedbacks and then improve on it and and
a lot of technologies also relate
greatly on these feedback and so given
this when it comes to developing it
doesn't really make sense to develop in
dark because we go off in the wrong
direction and that becomes a waste of
time waste of effort so ripple is a nice
tool to tell us whether what you're
doing is really heading in the right
direction if you're doing something
useful with our code we are writing I'm
also a huge fan of TDD I write automated
tests and I want this feedback loop from
these automated tests so the obvious
question is we are doing TDD why do you
care well while TD is a fast feedback
loop it's not fast enough for me and the
reason is if I'm in the middle of
writing a function and I want to make
this test to pass and I'm in the middle
of writing a function i'm trying to
tease out a certain implementation well
i can write that in there and then i can
see my test pass or fail but even before
that I want to experiment there are two
kinds of learnings here one is of course
the code you are trying to implement for
that particular test and you may want to
experiment a little bit on it but it's a
lot of time honestly I don't have a clue
what I'm doing and I want to just sit
there and play with the piece of code
and see how things actually work you
probably have noticed one thing though I
rarely use an IDE actually because one
of the reasons I don't use an IDE is the
minute you go into an IDE they tell you
set up a project I'm like I'm out of
here I just want to try a piece of code
don't ask me to pay upfront and if I'm
doing something very you know heavy
weight or something really you know
requires a thousands of files together
oh of course I want to have a project
but just to try a little piece of code
don't bother me with that well so text
editors I kind of customize them to run
code I'm mostly a VI guy so I'm always
on the command prompt doing stuff but a
ripple I quite often use that for quick
experimentation this is i would say
repple is a distinction between the
haves and the have-nots there are
languages with ripple and there are
languages without it and this goes back
to a few decades I used to be a C++
programmer well if your C++ programmer
there is one thing that is required of
you
you always have to laugh at vb
programmers write because c plus as
programmers are really cool right we
walked with arrogance and we would not
wait look down on the vb programmers so
i have to do that as a C+ programmer but
when I'm writing code when I was writing
code in C++ I would write the code in
C++ back then and then when nobody is
looking I return my computer away from
any window and door because you never
want anybody to see what you're doing on
this and I would quietly bring up bring
up vb and drink up the C++ code in vb
and i will type the code and you can
actually interactively work with this
object that feedback was amazing and
when you've experiment finish it you
close vb and pretend like nothing
happened and turn the computer around so
nobody knows that you're actually doing
this but that kind of feedback loop is
really powerful for us to get going so
really quickly for example just to kind
of show how this really feels like let's
take a look over here so what I have
here is just a command prompt and I'm
going to simply say a scholar well
that's Carla's rebel and and witten here
in Scala we could write any code we want
to for example i just typed three plus
five and gave us a little eight well
that scholars ripple giving us a little
response well until recently i used to
joke that java has a ripple it is called
gooby Sh because you could bring groovy
shell and you could do the same thing
here for example you could say test over
here and you could see the code running
within the groovy shell so you could be
running this within the groovy shell for
example or what you could do is you
could be using IRB which is the
interactive Ruby shell and you could be
writing Ruby code within that and try
out little experiments in here for
crying out loud you could be typing node
and you could be typing JavaScript as
well and then you could be playing with
it if you want to so almost any language
worth its salt has a ripple and so as a
result there's a bit of a tension here
hey why not have a ripple for java well
thankfully now java has a ripple and
that's of course is j shell
so Jay shell comes to Java nine and one
of the beautiful things about Jay shell
is it gives you the power of the ripple
full-blown and you can write code and
play with it without the ceremony that
Java often introduces you're not
burdened by those ceremonies to try
things in the rebel so rebel actually
sits on top of the Java debugging
interface so it kind of inter it's not a
debugger but it kind of interacts with
the system just like a debugger would
and that's how it knows to take a few
snippets that's exactly what they call
it snippets of code and send it down and
have it executed and get back the
response so it facilitates things like
very fine-grained incremental
development you can get feedback at the
at the tip of your finger tips you can
keep trying this and get this is a great
good tool for a prototyping and and this
is one of the things I really like about
rebel is when I'm sitting and writing
code oftentimes I'm not exactly sure
what functions i may have to call and
what kind of things i have to do and so
what i would do is I'd be coding here in
my editor or ID whatever i'm working on
especially in the case of a web
application i want to be writing this
little code in the middle of this
function so what i would do is i would
leave this code right here in the editor
or the IDE I would switch over to the
repple really quickly I would do a
little experiment in an experimentation
see how the code works and once the code
works I would use the world's best
technology ever invented call copy and
paste and I would copy the code from the
ripple and paste it back into my editor
and then continue moving forward because
you know that little piece of code
actually works so this is one of the
things it's a really nice prototyping
tool for that reason you can call it
micro prototyping if that's something
you like to call it as very very small
little steps it's a great tool for
experimenting things if you're sitting
there and working with this and you're
thinking will this work will just do
this you can quickly do some
experimentation with it without having
to do a lot of effort let's look at an
example here for a minute let's say Here
I am in this piece of code and I want to
go ahead and take this little
array array list actually and then I
want to do some work with it maybe I
want to just take all these values I
don't want to total them so how do I go
about totaling them we could say we
could write a traditional for loop week
it's a total equal to 0 or hey this
functional style seems to be a nice idea
we could say numbers and then maybe call
a stream on it but i'm not sure what
functions to call would be nice to play
with it well let's give it a try so I'm
going to call jay shell right here and
right there we are within the gel
environment right there so now that I'm
within the J shell environment if this
is part of Java 9 of course I want to
install Java nine you're going to have
this but I want to play with this a
little bit so what am I going to do I'm
going to just grab this little code
right here that I have just a little
snippet I'm going to just put it in here
and I'm hitting the return well I didn't
even need the semicolon but i just
copied and pasted it so i got it there
so now what am I going to do what I'm
going to use the streams API so i'm
going to say numbers dart stream well
one of the things people normally say is
I love my ID because i can type a little
bit and then hit the dart and it tells
me what all i can do with it sure we can
here to as you can see i just hit the
tab and it filled it so you don't have
to really lose out on those things i put
a dot and a tab it tells me everything I
have available to me right there on my
fingertips or I say SS and then tab it
tells me those things are available so
you can be thoroughly interactive right
there by just hitting the tab you can
find out what's available so I'm going
to call the stream right there and once
I get the stream what do I want to do
well I want to perform a map to int over
here and then of course given an element
I want to simply get the element itself
back and then of course after this I
want is quickly perform oops I made a
mistake well that's what is going to
happen if you make a mistake it'll tell
you that you did so you can go back here
and say well there's a stream I want to
call and then I want to call the filter
method right there on it and then i'm
going to say up well sorry Mac method on
it so i'm going to say given a element
give me just the element back so i can
just play with this right
here and say well why don't we just call
us some operation on it so you can try
out a little bit of an example in front
of you and it tells you that the result
of that operation is 55 you can sit
there in tweak it and play with it and
once you are happy with their just copy
and paste it into your editor and you
can move forward so that is something
you can do to you know play with and get
a little experimentation going the other
reasons I really like to do this is it's
a really nice tool for learning purposes
so if I'm sitting there and just teasing
out something and playing with a little
function I don't need to be burdened
with a lot of tools and support I can
just come in there and one of the things
I really find it hard as you know I
teach at the University as well and a
lot of times I when I work with students
they are they become very quickly slaves
to their IDEs and they have no clue what
it means to compile a piece of code what
is a classpath well the good news about
IDE is it hides a lot of details from
you the bad news about IDE is it hides a
lot of things from you so as a result it
becomes really hard to find and fix
problems when you run into trouble so
one of the things I do when people begin
to learn as I tell them get down to the
basics really understand what the
different parts are what are you
importing well if you're just driving
this through up I des and somebody say
is why can't you use this function
you're like where's this function come
from well if you know where it's coming
from then you know to go look for a few
more things so I just you know feed
those things a little bit better in our
mind so this can be a really good
learning tool to think through and focus
on it and learn about it so having said
that let's talk about a few things about
how to use a gel so the first thing of
course is we want to start Jay shell so
if you have installed java 9 you can
simply say jay shell and it starts the
shell right there so once you start Jay
shell of course you can start doing
stuff with it well remember it's a
ripple so you don't have to really put a
print statement and stuff like that
because it's going to keep reporting to
you whatever it does after it analyzes
the code and evaluate said it
going to tell you what it really found
for you so I want to just print a hello
world in the tradition of hello world
well I'm going to go ahead and write a
little bit of code and and print it now
here is the beautiful thing you know
imagine somebody comes to you and says
hey I hear Java is very popular can I I
want to learn java can you teach me and
you tell them oh yeah I can beat you and
then they asked defensively is java
really hard to learn and you say no no
java is very easy to learn and they're
like okay that is good why don't you
teach me a HelloWorld in Java you're
like all right let me do that what do
you were the first thing you do you say
public there is the hand and say what is
public well you don't need to know that
right now and they take a note public no
need to do that right now and then you
say class and there like what in the
world is a class you don't need to know
that right now they're like this is
awesome i'm learning things I don't need
to know right now and then of course
they write that down and then of course
you say hello world and they're like
awesome i saw oh well you said that's a
class named don't be so fast i think i
put a curly and they are just looking
through it then you said public they're
like this is awesome i know what it is i
don't have to know that right now and
then you said static and they're like
excuse me is that word static is that
also something i don't need to know that
right now right so you can imagine the
ceremony that you go through before you
get to the essence right so this is the
difference between essence was a
ceremony right essence is what you
really want to do ceremony is the
nonsense you have to get through before
you even survived get to the essence of
things so as a result it's a very you
know we're not really able to show the
things very quickly we just you know
tied down with all these things well how
about simply saying hello world right
there and say this is a string after all
and we just created a string and Java
says oh that's cool it's a string I want
to tell you that string has a property
called length so dollar one is an
implicit variable name it gave for it
and I'm going to hit the length I he
just hit the tab on it it tells me the
length of that string is 11 so you can
see how you're just sitting there and
just interactively talking to this live
probe
and you can do stuff with it so this
becomes a nice way for us to teach nice
way for us to experiment nice way for us
to discuss in a meeting hey let me show
you how you can actually use this stuff
and then we can sit there and
interactively kind of you know pair up
and change stuff and play with it as
well that becomes very effective for us
to do that right there so that is an
example of writing a little bit of a
snippet and we can write these kinds of
snippets and play with it well let's try
a little air expression in here so I'm
gonna say a 4 plus 2 is is 6 as you can
see right there oh but I want to put
this into a variable though well sure I
can put that into a variable it gave me
a dollar three as a variable name but
everybody can agree that after a while
it becomes really hard to remember these
variables so we may want to give a name
for a variable and use it so we can
certainly do that so we could say for
example max equals thousand and we
decided to give max as the name of the
variable notice that i'm not using a
semicolon well I programming about 12
different languages and out of those
languages maybe three languages requires
semicolon everything else don't require
semicolon so there was a time when I was
programming in another language and I
came back to java and i wrote the code
and the compiler gave me an error i was
staring at it because i couldn't
understand because a compiler was
telling me you are missing the semicolon
and i was arguing i'm not really missing
semicolon you know that right so so the
point really is you kind of get used to
not going to that ceremony well you
don't have to put a semicolon as you can
see right here but i'll come back to
them in a few minutes so you can just
try out a little bit of a code and play
with it and we just define max to be
that I could say max plus one for
example I can try that right there
actually as well so you can also of
course when you are done with it you
need to exit this so how do we exit it
well I normally my instinct is when I'm
here my brain kind of forgets that I'm
actually in j shell I kind of feel
comfortable being in the command prompt
so when I'm in the command prompt I'm a
lazy guy if you look in the dictionary
the word lazy neck
to it my picture is there actually so
the point is I'm the laziest guy i know
i'm not going to type anything i don't
have to type so the grid I just do a
controlled be over here and I've quit
from jhl so that's the easy way to quit
from jay shell you could just do a ctrl
D well if you don't want to do control
be you could also do one more thing you
could do a slash exit and that also
exits so you may wonder what's the
difference between those two well if you
hit a control D it immediately shuts
down if you do a J shell and then you do
a slash exit it says goodbye to you
before it shuts down how sweet that is
right so if you feel little only one day
you / exit right otherwise just use
command D and get going so the point
really is you can exhibit very easily by
just hitting a control d and you're done
you can close it well I can bet you this
is not going to be far away in fact it's
only happening almost every single IDE
is going to integrate J shell into the
IDE so you don't have to go to the
command prompt to use DHL you can be in
your environment but just click a little
menu button our shortcut hopefully and
you got Jay shalt right there in the
environment which is super cool in my
opinion right then you don't have to go
through a you know as external shell
you're there you know just a visual
studio has done this for years for C
sharp and F sharp and you know things
like that we're gonna have that
definitely very soon and no few IDs are
already beginning to do this so so
that's the beauty of that we can have
access to that pretty available very
quickly but how do you navigate into a
gel environment so I'm going to go back
to Jay shell right here but what I want
to do is to try a few comments so in
here i'm going to say two plus three and
it tells me it's a five as you can see
let's say seven plus seven is fourteen
but i want to go back and redo a command
i just did before just a press the up
arrow so when you press the up arrow it
keeps navigating through the commands
you already type are the down arrow you
can see that it's coming back a one at a
time so you can go back and forth in
fact
demon remembers your commands from the
previous step as well so you can go back
a few more times so it remembers from
the you know previous session so it's
kind of like your history on your you
know unix or linux environment it's
going to keep track of that quite a bit
so you can use the up arrow or the down
arrow but on the other hand suppose I
had said something like numbers start
let's say stream dark filter and then
I'm like oops I want to really go back
to the beginning well sometimes we do
this right we hold the arrow and say
burn this is very frustrating when
you're sitting next to somebody into
watching them you feel like you want to
strangle them right it's like why can't
you just go to the damn cursor location
why are you moving one at a time and
then they kind of go back and then they
do this is called binary search right so
it doesn't help really well so so you
want to be able to navigate really
quickly otherwise it gets very
frustrating so what do you do well
thankfully the things you are already
used to on a command line works here
very nicely as well so if you're here
you want to go home control a takes you
home as you can see so I'm on the left
most positioned right now or you can do
a control e and your to the end of it so
you can use a control a control e and
that's what I use on a command prompt
normally when I want to go to the
beginning control a takes me to the
beginning control e takes me the end or
if I want to just jump through the words
you can do that I'm holding the alt or
option and then I could use the arrow to
switch between words you can also try
things like you know control w so pretty
much what you are used to in your shell
is going to work within this environment
as well for you to navigate back and
forth very easily so that is an example
of how you can move around and of course
I'm going to make a mistake here so I'm
going to close it and let it die so
that's giving you a error as well as you
can see fairly well it tells you what
just happened illegal start of
expression and gives you that error so
you can navigate very easily by using
these these commands oh the stupid
completion is a very useful feature as
you can see here so if you are sitting
there and working with a string so let's
say for example i'm going to say string
and we will say agreed and then I'm
going to say hello and of course I want
to be calling things on the on this so
I'm going to say hello and what do I
want to do in here I'll say greet darte
el and I hit the tab and it tells me
there are two functions available and a
little bit and then you hit the tab and
that is something we got to get used to
very quickly never type something you
never have to type I don't have to type
so so hitting the tab is something we
should get very habitual very quickly
that way you can you know you type the
minimum hit the tab if it's not
sufficient will give you the options but
the minute it's efficient it takes us
towards a unique value you just hit the
tab it fills it up for you very quickly
and you can get that feedback that it's
working and then you can try it out very
quickly as you can see so so you can do
a snippet completion by hitting the cab
and based on the context it will give
you things if you're used to the unix
environment unix-like environment you
are used to the bank a command so this
will reevaluate a previous command and
so you can do something very similar to
that well in this case I'm a little
curious I don't know what the command
was but i'm going to say exclamation
well actually it's try this this way i'm
going to say four plus five and i'm
going to simply say / exclamation and
you can see that it reevaluate that
right away so the slash bank is do
whatever I just did do it again so you
can just really ate that command very
quickly or alternately what you could
also do is you can do a slash list and
it gives you a list of all the commands
you tried in this particular session and
once you have that list you can see the
number on the left side followed by the
command itself that you see in front of
you so i can say / and i can give the
line number let's say two and it runs
the seven plus seven so you can
reevaluate a command which is already in
your list or you can say you know what I
want to run that command five the four
plus five again so i could say / minus 3
and then you can see that I've run the
command three commands before so minus
is you know go backward
and run the command if you ever try a
plus three and were if it works you've
been to the future right so so basically
it's going to run the command that
you've evaluated in the past and it's
going to tell you actually I'm curious
what it's going to do plus 3 i've never
tried it if this fries my computer it's
your fault okay so there you go so it
doesn't know what the command is so you
can see that you can provide a number
which is the from the line number you
can also do a minus and say go backward
that many commands and evaluate it and
that's what it is doing so this is a way
for you to exercise a few commands and
just moving around navigating around and
doing stuff on it so we saw how to stop
the shell to stop the shell we saw how
to move around the shell to go to the
beginning go to the end go to the
previous one go to the next one complete
the snippets execute a command you've
already executed so let's move forward
hey what about the imports this is a
good news how many times you sit there
and write code and you say come on I
don't want to be typing all these import
they should be there already well at
least the J shell is going to do that
for you so if you real quick collect if
you write a piece of code in Java and if
you're trying to use a lister on array
list you got to do an import of Java
util right and and how many times you
write code without it not too often
right so you're like okay why should I
really import it would be nice to have
it after all well sure enough that's
available for you you don't have to
really be doing it that's why if you
notice over here i'm going to say arrays
dot as list and one two three over here
and notice that it doesn't complain it
just simply took it and the reason it
didn't complain and took it is if i type
/ oh of course a part on me you probably
figured this out already / is a command
it's escaped to say you're talking to
the shell not telling the shelter run a
Java code right so you prefix with the
slash to say I'm talking to you she'll
not what you should do right that's
basically what that is so in this case
of course I'm going to say imports and
it gives a list of imports that are
already there so this is the
fault imports you can add to this if you
want to you can change this if you want
to but it's just the default that are
available so you got the you till you
got the I oh you got the math you got
the net you got the concurrent you got
the perfect prefs and then you got the
regex so that's basically the imports
that kind of comes by default and so as
a result you can use any of bees very
easily in your code so for example if I
say a new random you can see that random
is actually available and it filled in
enough of it to work with it and then of
course I can say in over here and I want
I'm kind of wondering what in actually
is giving so I'm going to say ince over
here and then close that and it tells
you it's a stream it's a it's a pipeline
so you can start playing with this you
know this is incredibly hard to find in
the code isn't it because you're trying
to know what the typist and what do you
do you got to put a silly print
statement around it or you got examine a
debugger and stuff like that well here I
can just keep experimenting with types
and see what type it is so it gives me
an insight very quickly and you can play
with it as well that becomes very easy
to work with it so that is the imports
to look at the things that are available
well he already saw me use the list
command so / list will tell you all the
commands you used in this particular
session well okay but I've tried these
things but maybe I'm creating an example
to share with a colleague or a student
and and I do this quite often somebody
would ask me a question can explain to
me about covariance and contravariance
well guess what i want to put together a
quick code example for my student to
understand what covariance and
contravariance s and typically when I
program in languages like Scala or
groovy i'm very impatient as i told you
so i would just bring up the ripple and
i would be typing all the code examples
i want to type and then i'll close the
ripple copy and just email to the
students they take a look at it play
with it well that's a very easy way to
just send it off to them and say here
you go you can play with this also and
the beauty is they don't have to set up
an environment currently I'm teaching a
language programming languages course
we're using 10 different languages in
the course right now
you can imagine if the students have to
open up an ide for every single language
and try it that's the easiest way to get
Oh get old and die right so we will be
talking about some stuff and I would
send them a little snippet of here's how
you do this in ripple well they can
immediately open the repple and play
with it right there without having to go
to the ceremony of setting things up you
know with IDs and stuff like that so
it's a really quick experimentation to
learn becomes very easy so what can I do
I'm going to simply say save and I'll
say session one and I'm going to just
save it as session one let's take a look
at this right real quick if you look at
the session one that's a file that
actually saved right there so you can
just send to them and say hey here you
go these are the commands I tried over
here but obviously if you want to run
that you can do that as well so in here
i'm going to open up j shell right now
and i'm going to now ask it to say load
and then i can ask it session one and i
can bring that update a call it session
one so so i can bring that up really
quickly here as well and i'll take a
look at it so in this case of course
they shell and of course i want to load
it let's see if it does it so i want to
load that particular shell so we are
saving it and then of course i can open
rather so open and i'm going to say in
this case session one is the file i want
to open so you can see that it actually
a little paws over there it opened it
i'm going to do a list and you can see
it's back here available to us for us to
use oh just to show it again so j shell
here and i'm going to type a slash list
I don't have anything right now and then
I do open and then of course I do a list
and you can see that back right there so
that's an example of how you can bring
it back and you can play with it well
you can also reset your environments so
what does that really mean well what it
really means is let's say you are in j
shell and you are playing with a few
different variables so i'm going to say
into a equals 4 i'm going to say in to
be equal 7 well but i want to get rid of
all of that so if i do a list over here
you can see that right there and if i do
of ours you can see that in this case
there are the variable sitting in front
of us but i don't want any of them so
i'm going to simply say reset and puff
they are all gone it
he said the state and so if I look at
this now there's no listing anymore and
then if you look at the variables you
can see that it doesn't have any more
variables also it gets rid of them so
you can see how it is easy to get rid of
some of the things clear it out and
start a clean slate you can do that
without having to exit that and come
back in yes sir the history that's a
good question so history is going to be
let's go ahead and type that so history
is the commands you type plus the code
you write what does the list is really
the code you write it doesn't have the
commands so the history it keeps it and
and there is a little thing you can do
about a you know reloading so i'll come
back to reloading a little bit later and
talk about it but it does keep the
history yeah and also even in respect of
what you do here the up arrow always
brings the previous sessions as well for
you yes I if you define okay so the
question is good question the question
is that the variables go with it if you
reloaded yes and no let me clarify what
that means if you explicitly define the
variable name then yes that's going to
be there with it if it gives a number
well it depends on what state you saved
it in the numbering might be different
depending on if you clear something out
and then recreated it so the sequence
numbers dollar one dollar to might
potentially be different depending on
you know when you saved and when you
create things so that but what you
define will be there definitely did you
have a question or a comment yes sir so
the question is is there an option to
check javadocs from within here honestly
I don't know but I'm not even sure if I
want to so so I don't know answer short
answer is I don't know yeah um yes yes
we're going to come to that in just a
minute so we'll stay tuned yeah the
question was what happens if you define
a variable again you're just basically
redefining it and ripple is going to be
kind to you than Java is because it's a
playground right in playground usually
we don't get very
added people right we shouldn't so so
Java is going to be a little bit more of
your friend here and and and you know
when you go leave this environment and
go to the IDE you're going to say you
are such a nice you know a buddy over
there in the ripple what happened to you
here right so it's going to be a little
bit more flexible to you and then that
is usually xperia for a pole so we'll
see that in just a minute yes sir how do
you actively delete from that yeah you
that you can you can drop some variables
but expressions just evaluate and give
you the result so you could do a drop so
you could do a drop of a variable can do
a drop of a method so you can certainly
do that so you're not literally removing
a line per se but you're removing its
existence that's what we are doing so
you could do that too and I'll come back
to that in a few minutes very good
excellent so um hey this talk is titled
interactive so I love this interaction
from you so that's wonderful so let's
talk about some of these things you can
do examining the variables and the types
and such well first of all what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to type
bars are most of those have a single
letter so /v would do the same thing as
/ bar if you will so you could type some
of these and play with it right readily
for example if i were to say i define a
variable so let's define a variable
before we try to go around and and and
if i use it so i'm going to say in let's
say greet is equal to hello and i
defined that i'm going to define a
variable at this point of course okay
type checking says you can't do it so
string greet is equal to and then you
can see hello and you can see that i was
able to define that variable right there
called greet i can also say int max
equals thousand but i'm right now not
sure what i am actually looking at so
this is also one of my habits by the way
different people are wired differently
that's what makes us so wonderful but
but i'm a person who is wired this way I
never want to see in front of me what I
don't want to see so when I'm working on
things I don't ok I never trust me when
I say this my computer environment is
very different
from my office so any time I say I don't
like clutter my children start laughing
because they look at my computer monitor
they look at my desk and say daddy don't
lie so my desk is a complete mess but
the good news is I'm never there to look
at it right but my desktop is what I
look at every single day and that's one
of the reasons if you notice my desktop
has absolutely no icons whatsoever and
this also makes your computer very
secure by the way because when you leave
it like this nobody knows what to do
with it and my argument is the point
really is when you look at it I can't go
through and say which one do we want to
click on there's not enough time in a
day for it if I can't get what I want by
using my chemical board shortcuts then
it's might as well not be there right so
I am a person who don't like any clutter
at all in front of me in my computer my
computer is the cleanest thing in front
of me right my surroundings are a mess
completely but my computer is just as
clean as it could be so you probably
notice me do this quite a bit along the
way I'll be hitting this control L over
and over and over control L clears the
screen because i want to have minimum
things in front of me I want to just
have the focus but but they're also
consequence says there's not a whole lot
of trail left in front of you to see
what it is now how do I know what the
variables are well taking the mouse and
scrolling up is the most terrible way to
do this right because then you're going
to be searching back and forth you don't
want to do that so this is where you can
see / VAR r / v and it gives you a nice
listing of all the variables available
to you very quickly so you can look at
the variables and say I've got all these
variables set up I can continue to use
them so that's / more you can also ask
for some details about the signature as
well so for example if I were to say
system dot out print Len but I know that
this is an overloaded function and I
don't know what are the different
overloading obviously i'm using print
line as an example but this could be a
third-party api or working with and
you're curious hey what are the
parameters that can send to this
function that i have on my hand and you
may wonder and you can find that out
very quickly so i shifted tab will give
you the overloaded functions with
signature shift tab so you hold the
shift down
hit the tab and immediately list you all
the different available versions of that
function overloaded function that is on
the other hand for example if you notice
here if I say new random and then if I
say dark hints and then parentheses and
I do a shift to tab it tells you what
are the different options available for
the ins function and you can see that
are at least quite a few so this is a
nice way to discover and say oh look at
that I didn't even realize there are
three four different things that can I
can do we can kind of think about this
and see what else we can do with it so
that's a nice way to experiment with
that as well and and get that
information so that is about the hit
shift tab to see the different options
available then come something a little
bit more weirder so let's say I say int
max equals thousand and I have a
variable here called max which is
thousand but i really want to write a
little bit more complicated expression
and maybe i don't want to type that in
here because I want to go back and forth
and use the mouse and change variables I
want a little bit more degree of freedom
like an editor or ID would give me and I
want to go a little I would elevate this
a little upgrade if you will so what you
can do is you can say ed did and then
you can do a max on it well the minute
you say edit max it brings up that
little little editors in the cute so
right there is a little editor and you
can see that in this in this case that
editor you can configure this editor
with various other tools you may use and
you can bring up your own favorite
editor to use and you can change that to
whatever you want to change it to so
obviously you would probably do more
complicated things then setting the
value there but just to prove the point
I'm going to click on this except right
now click and you can see that it takes
effect right there so this editor now
communicates back and say there you go
we have set a new value for this and you
can set that right there as you can see
so that's an edit you can do a / edit to
bring that up and you can set that into
into it so that is an example of how you
edit things but you can also drop things
you can drop different things so far
over here you can see that I have a
Greek I have a dollar for I have a max
I'm going to say over here / drop and
I'm going to drop greet so now drop the
greet variable now I save are you can
see greet doesn't exist anymore so
that's how you can remove stuff you can
remove the variables you can remove
methods this way also so for example i'm
going to write a method called foo and
then i'm going to write let's say just
leave it that and then i'm going to
write a method called bar and i'm going
to leave it there i'm gonna say /em to
see what methods are available so in
this case I've got foo and bar sitting
there but I don't want the foo anymore
so i can say drop foo and you can see
that it dropped the foo if i ask for the
method you can see that food doesn't
exist anymore so you can you can kind of
be commissioned methods you tried to
write so it's a very live and breathing
environment right so it's kind of like
the like the ultrasound right you're
seeing that life you know being and
you're working with it it's not a dead
code in the editor that one's will come
to life it is live and you can work with
it that's pretty pretty nice so so you
can do anything you want to do in here
that you would normally do in the Java
code and you can get rid of stuff by
using the drop so let's talk about a few
optional things you can a semicolon is
almost optional and it's I say almost
we'll see why in a minute and also try a
throw and try and catch are optional
well now to throw is option always you
don't have to throw but try and catch
are optional in this case so what does
that really mean let's look at an
example and then we'll talk about the
limitation that is associated with it so
you can you saw this already here if you
are trying to write a little expression
you don't have to go back and put the
semicolon in the end we already saw that
quite a few times that's pretty nice
it's not something you have to keep
doing so that is that is going to become
very useful very quickly so i did a 4
plus 2 it was more than happy to give me
a six there are times when i'm doing
experimentation I would do with a red
dot sleep 1000 and the Java compiler
will tell me oh wait a minute you're
calling the sleep you have to put a try
and a catch and I can tell you have
spent sleepless nights on it because I
never can figure out what to do in that
catch because all you're doing is you're
catching it and suppressing it and Java
is like I'm so happy right you're like
why why do you do this to me right so
this is completely a nonsense so but the
good news is for the first time we have
freedom you can simply say thread dot
sleep and I'm second later it says okay
right you didn't have to put the stupid
try and catch around it if all you're
doing is doing a little experiment but I
didn't say there are some limitations
around it so what is the limitation the
first limitation is I'm going to write a
function foo right here and in this case
I'm going to say oh let's actually say
into foo and in this case I'm going to
simply say curly you can see that it
tells me I need more so that's how it
says that there's something more
expected return let's say four plus two
hit return close this and hit the return
there you go so it tells you i want my
semicolon back right so it's a it's a
very nice player in the field but after
a few hours it can get a little cranky
right so it's kind of like me right I'll
be the nicest guy around you but the
longer it is since I've had my coffee
you will see me morph into something
else right so so the minute I take a few
you know cups of coffee I'm fine back
again that's kind of like where's my
semicolon why you're not giving it to me
so you're supposed to give that because
why well it's a function it's not a
snippet so snippets don't need a
semicolon but functions do and so you
have to provide it in the same token if
I say a method called take a nap and the
take a nap is going to say a thread
darts sleep 1000 and semicolon of course
and then I close it and it comes back
with vengeance to you as like I want my
exception also so functions follow the
rules of Java into
finally stupids don't so snippets are
the ones that kind of give you that
little flexibility so that's something
you need to really be aware of as you're
writing functions but the good news is
once you write it this way you can very
nicely copy and paste the function and
you know that that's going to work in
your code so that's a good good reason
for having that so we saw how that works
but what about defining variables well
sure we have seen this quite a few times
already but let's take a look at that
just one more time here for us to see
how that's going to work so okay i'm
going to try to quit here so okay I told
you it gets moody right so right there
it's not happy with me quit die okay so
as what I was not planning on doing this
but if this happens this is how you kill
the process so PS ax find out or JP I
should do it isn't it so I'm going to do
JPS see if it's oh yeah there's the day
she'll tool kill minus 9 i'm a very a
you know a kind person but not when i'm
on the computer so i had to kill it okay
so there you go so we killed it so right
there let's go back I don't just JPS
look at the process number i killed it
alright so what am I going to do go back
to my example here start Jay shell so
we're back here into a shell let me
reload what I wanted to talk about oh
yes I wanted to find variables so what
do I want to do to define a variable
well i'm going to say here a list
integer and then i'm going to say uh you
know numbers equal to arrays dot as well
that's too boring that's too much of
code to write don't want to do that so
what can I do start with what you want
to do are raised art as list one two
three four five six but I want to define
a variable to this and I'm going to
press a what's called a fixed shortcut
key and the letter V and it does a type
inference very quickly so it inferred
that the type of that variable is a list
so nice to have this type inference
right you don't have to start with the
ceremony let me tell you what the type
air
is hey we are intelligent we can figure
this out on the way so go ahead and type
your expression to a fixed shortcut key
V and then you are able to get that type
inference working so now I can call it
as numbers or whatever I want to call it
I've defined a variable called numbers
so you can just define your expression
and then fill in the type and the
variable name right after that so that
can be very useful and then of course
your earlier question i define a
variable here called numbers as you can
see but I want to change it so i can say
int the numbers equals 24 and bar you
can see that in this case i have only on
numbers so you can redefine variables of
course if you accidentally redefine
variables oops but if you're
accidentally redefining something that
means you're doing way too much here
then you're supposed to it should be
really small experiments anyways ok you
can redefine with different types and
you saw me do that just a minute I had a
list and I change it to a int you can
define methods you saw me do that i
created two functions foo and bar you
can redefine methods as well very easily
sorted ready to find methods just like
your method that you want to type with
the same name and you got a method right
now of course if you change the
signature you're overloading the method
so that's perfectly fine also but you
can also define classes so to define a
class just type a class define an
interface type an interface and then you
can ask for methods you can ask for the
class is available let's take a look at
all of those so what i want what i want
to do here in this example is i'm
starting JJ shell and in this case what
i would like to do here is a define a
function so void foo and let's go ahead
and say output a foo called so that's my
little code that i have written right
there for our food called well it
created a method I'm going to say void
bar in this case of course I'm going to
output again bar called and you can see
that in this case we have that little
function I can ask for em it tells me
those other methods available but it can
also this class myclass and then within
my class I can say public let's say void
f1 and then I can output let's say f1
called so we can start
defining classes as well and then of
course close the class right there so my
class has only one method of course I
forgot a little curly but I recover from
that that's my class but I also can say
interface and I can say my interface and
then this is going to contain just let's
say avoid a you know some funk and I can
create that so that's my little
interface and I've created that
interface a / PR / type tells you what
classes and interfaces you have in front
of you so you can see that I have two
classes here I'm sorry one class in one
interface I also have two methods i
wrote for myself so that is an example
of how you can define these things but
one of the cool things is you can do
forward references so what is the
forward reference do so let's say I'm
going to write a method so void greed
and then I'm going to within the greet
method I'm gonna say say hello and hit
return well I'm not return to say hello
you didn't see me right say hello so far
but the greatest calling say hello I
like this actually because when I'm
writing code I don't think too far ahead
that's just not me I'm just making stuff
up as i am writing the code and then I
want to come back and say I want to
write this function later so when you do
this it tells you hey hey i created the
great for you but don't bother calling
it because it won't work right because
there's a part of it missing so now what
can i do if i type greet i disobey and I
call it it says I told you so right so
it's basically going to fail because it
has an unhandled method right there that
it doesn't happen but now what i can do
is i can say voy to say hello and within
the say hello function i can output over
here and i can say a you know hello and
of course close this function and now
we've got to say hello now i can call
greet and you can see that it actually
is working but of course you may say aha
but i'm going to drop say hello right
now so now I've dropped it now I call
great
well greet as a function you can see
that it fails again because what it
needs is not there anymore so you can
start experimenting with this very
nicely by introducing functions with the
forward reference as you can see right
there that becomes very useful to
experiment and play with it and then you
can change stuff around and the fact
that you can really find functions gives
you the ability to simply come back and
redefine it that that's a pretty nice
thing also great so we saw his story a
little bit already but there's one thing
you can do which is a real load command
and the reload is simply to say I want
you to just do whatever you did so far I
just replay maybe it's a kind of like a
replay right so you can do a reload of
it so to understand reload I'm going to
quickly give you a little example here
to see how reload is going to work so
I'm going to quit jhl here I'm going to
bring it back up and within here I'm
gonna say let's say I type output let's
say hello so you can see that hello up
here I'm also going to say you know four
plus two and I'm gonna then output let's
say over here let's say howdy so I've
got just a few lines over here now i'm
going to say reload and you can see that
it restarted and simply replayed
whatever you had before well this is
good but it is too noisy for me i'm a
huge fan of don't talk to me unless I
have really have to answer you know
something back to you kind of a model
right so as a result you'd be nice that
it doesn't be so you know talkative so
reload minus quiet so you're asking it
to reload but quietly please so you can
see that it did not spit out all the
details that it ran through it just gave
us only the output commands we saw yes
sir why did it do what knows it did it
just didn't print out the result because
there was no side effect so it evaluated
all of those so if I had set a variable
oh and then I had used something to do
the work if you have done it when you
are typing it it is giving you the
immediate feedback but it's not giving
you that intermediate results it's only
giving you the visible side effect so
but having said this let me quit this
real quick let me come back here and I
want to do one more thing here I'm going
to output let's say before and so you
can see that i did before now i'm going
to say reload so I'm going to reload
quiet so you can see that i reloaded so
it printed before i'm going to now
output i'm going to say after and it
printed after now i do a reload quiet
you see that it did before and after
makes sense right so so you did you
print it before reloaded you print it
after you reloaded it runs around the
entire session for you well you can
think of a reload as kind of like a
checkpoint if you want to so notice what
I'm going to do now I'm exiting i'm
bringing back the shell again but this
time i'm going to do up before so right
there is the before then i do a reload a
quiet so what does the reload quiet
going to do well it's printing before
sure then I print the after as you can
see so now I printed before and after
but what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to run reload but this time I'm
going to say well I'm going to ask you
to do a restore at this point in
addition to a you know just saying
reload it so what does that do so I'm
going to ask it to restore and in this
case you can see it ran from the
beginning but only to the checkpoint
anything you did after the previous
restore it didn't run it so in other
words if you're experimenting something
and I do this quite often i'm
experimenting something and now i get
into a really unknown territory and i'm
going to mess up a lot of stuff so i'll
do a quick check point that i do stuff
and then i can discard it and then come
back to the previous stage and then
continue further so this can be really
valuable for experimentation purposes so
we saw that we can do a few other little
things you can
do a set and then you can do a set of
feedback verbose so let me show you
quickly what that does feedback verbose
is very talkative four plus two you will
begin to hate this very quickly it tells
you i create a variable and set it right
are you really going to speak to me like
this right so after a while you will
immediately want to turn this off right
because every little thing is going to
do it's going to keep telling you so if
you were to output let's say in this
case hello you know you can see what it
actually wants to tell you well in this
case it didn't thankfully but if you
were to say in max equals 4 it tells you
i created a variable called max and said
it so you'll never mind i don't want all
that noise so what can you do you this
is other extreme it is silent so if you
run this then it immediately goes so
silent it doesn't even say jay shell
anymore right and then you do a 4 plus 2
it kind of just okay right so it's like
would you talk to me please so you get
kind of justice based on your mood right
you're feeling alone go verbose your you
don't want to be disturbed go silent
right but normal seems pretty normal so
you can say normal and normal of course
is it's going to give you enough details
to kind of carry along it doesn't give
you stuff you don't need to know but
just adequate piece of information so
that's normal you can also do change
your mode to an existing mode if you're
interested so for example i'm going to
set mode vent cuts so i'm going to say
set mode but i forgot the slash set mode
vent kit and then i'm gonna say normal
well i create a bank its mode now but
then i can play with this a little bit
you know fancy things and I can do this
I can now say here i want the prompt
well mode name is of course van cats so
we'll say this is van cats and then that
the little a angle is my prompt the
better the vertical bar is for when it
needs more from you i'll show you how
that works so of course i'm going to say
set mode to vanc it's so we are setting
the mode to vanc it's right now well
let's see why didn't do that so it's set
mode to vanc
it should have turned up but not your so
anyways what I can do now is to have the
prompt greater than and then I can start
using that prompt so i'm not sure why it
didn't turn maybe i just forgot a
command here set Oh set feedback you're
right set feedback there you go so send
feedback van cats mode as when kids
right so set feedback there you go so
thank you so now oh there you go so what
happened now you can see that little
angled sitting there but if I were to
say something like you know nah bars
let's say max over here how about this
arrays dot as list one two three dot and
you can see the vertical bar now let me
do this again so there you go so you can
see the vertical bar now and then i can
write more code after that so that's
basically how we tells you there's more
coming the last few things i want to
quickly say is if you are interested you
could change the startup so just to show
what that actually does if you notice
over here i am in j shell right now and
if i type / imports you can see all that
import right there that's the default
but what i'm going to do now is I'm
going to run J shell but i'm going to
say no startup so now i've started in no
start up now if i say he imports you can
see there is no imports so if you don't
want those imports you can do that but
what if i want my own imports well you
can do that very nicely put them all in
a file and you can start with that file
i'll show you how to do that after i
talk about the summary of what we talked
about so i'm going to show the startup
option in just a minute but before that
well we saw the benefits of ripple to
begin with I'm a huge fan of ripple I
use that constantly in other languages
honestly I'm really happy about Java
having ripple you can do a little
experimentation to play with things you
can navigate around very easily you can
change the imports if you want to you
can list you can say if you can open the
files you can redefine variables
redefine methods you want to and then of
course you can
find classes look at what types you have
in your system and then of course you
can reload and reset do all of those
things so my final example is going to
reopen a file so what I have here in in
here is one file called startup dot star
dot J shell so I say J shell minus
startup and then I'm going to specify in
this case the star DJ shell and it ends
with a sentiment I want to leave with
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
