I am the CTO for something called
bluemix garage which is about three
blocks from here down straight in at the
end just to make prompt you is we're
having a party after party at the garage
tonight rooftop and we're going to be
going somewhere down part so it's 730
730 and we have a page at the end we'll
leave it out with the end of session
that you can go to the URL and get
better fruit for it or if you follow me
I tweeted at last night as well so we
forgive the link that way as well so
we're going to talk about you know
really very significant changes
occurring and have developed
applications around platform as a
service and I Maikel Franco would me and
he's a very deep expert on Cloud Foundry
is on the 45 energy will pop up a
grayish also a deep expert on Java and
IBM surgeon that with liberty and we
wanted to ask you guys first how many of
you on our collective platform as a
service to show you okay so a little bit
not too much um many of you use things
like carrabba's or who will App Engine
okay so along with that okay so we are
going to for you guys you know you can
you know kind of look around for five
minutes while I go through what that is
not that I am I do a level set so let's
go ahead to the first slide Michael well
the disclaimer so we've been putting
everything so the African so literally
what's happening is there's a lot of
fundamental shifts going on I'm sure
you're experiencing a lot of this
yourself the way in which consumers and
now people are judging because we're all
consumers you consuming function in the
app paradigm so this really starts
changes welcome changes the speed at
which they expecting so you know the iOS
8 is updated now you expect your apps to
get updated rapidly no it's about the
experience you know when you go to it
out and it does a little quickly or you
go to a website and unless it's
something you have to be on sometimes
your insurance yeah you want to oh
forget this undated website and on
people to kayak or something's moving
slow doesn't have a good experience you
have to go off to the next room so
experienced customer strange
matters so it's about delivering ass
that engage customers it's not
announcing your to fill that fast you
need to really build them engage away
and you need to build things that
customers your block and the way you do
that is you are you're rapidly and
getting feedback breath and we're right
no right next to sort of a heart a lot
of innovation lost our conversation and
this is what a start-up student is that
they experiment they do minimal Viable
products they experiment to get it out
there these or feedback you change the
chain for business models that use of
technology they change the user
experience looking for what is going to
resonate and what's work so the question
is is how do you as developers deliver
on how rapidly the business wants to go
and supporting a kind of great customer
experiences they want to look so in the
cloud it will be part of that the cloud
supports this rapid kind of development
experimentation ever lost so it's going
to page so as an app developer what we
find as we talked to the guys down the
street with ananya other
in these kinds of characteristics so
they want you know today's Melville's
which you guys are increasingly want
choice so we were just tell me a
discussion started well I'm specific all
right what we have clothes dress it's
like yeah we're doing something else we
can all go you know we haven't maybe
wanna go for J so they said about graph
database so it's not a one size to exalt
today's developers tend to want really
specialized tools how many development
is fundamentally changing too much more
of a stitching together of different
services who needs to write an email
service hasn't it been done often enough
and you know Regional Service apart yeah
email service yeah that's a good
question do we have here preserves yes
yes okay there's 50 services on bluemix
so it's a good question and we have
third parties so we have truly are
referred to a consular notification
through things like that but it is that
that of that which is deep abyss you
have this you have this on what you know
in the platform sometimes outside the
classroom sometimes you know third party
just incorporating api's there certain
things if you want right on the same
platform and davidson soon as you
the low latency and things like that now
there's a focus on code a choice of
tools the land that you develop in the
liver is different you know it's
continuous integration that's the
expectation now fast delivery not you
know months of figuring it out not
certainly many people now go as far as
to continuous delivery automated
production I know there are companies
that do with Netflix but I was a
majority by parking after quite that far
but deliver a continuous integration and
delivery all the way through to staging
very common it really is a different
world you know different kinds of
languages again soon for purpose we get
hear a lot about JavaScript lots of java
swing that's what are your events
that job is certainly still a major
language for use so let's get you so now
i'm talking about cloud or not
alright so so today if how many you guys
are fun and I was ok fuzzy so what
happens when you want to build
applications in the technology you have
you can create a plan and now you need
to get Penelope's to our services i can
put harder hopefully get fulfilled and
not too long you know but you taking
about that i'm going to get your
virtualization layer you're going to get
your OS layer you're into then you know
it's all your been aware that's
important question can i install Tomcat
girl on tomcat install the post rest
videos all night April's into whatever
that's right you're installing your
runtime so i'm actually back taking a
Liberty before contact and then you get
to find this is down here right your
your code and figure out if data start
loading so this takes time it takes
management it takes a lot of hops best
capital cost right there's captain
Acosta's and servers of course of costs
and giving a costume acquiring a lot of
different little wear and software and
most of all it's fine so let's see what
happens is it starts going to the cloud
so now when we come to infrastructure as
a service what we're doing is those
lower lower layers through the
virtualization on I'm going to be taken
care of for you by the infrastructure as
a service so you're now
the machines and getting out a
virtualized image potentially come your
way point of a you may then be able to
deploy a pattern that has on OS middle
around a high for protective Heather's
in IBM recon software that's our
infrastructure as a service with lots of
data centers around the world that's
that stuff to competitor to you know AWS
bezoar hoofers like that used by many
companies most startups and enterprises
so that takes you that's really hops
this house a lock right so about rid of
your capital pop the lousy at the server
closet man it allows it grows you need
two on one of the things that we would
softlayer is there's kind of a private
group person a public mode so if you
have a bright network we can say a
minute so you can get a lot of control
so we think of it less as just you know
surely a private public and more
advantaged for for the public let's go
to next one now we're going to come to
platform as a service and what platform
as a service is doing is now it's
providing the runtime in the middle
where do I and is managing it for me so
this is very different so like
can i install Tomcat well on
infrastructure to service you cannot
solve their can install pakka here you
don't need to hear it there is a
platform as a service layer that it's
taking care of the energy runtime so
when you say is push this app in the run
high and punches other performers Cloud
Foundry platform-as-a-service figures
out oh you want you know the Java
Liberty runtime for you want a job
tomcat Martha where you ought to be fun
time you know identifies it it has a way
of looking at it to figure out the code
that you're pushing what is it so that's
one part and then it's managing the
number of instances so you're tagging
and Michael's going to show you this is
you know you can say i want five I want
to into this trial to be a minimum for
you know about an endpoint oh but now i
will start to add more and more than
9,200 it's simply with man's as you know
give me 200 and that's you know in the
hope of a funk the underlying fabric
capacity and in a public cloud stretches
over cap enough capacity now the other
part of its rest of the pine
no we're in emails you know an email
service a database messaging a business
rule assessment and analytics warehouse
a push notification find the service you
know data synchronization to a mobile
device and Michael's going to show you a
bunch of these so this is the way that
people go about from three services I
was just in a working session for
project and we were keeping any session
they said oh you know my keep suctioning
level that season we have you know a
session cache that you just easily apply
in so these capabilities are there for
you and this is the development inside
and one of the reasons you have it in a
platform which is going Jesus picking
you can okanagan ones out there it's no
consolidated feeling so for in some
cases you really want is running
close to collapse in the damn case of
the database so there's a lot of reasons
to you want cantore of them on the flap
no you may also go out and do something
like this before okay and that's where
IBM bluemix cousin so I don't mix which
email forgotten John stop is I hands
platform-as-a-service it was an acid
beta in February and my general
available engine and so now I'm going to
tell you more about that and Michael's
been to a difference I'm sorry what just
came out with you it lunch became
general about so supportive who X is
generally available it has a 30-day free
trial if you go you can sign up right
now what you want okay so one of the
things is not providing them is
especially for supposed to you from
enterprises they have a very strong
understanding that you don't get to grow
everything you have on the working that
want to write a guys rich customer
information you have you know tax
calculators or other writing systems you
have reservation system so in bluemix on
we have a very strong emphasis in
connecting to existing systems and also
supporting interaction path we can see
structure as a service layer we're going
to see more and more of that coming out
so that idea you need to stand up your
own service and you may want to do that
at an infrastructure as a service level
because
coat and tie it into the mix so things
like that we both have some cake filling
out we were doing more and more than
necessary and that that is something
you'll find very different from a lot of
the other platforms as a service you
know wheatley definitely we are
supporting those startups and
enterprises so we're going after a full
capabilities okay fun so blue and blue
mix move its works yeah advanced when
you get to that were connections workers
so what what is blue eggs and what is
the folks oblivious we've talked about
some of this so it is a standards-based
public cloud platform for managing and
running applications of all types I
would say it is much more about engaging
application so applications around
analytics mobile web things like that
this is not necessarily not necessarily
going to take your transaction you know
your big transaction systems and move
them right there are there are very
different kind of programming model and
architecture it is a cloud-based
architecture we have an API instead of
services we have gaps Michaelson show
this to you as you would expect we have
various layers of different kinds of
security available and and mention the
on-premise integration and then pricing
is
you know a pay-as-you-go or subscription
model and the peer review by Chum the
pricing nature so this is very different
from traditional idea and you also see
that the services that we have a bunch
of them are beta there's experimental
services now this is the idea let's get
things out there and get the feedback
about what you was asked about guerrilla
wat i was working with dallas continuous
integration pipeline last week and it
wasn't there was a feature than didn't
have that the chemos working with needed
so we got home with the dev ops team and
they literally deployed it that night so
they are you work at it and they said
you know we can deploy a simpler version
of this because you are customer telling
us you need that will go tonight so they
normally deploy once a week they did an
extra Napoleon for us and nobody blinked
yeah not mean that you think about that
for your own sisters how often you
really deploy changes rapidly so it's a
really changing world on expectations in
delivery all right let's continue so
inside of bluemix is cloud foundry Cloud
Foundry is bleeding open and platform as
a service it is it was founded
originally on by can wear spun out into
a company called pivotal which is right
down the street from here I am signed on
with
all to support Cloud Foundry because we
felt it was a very strong technology
base and because we felt that had very
strong community that was building and
since we joined which is nothing guys
it's a year this value it's a little
over here um we have we and federal and
others have joined and worked with all
these kinds of companies that you see up
here and Cloud Foundry is moving into
the open foundation model is so it's
been under an Apache open source and why
this is important for you is to avoid
better locking right so the four
opponent is is open it is
non-proprietary we do not alter the flat
founder code you know in terms of
forking it we do put fixes on top of it
everybody you know get that in like a
specializes in that and you can see
where we are the the second leading
contributor to it after afternoon so I
have a very strong commitment to plaza
but what's really important about it
it's the ecosystem so a different vendor
standing up cloud foundry of having on
premise options for it of then having
third parties because if you think about
it as the third party of your fading the
service and you're going to invest now
we're connecting at the deserves some
connection code they can do and then you
know potentially supporting it as a
service as well you know you want to do
it for something that's going to be
widely adopted used widely and that
again the partner
hi there is a vendor so let's continue
from that so Cloud Foundry is the core
so qualified to provide advantages of
the instances the deployment of the
runtime that picking up the runtime the
finding of the services those are all in
the help of the whole system that's what
Cloud Foundry is providing what I have
adds to that as you look at puma is the
user interface so the experience the
specific set of services that are
available now some of them are very
common services that are value on like a
platform people want that they want
their post grass or you know their Mongo
and then some are you know high high
value IM service some experimental ones
like we have a gamification service some
like rules engine athletics etc so
there's both kinds of services and then
also with partners of course like a
twilio so we add that capability around
it and we manage it we manage it in a
highly scalable way we will manage an
increasing level management with
geolocation you know avoidance multiple
locations things like that additional
security we add features into plugin
point on Cloud Foundry like auto scaling
so these are the kinds of things home
and and there are things we contribute
work and contribute back five family
internationalisation for translation as
you expect that's important
we operate mantasy english-speaking
countries anything else I'm just saying
Michael those are the main things we had
what's a text I think he must the charts
have been doing talk about tooling us Oh
during my lunch ever maybe I should
write you some coffee all right so it
works with your app so we want it I like
where our holdings and the Michaels they
go into a lot more that so one thing is
um is the tooling as well oh I guess
there's a video by the good foot is we
have idea provided to learn so we have a
dance like lying on that thing really
won't receive to offer the continuous
integration building all those kinds of
things we also have an editor and it has
get inside of it so you can have a
private you know get and everything but
you can also rip duped yes yeah they can
never run git repository within several
services um and then you can also use
your own editor we've dominated and
contributed to the 500 community of
plugin for Eclipse and then
you can use that you can use command
line you know you can do the integration
into college a so no its developer every
developer wants their own tool set okay
first I'm not sure on your chips what if
you need plugins to do you clips I'll
show you cuz I'm no wrong with that
though yeah yeah that's actually part of
my gun yeah I'm sorry that's good these
are interested in I am separated all
right and I think we're going to over
one more thing right ok I mentioned this
which is down from this application
securely and deploying from existing
systems so we have several different
kinds of ways to do this and we're
adding more we've had a technology
called secure connector reinstall on a
small program on premise and it's a
pretty secure of pipe and then it can
reach into the existing systems and
their schooling on top of that we have a
web-based version that makes it really
easy to just kind of point at the
database extracting turn it into a
restful api we have a more sophisticated
version that we've had for a while which
is cash on the
innovation capability which is a cloud
capability that has a separate kind of
studio a very rich kinds of mapping and
it can connect over to Salesforce that's
18 lots of things like that we're
removing that technology into basically
more about web form so that it's more
seamless with limits but from a
capability standpoint there exists today
and then we have also we have eight guys
who can do it guys from on-premise and
we have a level of a cat management will
be adding more of that this is an area
where you see lots of changes coming out
in this month I don't think they've
deployed the new bit I don't know thick
down the latest update there's an update
coming around this keep I don't think
it's in point yet and we're working on
private api kind of a private kind of
Service Catalog so what this will allow
you to do is as an organization so you
have you know a customer service or a
mortgage service or something and you
want to expose it as a set of eight guys
within your organization and some it
appears in the catalog and also want to
be able to restrict which services are
you into your organization that's what
working so that will be coming and with
that I think will turn over to the devil
you're wearing
yeah okay so and we're going to see how
this goes it's all dependent on the
network and so I may need you to ask
lots of questions if it doesn't go fast
enough just to fill the gaps if you will
now what this demo will actually show is
with bluemix as well as with Cloud
Foundry we actually have multiple ways
to access the environment there's the
common one which is your browser you can
also do use eclipse and i'll show that
i'm actually going to eat with the clips
and then switch over to the browser and
then there's command line so i'm going
to show you a couple of things with the
command line but in reality you can
switch between them and you'll see as I
switch the information represented will
actually carry through so with eclipse
there is an eclipse plugin that you
install there's actually a few versions
there's a special one for bluemix which
is really taking the standard one so
there's a cloud foundry one that one can
get and then there's one specialized for
bluemix to do some additional odds and
ends that work better with bluemix yes
it is just a plugin where you run off
your old PCs and then you talk to the
club or yes yeah so you go to the
marketplace I mean I can go through this
you can go to the marketplace and you
know you just have to type Blue Max and
then yeah
it's my actual work all right so cute
right when i type blimmets you get you
know the Eclipse tools or the beta
version doesn't really matter which one
you take as long as you take one and you
know we update this just like everything
else so you know usually once a month
you'll get a they'll be a beta update
with some new features and it's all
based on what's available in the open
source on github I think the question
was more love like when you're working
love life yeah yo you got like a micro
that was like to do single micro foundry
when you have your own sequels all
versions online right so the interesting
thing is so what we did with bluemix or
the bluemix plugin is when you install
it we actually also will install a local
version of Liberty what's your Liberty
so from that perspective if Liberty
happens to be your platform du jour I
you can do things offline as well as
online now where the gotchas come in
come to be in the services that's not so
easy to tackle you know you you either
have them available or you don't think
there's not a whole lot of magic that
now with docker it's making some
services or become easier and easier to
stand up locally and then you can switch
to something remotely and that is
something I mean you can wire in a ride
service locally as well as you switch to
something else when you're in the cloud
say is it away she's like dummy out of
service or we're not
I'm going there waited like let's say
I'm offline and I my company's call me
an email service but I multiply is there
a dumb you'd also doesn't throw a bunch
of exceptions I always say yes I mean
that that's a classic mock objects kind
of approach to do and that's what you
want to do because also you're paying
for the usage of these services so you
typically do not want to hit an email
service during development because as
you're setting ideally you're setting up
automated test suites for your code and
so if you're doing that you'll always
want to be going against a mock object
or a local potentially local service
right in the case of an email service
something like that you would always do
it as a mock object just behind the API
for the email I think oh I never
actually paid attention I think it's the
raw because i'm using kepler but my
guess is this one on the previous
release which is it should be like 42 43
44 all right then there's not a whole
lot of specialization in this plug-in
it's more about network actions rather
than taking advantage of the Eclipse
framework itself so what I've sort of
jumped ahead with is I've already
defined a bluemix one time and all it
really is is a bluemix somewhere and you
enter in your account information like
my user ID password and where the heck
it is the rest is defaulted in because
it's the default when you enter this and
it'll be more obvious when I go through
the browser how this really plays out
and I have an appt already running in
bluemix which I'm not going to use until
the end whoops because it shows a
slightly different feature that I don't
want to get into right now so what I'm
going to do is actually import in in
application if people are familiar with
day trader or trade
we've now come up with cloud trader
which is take a trade like application
and move it to the cloud and this is
actually part of our IBM DevOps services
where we offer a source code control
system you can do track and plan
basically bug management and like Rachel
meant mentioned before we can go edit
code live which works great if you're
doing scripting languages not so hot if
you're doing java but again you can tie
them to a build and deploy back end so
you could do a with Java and then have
your CI pipeline sorry to take over and
then actually push the updates into
bluemix i'm not going to show any of
that here i'm just going to do the
reverse which is with IBM devops
services we actually offer to source
code control systems we offer a get back
end as well as a wouldn't they call it
now ajaz STM back end you get to decide
when you create the project which way
you want to go you can also use github
you can use whatever you're comfortable
with I'm just going to copy this URL and
then move over into Eclipse and then
import it all right so you go through
your normal thing import it from a
project we have the or I enter that and
say suck it all in alright so now
eclipse is pulling it in I tell it to
import it as a Java project if it can
find one and proof we now cloud traitor
so from here we we have you know it now
it's it's sort of eclipse takes over and
sort of puts it in its way that it wants
to manage Java projects or in this case
a web app right where you have your job
resources I'll up here and then you have
your web content down below what I'm
going to do is deploy it and while
deployed I'll show you some things about
this application as I take you through
it so as with most you eyes will pray
this works you drag and drop and again
there okay we won't do it that way I
found that it's somewhat temperamental
which difficulty this version of the
plugin I have okay so I've learned that
there's many ways to do the same thing
so we can go this route usually one of
them this one will work I know if I see
this pop-up I went the right way so now
which it's basically saying hey you're
adding foul traitor to bluemix and this
one is what is the URL you wish to
access the app you'll find out that lots
of people run cloud crater as a demo app
so just add in your initial somewhere is
your safe bet here you can bind services
in now I have a surface already defined
with my other app but for cloud trader
you do need a database and in this case
here and I'll show you a different view
of all the services this is the one
eclipse uses to sort of show you
everything and I know it needs a sequel
database will pick that
we'll get to later is if you type the
right name of the database we will
automatically match it to resources that
you've defined in your web.xml so I
happen to know that my web.xml has a
resource ref and the resource rep is
called the trade data source and so what
that will do is when this database is
created will actually wire in all the
all the information that's needed in
order to match up that resource to a
back-end so it'll inject the URL it will
inject the password they'll do all that
quang quote magic for you for free you
don't have to do it look at the spring
it's all define an xml everybody so
there's also part of it is you at one
time well the same magic happens it
won't if you so both of us are so
whether it's spring or in your web.xml
yeah we'll do matching on the names so
as long as you spell it right it'll
match up right yes so pair of your cube
that you need to manage environment
variables and
love that end in your code that I hear
that it will detect your data source for
example an immediate employment yeah and
I'll show you I'll show you exactly how
that works I'll also take you through an
example where you do have to use
environment variables because not
everything can be done this way right so
now it's a packaging up the war file
pushing it up into the cloud and
starting it for us right well do in the
meantime is actually switch over and
take you through the UI now what I've
done already is I actually went to ww
bluemix net and it automatically routes
you over to our website where you can
like we said before you can sign up for
a free 30-day account in my case I'll
just logged in
yeah it's always tricky we have my IBM
ID versus mine internal lighting now for
everyone you're always going to see the
same things except in my case I have 273
days left so what you see now is the
standard dashboard with lots of
information I have four apps I don't
doing oh and what you see here is I
personally only have two gigs of
available memory which is I can only
start up so many apps the total sum size
cannot exceed two gigabytes of total
memory I get to use up to ten services
and all my apps are doing well which is
I guess a good thing you easily see all
the apps that you have running as well
as what services they're bound to and
then you get a closer view on the
surfaces and I'll go through each one
I'm just gonna do some things that I
know take a little while and then come
back what I'm going to do is actually
show you some of the dashboards that the
services provide so even though in to
hear what we've done is we've actually
asked services to spin up instances of
thing things like here it's a database
behind the scenes we still don't hide
things from you right so I'm going to
launch the dashboard for database
service while I go take you around and
show you other parts of the UI if it
responds there we go
right No
okay I like it when I quickly okay there
we go now before I go further through
here I'll go across the towel so we have
this catalog and like we mentioned we
have a variety different categorizations
of things or catalogs one of which are
boilerplate and boiler plates are really
getting started apps so if you were to
come to bluemix and you had no idea what
you really wanted to do you could start
with a prebuilt sample or example where
you click one of these or I'll do this
one and you can read about what the
boilerplate is all about this one
happened to be hey if you want to
develop a job app using our data cache
service you can go over here hit create
and what it'll do is it'll push
basically a sample application into the
cloud from there you can actually hook
up get so you can actually wire it back
into devops services and it will
actually pull back all the source code
so that you can now develop offline
through the DevOps services just like
any get project oh I will say you know
this is indicative of design this is
designed very differently than some
products in the past like in the past
right if you think about IBM you think
about us as having very resilient
products with lots and lots of features
you know we we in within IBM we've been
transforming to be much more centered on
our users and I'm making the simple
things easy to do and in this case with
the cloud making it really self-service
consumable for documentation for samples
like this and that's the objective is
fruit for developers to be able get
started very rapidly here and to make
the simple things easy
besides boiler plates we have 1 times
and like we mentioned you have Java node
for JavaScript Ruby as well as you can
bring your own build packs so if you
don't like these languages or you prefer
in different language like 0 or Python
or PHP there are additional build packs
that you can then also apply to this
front to bluemix itself so that you can
get you know WordPress up and running
very quickly yes with the support if it
was feel better oh yes yes yeah you know
and we've we've chosen certain ones that
we really claim that we support and you
can always bring your own and also the
the pricing sorta is you basically get a
certain amount of free hours per run
time and really it gets broken down into
Java node and I think it's like
everything else or Java node Ruby you oh
yeah you could at PHP you can add our
then we get into services and so like we
mentioned you know there's a bunch of
mobile services that you can add your
application things that are more
specific to web you know account i'll
show you how the session cache works and
why'd you use it another one you know
here you sendgrid is the male 1 alright
so for email delivery you can use sem
grid then you get into your data
management and as you can see there's
what 16 different types of databases and
data services that you can attach to
your application so you know as long as
you're right you know compliant sequel
you can just pick and choose the service
and each service so i'll just pick this
one for kicks will have different plans
this one actually only has one and it's
free others you'll see if I pick oh this
one I believe we'll get into right so
you can have a free one and then there
are like there's others that will start
charging you money so this one for a
small plan will be thirty dollars per
instance so it's not per month it's not
you know everyone has a different charge
rate as to how they'll charge some are
size of database some are a number of
transactions per second some are just
total number of transactions this one
just happens to be a size of database
okay and that's we doubled back up so it
depends on the service so some services
that will offer dashboards here's an
example it's not letting you go show you
a whole lot so here they offer backup
and restore others may offer
import/export some offer you nothing and
you have to go write an app so again
it's up to the service and what
capabilities they'll provide it's often
with like you're paying for a higher
level service right so then have backup
and things like that right and some will
offer you no more you buy the H a
database so you you know you can do
backup or it's like automatic backups to
yet another service you know some people
provide backup services and so it's more
just hooking it up and you know watching
you take off and do whatever it does to
provide that feature does the party
so anything that you can access from
this UI it's one stop going and we'll
bill you right I believe that today's
two bills there's one for its
consolidated billing but I believe or
Gordon yeah I believe that the IBM ones
are on one bill and the third parties
are on a second bill but it's against
one account it's just data that's me as
you imagine we have quite a bit of
changes in integration to do in IBM's
own back-end systems you know financial
yeah yeah it's tricky good question
let's say I really want the mineral and
like an application to run amok well
you're acting to say don't you I pay for
this I'm going to stop you um how do I
want to answer this so what I'm trying
to think I because I skipped over the
part that actually shows how this book
so the way it really works is I'll do it
through an example because that'll just
be easier so when you create an
application let's know i'll pick like
yeah sure
let's create one of these suckers oh
okay maybe I won't do it this way let me
do it through the boilerplate since it's
a prebuilt app well you did actually
that's another question here Charlie is
it possible out of multiple environments
test a yes so there's the concept of
organization and spaces spaces you can
you can create as many spaces as you
want and you can authorize people to
share and they span a space level so you
can have other people sharing your dev
and test environment but not be over you
Gavin test space and not be able to get
to the production space physically it's
just all an allocation within cloud
foundry there's no physical and this is
our thing for people if they come from
an enterprise background there's no
physical difference right it's just
control yeah so I didn't move away like
a war file from one environment or the
other yes I would assume that but yes
and if you in you could set it up in
your pipeline to do some of it
automatically if you want to you know I
have a URL name a domain name like the
point cheers to your system yes yes yeah
so there are ways to first you'd have to
register a private domain whatever God
and as long as you point it to our IP
addresses you can now use it and create
as many routes as you want so host names
on top of that domain so the way it
really works is you define the number of
instances and the amount of melon you
don't ever ask for CPU it actually the
more memory you and and pricing works
around memory so you're actually paying
four gigabytes of memory per hour is the
actual standard charge rate that the
more memory you ask for the more
allowable CPU you can get and really
what happens is cloud foundry and a
platform as a service is all about high
density how many apps can we
together on a single instance so
therefore the more memory you asked for
the more CPU your allocated and if
nobody else is using the cpu you can get
far more than you you know you actually
thought you could get right because we
put you on a eight cpu box and nobody
else is using any of the ATP use you'll
get a TP use but if everyone's running
hard well your mind you'll get the
fraction that is allowable by your
memory allocation so I have an
application that has a first of all
memory output flipped or I should say
and like that let's say thousand users
and with the flippers very little I
won't have much of an issue the cost was
correct cost-wise you want but it'll
also mean you don't get all the CPU that
you may want right so you have to do so
it's it's an interesting dilemma where
you have to think about ok I'm going to
pay for the amount of allowable CPU
through the amount of memory yeah what
tends to happen is you know people need
more than they expect and to actually
support so many concurrent users you
actually need more memory regular so it
it naturally falls out that doing it
based on memory is one usable form of
control we are looking at others but
right now memory seems to work quite
well oh do you want to mention them
about auto scaling all right well I'm
gonna show yeah seriously ok maybe with
15 is guilty yes I'm very careful
memories so that might be a good thing
yeah yes yeah so let me
okay so let me switch back I'll do it
through here because that way you'll see
some of the other things so let me
delete this guy so that way i know i
have enough memory let me making a
mormon all right now you got today human
right so what I'm going to do is
actually attach a couple of services to
cloud trader and as you see here this
guy started right he started one
instance of 512 meg and I only have a
gig left which is why I'm sensitive
right now what I'm going to do is add a
couple of services to them so one
service i'm going to add is the session
cashing service so the big issue or the
the things you have to realize is when
you're developing with the cloud or
trying to develop a scalable web app
right one of the things people love to
use is session and the trick to using
session is you need you can't use in
memory sessions once you scale out right
because there's no way for sessions to
magically hop around now you could do
cess infinity but that's only a stopgap
because if something were to go down or
if for some reason i get rerouted I need
the seson so what we do is we provide
the session cache and again it comes
with a variety of plans as you can see
here we're going to go free because I'm
cheap actually I'm using free services
for all what I'm doing here now I'm
going to delay the restage and I'll go
through some of that only because
there's other things that I want to
attach first I didn't mean to go all the
way back out we've added the session
cashing service what I'm going to also
do is add some common add-ons one is the
auto scaling
yep free please and I'm also going to
add the really
time is safe you have unsaved changes
save
the other what the heck I didn't change
that and servicing that that's
interesting you sure you're in the same
app gonna partake that's not one solo I
can tell you that's not going to look
well yes okay the other one that I had
is the monitoring and analytics and all
and with 12 minutes ago yeah so as I
keep doing it you're noticing that my
activity log keeps changing but let me
go ad the monitoring and analytics you
ok so now I've attached the the session
caching I've added auto scaling and i've
added the monitoring and analytics and
i'm going to have it apply all the
changes all at once so one thing you
need to do is with auto scaling you need
to describe what behaviors you want to
actually scale out or scale down all
right and I have no policy great so
let's add a policy will do it on memory
now I'm going to force it to scale so if
we just say if you see me exceed twenty
percent please scale up and if i drop
below nineteen percent scale down in
order to make this more interesting I
need to adjust all these time windows so
that way we're not sitting here for two
to five minutes okay so now we have this
in play so
there's one side cause memory to
actually bump we'll see it happen so now
we can come over and use something like
our monitoring and analytics and we'll
pray that this starts which will
actually show you what's going on with
your systems there's actually a variety
of tools that we have here that will
show you the what's the current cpu
usage or logs or other things that are
going on with your application okay so
right now we haven't started up yet
we're actually restarting the
application so it's saying we have no
data yet available let's see you okay so
that actually you starting I think it's
restarting in the meantime since I'm
impatient like I said there's also the
command line and so depending on which
route you go you can see what's really
going on with the system some provide
more feedback than the other you make
the view on that bigger there in your
time senior
okay so right now I pointed to the same
place you know bloomix dinette I've
logged in as myself if I look I can see
all the applications that I'm running as
you can see this one's red for some
reason let's see if we can get some logs
to find out what's going on let me see
if we can get some recent loss now look
okay so it's actually restaging my app
as we speak so here you see that it
downloaded it it's applying the build
pack installing liberty so we just I'm a
little bit impatient I thought it would
be slightly further along than it is but
at least we know it's coming back what I
did not touch that
okay it's still not back yet
there's something weird
no it's okay i was at this thing oh I'm
29 1149 three minutes ago there's
something stuck I wonder if I'm it could
be the connection it's a no no let's not
that or upgrade okay well that's what
network are you guys on your knee up
though he had to go hard wired um hard
 he was having trouble getting on
the network okay to this what so yeah so
what what I'll do instead is will switch
to the other application while we're
waiting so this other application i have
is the twitter influence analyzer so
with cloud trainer i showed you how we
can wire in a sequel database with the
twitter influence analyzer what it does
is it actually uses two things one is it
uses a Cloudant no sequel database which
would you know require you to do the
same thing that i showed you with the
sequel DB the other thing that it does
is it actually uses Twitter now we don't
offer Twitter as a first-class service
so the way you actually get Twitter to
integrate is you actually have to define
environment variables so if we come over
here you see that I've already hooked up
my application to Twitter and this is
the information Twitter gives you right
so I put it in as environment variables
for this deployment if we were to look
at the code we would actually see that
they actually read
this is this guy it'll actually pull in
your twitter information right here from
the environment variables right so it's
nothing more than looking at the system
environment because those get passed
through so there are things that people
consider as you know first class or
services that automatically get wired in
and then these you would consider second
class services where you have to define
things on one side and then expect to
pull them in on the other people have
come up with different ways of making
this more pretty where you sort of hide
it as it can be from the system
environment variables or it can be you
know configuration file or a mix if you
will but now if I were to actually run
this app it is already running so all we
have to do is switch back over right and
here's my URL please pretty please
yeah there we go okay check out job one
yeah I did that this morning so I know
there's more than at least one hit I
would hope so what's happening so what
this does is it actually scours oh it's
up to 19 followers this morning was only
15 but you can see what it's doing is is
actually going out to twitter using the
twitter api is pulling back all the data
and then using google maps to actually
lay out where all the tweets are coming
from around the world there ain't ever
goes really question here do you have
like napping a services so realize that
some services need to be formalized
services and other ones are just web AP
is that you can go access so I know of
no formalized Matt api's because most
people just go to google maps and then
use obviously yeah google maps is what
everyone i know i mean with a lot of
those right you can sign up again
there's no direct integration yet but
you can obviously go to them sign up and
you know because i know they offer
different qualities depending on our
servers i think they have something
about if you do it for something no pay
if you do females yeah so I don't we we
have geolocation services we don't do
the translation of like a dress to
coordinate and but then you go to gold
maps and phebe and they've guy for the
google maps that's pretty common so we
should probably wrap up and go back to
the presentation of a minute and show
them the party invitation and tell them
a little bit about the garage make sure
alright let's talk so um I mentioned
that on the CTO of the bluemix garage
the bluemix garage is not a physical
garage I have to say it is a new
consulting lab within IBM that that is
house with a whole set of startups down
the street over at howard and second
street and what we're doing there is
we're really taking an innovative
approach to developing applications with
customers both from startups of tanner
prizes and we apply IBM design thinking
as a means of you know using a test set
of design techniques to really get to a
great application which is actually been
applied to bluemix and then we use
leading agile development practices
really based off of extreme programming
to develop applications really rapidly
with very high quality test driven
development continuous integration and
we both build and transfer switch ease
through pair programming and then we
deploy on bluemix so with that we'll go
to the and that's our rooftop that's one
of the pictures there you can see the
rooftop that's where the party is
tonight and then I think you know we
have you put in their fearsome the
information about the the party that's
at the rooftop and we're also doing it
with twilio so you can come and there
will be a lab a demo in a lab so you can
try it all out yourself in their
strengths and you know tore apart the
booth oh the booth has the information
to ya house well as they can try out
bluemix over there oh I'm sorry that's
very true right so there's a big booth
upstairs and bluemix is a big part of
that so you can try it up there as well
so there's a number of different places
that you can go and try it nowhere does
it with booth yeah I think it's right
like in this you go in and it's on the
right yeah in the hilton it's in the
exhibitors hall yeah
the gear yeah yeah all the job of ones
are here we agree about that guess and
yeah it's a 30 day free trial and that
Michael in quite mention but there's
actually then a free tier two so like
you notice the services are free there's
an ongoing free tier as well you know
like you could use for a small app so
I'll need to putting a credit card in
case you decide you're going to go over
that amount so and that's about it I
think we're any other questions right of
time actually and we're out of time
