is lab 500 and our DevOps cloud native
micro services with my su cool hands on
lab in this lab we're going to assume
the persona of Lisa Jones and we're
going to use the Oracle 2 developer
cloud service to close out our sprint as
well as perform a number of
administration tasks or at least show
you where these tasks are in the tool so
let's go ahead and get started as Lisa
as a project manager that one of the
first things she's gonna want to check
is to make sure that everything is done
in this particular sprint and she can do
this by looking at the burndown chart or
the sprint report and as you'll see we
completed this in a day for our lab but
in reality those reports would be very
very helpful to see what was completed
over time next you can click the
complete sprint button make sure that
she understands so this will actually
close the sprint remove it from the view
and there we go our sprint has been
completed our new comp our new product
catalogs with combination of social
media the first X phase of it it's done
and we can drill in and start looking at
some of the administration screens now
one of the most useful things is to
understand how to delete a sprint or
delete a project you can this is where
you can do that in the top right corner
you can look at your usage metrics over
time see you know how much space you're
consuming what's going on there you can
also look at your issues so you can do
issue tracking on the various products
that you have going on and probably one
of the more useful ones is to look at
the various repositories so you can see
all the different git repositories
you've created or accessed inside of of
your various projects and last but not
least we'll take a look at the branches
that exists this is our master branch
for for this sprint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
