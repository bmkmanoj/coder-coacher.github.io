the DB csdb a workshop in this lab we
will configure our man recover a table
we're going to create a database from
the cloud service back up and then we'll
explore the DB database image with SSH
and finally look at the console so first
of all let's install the backup module
we've already downloaded it we're
extracting it now we're going to create
a wallet directory and the wallet
directory will be used to access the
cloud module and now we're installing
the our man backup module once we've
done that we're going to use our man to
connect to the cloud console backup and
let's just take a look and confirm that
those backup files exist in the cloud
let's backup files were created when we
configured the instance when we created
it so let's create a restore point and
the restore point will be used as the
point to return to once we've dropped a
table we're going to drop a table and
then restore it after restoring back to
the gold check point
so first let's drop the table once we've
dropped the table we've got to connect
back into our man we're going to shut
down the database and then we're going
to start it up in mount mode
run the restorer will execute that and
the restorer should restore back to the
checkpoint that we set a few moments ago
and will restore the backup now this
should take actually several minutes
even though we've edited out the time
here now we're starting the database
back up now that the database has been
restored we're altering the pluggable
database and opening the container
opening those pluggable databases and
let's just confirm that the table we
previously dropped has been restored now
that we see that it has we're going to
go back to the cloud console we're going
to create a database cloud service from
the backup restoring it using the cloud
backup files then we'll go back into the
instance and connect to it and confirm
that it's that it's up and running now
this create exercise is actually going
to take about 30 minutes I've edited
that out of the replay just so you know
but you can expect it to take somewhere
around 30 minutes once we kick off the
restore process it could be longer as
well so right now we're connecting we're
logging into the database console now
we're hitting the create button we'll
call it alpha 0 1a it's got to be a
release 2 version since we backed up the
on-premise version from the workshop
image it was a release 2 version as well
let's enter the mandatory information
that's the administrator password we're
going to select the public key we'll be
using that later to connect back to the
image
and we don't need to back that we'll
choose not to back up this instance that
we're restoring but we will select the
option to create from back up you notice
that we deselect the on-premises backup
the procedures a bit different from that
for that instructor-led version actually
uses an on-premise backup we're using a
cloud backup in this case now you'll
notice it's creating the instance now it
has a status of creating instance and
you can monitor those steps by going
into the activity up in the top menu and
it'll be in service maintenance mode
while this operation is occurring and
again as I said it'll take at a minimum
30 minutes once it's finished it'll give
you a status of succeeded now let's go
back into it we need to know what the IP
address is so we can connect to it in
this case 129 157 187 1894 you'll have
to check that for yourself obviously
yours will be different now let's open a
new con a new terminal window and our
keys are sitting here as well I'll just
make sure that the permissions are
correct on the private key we're going
to SSH in and you can see that we've
successfully done that and let's just
poke around a little bit
you notice we come in as OPC let's
connect to the Oracle user and let's
just take a look at the filesystem
you'll notice that the file system
utilizes user or one for product and use
0 to 4 data files
we'll just change directory to the
Oracle directory you'll notice or the
Oracle home directory
now we're opening part four for three
and you'll see that that port has been
open it takes about a minute to open the
port once you've made the selection
you've got to go back out and back in
again it doesn't Auto refresh now let's
look at the consoles first the database
monitor you type in the I you can select
the monitor directly off the menu in the
cloud menu you have to accept the
certificates confirm the security
exceptions we're going to log in as
debounce monitor and it has the same
password that you entered when you
created it and we're not going to do
much in here but just take a look at
that the next thing we're going to do is
look at the access access the Enterprise
Manager database Express
you might have a problem with the Adobe
plugin it's a bug the way to get around
that is to bring up the debugger I know
this is a little inconvenient but we
haven't got control over the Adobe
plugin it requires it to show the
monitor now finally let's go in with the
application Express monitor take a look
at that alright this is Apex so this
concludes lab 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
