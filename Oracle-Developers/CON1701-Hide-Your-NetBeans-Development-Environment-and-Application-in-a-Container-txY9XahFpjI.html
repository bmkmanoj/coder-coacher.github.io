enjoyed the party last night and our
fresh to start with the new sessions or
probably already followed one and so
what's the content for today so this is
more or less the outline if you have any
questions in between please feel free to
interrupt me and i'll try to answer them
immediately you don't have to wait until
the end but first of all why do we even
want to run an ide in the docker
container except that it's cool of
course to do things with dr. nowadays
but we had some practical reasons for it
one of the reasons was it we have like
big servers that we share for the team
so our development machine is like a
hexa core which we share with between
five and eight developers and that's
kind of cool until the fight starts
breaking out because we have numerous
ports you have a port for your API a
port for your angular code port for this
port for that and if you were all on the
same machine and yeah you have port
conflicts quite quickly so you have to
decide which developer get which ports
you have to adjust your application to
support multiple ports that's not really
convenient and another reason for us was
that we just wanted to roll out new
environments quickly if it was a new
team coming up we just wanted to have
those environment setup and hours or
even faster if possible and I like I
mean docker nowadays you see it a lot
being used in production maybe we could
even use the same docker containers that
we use on production for our local
development so that we know for sure
that if we develop something for an
application server that it would work
locally on your development machine but
also on a production machine and yeah we
came up with docker of course you can do
this with virtual machines or stuff like
that but I show you in a minute wide
docker is probably one of the best
solutions for it now if you ever seen a
talk about docker or an introduction
article or anything like that you often
stumble about this comparison to try and
explain what dr. is but i was thinking
okay you might have seen this already
let's come up with another example so
last night I did some internet research
and I
cause this guy don't know if you know
him but apparently he's a musician and
he also has his own container because
he's located in here for quite a while
in the year that's easy for him he has
no troubles from the outside he doesn't
have to go to rush hour he hasn't got
any bad weather he can just do his
business and focus on the thing he's
good at and the other big advantages I
don't have to listen to him there's no
interference from the outside world so
that's sort of the same thing for docker
containers except of course you all know
what happened last night that container
broke a bit loosen he went on the run so
we're four can you use docker I mean I'm
telling about using it for the IDE but
lots of people are using it for like the
production environment or a test
environment which can also run it on a
Raspberry Pi and do some stuff there and
if you want to get started this is like
probably the most easy example and
you're going to just install the package
and start a docker container and then
you enter the shell in that docker
container you can start playing around
then you can install software and the
docker container and configure it as you
want but that's not really the preferred
option the preferred option is like to
use docker files and the docker file is
more like the configuration of your
machine so here we say we want to have a
Java 8 JDK image as the base the big
advantage of that is that Java is
already in there and it's an official
supported image so i don't have to
install java manually inside some window
container or some other linux and
machine and then i can simply just
download netbeans and install it and
start it so it's if you're a bit used to
linux operating system commands and this
is quite easy to do and you can find a
lot of it on the internet so then you
can just copy paste the most of it from
this docker file we can then build
images and images like a non-running
container if you run it it's a container
with the terminology sometimes a bit
mixed up even in the doctor
mendation of dr. itself and if you build
it you can start it and you have a
running container it can also push the
image to a container image registry that
the sort of like get for docker
containers or docker images to be more
precise the big advantage of that is
that if you have friends is a d-type
environment and you create the image
once and then at every deed that machine
you just pull the image from the
registry you know for sure that you all
have the same image because if you don't
do that and you're built a docker file
an every machine and one of the steps is
to update all the packages in your
docker container then depending on how
much time is between those bills and it
can be that you have new updates and
adds up I always try to use an image
registry and the big advantages is that
it's also really space efficient because
only the differences are stored in the
registry it's not that the complete
container is stored if you would have
virtual machines and you have multiple
versions of it yet to store all the data
here it's only the disk so if you only
change the application only the war file
then the rest isn't stored again and
this is an example of it for instance on
one machine this is the old situation
and then we pull the latest version from
the docker image registry we can see
here that the newest one is downloaded
and here we can see what's the
difference so it's less than a megabyte
or 0 dot 1 megabyte even so it's really
space efficient so that's one of the big
advantages of docker compared to virtual
machines i mean with virtual machines
you need like a complete guest OS for
every virtual machine that takes up a
lot of disk space but there are some
more and some of them are also touched I
mainly no internet of things it's really
popular Raspberry Pi running virtual
machines on a Raspberry Pi isn't really
convenient the resources are just too
constrained for it but running doc
around it works perfectly even on the
lower versions of the Raspberry Pi so to
give you an example what we did is like
create
complete detail environment and a built
environment all with docker files where
we have like a base image with Java in
it and this is a base image for the
server where I think dumb cat was inside
it and then we built everything on top
of that and if you don't look at the
disk space I mean all of that is less
than 1 gigabyte of disk space mean try
that with a virtual machine that's
nearly impossible so that's really
convenient and another convenient thing
is that it's really quick I mean
building all of this or actually
downloading everything downloading like
sonic qube get bled don't get java
everything building the docker files and
having everything set up took me four
minutes and 11 seconds and that was
probably because my bandwidth is only 30
megabit so if you have more bandwidth
you can do it even quicker than that so
that's more or less words it's often
used for some mainly known GUI
applications application servers web
servers and stuff like that at the
company where we work for we also use it
for testing just run the tests in a
docker container and if the tests are
successful call API with a green thing
if the tests are not successful call it
with a red thing we're all set in the
docker container we can do whichever
test we want so you complete continuous
delivery process is independent of any
test framework but the topic we're going
to discuss today is use it for
development so just your local
development machine run your IDE inside
it at one thing that's important first
is you have to persist some data there
are a number of options for it you could
use like a data container that's more
the preferred a really official way so
you just create a container for the data
but if you want to get data out of it
it's a bit tricky because you have to
first extract it and everything so
there's a bit more convenient way and
that's just to use your host operating
system and make sure some of the ports
from your host operating system are
available in the
so what I do here is the workspace
directory within my environment is
available within the docker container so
I think I can conveniently copy files
through that directory and the big
advantages if you throw away a docker
container and it doesn't possess
anything so if you have changes in it
it's gone so if you want to keep those
changes you have to make sure you store
them somewhere properly and what do you
then persist on these are some common
things that are convenient in the end we
ended up more or less positioning the
complete home folder so that everything
is stored outside of the container all
the data that you want to possess
friends is amazing repository you don't
want that if you start a new docker
container that you have to download all
your artifacts again or you want to do
some performance tests on your network
or something like that and but then if
you want to run IDE which options are
there so in the beginning there were
mostly options like remote desktop and
using VNC but nowadays using x11 from
your Linux host there's also an option
and that's actually quite powerful
because you just start a container and
you immediately get the application in
your face instead of having to make a
connection with VNC or remote desktop or
anything else but bear in mind some of
the examples i'm showing i didn't
possess everything to my host operating
system because for testing purposes you
mostly want to just have a fresh copy
every time but that means that some of
the examples i will show you have a
little bit more of a startup time
because not everything is possessed it
and some things have to be executed for
the first time it's like cycling first
steps take a bit more effort if you just
possess your entire home folder and
everything that's there to persist you
won't have this issue so X 11 it's like
from really simple to quite complex I
won't go into the details of this one if
you want to read the details read it
here so by default you can use it quite
easily but it's not secure for us that's
not really a problem I mean it's
our own machine and we're admin on it
anyway so we can do whatever we want but
if you have more security considerations
and it's good to look at these points
but bear in mind that the further you go
down the harder it is to set it up you
need to do a lot more things to make it
happen I one thing you probably quite
quickly notices that you get an error
like this because you have to set your
rights okay and it's easily fixed with
just this command so if you ever get
that error you yet so we are not going
to discuss the different doctor files we
have like 4 X 11 for VNC for RTP but
we'll have also a general part I mean in
every container I want to install
netbeans and I want to set some of the
directories netbeans is using to the
workspace directory and the reason is
that the workspace directory is mapped
to my host so that gets persisted and
the other option would be that I would
make sure that the default user of
NetBeans has already possessed it on my
host just what you want at the end Reza
URL with a bit bucket repository so you
don't have to type it over 40 x 11 dr.
file is really easy of course we want
Java we have the general part where
netbeans is installed and we can just
run netbeans and maybe you don't believe
me that it works so I'll show you wait a
second
is their phone big enough for everyone
to read ok so I'm using a virtual box
inside windows machines I'm really sorry
for that because running dr. a native
home windows isn't supported yet
Microsoft is working on it but we still
have to wait for a while to get at so
I'm running it inside VirtualBox image
and inside that I have all the
information to create docker containers
so this is the configuration that's used
to run the docker file which you saw so
I mapped the workspace directory and the
maven directory and I give it some port
so that I can access the application
from outside I can simply say run and
you can already see not been starting up
know that it takes some time because not
everything is persisted but we'll get
there
so I got like a really really simple
example that's not big enough for me so
I just simply add a world example to
show you that I can run the application
inside a glassfish application server
and show you that it works so not really
special anything there it's mainly about
docker here so I can just say run
glossary should be starting I don't care
about passwords
so now i can type whatever i want more
or less here and i'll get the response
and you can even see down here it's
really this container that's being used
so it's really easy you mean you can
just start it up and start working
immediately it could be even run it from
a USB disk or something like that and
take it with you to have like a quick
development environment at hand if you
don't have your laptop with you and I
mean that's the NetBeans example but it
goes it's stopping some stuff that takes
a few seconds but it works more or less
for any IDE and so I could even do this
video clips sorry for the NetBeans use I
will wake you up when eclipse is gone of
course you collapsed a bit slower yeah
yeah so the question is does darker
support resource control and there is
some support for it but its last time I
checked it was quite low level so it was
more or less configured with it on linux
kernel level I don't know if they
improved on that I know there were some
projects that can help you with that but
we didn't do it because we have quite
large machines and we didn't encounter
any issues working with multiple users
on the same machine plus it's not a
production environment for us so it's
less mission-critical if you would
really run lots of docker containers on
production and probably it's more
important but yes yeah so the question
is what do we do with the docker
containers do we run forever would one
or do we try them away like diapers I
heard there was a popular topic in a
previous session it really depends I
mean when you're in a project were lots
of changing for instance we run lots of
applications in different application
servers within the docker environment
and if we add a new application we have
to change it and then everybody has to
update it so in the project I'm now
doing depending on how much you need it
I think you would update once a week or
something like that some people who are
working on other topics update like once
a month or something like that it really
depends on what you want but if you
structure it quite well because you can
layer those containers and if you make
sure that most of the changes are in
like the latest container you only have
to build that one and start that one
again so then it's really quickly to get
a new version if you have to build
everything again if you have to install
lighting that means again a Java again
everything that can take a while so
that's not convenient so there if you do
it properly then it is quite quickly
within minutes that you have a new
version
yeah so the question is do we put
Arizona on get up and no unfortunately
not i work in a large financial
institution with lots of security and
stuff like that so we also do things
like managing certificates to connect to
get repositories that our internal so I
unfortunately cannot share them but the
ideas behind it are the same as as the
ones i show you here and at our company
we don't use the x11 connections we use
rdp mainly so differs a bit what you
want or what you're used to where I have
shared them okay yeah so the question is
how do you share the docker files a best
way would be to do it to a darker
registry I mean you just push the new
version to the doctor registry and your
teammates just get the new version there
the other option is that you don't use
the doctor registry you just use the
docker files and you share them in our
case we share them true stash repository
which is a git repository and then
everybody just builds the container over
and over again because we also have some
use of specific entries inside it so
then it's difficult to do it to a shared
registry
okay so the question is can you build
like a private doctor registry for your
company yeah in fact it's just a docker
container which you can start so it's
really convenient it's it's a one line
and and you have a docker container
which is own private dock or registry so
that's that's really easy to set up but
we have done that before it's on
projects and if you don't need extra
security it's just one line of code and
you have a registry up and running ison
all right mmm okay so the question is
what do you do with the database yeah
that's a common topic databases and
doctorates it's a bit more difficult
again it depends I know we have like a
shared database which we sometimes use
so that's just a physical database on I
think a red hat machine and we just
connect from the docker container to
that machine but we also created like I
think it's my sequel database within a
docker container and connect to that one
so then you have sort of like the data
container for a database works as well
and the difficult thing is if you want
to access data easily it's a bit more
difficult because it's in a container so
the Pens have hit on what you want but
it's easy to throw away and then just
develop stuff and use some scripts to
fill the database for those things it's
quite handy okay so we add the Eclipse
but we can even do it with IntelliJ if I
have a network
so again it's just a matter of setting
up you can do practically anything with
it it doesn't really matter which ide or
or whatever you want to use you can put
it in da current on the common duct or
registry you can see examples for almost
every application the application is
running on inside the VirtualBox graphic
environment yeah it's quite quickly of
course you always have developers
complaining like I know it has to be
native because I also i will have
performance issues but we actually have
quite a lot of teams using it and it's
it's performing quite well I mean IBM
ones did their research where they
compared auger machines to kvm and bare
metal and overhead of docker was really
minimal there so I think it's quite
workable to use it not much over right
there
hmm so you can start like any docker
container just if for this it's a bit
harder to use multiples on yeah you can
still use multiples on the same machine
so that's not an issue talking between
docker containers you normally don't do
or yeah you can still do it but what a
man is mostly you go if you use remote
desktop or VNC you just connect to the
port which is running your token
container so for instance I have port 2
for my daugher container my colleague
has poor tree and we connect with remote
desktop to the sport so still you have a
bit of port configuration there but at
least you don't have to change your
application for it also I showed this
one starting command I also show that
one pnc so this is I think it was used
before thing now where my desktop is
more popular than nowadays and VNC but
so can be helpful but it gets a bit more
difficult than x11 as you might notice
here we already have to do some stuff to
make sure we have users and access
because we cannot access it and we use
something called a supervisor to
supervise the process so everything
keeps on running to make sure that the
VNC connection is kept alive and to do
that we add a VNC configuration file in
the end we expose the port so we can
reach crew v and see this this container
and we start to supervise sorry yeah
in me mid boot the daughter on a macro
oh yeah ah hmm yeah I haven't used the
head on a Mac but my experience with
boot the DA current tools like that is
that for whatever reason they don't work
I just use virtualbox and it just works
I don't know what they did with boot to
dokur or I haven't used the new version
maybe that works better with with the
doctor me and my colleagues we always
had issues with it it didn't felt like
completely working out of the box so i
would suggest just using virtualbox or
something else or go apple and ask them
to support donated Lee
yeah so this is a bit of configuration
you already know it's it's a lot harder
than x11 I mean you don't have to
remember any of this you can just google
for it but you have to do a quite a lot
of work to get like VNC and xfce to get
a graphical user interface and it's it's
already adding up a bit of work but but
to start it it's more or less the same
we just start the application and we
assign some ports here I also assign a
port to be able to connect to the
GlassFish application server and yeah
that that's basically it and again to
show you that I didn't make this up
actually i think is running here already
so you see the resolution is not it's
configured within one of the files so i
put it a bit low dust just to be sure
that it would fit on the on the Beamer
screen
and so again I didn't persist and if
everything so if you did it a bit more
properly than probably it would go
faster than this there's a bit of lag
because of that I just deployed the same
app over and over again I still don't
care about a password I think we're good
to go so now the application is running
inside my virtual box and I connect with
VNC on my host machines on my Windows
machine to the VNC daughter instance in
my virtual box and I should be good to
go again and to show you that it's the
VNC instance you know if you can read it
but at the bottom as the text I I just
randomly died
for xrdp it works sort of the same
because we still need like a supervisor
and we need to have some configuration
for xrdp I decided today I just use
another linux version because I mean the
previous one was made on some standard
Java mhm I thought up let's try another
one just to show you it's not tied to a
boon to tudie BN to fedora or whatever
you can just use your own operating
system and and start playing with this
so again I have to copy some
configuration files and saw some
supervisors stuff some xrdp stuff a
really secret password of course I have
to allow all the users to connect xrdp
and saw some Java because it wasn't by
default in the Fedora image to the
general part so install NetBeans of
course and again expose report and then
it's just a supervisor that is making
sure that xrdp keeps on running but then
we already have even more configuration
for xrdp and then we started again so
looks kind of similar it's just some
minor configuration so if you start
playing around with it i mean really
google for it and look in the public
doctor registry you can find lots of
examples there so you don't have to find
out by yourself how it's working that's
the name so sorry I will go back and
sorry I didn't mention that so we built
the docker file so then an image is
created and that's at the top so we gave
it like a name and the name is NetBeans
xrdp and then we have an image and if we
want to start it image we have to say
dr. run and provide the name of the
image and then a container is created so
it's a way to link them together
yeah you ought to start netbeans inside
your container it's a running instance
of the image not being suspected to the
mhm yeah yeah I'll to start part I would
I go back a few all right one more so
here the last line of the darker file
says this command and this is the
command to start NetBeans so that's the
way the NetBeans automatically started
when you create a container
yeah so the question is we use
certificates for like connecting to get
how do you do it do you just generate
everything inside the docker container
or we use certificate that is placed on
the host I think both are quite good
options we generate most of them we just
ask a few input parameters from the user
of the docker file also for instance
which resolution he wants to have
because our monitors have different
resolutions sorry so we asked some input
and based on that we make a specific
docker container for that user yeah yeah
our doctor files are a lot bigger than
what you see here we do quite a lot of
stuff there so you you're talking about
multiple docker files that are stacked
on top of each other doing all kinds of
stuff there so depends on what you want
if you want to integrate a lot of stuff
when you're in a bit of a secure
environment then you have to do quite
some steps to make it work here but
otherwise mean you would have to do the
same trouble if you would set it up
locally on your machine because then you
also have to do everything with
certificates let's see I think I was at
the eggs already peed demo more or less
so this is just xrdp this is what we use
in our environment it's worked really
nice integrates with and not only with
Linux but also with windows so it's it's
really convenient to use it and just
works more or less the same way as the
VNC option
the big advantage of using VNC or rdp
instead of X 11 that you have like the
complete graphical interface of Linux at
your disposal and so you can easily do
like file browsing or stuff like that
and if you use x11 that's a bit harder
to do so that's a reason why we prefer
this so again I can just start your
application
any questions on between because you
have to wait
yeah I I saw my own at the end so where
these files are located in and if you
just google for it or go to the public
registry and search for VNC or xrdp or
x11 you can see quite some examples
there so now this one is running and
again this is running inside my virtual
box and I connect to it from my windows
house and I have to find my virtual box
again
so this one is also working of course we
see that text down below so now we have
more or less I seeing the three
different options and I wanted to give
you some like tips think about if you
want to start using this one thing we
noticed is that with virtualization that
sometimes performs a bit less so if you
start try and get a native linux machine
where you can house the stove on don't
do it inside the virtual box like I do
on my Windows machine because that gives
a bit of overhead and performance is a
bit less so it's better to get a lot in
native linux host and that's what we
have with our projects as well one and
that works quite well also doing a bit
of cleanup can be quite well because
else if you like you download netbeans
and everything and maybe even java
inside your docker container because you
specify that in the docker file but all
those files remain in the docker file so
for instance the NetBeans I believe it
was a zip file you can just remove it at
the end of your door / file to clean it
up then your container is not so big so
if you just put everything in like a
temp folder and at the end of your
doctor file you just remove the content
of the temp for it can save you quite a
lot of disk space another thing to
consider is that I'm not really nicely
using docker here because dr. is mainly
for separation of concerns and what I'm
doing now is just putting everything in
one big container so that's not really
how you should do it and it should be
better if you do like your IDE in one
container application server in another
container and and maybe even separate
other things out and although that
sounds like ideal it's a lot more
maintenance it's like garbage collection
I mean if you have this amount of
garbage it takes a while to to clean it
up so we prefer to put it in one big
container which maybe isn't ideal but it
saves us a lot of trouble getting all
the
connections between the containers
working and everything like that but I
yes so the question is do we experiment
with dr. Campos no not yet we started
with this quite a while ago and then
there were lots of frameworks popping up
everywhere where you could do all kinds
of cool doctor things would but we
decided to keep it as minimal as
possible for the time being because we
didn't know which directions those
frameworks would end up doing maybe
become obsolete within half a year so we
didn't do that yet but that would be a
nice step to consider yeah another thing
I mean I showed just one simple docker
file which creates one image and then
one container but it would be nice if we
just use multiple docker files for
instance you have one docker file where
you installed java in and every team has
to use that and then you you create an
image from that and every team can use
that same image on top of that you
create multiple docker files one for
netbeans one for eclipse and one for
IntelliJ and you base them on the doctor
file you created with Java that way you
can share a common base and make it easy
to upgrade parts of your system and one
thing if you're toying with this disk
space can get an issue if you download a
lot of stuff and especially if you
change like witch doctor immature
depending on if that's a large image
then that gets downloaded and you will
end up with some disk space so then it
can be good to remove your containers
and images and start all over again so
you you will notice that if you start
playing around with it a lot if you keep
using like the same images and they can
do a lot of caching and then the disk
space is ok but if you change a lot
inside of it then this space will become
an issue but it's cheap anyway so who
cares security I mean I've shown you
these kinds of stuff but it's if you
want to do it really secure especially
with x11 you have to dive in a bit
deeper for us the machines are like
more or less public machines that can be
accessed by anyone so security is not
really an issue there but I can imagine
that some people have stricter security
regulations on that part so it all
depends about how do you want to connect
to those machines do you run it on your
own machine do you run it on a shared
machine if it's your own and it doesn't
really matter what you do with it
probably as long as it's not connected
to the outside world if it's shared then
you have to consider things like
security or resource restrictions and
things like that so summary for us it
was they are quite easy to use of course
I mean it takes a while to set up
everything but if you do if you let
every developer set up his own machine
it takes a lot of time as well so of
course it caused some time but our idea
is still that it will save us time in
the in the long run and make our set up
a lot more flexible and a lot more easy
to upgrade and make sure that everybody
is running the same software with the
same version and don't have issues with
that and if you like it mean just start
playing with it it's really easy to set
up you can run it in a cloud as well or
on your raspberry although I didn't try
to run and netbeans ide on a Raspberry
Pi but it should work so down below if
you want to download because this is
more or less it be aware I mean this is
not the bulletproof military tested
enterprise great or something like that
but it will give you a good idea to get
started what the different options are
and start playing around and next to
death are like i sat in the doctor
registry lots of examples available if
you want to have more information about
that are there questions remaining
yeah the doctor files are in that repo
yeah yeah so the doctor files the run
commands everything you've seen during
this presentation more or less except
for the slide is in that repo and if you
miss anything let me know my twitter
account is down below or just mail me
and I happily provide you with more
information any other questions yeah I
will make them available and tweet about
it or something like that so other
questions and thank you all for showing
up and have a good last day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
