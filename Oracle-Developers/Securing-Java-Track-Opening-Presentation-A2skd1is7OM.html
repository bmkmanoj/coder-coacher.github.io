leads on the for the security program
here on Java so while we're waiting for
everybody to come in here has anybody
been to Las Vegas yeah yeah has anybody
seen blue man group in Las Vegas yeah
okay has anybody seen what happens when
you walk in late I hear a few laps yeah
anyway my wife and I were going to blue
man and she was really stepping it out
because we were we were late and it's
anyway we got there on time sat down and
was kind of funny this a couple husband
and wife and a couple of kids sat down
and the all the lights in the theater
turned on to this couple that was being
seated and the blue men that were up on
the stage jumped down from the stage and
ran over and you tried to get them
seated and meanwhile everybody in the
audience was focused on where the house
lights were and that was directly on
this family being seated I don't think
they'll ever be late for something in
Las Vegas again but we're not going to
do that to you at javaone so I've kind
of taken some photos here and used for
my presentation right here is my
sister-in-law's cat kitty mouth in a
defensive position behind the couch I
just thought it looked cool since I'm a
security guy
okay so I've got some information here
on my background really included for
when this thing is recorded but I know
my information is in flyers and stuff so
I'm not going to really cover that
except to say that I'm a leader for the
security program on Java so we're going
to cover a bunch of different things
talk a little bit about the security
track and and how we do things on the
security track and then segue into a
little bit about security remediation
and what we're doing on the platform and
then we're going to start covering a
little bit of a history on security
changes that we've made and improvements
in the Java platform some of those
starting and Java 7 which you might not
be aware of and then leading up into
features that we've delivered for Java 8
then after that we will look into who
kind of cover some of the session
highlights that you'll see in the
security track throughout the week so I
think this is kind of an interesting
session and that so first let me just
start off to say that anybody who is
presenting here at javaone is is you
know very high quality session but we're
going to cover the best of the best here
and then we'll finally we'll provide
some closing thoughts so this thought
this a shot here I thought was kind of
cool because the angle that I captured
here you know you see the no swimming
sign and the fact you see people
swimming so I think there's something
humorous there and it really depends on
your perspective if I took this shot
from a slightly different angle and you
just saw people swimming in the water it
might not be very interesting and I
think that's kind of like security
there's different perspectives and
everybody has a little bit different
perspective and the more that you know
or understand about security the better
your perspective is and so why did we
decide to include a security track at
javaone we've had security content as
part of Java one for a long time
but there's a very strong interest in
security interest in terms of of course
what we're doing here at a worker but
also people that attend javaone want to
know what they can do to be secure and
what are the new security technologies
and how do they use them so improving
understanding of the different API s and
resources that are available as well as
the threat landscape you know what are
the bad guys hitting on defensive
measures for those and then new platform
security features like I mentioned
before the other thing is that prior to
the security track content was very I
guess scattered across different tracks
a lot of content was considered part of
core technologies which it still is
today like security api's but the
security track gives us a nice place to
corral this content this right here is
the second track that we've had I was
asked to lead it the first time and
asked to lead the second which is great
one of the things here as the leader is
that you get to choose the committee
that will be helping you to review
papers and the presentations that are
here another thing about the security
track is it's very defensive in nature
so there's a lot of offensive
conferences like will say black hat or
DEFCON where they tear things up and
break things whereas here most everybody
in the room is really interested in how
we build our systems and how we defend
our information we've got a lot of
different interests captured here we've
got government financial sector
technology hardware device makers so
this right here is the little bit of
transparency for the track they'll just
kind of share who the different members
of the committee word that helped to
make the decisions about what to bring
to you for this week so we had Frank Kim
from sans institute David from Carnegie
Mellon who's sitting in the audience
over there
thanks for showing up robert c court
another one of the CMU leaders Sean
Mullan from our vulnerabilities team
very sharp guy Eric cost low one of my
fellow comrades and security and myself
course so now we'll so we talked a
little bit about the track and what
we'll do now is just kind of segue into
remediation and what we've been
improving in the Java platform we don't
really for obvious reasons share any
vulnerabilities that would place anybody
at risk that uses Java but to add a
little bit of transparency what we do
show is what we've done in the past
perhaps show a little bit of our tempo
and also where we've made some
improvements so before we show that
information one of the things that I'd
like to share is a little bit about
Oracle nomenclature so you might think
that a CPU is a little chip that's
inside your computer that's the brains
of the system but at Oracle CPU is a
critical patch update it's our security
fix and the idea of the CPU is that we
it's our goal to only deliver the
security patching and that way we keep
the operational risks at a minimum we
have had to kind of take some liberties
there to get fixes out quickly but
that's that's our goal security alerts
are more the hot sort of fix for
security so if we have to if there's a
breaking vulnerability that we need to
address fast we can't wait until the
regularly scheduled CPU then we create a
security alert or hotfix to address that
concern immediately and we've done that
and then the other thing I'd say is that
so I show some release swags in here
because some people are more familiar
with seeing things in terms of dates
others perhaps in terms of release
I've included some markers here for you
to look at the engineers have asked me
to say that this does not include CBS s0
vulnerabilities which are more the I
guess ones that you have to combine with
other vulnerabilities to actually
perform an attack so as you can see from
the from the left hand side in seven you
five you know we were fixing about 14
vulnerabilities per CPU and then play
that forward to around februari ish of
2013 we were fixing about 55
vulnerabilities in the platform and then
it dipped down and back up and and of
course it's it's come down since then
but this kind of gives you a good idea
of the numbers that were addressed in
the platform so this right here is a
little bit different this shows the
remediated vulnerabilities by component
subtype and one thing I'd like to say
about this information that you're
looking at here this is all publicly
available information so if you go out
to Oracle's you do a search on oracle
cpu you'll see a lot of different
information about Oracle security fixes
for different products Java is out there
and you can take this information just
like I've done and pop it into an Excel
spreadsheet and and kind of you know get
formed some interesting a picture of not
so much what's out there now but what
has been done so starting off on the
left hand side you can see we have some
high numbers here in deployment and in
fact that is one of the areas where we
had over the last two years a lot of
concern deployment would be like Java
applets and wed start and so i think the
press kind of captures java
vulnerabilities and just kind of throws
the word java out there but in fact most
of them have been
focused on deployment and then of course
2d and javafx but then going you know
more towards the right you can see that
these mean a lot of these packages that
have been here for a long time the you
know the number of vulnerabilities drops
off precipitously and then okay this
machine here does anybody know what this
is this is not a alpha typewriter enigma
perfect so this right here is a German
encryption machine used during World War
two I was at the RSA conference earlier
in the year and the fellow from NSA
History Museum brought that in so I
thought it was kind of cool okay so
we'll chat about here real briefly as
we'll just kind of we're going to kind
of speed through some of these different
Java 7 features and the reason we're
talking about these features is because
i'm not sure that everybody knows what's
been rolled into java 8 and then we'll
talk more about java hate features ok so
starting off here in about seven you ten
time frame we added support to there was
some concern about being able to disable
applets you know when there's a
vulnerability and Oracle hasn't got to
fix out fast enough hey we just want to
turn it off how do we do that one of the
things that we noticed is the one of the
great benefits about Java and being
multi-platform it was very hard to talk
somebody through how to shut it off on
each different platform so we just added
a simple on/off switch to turn it off in
seven you 10 hard coded best before date
is really about so since we have
regularly scheduled on cpu or security
patches that are published a year in
advance we know that
as a the time for a patch has elapsed if
you haven't applied the new one we know
that you're probably operating unsafely
being that you're unpatched so there's
some changes that we can make care to
the behavior the java platform or not
not so much in terms of shutting it off
but perhaps maybe communicating certain
actions that somebody would do with an
elevated level of risk so the java
security slider was another feature that
we added we wanted to allow sites to
have some capability to adjust the the
security features of java to be more in
conformance with their enterprise
policies and that's what adding the
slider was all about the balance of
security with risk with maybe ease of
use then the other thing that we noticed
since security is a journey or that's
the saying that goes one of the things
that we learned is by adding the slider
everybody would just go ahead and
throttle it down to low or custom and
turn off security and of course that's
everybody's prerogative to do so but I
guess one of the things as a software
you know developer is that you know if
somebody changes the security or turns
it off and then they get pwned well then
they call us too so we have to have a
certain balance or minimum so in this
case we actually took away these options
and we added new options which we'll
discuss a little bit later the other
thing that we did is it used to be in
Java that signing established
permissions for the application but
that's not really industry standard
practices so privileged assignments
really need to be separate from identity
and that's what code signing is all
about so what we did was to separate the
two and so we added signing for
sandboxed applications
so now I will say a Java applet can be
signed but whether or not it has
privileges to the operating system is a
completely separate setting in addition
to code signing and making code signing
stronger we also had to standardize our
revocation services and enable them by
default so prior to seven you 25
revocation services were turned off but
somebody could could turn them on but
it's much more safer to run with a
default where they're enabled on
millions of laptops and desktops but
people can turn them off if they want
but in order to get to that point we had
some issues with interoperability with
different cas that our partners that
have certificates in our trust or so we
had to do some testing with them which
we still have to do today as we maintain
that certificate store but we had to
make sure all that was working properly
for both crl and ocsp which are a couple
of popular protocols for revocation the
other thing that we had to do is there
was some concerns about repurposing jars
for you know downloading a jar and
repurposing it for other applications
and so to deter that practice we added
some support for jar locking to lock
jars to a specific server then in 7u40 I
think we added one of the most powerful
features and that's the deployment rule
set so one of the things that we noticed
is that there were a couple main vectors
of exploitation for desktops and laptops
and that was spear phishing attacks you
know where you get an email it looks
like it's coming from your friend when
fact it's coming from somebody you don't
know and has a little bit of extra
functionality that you might not be
aware of and so now we're payloads were
being delivered as part of spear
phishing emails also with the way ads
work and browsers sometimes as we're
being delivered by third parties or
parties of other parties and so the
advertisements were becoming a vector
for malware as well so we developed a
new feature called deployment ruleset
which addresses that concern by allowing
enterprises to whitelist their corporate
assets or the assets of their partners
so using this tool you could set up you
know that you'll allow applets to be
loaded from company com but nobody else
or maybe company a calm and company be
calm which is your partner and then
nobody else so it really helped a lot
and we have another feature that we
delivered later which I'll make note of
but it's more for the consumer this
right here is an enterprise feature it's
delivered via XML in a jar and push down
to desktops the other feature that we
added was just when a JRE is out of date
to pop up a warning and let people know
and of course at the time that we
created this warning it generated a lot
of concern by enterprises because those
users then called their support staff
and said hey why am I insecure and I
think you know so we're kind of rolling
through these features pretty quickly
and they all kind of make sense when
they're strung together the thing is
from an engineering perspective you
can't always deliver all the features at
the same time that you know that would
be the best from a user perspective
right sometimes you just have to turn on
the stop light and make it blink before
you can actually coordinate them right
and that's really kind of what was
happening here
we had to warn people quickly and then
we eventually when we had other features
available we allowed enterprises to go
ahead and turn this off or customize it
the other thing that we had to do is we
added support for improving support for
the Java uninstaller so that we could
clean up do a little bit better job
cleaning up after ourselves because one
of the areas that we that's continually
concern is old versions the Java that
are installed so when we patch Java you
know we address security concerns in the
latest versions of Java and we hope
everybody applies those security fixes
but in fact many don't so so we have to
address security concerns going along
that line but then we also have to look
at how do we clean up that old stuff
where people aren't may be paying
attention or tracking it as closely as
we are so cleaning up the installer is
as one area and then I'll share another
area as we get later in the presentation
the other thing that we did is pushing
forward in our security journey for
applets is we established code signing
as a default for Java so so if you want
to use applets you got to have signed
code and that's really what that's all
about
and then exception site list is really
the consumer I had mentioned earlier the
deployment rule set which is the
enterprise whitelisting feature except
in exceptional 'used is more the
consumer based feature so if you're you
know just a single workstation or maybe
you know you've got a computer at the
house that has java on it you'll have a
screen depending on your operating
system that looks more or less like this
this one was taken from OSX but you can
see kind of the exception site list and
where it fits in there but that's for
the consumer to protect themselves or
maybe you know you could whitelist Pogo
or something and and not accept them
applets running from elsewhere so they
can do the same thing ok so now we've
talked about security features that
we've been delivering against for last
couple of years a year and a half or so
now we're going to talk about some of
the JDK 8 security features so so JDK 8
of course includes all the 7 features
plus these other ones here so one of the
things that we did for Java 8 is
established TLS 1.2 as the as the
default and by doing that of course it
makes security much more stronger TLS
1.2 as a newer protocol and this again
is for transport encryption so like when
your browser does HTTPS to another site
this is kind of what we're talking about
is the underlying transport security
mechanism the other thing is we added
some support for enhanced revocation
checking you know there's there's a lot
of things that can happen when you're
doing a revocation check when you're
connecting to revocation services on you
know it could be that there's some
intermittent network connection where
the site is always operational but for
some reason your connection to the
revocation server didn't make it
it doesn't necessarily mean that that
certificate is bad but what should we do
in that case do you as a developer want
to try another connection and see what
happens or you know how should we handle
that failure and so this is some kind of
where some of this revocation checking
enhancement comes about another feature
that that we added for Java 8 is a new
static analysis tool called jdubs and
it's really for for checking for class
dependencies say your hina you've got
some open source packages that you're
including jaidev's can help ferret out
some of those and the significance of
that from a security perspective is that
if you're including open source that has
not been assessed maybe you're including
a certain version log4j but you only
checked an earlier version or did a
review on that and then you find out
Engineering's included a later version
well now you've got a you know you you
have some code that's now in your
product that may not be assessed from a
security perspective so it's kind of an
interesting tool for it from that
perspective type annotations once again
not necessarily a security technology
but it does offer some I guess security
bonus in that type annotations can be
used to do tane analysis on strings so
Washington University has been
experimenting with this and has some
annotations to actually check for
different sort of string painting worth
checking out
another feature that we added was an
addition for TLS and that's the server
name indication extension which is for
really helps to bring us more into the
cloud world where several servers might
be served off of a single IP and this
will communicate that information so
that way the server infrastructure
understands what the original domain was
that was asked for requested so that the
proper handoff can happen and then we've
got a whole battery of technical
improvements that I'm not going to
really dig into but I did mention or
place here and in my as we get into
reviewing the sessions for the week I'll
communicate where that extra technology
where you can find that information the
details okay this is my dog Oreo now I
debated about when I put this in here I
thought maybe they'll think the Java
team is lazy or you know away everybody
thinks a little something different this
is true love right here this dog is
napping in the captain's chair and she
only does it when I'm not there so that
means she's probably in that chair right
now okay so we're okay so now we're kind
of looking at some of the sessions that
we have coming up in the week here we've
got applying java cryptography by Eric
costlow who's on the Java platform team
with me and security colleague i'll be
going over some of the cryptography
features we've got Simon bennetts from
mozilla foundation who's also part of
the OWASP group which is a group of
security practitioners he's going to be
talking about owasp zap which is really
cool basically a security proxy tool but
it can be used for any kind of proxying
you want to do
it's I guess it's based on what's that
package perros proxy loosely based on
Paris proxy they kind of downplayed the
percentage of Parros code that came as
came over as part as app I'm not really
sure why they do that because I love
peros as well but anyway so Simon's
going to be talking about that I think
it'd be a great discussion something for
everybody to listen to especially if you
need to use proxies on the job to change
HTTP headers or just examine what's
going through five keys for securing
Java Web Apps Frank Kim is going to take
us through that Frank cameras instructor
on app security from sands to institute
sands is probably one of the most highly
respected application security training
centers around a lot of the government
agencies go there so for their training
so if you are lucky enough to go to
sands you'll see some squirrely sort of
people walking around not talking to
anybody that are dressed smartly ok now
I want to really highlight this session
here so this is leverage leveraging open
source for secure java web construction
Jim Monaco who is a secure coding
instructor romantico security this book
here I wanted to highlight because it
has some special meaning to me I helped
out on this book as well it was just
released this month and is I'm told as
in the Oracle bookstore at the event
wink wink if anybody wants to get this
book signed my partner he's laughing
yeah keep going anyway we just had a
fantastic time doing this book you know
we we really kind of battled battled out
what was to go in there
everything from just logging and tearing
up chapters and rewriting chapters
anyway we had a fantastic time doing
this book and and for those that buy it
we hope that you enjoy it and for
anybody that does and would like to have
the book signed Jim and august are here
and myself included that's all I'll say
continuing on platform and web app
security we've got code level security
games and puzzles this is one that kind
of caught my eye and that looked pretty
interesting i'm always looking for
something kind of fun and a little bit
edgy for the conference maybe that we
wouldn't quite look at elsewhere and
others on the on the review team thought
so too so i think this is one I wanted
to highlight anatomy of another job a
zero-day exploit this is David will be
providing this session from CMU and last
year David did a very similar
presentation really kind of thoughtfully
pulling apart a real exploit to show
engineers what what is the code for a
real exploit look like and I thought he
did a really great job so I specifically
reached out to see if he could help us
out again QA with the with a security
group so I wanted to highlight this this
is the Oracle security group on Java
this is the technical staff that
researches vulnerabilities that we
receive as well as works on features and
Francis ho who is here now but she is
going to be at this talk and also as she
leads the team also Sean Mullan who's on
the committee for the security committee
for the conference here that does the
white paper review he's going to be on
speaking on there and also Brad Brad
wetmore who is soft-spoken but one of
our brightest leaders here so
these three people are going to be going
to be speaking there it's a great
opportunity if you have specific
questions about the technical aspects of
Java security api's to sit in there and
have access to them okay so continuing
on I got to speed it up here java secure
coding guidelines this one caught my eye
this is being delivered by Andrew gross
who is also on Francis's vulnerability
team Andrews really special because he's
the guy that gets the vulnerabilities
first on the team and he does the triage
on all the different things that we see
works very closely with researchers on
so if he's doing a talk on Java secure
coding then it catches my eye java
native interfaces this is mark
Schoenfeld who is another member of
Francis's team the security
vulnerabilities team and is going to be
talking how to how to secure your ear
apps from jni and then inside the cert
secure coding standard for java so
Oracle has Oracle and Java has secure
coding guidelines for the Java platform
the cert guys really have picked up from
that and kind of transitioned to a very
detailed standard on different areas of
Java technology anyway they're going to
be sharing their coding standards and I
did want to highlight their book too I
don't actually know that that's at the
bookstore but it's available on Amazon
it's it's still it's not new but it's
still relevant
it is at the bookstore okay thanks I was
going to also cover security Internet of
Things everybody's coming from a
different perspective a lot of folks are
interested in Internet of Things or IOT
so we have some discussions that are
that are happening some sessions around
IOT and Oracle's efforts on Wednesday
I'm providing a session basically
introductory on security and threats
around IOT and I'm going to also bring
in not that a super IOT related but I'm
a software guy and I like to I like to
get on my Hardware mojo so I built a a
dsb aircraft transponder receiver using
raspberry pi and software-defined radio
and some other stuff and kind of put it
together it's nothing that's like you
know I'm not saying we're unleashing it
here for the first time because I did
see a presentation that was done three
years ago on at Def Con in the same sort
of area I just think it's cool and I
noticed a lot of other people kind of
like that when I blogged about it so I'm
bringing it in hopefully we can detect
aircraft inside the hilton here but if
we can't we'll just merely walk outside
after Internet of Things security
architecture so both of these next two
sessions here are being delivered by no
poor who is the lead architect for
security on the Oracles IOT efforts and
really kind of the mastermind putting
everything together so I specifically
wanted to kind of call call him out and
I think if anybody was interested in the
specifics around the protocols that
we're using in the real details of
device provisioning all that sort of
stuff those would probably be
interesting sessions to attend all right
here is my dog again okay so one of the
things that I wanted to just kind of
cover is as we as we close out here it's
just some
common security myths or misnomers and
just to kind of give you something to
think about so a lot of people think
that being slow to or to being slow to
upgrade or patch is is best for
production and I think the reality there
is that there are some operational
benefits of not being an early adopter
obviously the other part of that though
the equation that most people don't
consider is that specifically with Java
because Java is open source and that we
published the source when we publish
those security fixes all the bad guys
know what we fixed so it's you know it's
a roadmap for exploitation and that's
why we encourage everybody to patch as
soon as possible so keeping up to date
on java cpus and upgrading older
versions of Java is a good thing the
other thing would be another misnomer
hackers need my code to break into a web
application that is patently not true in
fact you know your code might actually
confuse hackers I know mine would so I
think that the deal here is integrate
testing and development process address
vulnerabilities earlier instead of later
ok now another point here another
misnomer is attackers or hackers are
uniquely gifted individuals I think
media likes to play this up I think
whenever a company gets hot they like to
play that up but the reality is is
hackers are really the same as engineers
yes you've got some gifted ones you know
just like you've got gifted engineers I
mean you we've all seen coat that really
gifted engineers can push out and that's
the same as hackers I think that hackers
are overly esteemed because it's a way
of shifting vulnerability or shifting
responsibility and so I think what we
need to do is we need to always be
vigilant
and we need to be performing independent
assessments of our code getting outside
opinions and not focusing so much on the
attacker but focusing more on what we
can do at whatever level we're at
another one that I see another misnomer
is that we've never had a security
incident so we're secure I think that's
another one that's patently false just
because you have not had a security
incident is not the same thing as
knowing that you're secure okay so
knowing you're secure implies that
you've done some sort of work or
assessments on what you have to be able
to have a basis for that foundation so
the action item here is word to
understand your landscape your threat
landscape you don't necessarily need to
fix every vulnerability but you need to
fix the ones that matter okay so moving
on security and compliance are not the
same thing you know if you don't do
compliance you get finder you go to jail
security you know you've got some more
leeway there but having good compliance
is not the same thing as good security
either so you know work on establishing
strong security programs across many
different disciplines security
operations security compliance network
security security architecture
throughout the entire lifecycle and
again catching things earlier allows
more influence to fix stepping in front
of the freight train later on as
software is being deployed is very
challenging to do so okay the last one
security is impossible this is not true
you know saying security is impossible
is like a doctor shooting the patient
because the patient is sick you do your
best you know whatever it is do your
best dedicate whatever you can
and it does make a difference and so
that would be an encouraging word I
would like to leave with you so another
thing I'd like to announce here is
getting back to what we were saying
about uninstallers and cleaning up after
old versions of Java we've also been
working with Microsoft to clean up old
versions of Java on the Microsoft
platforms and so we've been helping them
with a feature that they have called
updated updating outdated activex
controls and we've shared with them how
you can check to see what the most
recent security patches of Java and so
based on some of these checks it changes
the behavior of the Microsoft platform
and ie to prompt people when Java is out
of date and you can read about more of
that in the length that I'm included
there I think the impact there is that
we all know how big the Microsoft
platform is and how many desktops it
touches so I think even though it's not
a direct change we make to the to the
Java platform anything that we can do to
help make people safe that's what I'm
going to do and I don't think that while
we compete on many different levels I
don't think that we want to compete on
security platform support I'm not going
to spend too much time on that but I get
asked about support all the time so
there's a lot of different support
options if you're still using java 6
they're still work going on in java 6
and in fact we patch it so you need to
be looking into these support programs
for your data center I think it'd be a
positive thing that's what I would do I
included some of the upcoming CPUs as I
said we do publish CPUs or the security
patches you're an advanced so I've
included some of them in the slide deck
here so you can look at and then I have
a few few actions here that you can do
based on whether you're an end user or a
software developer to help keep your
community say
so keeping your JR ease up to date
defense-in-depth I mean use the Java
security features that we've talked
about for sure but also consider your
platform security features you know have
you hardened your windows or OS X
operating system do you have virus
scanners deployed you have firewalls all
these features are helpful and when you
stack them you make things more
difficult for attackers and maybe a
little bit more difficult than they want
so they'll move on somewhere else if
you're a developer you know take your
code and try to certify on the latest
versions of Java that we have so that
way it allows those that use your
product the ability to update quickly so
by letting them update quickly making it
easier for them certifying on latest
releases will reduce their level of
exposure and then of course signing
applications and time stamping and then
applying secure coding guidelines for
the java language i've included a couple
links here actually we've got a plethora
of security links but i wanted to focus
on the on the ones that matter the most
and that is the Java security Resource
Center which is really our landing page
for Java security so you can go to this
page and you can find all sorts of other
links depending on what your role is are
you a security practitioner well then we
think you'd be interested in this are
you a Java developer well you know you
might be interested in these things ap
is and then I've included the Java
platform p.m. blog which is usually
written to by Eric in the back there
thank you we talked about a lot of time
relevant issues whether we're talking
about applets and/or new security
features that we've come out with and
how you can apply them to your
enterprise those are the kind of timely
topics that we talked about on the
security blog
and then that's really all I have so I'm
going to go ahead and close out the
session and if anybody has any questions
I you can feel free to come up thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
