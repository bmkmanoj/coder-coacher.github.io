developer what I hope to do here today
is to teach you that if you're a java
web developer you can be more and to
show you some tips and tricks that I've
learned along my journey and and go from
there so to start I would like to tell
you a little bit about myself my name is
Matt Ravel
I'm a hick from the sticks I grew up in
the backwoods of Montana no electricity
no running water sixteen years and I had
to walk two miles to the bus stop every
day and yes it was uphill both ways
now like to find out about you a bit
more how many people have used struts
one about an 80% how many people have
used PHP put them in about same vein
that's like 60%
has anyone written CSS from scratch all
right what about JavaScript who hates
JavaScript haha like 50% someone shout
out a reason ext jsj quick just
frameworks not like come on where's
untyped where Java developers anyone
hard to debug okay what's your favorite
JavaScript framework he says slow any
xdj s right so this inspiration I got
from Ben Evans and Martin Berg's book
the well-grounded Java developer I read
this last year and what I felt was it
really showed as a Java developer all
the things that you should know from you
know how to read bytecode to how to
develop with Java 7 I'm how to do
polygon programming or polyglot
programming with like groovy and Scala
and then how to create a project so what
I thought was you know web developers in
the Java space often don't have the same
sort of manual that tells them here's
all the things you should know to be
successful and be productive and the
other thing I often see is that Java
developers that call themselves Java web
developers just program with web
frameworks and CSS and JavaScript a lot
of times they'll be like I hate that I
don't want to use it and what I found in
my career is that you have to embrace it
and learn it and then you'll actually
enjoy your job a lot more so the purpose
is some of the most valuable engineers
and we mean dollars by valuable these
days have front-end skills
javascript CSS as well as the backend
skills and so I'm trying to make you
more knowledgeable so you can make more
money
so hopefully that works out well so the
easiest way to go from being a Java web
developer to being modern is to simply
say that you're a JVM developer and that
brings a whole ecosystem of other
languages and frameworks that you can
use you could even use Ruby if you want
you can use Scala you can use GWT or
quit and that that makes you just opens
up a lot of horizons so what I believe
is the modern JVM web developer first of
all starts with fast hardware I think
this is vitally important a lot of
companies don't understand this
hopefully yours do and you use IntelliJ
how many people use eclipse how many
people prefer clips over IntelliJ five
and there was like a hundred that did
you leverage jQuery and not just jQuery
but JavaScript in general html5 and css3
the most important thing is creating
high-performance websites in my opinion
as far as what you would do on a day to
day basis I do a lot of consulting with
a lot of companies and you'd be amazed
at how much of an impact that can make
almost immediately when I started a new
contract at the beginning of this month
which is only a couple weeks ago we
basically had eight second load times on
pages within a week I got that down to
three and I didn't touch any Java code
all I did was configure a few things in
Apache and boom things are loading
faster so that's important to look at
you develop for mobile devices and you
deploy in the cloud or you leverage the
cloud if you need to and then you care
about security and this comes from my
experience with with my wife who I met
three years ago when I first met her I
was instantly attracted because she
switched from a martini to a Guinness
which you don't see many ladies do so
that was my first inclination the second
was when I was talking to her she
mentioned a wasp and that she sold
security softer and so I traveled to
some conferences with her and what I
noticed was a lot of the security people
of people that do security are often
what I like to call selling fear you
should you know be fearful you should
buy our firewalls you should you know do
penetration testing and all this kind of
stuff and what I found is there's a big
disconnect between the security industry
which is rapidly growing and developers
who write the code and so I think if if
we as developers can be more cognizant
of hey you know cross-site scripting
sequel injection you know try not to do
that then we won't get so much fear sold
to us and we can save some money there
so with fast Hardware I recommend a Dell
XPS developer edition or a macbook pro i
think you should get eight or 16 gigs of
ram i have sixteen in this one here and
an SSD so what I found is is if you
double your RAM or you go from four gigs
to eight gigs or sixteen
you'll probably get like a 2x
performance increase with an SSD
you get about a 10x and and I haven't
waited for stuff to happen on this
laptop in years so if you're waiting for
you know compilation obviously away from
maven a little bit but you can really
get away from a lot of that and make
things a lot faster the RAM is cheap you
know 100 bucks for 16 gigs now you can
get an SSD for about 500 bucks and you
should be making that in a day and if
you aren't then talk to me after
I recommend IntelliJ and the reason I
recommend IntelliJ over eclipse is
because of its CSS and JavaScript
support so if you're a web developer and
you're you're playing with those tools
or you're using HTML and you're writing
that during the day chances our Eclipse
doesn't have that kind of support for
JavaScript and CSS and and with IntelliJ
you get code completion you know all
that syntax highlighting and you know
one a jolt Award in 2013 for the coding
tools supports a whole bunch of
frameworks and like I said it even
supports like CoffeeScript
sass lasts all these you know new
frameworks that we have to write a
JavaScript and CSS and you can use git
right inside it works flawlessly and it
supports Zen coding which is now called
Emmet so see that line on the top you
can type all that hit tab and it writes
all that code for you so if you start
you know using that style then you can
write HTML very quickly I'm sure there's
a plugin for Eclipse that does something
similar I like the name Zen coding that
kind of sounds cool I don't know why
they renamed it to Emmet but if you're
looking for this concept it's called
Emmet now I think the modern JVM web
developer should be aware of what's in
Java 7 how many people are using Java 7
on a regular basis ok that's about 1/3
anyone using Java 8 one guy everyone
else is on Java 6 and went on Java 5 a
couple of you yeah that's what I've seen
is a lot of my clients are still in Java
6 and even though you know they're
trying to end-of-life it and they're
still using it so there's a lot of new
stuff in Java 7 and 8 strings and switch
statements diamond syntax so you don't
have to write your generics as much you
know on both sides of the equation try
with resources allowing you to close
things easily improved exception
handling and if you're doing in a file
manipulation there's a new path API and
asynchronous i/o it works really nicely
I'm with eight there's parallel
collections the lambdas that you've
heard a lot about this week the date and
time API and functional interfaces with
default methods and the JavaScript
engine
rhinos out national ones in it was
scheduled to be released two weeks ago
now it's early 2014 that's a nice and
big the modern JVM web developer is also
aware of spring data I think it's the
new gateway to hibernate hibernate has
been very popular for many years but
spring data kind of adds a no sequel
flavor to it so you should check that
out with servlet 3 there's a whole bunch
of annotations you can now use web
server Web Filter you can do
asynchronous processing and you can use
a web application initializer to get rid
of the web.xml
there's also rest and functional
programming so if you're still doing web
services or you're talking you know
between machines I still see a lot of
soap out there and I'm trying to
motivate clients to move to rest just
because it's faster and it's easier to
understand and then functional
programming with lambdas a lot more
people will get into that but let's talk
about the last two a bit more one of the
key things in functional programming
that's coming about and certainly hyped
by a typesafe and a few other companies
is reactive applications and so this is
you know the ability to actually develop
applications that are event-driven it's
a new architecture that basically is
scalable resilient and interactive and
so by publishing events and doing
asynchronous processing on the server
you're able to speed things up and use
less resources on the server and then at
the same time using like web sockets or
server-side events on the client to
basically create an open channel and get
away from this this blocking paradigm
that we've been using the key building
blocks are observable models that enable
other components to receive events when
state changes you know it's nice for
real-time communication between users
and systems there's also event streams
they form the basic abstraction now the
connection is built keeping them
reactive means avoiding blocking and
instead allowing asynchronous and non
blocking and then the rich web and
mobile clients creating the gauging user
experience so that's WebSockets
server-side events makes that easier and
then
you know you can push events to the
browsers scalable and resilient way one
of the possible candidates for a
framework to allow this type of
development is avatar this was announced
on Sunday from Oracle it's a new project
avatar java.net it's possible their
description is avatar provides a Java
Script services layer zeroed in on
supporting Rast WebSocket server side
events and a rich client-side framework
that assumes very minor JavaScript
knowledge come on okay another framework
that's gonna hide the JavaScript from
you so you don't have to write it what
I'm here to tell you is if you're gonna
be a web developer learn JavaScript like
it's not that hard if you use
intelligent you can actually debug your
JavaScript just like you do your Java
you can step through it I'm using Chrome
you can step through it as well so it's
it's one of those things I have a good
friend is an iOS developer and he's
always frustrated by the number of
people that don't do objective-c they
use PhoneGap they use html5 they use you
know Ruby's got something that you can
use to you know write your iOS apps and
he's like why don't people just learn
objective-c it's not that hard so he's
writing a book about how to do it and
and I was like well you know some people
just don't like it and he's like what's
there not alike I learned it you know
only took me a year and I was like how
about a CSS why don't you learn that you
think yeah so so pick your battles but
if you're going to be a web developer
learn JavaScript learn CSS but in the in
the sense of functional programming and
reactive applications one of the ways to
do that is to learn Scala so this is a
quote from Venkat scholars like the
dragon and avatar will try to kill you
but if you master you can fly great
distances with it have a wonderful time
so so I didn't have a computer science
background in college I got degrees in
Russian and international business and
finance and so I didn't really learn
recursion or a lot of the concepts in
computer science so I took this course
on Scala last year from Coursera and if
you have a similar background or you
just done web development without
computer science you should have fun
with that course it's it's a great eye
opener to a lot of computer science
concepts and functional programming so a
scala basics on you know it's pretty
simple def starts a method similar to
how it works in groovy variables are
started with bar eval they're defined
with name colon type instead of type
space name like we do in Java and
semicolons are not required so here's an
example on the bottom right there of how
you'd write a trait which is similar to
an interface in Java and yeah it works
pretty well
Scala versus Java here's a typical Java
POJO with a couple properties in it year
and miles for a car and let Scala that's
a one-liner so it's a it's very in
terrassa
and I recommend that you know you at
least take a look at it and you're aware
of it so if anyone ever asked you know
hey can we start doing functional
programming or a more reactive
programming you can certainly say yes
what about groovy not that kind of
groovy groovy the language it's still
cool and Grails is awesome it just
doesn't have the hype that that Scala
has and I think a lot of times it's you
know the difference in a successful
company like SpringSource which is now
pivotal which was VMware that goes
through several you know times of
getting bought and and doing well that
they don't really need to hype it that
much because they have so many users and
they have such a large ecosystem whereas
you see like typesafe and play they're
still startup they're trying to get
people to use it and so there's a little
more hype there but groovy is still hot
this is from earlier this year you can
see the absolute job trends groovy
peaked it looks like in January 2011 and
they kind of went down in 12 and Scala
certainly on the rise
most meeting it there and then I took
another screenshot this week and now you
can see that Scala actually passed
groovy in popularity for jobs but also
groovy is on the uptick again so both of
them are going up so you know that's one
way to diversify yourself is to learn
these languages and a lot of times the
beauty of groovy is all you need to do
is you know copy and paste your Java
code and remove all the semicolons and
it'll still work so it's not too hard to
learn at all and what I found is when
I'm writing web applications in groovy a
lot of times using Grails the the
JavaScript that I write is very similar
so the groovy and the JavaScript kind of
go hand in hand and even though they
aren't the same language it's a lot of
concepts are similar so to learn Scala I
recommend Scala for the impatient which
is about a 90 page PDF from K horsemen
there's also programming in Scala 2nd
edition which is a book about that thick
I made it through half way and it's been
a year and I've made it like that much
further so there's a lot of a you know
complex stuff in there but it's
certainly a great reference
I also recommend the programming
principles in Scala from Coursera like I
said I took this last year it did start
a couple weeks ago the latest course so
September 16th but you can still sign up
and you know catch up on the assignments
if you want to it's one of those things
though that you really need to to be
aware that you're probably gonna need
five to ten hours a week to work on it
the mistake that I made was I would
always do the homework the night before
it was due and you know spending seven
hours doing homework is not that much
fun
takes me back to college but really good
course I learned a lot and but of course
Java is still a viable growing language
with lambdas it's it's certainly on the
you know forefront of computing still
this is from a study done in 2002 in
February from red monk that shows that
the LinkedIn member count among all the
jvm languages Java's blowing everyone
away so even though you hear about Scala
you hear about groovy you hear about
closure there they're barely making a
dent in the
developers that are using it in a rural
world you know environment and it's
still the most popular this is from
February of this year java re' takes a
leading language popularity and this is
all great if you want to be a services
developer or an Android developer
because you can write rest services you
can use Grails you can use play you can
use jax-rs drop wizard there's a great
framework mine that I created it is app
fuse and you know it basically you can
still write really robust services on
the back end using Java
Jai thon well Python but we're talking
JVM here so if you want to be a Python
developer and not use the JVM then I I
don't know I think it can do well but
you know my experiences with JVM and as
a consultant I kind of stay in that area
just because there's a lot of clients
using it I recommend documenting your
API with enunciate um there's also
swagger if anyone's heard of swagger it
basically produces a JSON representation
of your API and then it can very easily
show that to other people but if you
want to remain a web developer you
should learn and use all the latest and
greatest browser technologies and then
fall back if you have to for ie7 or IE
how many people still have to support ie
seven it's about third of you ie 8 mmm
yeah
Firefox 3 that's just as bad isn't it
yeah if you don't like your job come
talk to me after
but I see it too I mean with consulting
you certainly have to use a support a
lot of browsers I like to refer to the
modern principles in web development
developing mobile first developing
single page applications and creating
use your own REST API and finally one
that Java developers seems to have a
hard time with is that sex sells and
what I mean by that is make it look good
and I think Java developers over the
period of the last 10 years have often
got you know dinged because we create
JSF or struts apps and our CSS doesn't
look that good or JavaScript doesn't
look that good people are starting using
bootstrap
so it looks better but they all look the
same and and if you look at the other
communities Python in particular or even
Ruby on Rails those guys every time they
develop a web app like it looks good and
so with with Java a lot of times I think
the back end developers are creating
front ends and with those other
communities there's a lot of time the
front-end developers are creating
backends so they kind of have that you
know knowledge of how to make things
look good and so we can do it to Java
developers you know it's possible I
recommend looking at browser tools if
you're going to be developing in the
browser there's great tools nowadays
there's Firebug for Firefox
there's also Chrome's developer tools
which they just have a plethora of
things in there where you can do
profiling you can do debugging you can
inspect and speed things up this is a
link to some slides from Google on how
to use those dev tools in more ways than
one and to really increase your
throughput there and leverage it there's
even I have a link if you're interested
how to do everything in chrome and never
leave chrome to do all the development
so this is where people are actually
saving files to the file system and
there's also a nice tool in IntelliJ now
called live edit that I've been using a
fair amount if you have a big monitor
you can basically turn on live editing
in the tell Jay have your browser over
here and whenever you modify a file it
refreshes automatically so you basically
never have to switch to your browser and
hit refresh you just sit there edit it
away and then see the changes happen
automatically
one of the first technologies you're
going to want to know is jQuery and
maybe you're not going to be using it on
your project as your web framework of
choice or your JavaScript framework but
chances are if you're maintaining an
application it's already there so it
doesn't hurt to learn it fast concise
JavaScript library simplifies how you
traverse HTML handle events perform
animations at Ajax
it's used by 68% of the top 10,000 sites
and even the top million it's 50% so
it's out there everyone's using it and
you can see it's the most popular
JavaScript distribution right about
Facebook and Twitter so people are
adding those to their pages as well and
jQuery is pretty easy to learn you know
you just grab it from code jQuery comm
you can even point to the files there
you want things to happen after the
document load use document ready if you
want add event handlers to you know
links or buttons you just use document
on click the selector and then the
function you want to use
there's jQuery UI for dialog sliders and
calendars a lot of people are using
bootstrap instead nowadays you can kind
of tell when something was written two
years ago because they have jQuery UI
everywhere case in point the Oracle Java
website you'll see the jQuery UI dialogs
and then Ajax is very easy using dot
Ajax and div load URLs you can load
remote sections of documents in your
page very easily sizzle is there
basically a CSS selector engine that's
let's put in there you can pull it out
of jQuery if you want and so now that
you know you've picked your JavaScript
library JavaScript itself there's a
bunch of good things in there the bad
parts are global variables you know new
lines convert it into semicolons type of
and all this 0 not a number empty string
false null and undefined are all false
so there's all these things that mean
false and if you can get away from that
then that makes it a little better how
do you spell lambda in JavaScript
function
it's just another method you can add
dynamic objects at a property of the
object remove it no need for classes
loose typing object literals and arrays
or just you know simple curly braces or
square brackets and some things you can
do to make a JavaScript better is you
can actually with Ekman script 5 just
put a new script or you strict and that
allows you to basically prevent a lot of
those things that normally happen in
JavaScript from not happening and most
of the browser's you know non ie
recognize that and there's more on that
link there and there's also you know
JSON partisans stringify that's native
to language you don't need you know
jQuery for that to convert to and from
JSON there's also a number of
programming patterns with JavaScript the
old-school way which a lot of people
still do and that's function function
function function call function write or
JavaScript colon call function when you
click on something
singleton module pattern revealing
module which is one that I like custom
objects are you creating a lot of
classes and lazy function definitions
and so the revealing module pattern is
basically it allows you to hide a lot of
the internals of a JavaScript program it
also prevents the name spacing problem
that a lot of people run into so it
allows you you know to basically have
similar to Java packages and classes
hiding stuff and so you have you know
public functions and you can see at the
bottom there where it returns it it's
saying that hey here's a function that
you can call outside and then it calls
those internally and you can name
spacing accordingly there's also a copy
script which allows you to write
JavaScript even easier less code to
write no semicolons and it basically
hides all the bad parts of JavaScript
and it's fun to play with there's also a
js2 coffee dot work I believe online
that you can go and play with it you
know rank your JavaScript and then see
what it looks like in CoffeeScript it
basically takes a good part to make some
mandatory and then if you're going to
compile the JavaScript from
Java though you might just want to look
into equip and and using that the future
I believe is a lot more similar to
angularjs how many people have tried
angularjs okay it's about 10-15 percent
it's a JavaScript mvw framework from
google MIT licensed
does a data binding in dependency
injection for you and really great
documentation and community so the
basics you can see here you put an NG
app on your HTML component or your div
or your body and then you load the
angularjs and basically what it does is
the real feature that people like is the
two-way binding so if you have any input
fields or you have JSON from the server
you basically put it into your page and
you say hey here's my model and then if
you manipulate that model anytime in
your JavaScript it automatically updates
the page and you don't have to keep
those in sync which you know you tend to
have to do a lot with jQuery I wrote an
application last year that was a PDF
viewer in pure jQuery and I think it was
around thousand lines of code I rewrote
it in angular and it was about 300 so a
lot of what I was doing was you know
trying to keep those two values in sync
between what was displayed on the page
and what you know we were sending back
to the server and angular just makes
that a lot easier but that's not the
only JavaScript MVC framework out there
there's a whole bunch of them right
there's ember there's backbone you can
cobble all these together and make your
own but one guy addy Osmani has done an
excellent job of showing you all of them
and then allowing you to see what's good
about one and what's good about another
so he's got a couple good articles
journey through the JavaScript MVC
jungle that you can see what's out there
and what you might want to use and then
the JavaScript design patterns book
where he talks about all those revealing
module and and similar patterns and you
know why you might want to use one and
he's created this to do MVC project
which allows you to see the same
implemented and basically ten or fifteen
different JavaScript MVC frameworks so
you can kind of compare and contrast but
if you don't like making decisions like
that you can just choose angularjs and
my experience with angularjs I worked on
a project for Oracle last year actually
this year when we created this dashboard
where it has all these widgets and you
can drag and drop them you can zoom in
you can do all kinds of stuff and it was
a very pleasant experience what we did
is we actually the back end was all Java
they had DWR in there we use that to
load the JSON when the page load so it
actually the JSON would be in the page
and we manipulate and then send it back
to the server using DWR I liked it so
much I did my next project with it I'm
using a Grails back-end and spring LDAP
spring security to do a portal for a
client and worked great as well and the
thing I like using JavaScript MVC
frameworks is because the backend really
doesn't matter and I've actually seen
the backend switched out more than the
front-end so we always you know you say
hey develop a restful back end and then
if you want to switch your web framework
you can and and I've actually seen the
backend switched out to to Python
instead of Java but the front-end stayed
like quit so so yeah that's good to have
that separation but you also probably
want to learn html5 hottest technology
today biggest buzzword if you go on
indeed job trends it's it's right there
how do you write html5 that's it
change the doctype at the top of your
document and boom html5 app there's also
a whole bunch of new tags article
section header footer nav audio canvas
and video are the biggest ones that
allow you to actually get away from
using flash for that there's also a
number of them that are removed applet
is gone so how's deaf
JavaFX gonna work out so it's all applet
still isn't it well sanders gone but
they aren't really gone because you know
the browser's still got a supportive
alright so they're gonna still make the
old sites work frame and frame set are
going I frame still in there and used by
a lot of them there's a great site
called dock Abajo that explains a lot of
html5 tags and you know references how
to use them and when they might or might
not work there's also this developer
Mozilla org what I've learned and you've
probably seen this w3 schools if you
search for anything html5 or JavaScript
it's terrible right I mean people really
don't like it it has a lot of bad advice
on there but it's always the top of your
search results so whenever you search on
something that's like CSS JavaScript or
html5 related attack on mdn so space mdn
and it'll take you to Mozilla
documentation instead and drop w3schools
down a few notches html5 forms and this
is something I love to do on new
projects because a lot of people haven't
used them and it's so simple to add and
then all of a sudden you get indicators
from your browsers that like fields are
required you can see that we have
placeholder up there at the top that
just you know puts a some text in the
box before you click on it auto focus
focuses that field when the page loads
required pops up a little dialog that
says hey this field is required and
won't let you submit a form until you
fill it in so those are very easy to add
if your browser doesn't support it they
don't do anything bad there's also input
types holding them input types thirteen
new ones email URL number range date
some
the browsers have calendars that pop up
when use a date field date/time month
week time search color
there's even color pickers that are out
there so it kind of depends on what your
browser supports with a lot of these
people will still use something like
jQuery or bootstrap to do those just
because then you get consistency in all
the browsers but using those types will
work as an input field in all browsers
so if it doesn't recognize it just the
false input type equals text so there's
no reason that you shouldn't use these
there's also a whole bunch html5 killer
features you can use local storage
instead of cookies and you know there's
good frameworks out that it allow you to
start with local storage and fallback to
cookies or even flash if you need to
there's video and audio and the funny
thing that I found out about video it
works for Time Warner Cable for a year
and and we wrote a video player in html5
to replace the flash player because no
one likes flash on their Macs in
particular because when you're watching
a video it spins the fan and your laptop
gets really hot kind of hurts your legs
a little and and you know it's all
Flash's fault and so we wrote this html5
video player and guess what it did same
thing so it's video it's not really you
know the mechanism of displaying it
there's also the ability to post message
and make between windows communication
work content editable you can add that
to any HTML tag and actually make
content editable and then geolocation
you know people are using that more and
more it's really nice on on cell phones
right when you have an app you can
detect where people are the killer
features I think our canvas the ability
to draw right that's that's what really
takes kind of Flash out of the picture
you can't really draw with with many
other api's and the the canvas API is
very low-level I'm waiting for some
framework to come out that just makes it
super easy and you know becomes really
popular but in the meantime David Gary's
written this book on html5 canvas it's
in color which is nice and it's just got
a ton of JavaScript in it on how to use
the canvas API how to basically draw
something off screen turning and doing
show it on screen and you know really do
a lot of gaming and cool stuff that way
also WebSockets and socket IO is a great
framework for that basically keeping a
channel open instead of doing a request
response really makes asynchronous and
reactive programming pretty easy and
socket IO basically has a bunch of
fallbacks so you'll use WebSockets if
you can and if you can't then it'll
start doing like comet and push and
things of that sort so there's no reason
you shouldn't start looking into that
and then with CSS there's a this site
links to a bunch of Secrets ten things
you might not know about CSS you can do
animated transitions of any object on
the page you can flip them rotate them
do all kinds of cool stuff rounded
corners and drop shadows that time
rounded corners man those are so cool
two years ago now it's now it's flat
again and we don't need it but the funny
thing about those three things around
corners drop shadows gradient colors
I've had quite a few clients that you
know we've leveraged those to get away
from using images to do that same sort
of stuff watch out on mobile devices
those are the three things that really
slow down mobile web apps is having you
know the rendering engine do all that
stuff but you know the gradient colors
do look good there's a whole bunch of
new cursors you can use there's also
styling based on sibling count so
there's an nth child that you can use
and you can do calculations in there and
say hey every third one do this or every
other one do this and you might have
seen the the angularjs app I had up
there earlier you couldn't see the gray
line so we had we had a grid of boxes
and all these you know gray lines on the
odd rows but we also allow people to
drag them around and and I'd use the nth
child a lot to actually you know make
sure and color those once they moved
them around and it worked really nicely
on css3 media queries allow you to
basically do responsive design
responsive design and css3 media queries
are pretty much the same thing one's
easier to say but it's also basically
saying that instead of you know making
your site you know mobile site and a
regular site make it work for you know
people's browsers and people's screen
size
so if they have a small one you know fit
everything on there make it bigger if
they have the big screen you know add
more so it's not just you know making it
small and making it look good it's also
when it's big making it look good and
css3 media queries work really nicely
for that you can see media only the top
ones there for smartphones the bottom
ones for iPads and you can really make
an impact quickly I'm doing that and you
know it's funny I've seen a couple
companies launch this week without css3
media queries and without viewport the
viewport tag is a number one thing you
need to know when you're doing mobile
development for the web
you had the viewport tag in there and
chances it looks good right away if you
don't like one of the sites I saw this
week like zoomed in right away and it
had like just the top corner of the site
and you know if they add that viewport
in there would zoom out appropriately
there's a bunch of cool html5 demos on
this page the links up there in the top
FFF dot c mi s DM com I could go there
and do them but they might spin up my
fan and then it would crash and then
wouldn't work but it basically shows you
that anything you could do in flash
before you can do with html5 and canvas
and JavaScript there's also bootstrap
one of the easiest ways to get started
with html5 and css3 it started with
html5 boilerplate a couple years ago and
you know this project just took off
there's a there's foundation by ZURB
there's compass which are similar
frameworks but Twitter bootstrap is the
most popular
you know project on github and what I
encourage you to do is not just download
and use it but find a theme so it
doesn't look like every bootstrap site
out there and you know wrap bootstrap is
a place where you can buy themes boot
swatches where you can download them for
free and and once you start leveraging
it's one of those things that I've seen
where a lot of times you can take your
java patterns and the things that you
learned about Java development from job
to job and it's rare that you can take
your HTML and how you structured that
from job to job but as I've started you
strap with more and more clients you
actually can because you're using the
same classes on the same elements you're
structuring your HTML the same way it
might look different you know you get a
good designer involved there to make it
look different between sites but a
you know allows you to reuse that
knowledge a lot and bootstrap is built
with less so less is a way of writing
CSS how you'd want to write it with you
know variables and mix-ins and
operations and functions and once you
learn it chances are you'll use it a lot
more
there's also sass syntactically awesome
style sheets that has a similar concept
and a lot of frameworks like play and
even WR for J is another tool you can
use will allow you to compile these on
the fly into regular CSS as I said one
of the biggest things that I've done for
clients is is make their websites faster
and this was pioneering research done by
Steve Souders published in December 2008
high-performance websites Yahoo has
turned this into their 14 rules make
fewer HTTP requests is one of the
biggest ones and I see this over and
over where people load you know 16
JavaScript files and in JavaScript when
you have a script tag in your page it
blocks as soon as it hits it and it
doesn't actually keep loading the page
until it process is that so taking that
down to 1 can help a whole bunch I'm
using a CDN adding expires headers
gzipping style sheets at the top scripts
at the bottom no CSS expressions only
people that use those are people that
are developer ie anyway JavaScript and
CSS take those out of your page reduce
your DNS lookups minify your javascript
remove duplicates make Ajax cashable and
my experience is his biggest problem is
HTTP requests so if you can take it from
30 down to 4 then obviously that's going
to speed a lot of things up I've also
seen the gzipping will give you a big
score gained and expires headers
everyone does this as a developer they
don't want expires headers right we we
want everything not cached because we
want to make sure we get the latest
version of JavaScript and CSS when we're
developing well that's great when you're
developing but what about your users
right they should download your files
once and never have to get them until
your next release and and that's really
easy to do and I've seen huge
performance gains just by doing that
another one you can do is image sprites
so instead of having you know 50 icons
that load is separate requests in your
page you combine it all into one
and then use CSS to position them within
your page I'm sprite Cal is great for
that so as soon as you have created your
sprite you can go to spray cow upload it
and then it'll give the CSS coordinates
for each your little images the one I've
been using more and more for
optimization of web resources WR for J
there's a few different ones out there
there's our is another one JW are
basically does that concatenation and
minification of your JavaScript and CSS
for you and it has two ways of doing it
one is the filter where it basically
does it at runtime the other way is
using a plug-in for maven or an ant task
that basically does it at Build time and
and you can even do asset fingerprinting
so your your files don't you know if
they change then you get a new name for
your CSS file if they don't then it
stays the same and yeah there's gzipping
there's you can do copy script
compilation you can do less and sass and
it really you know brings a lot of those
things to any java web application
there's also web jars and you all
rewrite filter tools that I like to use
web jars is client-side web libraries
packaged in jars there's support for
servlet 3-play to Grails drop Wizard
spring MVC tapestry and wicket and it's
basically you can load bootstrap you can
let jQuery just as like another
versioned resource just like if you
would you know a maven jar URL rewrite
filter if you want to do rewriting in
your app maybe have clean URLs or
something like that
it's really nice to also if use in
spring MVC one of the things I recently
discovered is this default servlet
handler you put that in your spring
config file and you can actually map all
your requests to the root level and then
it'll basically send everything to
spring MVC that a URL exists for and if
it doesn't it falls back to the normal
handling you know which Tomcat handles
some other techniques that I've written
about how to version your static assets
with the URL rewrite filter web resource
fingerprinting with wr4 J and how I made
app use a lot faster just using Apache
and you know getting the page speed up a
lot and before I talk about how
did that with Apache I want to mention
Engine X how many people are using nginx
so there's a few of you open source
high-performing HTTP server used by a
lot of you know high traffic sites from
Russia as you know learned Russian so I
admire those folks and you know this is
a how-to on how to get working on Lion
and and it's definitely you know a nice
server with Apache gzipping and expires
headers really easy to do you can use
mod PageSpeed if you want it's a module
from Google I have had some clients that
have issues with it but the whole idea
is it does all that minification
combining of assets for you as the page
loads puts all your JavaScript at the
bottom which you know may or may not
work for you put your CSS at the top and
basically rewrite your HTML for you I'm
going to try it on my latest project but
like I said I've have had people have
issues with that so a lot of times
you'll want to do that kind of stuff
within your application but with that
views we were able to take all the demos
and configuring mod deflate mod expires
and turn on keep alive our PageSpeed
score went from 24 to 96 I didn't touch
a line of code right within the actual
application itself
our yslow went from 90 to 98 and all we
did was you know configure mod deflates
just a configuration file and Apache
that says hey 4 you know text plain text
HTML CSS and JavaScript go ahead and
compress those and for you know various
older browsers don't do anything and
browsers have supported this since
Netscape 4 which is what 94 and so
gzipping has always been there and it
can reduce your load of pages by up to
70% also you know configuring expires
headers you usually want to do those for
at least a week the way you do that and
you know make sure your clients get the
the latest version is by you know
versioning your assets putting a version
number in the URL or you know some hash
encoding of all your files so you know
it changes every time you do a release
I've come to the realization that a lot
of this client-side proc processing and
decoupling is detrimental both the speed
of development and application
performance this is a quote from
the guy who works on charm a ton of
JavaScript has to be loaded in the value
of each time you fire up that and what
he discovered is is that it might
actually be faster to load pages as HTML
documents from the server that's the way
we've been doing things for ever and and
so a lot of these newfangled apps that
are one-page apps that do this
JavaScript MVC that load JSON from the
server and then process it on the client
it's actually sometimes not as fast as
doing it the old-school way where we
just load up HTML from the server
Twitter's seen this Airbnb is seeing
this and and so the way that you've done
web apps for so many years is still
viable it's still you know important to
consider that one of the things that
Ruby on Rails has done is use this pjax
framework or something similar to it
that basically you know uses Ajax and
just loads the parts of the page that
you want to load right instead of going
and getting JSON and then redrawing the
page so just grab chunks of HTML throws
in the page same way we did Ajax when we
first start doing it and so that's you
know one of the fastest ways to
architect your application for mobile
devices
I recommend PhoneGap or Sencha touch if
you already have these skills with html5
and CSS but you might just want to learn
objective-c because chances are that's
not going away anytime soon you already
know Java so you can do Android
development I talked to the CEO of
harmony last week CTO and if you know
Android really well I got a really
lucrative gig for you come talk to me
afterwards there's also a viewport tag
right you had that thing you scale it
appropriately and all of a sudden things
work and look like they should so if you
don't have that and your web apps right
now I encourage you to go at it and
you'll get a lot better looking feel
right away and you know with the CSS
media queries you had that viewport tag
you start using that to hide stuff that
might not need to be shown on a mobile
device and things look better quickly a
couple tips that I've learned with
mobile development you might want to
hide the address bar when the page loads
this is how to do that the other thing
that we've seen is if you click in forms
and you're you know typing a lot of
times you'll click on a form it'll zoom
in and then it doesn't zoom back out so
this is a way that you can actually use
to not zoom in so you click on a form
and you know it stays kind of small and
but you can still read it
there's also cloud development Amazon
Web Services are very popular but
there's also Heroku Cloud Foundry and
cloud bees and I've been using that more
and more especially for prototyping
because you can very easily like start
up Jenkins you can start up you know the
server you can deploy it and you can
have get support and cloudBees works
really well for that
Heroku supports Ruby node closure Java
Python and Scala and you deploy using
git push and it's it's really a nice way
to develop and deploy Cloud Foundry
support spring Grails Scala Play node
Ruby there's also a whole bunch of
services on the back end with Postgres
MongoDB RabbitMQ Ravello is a new one
that just went out of beta in August
they allow you to upload your VMs deploy
apps and you know define them and you
know add a patch EDS and all kinds of
things really easily if you still like
manage your own I encourage you look at
Tommy which is the new app sir it's been
out there a while but also security
matters be aware of sequel and content
injection disable cross-site scripting
don't show stack traces on your page
always use HTTPS if you have private
data and understands what browsers have
to deal with this book the tangled web
is excellent on showing you all the ways
to hack a URL there's so many things
that people can do to actually get into
your app without actually you know doing
much to the app and just doing things
that browsers allow him to do the name
of the author is Michael's the loose key
and he's one of those 15 most
influential people in security so he
definitely knows his stuff he's worked
for Google and good good to follow so
the modern JVM web developer starts the
fast Hardware uses IntelliJ leverages
jquery html5 you know and creates high
performance websites so if you want to
stay modern I encourage you to read to
attend conferences what you're doing
submit a talk and if you've never talked
to the conference it's not that hard you
get nervous I still get nervous
but once you're up here it's not so bad
right right on your blog start a blog
write a book the whole reason that I got
into this consulting thing and you know
I've had a good career is because I
wrote one of the first spring books and
and it was hard right it was a lot of
work I didn't make any money but I got
my name out there and you know I've made
money consulting since then so you know
do stuff if you can't get paid to do
something then do it in an open-source
way and if you get paid then you get a
gold star
but you know a lot of these things are
possible if you're at a job or they
don't allow you to use the latest and
greatest technologies there's plenty of
other jobs so yeah that's it if you have
any questions contact me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
