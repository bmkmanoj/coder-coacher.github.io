Atlanta I'm Barbara Bart with the Oracle
technology Network and I am here with
the born ready
TJ Fontaine TJ tell the folks at home
what you do for Oracle and how you make
your bosses nervous sure I've been
working here at Oracle for about two
years I started on the Oracle cloud
infrastructure fair metal project and
right now I'm kind of leading a
container engagement with kubernetes iya
community so just kind of going out
there and being good open-source
citizens with kubernetes since we're
investing in kubernetes ourselves we
wanted to go out and use them good for
the community sounds like a plan now I'm
going to bust your chops for a minute
because the the abstract for your
session must be the shortest abstract
I've seen for any Oracle code session so
far I'm going to read the entire
abstract it says an introduction to
kubernetes and docker patterns to live
by and any patterns to die by that's the
abstract so that's right that's going to
pull them in if nothing else look I mean
brevity that's the goal here right okay
and speaking of brevity if I give you
say two minutes can you deliver your
entire presentation probably not but
I'll do my best
basically I wanted to give people an
understanding in the talk about how what
are what are the primitives that
kubernetes is is giving you and how to
be successful with that so whoo I wanted
to start with containers and how to
appropriately construct your container
to in an environment that would be
useful in kubernetes and then all of the
primitives that build on top of those
things to go together so you can be
successful because it's one thing to say
I want to go use kubernetes for my for
my orchestration and for my application
but that's not you can't just spring
pull some kubernetes dust on it and
magic and get magic out of it you
actually have to do a little bit of work
and understand how it all fits together
so that's what it was about okay so I'm
intrigued by the idea of life
threatening anti-patterns so describe
one or two of these life threatening
antique literature I think one of the
ones that sticks with me the most that I
wish more people could adhere to is this
notion of what you use to build your
software is you
not the same thing that you need to run
your software so there's a difference
between the set of software that you
need to build it so you need GCC
potentially or make or some other kinds
of set of dependencies to build your
software and test it against a variety
of use cases but when you go to deploy
your software you don't need those
things and as a result you end up if you
keep them in there if you build it all
in one container and do that with your
docker file then you end up with these
large images that are really kind of
onerous to shuttle around or you spend
all of your time trying to figure out
how can i after I've done all that work
delete all of those files and all those
things out of there and as a result
you're you can miss some of them and if
you run in production with those kinds
of containers and your process gets
exploited for a variety of reasons then
there's more surface area for your
application to be vulnerable because
they have now things that you didn't you
weren't trying to think about you were
only thinking about your software so the
goal there are is to not package too
much into your container except for what
you need to run your software so that
that's a kind of a best practice ok ok
so that's a that's a life enhancing
practice well I mean if you depending on
how you've used security it could be it
could be a death practice if you don't
follow it can you give me another
example of a life enhancing well it
really comes around your operations in
the environment so you can deploy things
through a variety of different ways and
kubernetes with with different
abstractions but one of the nice things
about is it gives you an abstraction
around deployment itself so while you
can go attach configuration to your
service or to your pods and you might be
able to go update that configuration
live that's not as you should instead
encapsulate that configuration change as
part of the deployment so that you can
go out and if and watch that deployment
be successful and if things aren't
working out the way you expected you
should be able to rollback that change
in the configuration that's so you could
update things live and in place but that
kind of breaks a principle of least
surprise and the kind of the notions of
the mutable infrastructure so this way
if you separate live updates of your
application from the deployment where
you have this deployment you can now go
back and see these deployments happen
and then errors started happening or I
found this person made that change and I
can
go back and roll it back because it
didn't work and it's just good
visibility and observability into your
into your system and that's you know
kubernetes kind of represents a series
of abstractions that have fallen out of
years of everybody deploying distributed
systems and then turning those into best
practices that are hard to get off the
path of so it's it's really the right
orchestration system for where we are
today with micro services and
distributed systems but they're still
places that you can there are still
gotchas there that you have to watch out
for
can you describe one of those gotchas i
mean well so configuration is kind of
the big one for me like it's along with
building your container image and having
only the things that you need in it you
shouldn't keep configuration in your
container so if you're keeping those
things in there and you have to
constantly go through your entire
configuration build process just to get
up there that's that's not the right way
to approach that thing so you should
really be keeping configuration separate
that's also kind of encapsulating in the
12 factor app ethos of what's out there
so okay let's change gears for young man
how did you how did you get started in
this by mistake I'm a recovering systems
administrator so well I started in the
into software development putting myself
through school by doing systems
administration okay and so I found out
all the wrong ways to deploy software
and I decided that I was tired of
deploying other people's software I
wanted to write my own bad software but
then as I got here and I was working
through all these things I decided boy
it's just really bad all the way around
so I've kind of gravitated towards
ecosystems where I can make everybody
else's lives better so that's what
attracts me to the kubernetes ecosystem
and it matches my ethos of how I feel
like you should be deploying your
applications given what we've
experienced over you know a few decades
of software delivery so are you
presenting on kubernetes or other
related stuff at any upcoming events I'm
not currently scheduled for any other
events right now but I'm looking to be
speaking technically at probably at
JavaOne or the upcoming docker con no
okay okay
and where can people find more
information about this stuff you're
doing so as it relates to Oracle and
kubernetes there was a recent blog post
on developers Oracle com that cover
our announcement around kubernetes but
we'll also going to be posting more
content there as it relates to best more
best practices and kind of tales and
trials from people using kubernetes in
production and we're also I would say if
you're interested in in contributing to
open source we're going to all of our
work is going to be in on github.com
slash Oracle so we're going to be doing
all of our kubernetes engagement there
so you follow us and see what kind of
features and bug fixes we're working on
there cool well great well TJ thanks for
stopping by and talking to me for more
information on TJ session and other
sessions in this Oracle code amend and
others visit developer oracle.com slash
code you'll find information on other
sessions sessions that have already been
presented as well as sessions that are
coming up in future Oracle code events
for the Oracle technology Network I'm
Bob Rupert thanks for watching and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
