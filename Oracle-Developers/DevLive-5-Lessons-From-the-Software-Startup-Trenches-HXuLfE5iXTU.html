my guest today Bob Pollin
former CEO and now VP of engineering at
the article so Bob welcome good to be
here thank you thank you
so sorry we missed the keynote
presentation you were busy over here but
this is a great chance for the statue
teach all the folks we weren't able to
make it here all the people who just
focused it give us some of the
highlights of your keynote sure yeah
well my main goal was to kind of share
some of my experiences with the audience
here around I've been in ten startups
Wow six acquisitions worked in DC and
then over to Silicon Valley and then the
last seven years have been in Austin had
three startups here and all of gone
through acquisitions that virtualization
and cloud and now in containers so
hitting on a lot of the topics that
we're talking about here I'm just
thinking out live it's like you kind of
like the Michael Phelps of startups you
got quite a few gold medals there yeah
well some silver medals and bronze and
then okay then all meadows yeah you
still qualify at all and you know make
it in but and that's kind of one of the
themes too is that you got to try a lot
of stuff because but also learn from
your experience that at MIT it's kind of
kind of wanted to share I had that
unique set of experiences and stars have
been a big part of my life kind of you
know get addicted to the purity of
starting a company with a team and going
after market and be able to have some
success sometimes you know not success
to so because we do perhaps like it just
I think this is a very fascinating we
don't usually get to talk to enter Paris
and sure especially ones who have such a
tracker so we can do it this is your
life what kind of got you into this a
bug of technology and then startup yeah
so I was always into programming
computers you know growing up and had a
lot of summer jobs around doing a
software engineering programming
this is in which area this is um so in
the Washington DC area I grew up in DC
and went to school Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore I was a mathematical science
major we didn't have a computer science
degree so it's kind of close as I get
but I learned Fortran a lot of the basic
kind of goes for programming languages
back then and it was a great way to have
summer jobs along the way and you know
coming out of school you know had an
opportunity to work at in Washington DC
area and you know using some of the
analytical skills and mathematical
skills but a lot of the programming
skills too so I'm probably like a lot of
folks who were hearing early days of
your software engineering career and I
was lucky enough to work on some pretty
interesting projects and one the ones I
shared today was around when the first
four major projects was super exciting
was I got to build an expert system for
based upon AI and fault diagnosis for I
was a space-shuttle Wow this is back you
know early days the Space Shuttle and
all the analysis was done by operations
controllers in in control rooms and so
we took a lot of their heuristics of how
they were looking at telemetry and
understand what's coming down from Space
Shuttle missions and we took that in and
were able to analyze that build rules
and and built an expert system around
that and that kind of became my thing I
learned about AI and expert systems and
finding out there's a bunch of sessions
here now about artificial machine and
machine learning
Chad watts so it's great to see you know
this next generation of technology
coming in and lot of it's being applied
to things I've been working on last 10
20 years around DevOps and CI and so
it's interesting that we had a previous
session with Baruch and the Leonid
talking about DevOps oh yeah and Greek
tragedy object in itself the great
session yeah but it was kind of curious
so as there are all these new and
interesting technologies and innovations
that take place how do you figure out
which ones you think are going to be the
ones that are tangible and adverse is
you know was it called the hype cycle
around some I oxidizer yeah so I mean
what kind of criteria in your mind you
kinda go through to figure out which
which one makes business sense with
which is right missus which ones don't
yeah I think so it comes with experience
I mean the previous to stack engine ii
was a company that was acquired by by
oracle we were - the company called
copper egg and between those two it was
like back in 2013 we were looking at you
know what we're going to do next after
we left stackin after left copper egg
and somebody did what the company do
copper egg was a cloud monitoring
solution it sold in the DevOps
marketplace for managing and monitoring
cloud environments like AWS customers
who and i could liken ideas kind of
thing yeah cuz i got a new relic for
cloud application performance monitoring
we did a SAS product close it up in a
mass on cloud AWS together and but we
sold that company it was acquired and
been very successful doing that but what
happened next as we start looking at
where the buzz was and we went to a lot
of conferences like this and we went to
that's a lot of meetups and talked lot
of developers and that was 2013 2014 in
the early days of docker and we saw that
there was this tremendous up swell of
interest and it was there was something
there we started using docker in
containers ourselves and so we were able
to you know understand you know the
problems we started to solve but we also
saw that while all the developers were
getting you know sort of attaching
themselves to it
what was happening was there was no
application management tools and tools
that were going to help them once the
application moved down the pipeline to
three years down the line so how do you
find out technologies we can look at
where technology is today look at some
of the patterns of history and then you
go to these sessions and you start
hearing repetition you see excitement
you see fuzz and there's a lot of super
smart people and all these different
kinds of sessions and you basically you
learn from them and you look for
patterns like that yeah by the way if
you just tuning in
you're watching cold cast here at the
Oracle code Austin and I have as my
guest today Bob Pollin who gave the
keynote he is like the Michael Phelps of
startups there's a whole bunch of them
I've been very successful at it and
we're just kind of going over some of
the highlights of his a keynote
presentation so Bob whether it be early
on even now I mean you're people are
probably looking to you more for
inspiration but have there been any
people that whether it be from a
business side or from other aspects of
life that inspired you
oh absolutely and I talked about um
mentoring as being kind of one of the
good through five lessons that I talked
about today and one of them is around
getting a mentor and you know I kind of
have a belief that if you're lucky
enough to find a one or two people that
can really inspire you like that's
important but I'm also a firm believer
and learning from people you work with
and I'm kind of called talked about Mike
micro mentors you know kind of coin to
term there maybe but the idea is that
learn from everyone you work with learn
from your peers or your bosses you take
everything you can from the people
around you and and and I think that's
important is it that you can absorb that
information you learn you listen and you
can grow as a person from there if you
have the opportunity to work and I've
had a few bosses and peers that kind of
help lead me along the way and you know
I would call them mega mentors but you
don't necessary have to find the mentor
either you can find people in meetups to
conferences bosses peers people that you
might find out in the community they
could be mentors to I like the wood it's
easy called a micro mentor micro mentor
yeah so learn to learn from everyone and
also there's an T mentors and say that
if it has been a lot of startups I see
mob behavior you don't want to model
right so I think it's also important to
remember the things you didn't like and
because you know then you could
eventually when you're faced with the
same situation you can kind of go well
you know I learned from how people I
want to model positively but also
there's options we're going to learn
also what not to do and embrace that
that helps you grow as a person
leadership wise and also just see I
think a little for life skill too that's
been things I've learned
mentors are everywhere absorb it you
learn from everybody and I think that's
an opportunity I've been involved in a
few startups everything from like you
know four person in a garage to 15 20
people to about 80 200 none of them made
me that you're famous that's why I'm
here but I'm glad to be at article yeah
however one of the lessons I took away
and I just kind of want to surround this
of you is that's so much it takes to
make to get a successful startup it
seems like the
moon and stars all have to kind of line
up in terms of you know having that I
team the right idea that I product the
timing right I mean it just seems so
difficult and yet someone like yourself
has been able to line the line up those
things so can you talk a little bit to
them I mean one thing that's been
particularly effective for me and I've
always kind of followed this we talked
about this also as one of this other
lessons is you know looking for I called
it
the next upside down is like when the
next transition happens and there's a TV
show called stranger things the upside
down is kind of the opposite of where
you are now so what's the next thing
that's going to happen that allows you
to see a transition and when transitions
happen there's a lot of secondary
effects one of the lessons I learned
early on this is being out Silicon
Valley we always talk about you know in
a gold rush and maybe a docker is kind
of a gold rush right now containers you
look at selling pickaxes shovels and
Levi's don't look at panning for gold
and more money was made selling things
to the miners they needed to pan for
gold and actually people making money
off of panning for gold right so it's
trying to find out those patterns around
management and monitoring and
configuration there's a lot of issues
that occur as you bring a new technology
into the marketplace that's kind of what
we did with containers at snack engine
we saw that we're not going to be the
next docker docker is going to be hard
the big winner in terms of a container
technology but how our enterprise is
going to consume docker applications
well how they've done that in the past
well they virtualization management of
tools and those techniques and there was
different kinds of operations support
DevOps tools to help them those weren't
available when docker started so you
take a look at the where things are you
look at kind of the history of where
things come from and as this transition
happens there's a great opportunity to
go after these secondary effects and
selling those pics act pickaxes shovels
Levi's
to the miners versus up trying to be the
next big thing look at those secondary
Mexicans like those could be huge
markets and those are the ones sometimes
the bigger winners in the long term -
and I'm more sustainable - right so your
product stock engine tended to article
contain a cloud service yes can you talk
a little bit about that about that
transition and going from a startup to a
trade product or service in a very large
companies product portfolio absolutely
so when we found a stack engine we were
looking at really solving the
operational challenges I think we
launched stack engine the press release
was solving the docker operational
bottleneck so we knew that there was a
was code and applications coming down
the pipeline but the rest of IT and the
enterprise was not ready for how to
manage and operate those we knew it was
coming because we could see all the
developers are developing on a super
amount of excitement on one end of the
pipeline but not on the other end so so
what we ended up doing is we focus on
the enterprise applications and the
enterprise consumption and you have an
enterprise grade container management
solution and so we built an on-premise
product to do that at stack engine and
when Oracle knocked on the door we're
looking for Series A funding and we're
like well who better to work with and
partner with is someone that basically
owns the enterprise application space or
is the one a be leaders in enterprise
application and so for the last year
we've been working on we move stack
engine now from an on-prem product
on-premise product into the Oracle
container clouds with a cloud service it
launched in the fall of last year a lot
of success what supe super exciting is
that not only are the Oracle customers
interested in it there's a lot of
internal Oracle teams who are building
new services new container based
services and also some legacy teams of
you know taking their current products
and container rising those they're
looking to use the oracle container
cloud service to internal customers and
some of the most ambitious ones or
Oracle customers Oracle internal
customers but we have a lot of external
customers financial services
professional services oil and gas
shipping a lot of industries that are
you would think it'd be kind of you know
traditional enterprises we're not maybe
the leading edge these guys are really
pushing forward on using containers for
new products new micro service products
a lot of are also taking existing
products and then taking parts of them
and upgrading those to container so it's
a it's been a good match between what we
saw our vision of the company and going
from what is you know it was a very
small startup and now getting plug into
Oracle but we're in part of Oracle cloud
and which is almost like a start-up
within Oracle it's got that energy and
that synergy okay and what was some of
those challenges in going taking an
on-premise product
I'm moving it to the cloud yes so you
know we had to get through the process
of understanding of how to scale up a
product right now on-premise products
could be so smaller and dead devil
oriented we had to have something that
could scale we had to plug in to the
underlying I ass or
infrastructure-as-a-service composed
making it easy for customers to consume
it made it it made the it easier for us
in some ways because we knew where we'd
be running you know when you're running
you know in any environment there's
always different kinds of complexities
we'd be behind the firewall here we had
to plug into the Oracle services Oracle
cloud we could take advantage of all the
stuff around us and then to the support
then we had this java service is already
out there in Oracle cloud there's
database services and just compute the
storages Network that's already built
for you to plug into that the most of
work was just taking that our existing
container management capabilities and
making it into a service that can take
advantage and simplify how to use the
rest of the underlying is services and
now we have the other path kind of
services that we could plug into so it's
kind of a nice win-win it took some work
to get into the cloud to get it up and
running you know no more than you
typically expect but there's some new
things we could look forward to doing
around micro services and docker and
kubernetes it's gonna be pretty exciting
so great two more questions I know you
got a busy schedule but I really
appreciate you sharing with us so much
yeah umm one is just like in any any
startup and and which applies even more
so just because you show the resources
how do you manage kind of the assume
your family guy how do you kind of
manage what is an exhausting process of
launching and startups and running them
right assembly time any thoughts about
that yeah it's um it's never easy gonna
have an understanding family yeah when
my kids were growing up we would he
unfortunately we need dinner at eight
o'clock every night but we always had
dinner together yep yep
we made our kind of our own family sort
of traditions all right yeah so they've
been saying all my friends eat is six
o'clock
at eight o'clock so I'm working late and
it but we always ate together because as
much as possible and you know my kids
were always supportive of what we were
doing
my wife Ellen is very very supportive oh
but you do have to create a some
boundaries I think that's important
it's also important when you bring a
team together that you you understand
each other's you know as founders what
are unique your unique situations and in
that conspire to culture you know are
you're going to be is everyone expected
to work you know all the weekends and
Nigel estate at the midnight or is it
something where you know everyone has a
family and this is the way it was to
stack engine we all have families job
responsibilities so we kind of sets the
boundaries of you know everyone has
family time and respectful of that we
give it we would pay for everyone's
insurance for the whole family and it
more of a family oriented culture and
we're able to recruit in folks that had
families to because they knew understood
that we would let them go home early
they got back on line later you know and
you can have more flexible work
schedules and things like that
so so I think the cool it's really about
what kind of culture you want to build
you don't have to be how the crazy work
24/7 culture you get to do what you got
to do when you got to do it but could be
much more flexible to reach enough
people schedule okay last question
you've done so many startups and yes
you're still a young guy yeah I was what
do you see technology doing on one side
is creating new opportunities on the
flip side you know whether it be right
wherever you know it's just causing a
lot of disruption right for what
traditionally ankle looked up to for the
livelihood so any thoughts about that
you know I I thought a lot about it I
think a lot of the folks in the
technology it's all about that those
kind of problems where we're always
trying to disrupt industries you know
look for opportunities and we look at
that growth as a good thing a natural
kind of progression what's happening in
industrialization and technology and
things like that I also think there's
things that we could do if we think of
where people are losing jobs and where
there's less opportunity I used to be
that looks like to me that's a new
market opportunity to go solve that
problem that's a problem that can be
solved you know social media created
these echo chambers during the election
and that caused some problems and those
kind of things I think the whole fake
news story so social media was a great
enabler that also had some other effects
on the other side so but you know a
typical technologist like myself we
would just say that's just more
opportunity to fix a new problem and
solve in a different way and these think
it's a progression it's on a continuum
and you know I look at mid wet some
Midwest cities and I have a lot of
family in Ohio and Kentucky and we drive
through some those cities and they're
actually you know starting to shut down
and shut her up and those kind of things
and I think there's that's another area
where we could use you know that's an
opportunity for technologists to solve a
new problem and move for the better good
not just for making money but also
bringing the country together and things
like that so ok
well Bob thank you so much for taking
the time you're watching code cast here
at the article code Austin stay tuned
for more cold cast see you soon ice not
yet so that the up-and-coming cities
both in the US and was like thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
