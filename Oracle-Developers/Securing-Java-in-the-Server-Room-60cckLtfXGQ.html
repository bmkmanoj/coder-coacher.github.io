here on the Java one the security track
and i'll be talking about securing java
in the server room it's safest thing
works alright but the speed reading for
you first thing in the morning important
disclaimers at IBM requires all the
speakers to put on the front of the
chance and all the charts are being
recorded and they're gonna be available
I believe on the website the orbital
website by the end of the week so get a
chance to regain in detail so my name is
Tim Ellison pleased to make everybody
here I'm based in the Java Technology
Center we're in moseley in the UK that's
the place where IBM brings together all
so different Java technologies and puts
out the IBM SDK for java I've been
working on various runtime technologies
for many years and that's with small
talk and then some time with eclipse and
all is going to flirt in the country i'm
currently technical lead for IBM job 7.1
and java 8 releases which are coming up
from idea you can get in touch with me
that's how you can do that so the
purpose of today's talk is to talk about
server-side security so if I kind of
start off with a little discussion of
what i mean by the server-side security
and contrast that with the security that
we don't expect to do on on Klein fine
so clearly when you think about
client-side computing and the systems
that people used to interact with the
services in the server and they have
devices that have pcs portables that
kind of stuff typically performing lots
of different tasks for a single user
interacting with lots of different
systems and also very heterogeneous type
environments they're connected over
ospital mechanisms to go back into the
server and it also yep you go really the
kind of how they how they're going to be
connected to you you have a portal open
somewhere with your in the accepting
connections but as far as the client is
concerned that that is something which
is outside of our control
the purposes of this discussion all
right the clients could be application
that you have written and you're
provided to your clients and so you're
expecting a certain type of
communication to the server but likewise
people could be writing their own
clients or they can be deliberately
writing clients which are proving
various characteristics of your server
and try to weasel their way into the
services of your servant of God and test
your defenses so by contrast looking at
what's happening in the server room here
we have a large piece of iron is
typically performing a single type of
business activity single kind of service
that we're offering out for but all is
multiple users to connect to in the
scenario I'm talking around here and of
course you know the intention of the
server here is that it can support you
and provide that service to multiple
clients so the server is going to be a
much more powerful machine it's also
very much more controlled environment so
this is something which is connected to
the way you do your business and so we
have lot more controls around the types
of software that we're running on on the
system and how we interact with other
people and the reason why we're talking
about server-side security this morning
is because this is a pretty interesting
target for the hackers now clearly there
are attacks which can be targeted
towards clients and they can take over
clients and creators on boosters and
then be used to go after services and
these ten together these server-side
services tend to be the surprise that
the people looking for and that's
because this has the opportunity to
really affect the way the business
operates and there are different reasons
why people may be looking to attack a
server it may be because they have an
issue with a cert the business that
you're in or the service you're
providing they may be looking to take
something from your business which is of
value to you all that may be trying to
get information about people and clients
and so the privacy information is out
there so the fact that this server is
Bible to the organization
serving multiple times makes it a pretty
good target for a lot of suicide attacks
so I pulled up this quick quote here and
decided this can complete my talk with
this with this single country I'm not
sure if it really is Dennis user said
this because it's kind of taking a life
is so in this particular statement but
the claim is that you know there is no
such thing really adds a secure system
but of course we have to run businesses
we have to run them on these types of
jeans and so we have to do the best you
can to to achieve some level security
and the way we do that is of course to
ensure that we're filtering requests and
we're applying various levels of
security down through different zones
into the server so the clients which are
on the the left-hand side of the diagram
other things which we don't have any
hard control over okay so these are
things which show in the hands of users
and potentially people that have mal
intent towards your services and it can
go through various levels of filtering
and checking before it gets to the
server platform which is the place where
we have all the business logic and the
business data thus in there and the
filters that it goes through will be
specialized become more and more
specialized as you move sorta from the
left hand side to the right hand side
this diagram so the initial filter will
be checking for sort of malformed
requests or let's do to add the filter
on the right hand side you've got very
specialized business logic and I think
so just taking a quick dive into some of
those broad areas just so we get the big
picture I guess the most important thing
that we need to install and run on our
server side inside the server room is a
hit so it's a host intrusion protection
system and and what this will be doing
is looking at the bigger picture looking
at the logs at the different zones and
the different built
and using a bunch of rules which are
typically heuristic rules right there
but there's some very complex inclusion
detection mechanisms are going there in
different different types of systems as
to how they how they detect intrusions
but they're looking for suspicious
activities and they'll be raising alerts
and entertain determining that they have
detected the characteristics of an
attack against the server so the host
intrusion protection system is key
importance Aussie firewalls everybody
hopefully is very familiar with with
firewalls and these are the mechanisms
that we will be using to ensure that the
network connections that are coming in
are coming on the correct force
obviously we're not opening up all the
different ports to to all clients
comedian packet level inspection to see
what type of requests are being sent and
being led through into the next zone and
so on and then of course antivirus
software which is looking at some of the
patterns and characteristics of
requester to come in there and and and
determining whether the sorts of
requests are coming in are things which
we would expect through the normal
patterns of behavior that we have
designed in the system and whether these
alerts also expected requests are coming
so others say there's a whole bunch of
different sort of systems that you use
as you move from left derived from the
client side through to the server side
to ensure the requests are actually
coming in to true business logic in your
java application are well-formed
requests and genuine requests from
clients the picture changes some guards
when you look to move your applications
out onto the cloud platform so I wanted
to say a couple of words about that now
clearly if we have control over the
service in our own environment and we're
operating those servers and we have the
full degrees of controls that we need
and yet there are a lot of benefit
benefits and advantages of moving some
of the admin characteristics your
application out into cloud operation
systems as soon as you do that of course
you have to have a trusted service
provider out for the cloud because you
are now offloading some of those
characteristics that you have in the
past being responsible for directly and
that could be a good thing right it
could be that in-house you don't have
the same level of expertise around
server side security as the guys that
are commercially offering Clara fisting
services and so you may actually become
a more secure computing platform by
using the cloud and however it also
means that you don't have the same sort
of control over the details of how the
employment occurs because they're
offering clouds of service to you and
your door service consumer and that you
would have if it was all in house so if
you really do need to get into the very
fine details of how the cloud platform
itself is handling security you may not
have a level of control that that you'll
be looking for and of course you also
have to bear in mind that now some of
your data is travelling between your
corporate environment and cloud service
provider and along a channel which again
has to be very highly trusted channel so
if you're out there reading logs from
the server or the backups of databases
or running reports and that sort of
things would normally be an entirely
in-house operation doing that over to
the cloud operator and opens up another
channel which you have to ensure is is
itself being secure even without the
cloud service providers if you're
virtualizing the server room and of
course everybody's doing that and there
are additional risks which can come from
virtualization the resources that you
have in your virtualized environment are
being shared with other tenants of the
virtualization space is working so you
have to trust the virtualization
software to ensure that there is an
opportunity for people to reach across
between tenants
and get access to information so you
have to configure this stuff correctly
you have to understand how it works well
enough to give yourself that level of
assurance and part of the benefit of
virtualization is that data can flow you
can change different pieces of hardware
you know what gets left behind when that
happens and it's your software which is
running the host intrusion detection or
firewalls or antivirus that kind of
stuff is it aware of virtualization to
the extent that needs to do to do its
job correctly as well so okay talked
about the big picture and I wanted to
talk about Java specifically so and
there's far too much data to talk about
the entire end to end all in detail
we're just going to focus on on the
server platform here well you know Java
could be used to implement some of those
filters for the other parts of the
system and that's not where the is
going to be for this particular tour
pamphlet focused on at people writing
applications that run on the back end
server that have got reasonable requests
that are coming in and had that level
filtering taking place even with
well-formed request there are still lots
of risks that can occur for an
application that's running on an app
server in the server room
so I've just listed out a few of them
here data loss or or exposure here kind
of refers to the fact that and clear if
you have concepts of users and users
visibility of scope and their data and
so on they have to be limited into what
they can actually see privacy is an also
an important part of data visibility as
well and there are laws around and the
correct handling of personal information
so to a serious risk of you or to allow
people's personal information to be seen
by other applications also denial of
service is a mechanism by which people
I've tried to inhibit the service
progress through its application and
integrity you know you would designed a
system here which has probably got some
business flow a number of actions that
he goes through to achieve particular
tasks and that it expected flow through
the entire lifecycle well it could well
be that some are sending well-formed
requests to your application and yet
they're driving it in a way which was
unattended and that could be for a
couple of reasons first of all there
miss korea into and sending bad request
deliberately to see if they can probe
different ways through the flow of logic
and but also as a system evolves or you
had new features it opens up
opportunities for things to be driven in
different ways and which hadn't been
originally considered as part of the
design but actors are people who are
behaving on the server side and in a way
which is not as intended and design so i
will take a quick look at those in a
moment and see the sort of things that
we need to do to ensure that people
don't have access to information on that
server platform and when they do things
which they shouldn't be doing and
suppliers so here on the server platform
we have different types of suppliers we
have people who are providing
third-party software as we implement the
system we're drawing on third-party
libraries well you know we some level of
assurance of those libraries themselves
are safe
and they have a certain level of
security around them that we're
expecting for the code that we're
writing ourselves and also services the
fast server is calling out to other
services to find to complete payments or
to get address information for people or
check the validation of telephone number
Social Security numbers that kind of
thing and we need to ensure those
services themselves and also very same
so when we write these applications in
Java it requires a whole life cycle
approach okay so you need to think about
the requirements of the system that
we're building is this something which
is going to be a core business
capability for us and if it is that's
going to have a much higher requirements
around the assurances of safety that we
need on the system compared to a system
which is just being used within the word
group or within the bounds of the
corporation itself and to do that we use
threat modeling and risk analysis where
we figure out what types of threats do
we see being challenged against our
server and what is the effective that
risk were to be realized in terms of the
business impact and the integrity of the
system and we use secure coding we've
spoke about narrow that other talks
during this track all about types of
guidelines that you need for ensuring
that the code that you write is well
secured and doesn't itself contain any
vulnerabilities and then we will test it
and will ensure that he's properly
documented so people know how to use a
system and we have a policy in place so
they throw this on wines and we do
detect that there has been intruded into
the system then we have a mechanism by
which people can correctly respond to
that determine the severity and respond
adequately in terms of shutting down
that vulnerability and when we're using
Java in the server there are lots of
characteristics of Java which make it a
very good programming language to use on
the server side so the fact that there
are things like strong typing and by
click very
action and code signing are all to javas
credit there but java has had a long
history and there's lots of API is in
there which now would not be considered
as safe today as they were back in the
day and so people do have to be aware
when they're designing the system and
when their coding the system that they
should be using the the advised ap is
and development techniques for
implementing the Java server without
introducing additional risk by using
some of the old types of unsafe epi 22
in there already java unfortunately
doesn't have a very strong model for
data security so coming in java rate
there is a concept of being able to mark
data is being painted so if you're
receiving requests in from those clients
it forms part of a query you can tag it
with an annotation to say that this data
is tainted which means it hasn't been
verified yet and validated and then use
tools to track that data as it goes
through various API calls as part of
your design you'd then be ensuring that
you're not dealing with tainted data in
the area of coding which you expect it
to be very fine and of course you know
calling out to other languages means
that we're not always dealing with Java
and so they have their own issues as
well
took a couple of minutes about and
getting some information about the types
of vulnerabilities that will be trying
to address it with developing our Java
service system and see des are it's a
naming authorities is a vocabulary
that's used when designing secure
systems and talking about
vulnerabilities of systems when you
assign a CBE number to a vulnerability
it's a shorthand way of describing it to
other people so we're all talking about
the same sort of thing it actually
contains very sort of brief information
and about the type of vulnerability
which they exist and it doesn't give any
sort of detailed way with you you fix it
it's just discussing it in terms of a
vulnerability so we can go to the CDE
web site there there's about fifty seven
thousand of these we're sure there's
plenty of things they're due to trawl
through and where it becomes have a
reality is in the when it becomes a
vulnerability through the National
vulnerability database this gives much
more of an assessment of the impact of
those vulnerabilities on a business so
combination of a CVE and the cdss score
which will give you a level of impact of
what that particular vulnerability is
having on somebody's business or
somebody's a software system and benefit
of the cwe so this is focused on
software weeks is across different
languages as part of the homeland
security in the US it's managed by those
guys this is something which again ties
together things which are common
programming sort of patterns and idioms
which will be exhibited as weaknesses in
a system whether its clients idle server
side there are whole bunch of different
ways in which these are being
categorized and organized and there's a
they also give more details as to exam
halls and relationships between
different types of weaknesses in ways in
which you can write systems just call
that Heather in you look cool ones which
are filtered by by Java specific
weaknesses they have 73 different
weaknesses here and these are as I say
that kind of reasonably high level
descriptions but they're things which
you can really relate to you as a
programmer there are descriptions about
how you should behave your software they
as they look at the software which is
out there and they kind of reevaluate on
a regular basis some of the incidents
that are being reported some of the
vulnerabilities which they're seeing in
deployed systems then each year they're
publishing a list of the most exploited
weaknesses and vulnerabilities at the
racine each year and so the cwe
published this top 25 list of things
which are exploited and have a high
business impact as well and to do that
you know they have this weakness scoring
system and risk analysis framework to
give a quantitative measure for each of
those different qualities yep yep longer
is fine there so please repeat the
question for the purpose of the tape so
the question was I when we spoke about
the list of unsafe EP is or referred to
unsay keep you guys in Java is this
where we will find the information for
that no and thereby know which one's not
to use right to some extent yes but they
tend to be more sort of programming
patterns as opposed to individual api's
and some of the programming guidelines
for secure programming in Java include
the information about AP is sure not to
be trusted but it kind of goes beyond
that as well it's the api's which you
can use anything some examples here so
not seeding random number generators
correctly
you know or using the wrong kind of
crypto algorithms that kind of stuff
right they would that they would be
described as concept within these lists
but they wouldn't give you the actual
API other than giving you a one
particular concrete example of how that
could be could be seen in an intervener
system so I I'm trying to think if there
is a good source lot of is learned by
hard knocks to be honest you know it's
can know English share which sets of AP
is and suffer these kind of
vulnerabilities another good source of
information is the elbows guys who have
a project of a community-driven project
go again deal with the whole life cycle
so you know Keane emphasis on the the
risk management approach that I spoke
about earlier and ensuring that people
understand what the risk is and I manage
that risk always of the development
process rather than just testing and
finding the defect as we get get through
there these guys also publish a top ten
list particularly focused on web apps
and they also will categorize the
vulnerabilities and and so it's a way
when you're both designing systems and
testing systems to ensure and have a
checklist and if you do nothing else but
they're having a checklist that goes
through the the top 25 and the top 10
vulnerabilities and saying does this
relate to the system that I have it is
applicable to the type of system I'm
building and if so how do I you know
review my code or test by system to
ensure that I'm not vulnerable to these
that particular weaknesses and another
important source of information of
course is the security bulletins which
are put out by the individual Java
vendors so IBM has got product security
incident response team piece suit and
the URL there where we publish any
information that we get about
vulnerabilities that we found in the
Java implementation produced by IBM
and likewise there is a URL here for the
oracle equivalent so an oral have what
they call a cpu to the critical patch
update they will publish and all the
vulnerabilities which have been fixed in
there but also any alerts so if you're
ringing an older version of java and
you'll get a heads-up this to the types
of problems that they're fixing that
this is like a very simple way of
ensuring the security of your system is
to ensure your java version is always
the freshest one that's available now as
it could earlier in the in the
enterprise you typically have a
reasonably large development process and
you have a really large testing effort
it's not always possible to be up with
the very latest java because by the time
you've picked up that java and tested it
with a new cpu being released by the
vendor and but it's important to know
what the vulnerabilities are which which
are a bit in the version that you're
running and if possible update your java
and states name let's take a closer look
and this is my very simplified block
diagram of a server application so we
have a requests coming here from the
client side and left hand side I'm
assuming that it's all being filtered as
we discussed earlier and it's sending
information up to an application I've
drawn a very kind of simplistic staff of
about the application looks like so you
have the runtime platform before the
operating system the job which in this
particular instance acts each other is
an extension of the operating system
it's a bunch of services and then you
have your application and little we're
working together to coast a particular
implementation of your application and
that we have a concept of user sessions
and user data which are layered on top
of your application onto the river and
all this is interacting with some level
of database
so what kind of issues you're going to
get when you're trying to secure your
service I'd computing platform well
first of all is no risks that are going
to be incurred through miss
configuration of the computer this is
hosting application or deliberate
manipulation of that platform I spoke a
little bit about what the impact is of
cloud computing on here but even when
it's in the server room right there will
be some issues around how you configured
your operating system and the particular
vulnerabilities are going to affect how
your application is run on that server
so using the cwe CN is this kind of
shorthand that I mentioned earlier
there's a longer description of all
these things if you go to the CBD
website but just call it out in
particular examples here you know
putting users into incorrect groups is
something which could cause great
problems so when you're wearing a java
application an observant it pays to
ensure you have created a user and a
group in the operating system with the
minimum privileges that it needs within
the operating system to run Java and
your application and you launch your
server program as that user okay and so
if somebody manages to break out of
their app server and they try to run
time exec some kind of a program it
doesn't have any other right so those
are the absolutely needs to achieve the
business use then it's not gonna be able
to run riot around the system and be
able to read password files or whatever
else um similar you know things to do
with sockets and if you're allowing
different applications to bind to serve
same ports than they can sort of hijack
services and be able to get into the
requests on services are intended for
other parts of the system so it is hot
so the question is what was meant by
allowed here and yes it's if you're
running two different applications that
both have the ability to bind on the
zipper on the same port they need that
right yes yes yes all yes all of these
things are our weaknesses and they are
errors so these are all kind of
anti-patterns really in terms of things
that you should not be able harting to
happen right great right yeah these
would all be addressed of the OS
platform level and wait eventually and
then looking at the resource consumption
again in the OS level we've talked to
our different filters clients could well
be probing to figure out how far they've
got through various validation checks
and and can use the length of time that
it takes to get a rejection back as
indications to have far through
validation they've got so if you're
always rejecting people as early as
possible then by tiny how long it takes
to get your rejection back you can
determine how far ya really got past the
first checking on the second check and
and whether that's you have been
rejected and then I'll way down people
use that as a timing mechanism so put in
some some delays in there actually made
enhancer security to fool people into
seeing where they are moving up to the
next level here things which are
specific to to Java we spoke a bit about
using api's they intended to be used and
designing your application to use these
patterns that that are promoting secure
programming practices injured at the
Java levels so um
the particular examples I've got here
are fulfilling API contracts there are
plenty of places in Java where they have
intended uses of AP is and you clearly
you have to follow those to ensure that
you are getting the correct kind of
behavior from those api's as opposed to
using them incorrectly if you're if
you're following the API documentation
that will give you the assumptions that
it's making and the guarantees that it
gives you if you step outside of those
you may still get the type of behavior
in the correct case but in the error
case it may all go wrong rely on package
level scope here this is the kind of
concept that we have in Java of package
level visibility and so we may have
types and and types that are only
visible within the same package but the
package is not a hard boundary for Java
so if somebody else was to be able to
load up an application in the same
server space that also uses the same
package name then magically they would
be able to get access to the package
level visibility scope types that you
have in in yours as well so depending
upon package level scope and assuming
that that is everything you've delivered
is it's just a well-defined security
context would not be appropriate and now
here's one which which is typically not
very well found by the tools and also as
long as she's pretty high on the list of
vulnerabilities is allowing any level of
external impact a taste level of
external input to be used as reflection
on to code so examples here would be in
the XML part for example xslt where you
have the ability to have extensions can
call out on to other methods and I've
specified as part of the document
I think we've speak any external data
which will get translated into a class
full name or a method look up and
executed you have to be very careful
like that sir definitely an important
part okay moving a little bit further
the suck again onto the application of
middleware so now we've really to ensure
that things that are provided by the
middleware are used as they are designed
to be used and that we're not
manipulating our data incorrectly so
number one on the list I think it's
pretty much top of all the top
weaknesses lists is still SQL injection
attacks but what kind of generalized to
any data which you receive from
externally and using it to evaluate
something is going to be a very high
risk for your system so you have to put
controls in there to ensure that code is
properly nutrilite the edge is properly
neutralized it's not going to be able to
break out of your balance and runs of a
kind of a system specific to j2ee is
storing on sterilized objects in
sessions so the issue here is that you
can't replicate those sections across
different BMS and if you've got some
kind of load balancer and you wanted to
leave application across and story nonce
your left objects in sessions that means
that they can't be serialized across and
view
I guess it's because it we pinned to a
particular machine right and then you
deliver the denial of service if your
people end up doing on the regular basis
and for ya hopefully this one should be
quite obviously believes fishing session
exploration and means that things are
not being expired and they could get
reused for authorization by people who
don't have that same level of authority
there right at the top there the user
sessions want to ensure that our logical
units of work and are protected and that
the user data is is well managed some of
the risks which kind of demonstrate this
really are privileged Cheney so spoke
right at the end that you want the kind
of principle of least privilege to to be
added to throughout the system you have
to be careful that people don't acquire
privileges elevated privileges to be
able to do a particular operation and
then use that too often to other
operations within the system at higher
levels so there's always sort of dropped
back to to lower levels even when their
privileges being raised so the next one
is already upon and I'm reliance on any
kind of data which has come from outside
parties so you know as an application
programmer you may be relying on putting
some state out on those clients or some
receiving some state from some other
service and low notionally from a design
perspective you may think that is your
data and you're giving it to somebody
else to look after for a while when it
comes back you really can't depend upon
the validity of that data without
checking to make sure that it's been
done accurately and using that in any
kind of security decision of you would
be a bad thing to do and of course just
making the incorrect
permission checks for the critical
resource allocations it's not going to
be very desirable few sessions on
stepping over to client interface for a
moment here here we have communication
outdoors class we talked about before
and the the choice of crypto algorithm
is going to be key you know there's
there are there enlist let's see if
security nice there are lists
recommendations as to the types of
cryptography which are going to be safe
for ssl programming and for encryption
of data so you don't be using anything
which is does not fall part of the
recommendations at this point and using
seating and random number checks
likewise without these levels of
escalated encryptions and randomizations
people can get all user data and maybe
using that either to game the system to
drive it down different flows and or or
just stealing the data directly
certificate revocation and again this is
on the the high list of people's
weaknesses that they see in in
vulnerable systems you need to check
that certificates have not been revoked
by the people that issued them because
that certificate may have lost its
private key for example or again in the
one case here just because i was
presenting a certificate doesn't
necessarily mean that it's been matched
to the correct host and so having some
dependency on on the dns service and
ensuring that he's done in a safe way to
ensure certificate does relate to the
person who are you talking to
and there was a guide to the back end
here and when the data is going out on
to the database there's lots of risks
that we can see around managing that
data that we're using to to achieve our
business objectives and clearly storing
the data in clear text on the file a
part on the disk means anybody who has
access to the machine through the
operating system again if this
vulnerability that exists in the
virtualization layer or is a bad actor
in the operating room could get access
to that and and likewise you know how to
keep the the backup of all this data
safe alright somebody's been taking a
copy of this and they go to taking it
off site and showing that it's done in a
safe way it's going to be part of
keeping your server side to secure
whether it's in the database or there is
serialized data where we have private
variables and get serialized out onto
onto a disk somewhere and then somebody
figures out a way of getting hold that
serialized data they may like we see
relies on to a disk right if somebody
can get into the system they can sear it
and there is a serializable object they
could see realize it into memory and
then they can start rooting through the
memory of finding the values of private
variables which they're stored in
serialize deform and I think I mentioned
earlier that improves a violation is not
necessarily just impact to the operation
of that particular application but
likewise to the business and it could
well be illegal impact as well as your
login the data and we have enough we
need to gather enough information as you
as your application is logging uni it
was a balance right you need to gather
enough information so that your host
intrusion detection can figure out that
there has been an intrusion and that you
have enough information in the audit
files to be able to go back and figure
out where it came from what information
they've got what the impact is to the
business
how you can go ahead and their their bio
fix it however you don't want to be
putting so much information in the log
files that that becomes another
opportunity for people to get hold of
that information all right so clear
their balance to be struck about the
information that's going to get put into
those log files and then again how you
manage those log files and have the
operator deals with it spoke about the
timing discrepancies and the length of
time it takes to to complete operations
and backup files and where they don't
happen so yeah all this is kind of
points in the application unless you're
looking at the design of the application
it's important to consider the
weaknesses of the different types of
handling of data at the different types
of a way in which the application is
being designed and it based on it it's
very important a holes a life cycle
approach so if planning it's a risk
assessment is a system that I'm building
something which needs to be super secure
and I need to ensure all of these things
are done or is it have a work group
level service and providing and if I
don't need to do it quite so rigorously
but you need to do the risk assessment
as to what the application is is
therefore and define the goals that you
have the level of assurance you're
building to this system and and thereby
build into the software development
process the secure engineering practices
it appropriate to building that system
that you come out with a level of
assurances to the safety of your system
showing the development certainly adopt
those secure engineering practices so
you mitigate known risks and expected
risks and you then have an explicit
security testing phase where people will
be using some of the risk analysis to
test that the checks and balances that
you put in there have been implanted
correctly but also those guys could use
some more dynamic testing 22 closet
system or do penetration level testing
and try and determine through other ways
in which they can drive
system and review a security weaknesses
that you have and then sure the users
and the administrators of that system
have Craig guidance as to how the system
should be operated so it needs to be
secured by default but it's installed
its default configuration out of the box
in these to be a secure system and there
has to be clear guidelines to people as
they are modifying the system through
their new configurations as to what the
impact of security is by changing these
configurations and then during the
operation to the system and ensure that
everything is configuration managed so
it kind of makes sense in these
operations to have a source code control
everything that she's changed on the
service side is going to go through
revision control and we can see what has
been changed and who has changed it for
what reason when their systems are being
deployed intrusion detection and an
action plan written beforehand so that
you know we know who we're going to
sleep to where there is to be an issue
those intrusion detection can provide
some information which will go back to
the developers and the designers to
ensure that they have enough information
to be able to address the particular
weaknesses and found those under
abilities and contingency planning right
it turns out that this system has been
deployed in a state which is not very
sufficient what we can do about that now
quick kind of shameless plug for some
IBM software mm-hmm this is a upscale
and diversity great detail about this
but there are systems out there which
dscam deployed systems so with apps can
you can scan your system before it's
deployed and you can scan it after it's
being deployed and proactively and shed
your time to up and figure out and if
you can detect vulnerabilities in the
software that you have it works in
conjunction with the host intrusion
detection so we'll collect the
information prioritize it and even give
you a full life cycle back to to the
code has given
rise to some of that fun durability and
then working with the host intrusion
detection could also do this for the
call of virtual path which is two to
shut down some particular types of
requests if they identity curly at high
risk but you know information a lot
security stuff is that this young that's
all I have for this morning so thank you
very much for your attention your
questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
