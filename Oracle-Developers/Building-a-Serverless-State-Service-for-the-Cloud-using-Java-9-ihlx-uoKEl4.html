going to talk to you about building a
service state service for the cloud a
little bit about me I've been doing
software development for over 25 years
you may know me from the Java EE realm
I was the spec lead for JavaServer faces
and servlet for many years and I'm very
happy to be helping to hand off those
items to the Eclipse project for EE for
Jay I'm really excited that the
community is going to be carrying these
things forward we've got some exciting
things planned I've been a frequent
speaker at conferences and I often like
to teach a workshop whenever I go to
conferences as well and I right now I'm
happy to be working on this state
service that I'm talking to you about
today we have a great team staffed with
people that are behind oracle coherence
this was a product that oracle has long
had great success with with our
customers and and running it ourselves
for various business purposes that we
run on and when we talking a lot more
about that in the session I've written a
few books from mcgraw-hill and so let's
get on to the next slide this is our
boring safe harbor statement but very
important in this session because I'm
going to be showing you code and api's
but this is still in development so we
don't have our final form for this yet
so expect it to change these are some
pictures of things that are useless
coffee pot made of chocolate that would
obviously melt and a spoon that you
can't I'm sorry a fork that you can't
pick up and
watering jug that you really can't force
stuff out of a square wheel the
archetypal example of something that's
useless in software there is a lot of
buzz and and justified buzz about doing
stateless services because let's face it
state does bring with it a lot of
problems you have to deal with
concurrency issues you have to deal with
mutability you have to deal with
scalability problems that all really
stems from having to deal with state so
there's a lot to be said about stateless
applications oh let's not cry like a
baby here what can you do without state
all right people are clearly making
great progress in stateless systems you
can basically convert input to output
that's what a pure function does right
in the mathematical sense when it comes
to building software applications to
deal with state you can make that the
caller's problem since what we call the
hot potato problem you just pass the
state on as you do something with it or
you can externalize the state this is
the approach that most people use in
production and this is indeed the
approach that we have advocating here
with the state service
it is externalize the problem when you
do that is you have to really have a
system that is utterly consistent and is
also very high-performing and I believe
this state service I'm talking about to
you is both of these things before we
get to state let's talk about state and
serverless serverless itself is a bit of
a marketing term really it just means
there are servers still but the servers
are somebody else's problem I'm very
fond of referencing the somebody else's
problem field from the Hitchhiker's
Guide to the galaxy here somebody else's
problem field is much simpler and more
effective and what's more it can be run
for over 100 years in a single charge
battery so this is from Hitchhiker's
Guide to the galaxy and you erect to
somebody else's problem
around something you don't want anyone
to see because when they see it they
really will be like I don't want to mess
with that it's somebody else's problem
it comes back to what we've been doing
in software and business software for
forever which is the relentless drive to
allow developers to focus on business
logic we've been trying to reduce
boilerplate pretty much since we
invented boilers this idea is separating
the stuff you need to get to the point
where your business logic runs from the
actual business logic you allows you to
focus on the core business logic and
this goes back to the beginning of
programming languages the very idea of
separating the core language from the
runtime libraries you know it started
probably before C but C is a really good
example C is so close to a seminal
language I had a CS professor in college
and would you say C is assembly language
and that's a NASA portable statement
it's an accurate statement and it has it
set the separation of the core language
to the runtime libraries in the
enterprise software world and
particularly in Java but not just Java
we could say the serverless
is the logical extension of dependency
injection so dependency injection is
where it sits you know was the
state-of-the-art for allowing you to
separate business logic from everything
else in 2002 came into the fore in the
Java world with spring JSF had it around
the same time 2004 and the idea with
dependency injection is you have your
core code and you just say you know
inject the business logic and you have
the business logic and inject
dependencies that it needs into it
this has manifest benefits testing
testability is one of them because you
your core code can be run in different
contexts in a test context
runtime context and in each case you
have different dependencies you for
example mock objects this was further
standardized in the Java world in 2009
when we had containerization I'm sorry
when we had the ad inject jsr 3:30 this
standardized the notion of dependency
injection moving further along in time
to Tanner is a ssin started to become
popular around 2014 or so and this was
yet another example of the kind of right
place at the right time effect the cloud
platforms were maturing and
containerization was kind of a perfect
idea for packaging applications in the
cloud so it's another way to sort of
have dependency injection you have your
core code and all the stuff around it
isn't really much concern because you're
running inside a container which itself
is running in the cloud at this point
though I think I've convinced you that
you do need some state so now where does
it go let's look at the history of these
things just like we have had a
separation between core language and
runtime libraries state has always been
somewhat divorced from the core
programming language code was always you
know the grunt the behavior was the code
and the state was the data it started
out really with from simple text files
that were read
you know from tape drives and got
further refined with the introduction of
structured query language SQL now there
it was a domain-specific language dealt
with dealing with state and you know if
you wanted to deal with it in your
programming language code it was you
know you could do it it was fine you
would have to have either SQL injection
of some kind or
maybe use an object-relational mapping
technology but the point was you're
always creating SQL statements and
sending them off to the database which
is separate from the code right this got
a little more refined when the so called
no SQL approaches and document style
databases we have you know up here on
the upper right Oracle cloud database
MongoDB DynamoDB this kind of seeing as
a logical progression of things now we
know we need state but what you need
from a store of state let's talk about a
few operations type things but your
operations had on here so you want to
have durability if you know either your
client disconnects and comes back or
some of the nodes go down in the data
cluster you don't lose any data
everything is perfectly durable of
course you want to have reliability and
high availability so when it comes back
it's durable but the fact that it comes
back at all is reliable the fact that it
fails over without even noticing or a
very minimal degradation in service
uptime is important scalability number
of the ability to increase the
processing capability as the load
increases we'll get to more on that when
we talk about the cloud aspects of it
and the throughput of course number of
requests per second for example in place
processing that is you want to operate
on the data where the data is so you
don't want to have to take your compute
and suck the data in what you really
want to do is send your compute to where
the data is do the querying and
aggregation and manipulation there and
send the results back
that's what M plays processing is
aquarium aggregations this is a
programming level concern where you you
know obviously all of this exists in SQL
we would like to have a system that is a
little closer to the core programming of
gideon's that will have there
of that system you would like to be able
to listen for map events for example and
make sure that it's done the highly
performant way and it needs to be
accessible with the programming language
of choice so this is the so-called
polyglot multi language use case that's
just the core requirements of the state
service what would you need on top of
that when you take it into the cloud
well on-demand provisioning and
elasticity you only want to of course
pay for what you use and not what you're
not using that's the whole rationale of
the cloud in the first place you want to
have a server this operating paradigm
that is the management is handled by the
vendor you don't have to manage it
yourself you want to have pay-as-you-go
and utility computing pricing and you
want to have a smooth on-ramp you know
in the local development case to the
cloud development case you want to have
similar abilities for your pipelines
your development pipelines to feed into
those things so what's wrong with using
our existing language specific data
structures most importantly map also
known as dictionary hash container
associative array every language has
this concept it really has everything
you need it's got rows and columns the
fields that is and its key centric which
means it will be very scalable but the
problem of all of these so far is that
they're stuck on the heap you want to be
able to take that concept and expand it
so that it's not succumbing ok let's
drill into why hash maps are great right
so they've got the the foundation
concept in computer science of the hash
function if you want to take that and
make it accessible and usable in a
multi-threaded environment the simplest
way in Java is just to say collections
that synchronize map of map this keeps
the hashing semantics and provides the
thread safe but it's very coarse in
terms of contention every operation from
every client
is serialized synchronized and executed
in serial concurrent hash map is a
little bit better it only locks things
operation basis so it's in process and
it's much more granular in its
contention than synchronized map so
let's introduce cloud map it has the
same hashing semantics as concurrent app
but it's highly distributed multi
process and multi thread and I'll
explain how we can do that and that's
where the magic of coherence comes into
play but the programming experience is
just a map based API that we plan to
produce as one of the state service
api's I mean in the local case right so
I've mentioned these before a simple
hash right hash map is you have a table
where you perform a hash on the key hash
function modulo the length of the table
and that gives you a new entry and the
concurrent hash map we lock that
particular bucket that you're dealing
with and then the distributed hash map
we have a very nice patented hashing
algorithm that comes inside of coherence
that does the hash which maps to a
partition which is you know also known
as a bucket or a specific member in a
and that is the data partition where
your your data lives so in a distributed
context you can have multiple nodes many
nodes coherence run thousands of nodes
you could have even easily and only the
node that has the data is the one that
has to be locked so you can think of
climb app as the distributed map plus
plus it's the circle of state service
it's running on top of Oracle's
bare-metal cloud and it is running on
top of oracle coherence
I mentioned the many years we've
experienced that we've put inside of
coherence to have site reliability
engineering inside you can think of it
as a Serena box
all right many languages let's take a
look at a demo here first I want to show
the local development use case let's
take a look at the local development
story for the state service
we followed in the example of the FN
project our serverless functions as a
service effort and we have a local
command line
ours is called CM which is the name will
probably change but it stands for cloud
map currently and it has a number of
commands and first we're just going to
create a local instance see I'm create -
p5 to do this we have a to-do
application I'll be covering that in
great detail the p5 is a partition
account which is a reference to the
underlying industrial strength coherence
technology that we have behind this
thing you can see that when we started
it up we have two different ports
exposed G RPC and a management port and
the G RPC is really important because it
leverages this very popular current
technology for doing a remote procedure
call this gives us a lot of benefits
which I'll be showing today but one of
them is multi-language support and
that's a really important thing as I
mentioned earlier the management port we
interact with that in several different
ways
via rest and also via maven so let's
just take a look at the demo that we
have we're going to start it out we have
several different language versions of
it here but there one I'm going to show
first is the node based one and p.m.
start and this is a simple to do
application using react JSON
and node in the middle tier and state
service in the back tier for expedience
we use facebook login to get us the
username of the current user you can add
a few items let's pretend it's a
shopping list milk cookies and peanut
butter
we'll cover the UI itself more detail
later but I want to show here is the
live code deployment feature so if we
click on this we expect it to check it
off it's done however we notice that
it's not doing anything well that's
because I haven't deployed the portion
of the code that deals with the entry
processor that does the check off of the
thing so let's look at what that code
looks like I mentioned the middle tiers
written in node and the back end is
entirely just the state service so the
only application code that's on the back
end here is this little entry processor
now the entry processor is a core
concept of coherence and also the cloud
map and the state service and it gives
you the ability to have server-side
processing for your data manipulation
code I'll talk about the numerous
benefits of that elsewhere in the
presentation but for now we can just say
that we are implementing the entry
processor interface which has one method
called process and this is handed a map
entry now at our domain application here
the data structure is a string mapped to
a JSON object and the string is a UUID
that's created by the client and the
JSON object is just a little bit of JSON
representing that to do in our case it's
super simple it's a boolean for the
checkbox the user ID for whom this to do
is to be accounted for and the text of
the to do so we're handed this and all
we want to do is obtain the value of the
completed property
- do not get completed because you can
see it's a JSON map so we can just
obtain the completed property there we
want to flip it and store it back again
so it's not been deployed so how do we
deploy it well it's maven so you can
just simply do a maven deploy and we
have I mentioned the management port
it's listening about 8080 that is a
maven repository so let's just run maven
deploy maven - yes I have a settings
file and deploy and you can see it's
going to be super fast okay it's been
deployed now this is the two-step
process we have to go back to the CM
command you can see that we had cm
activate so this takes the maven group
ID artifact ID and version and makes it
available for the code to run I have it
in my history here cm activate comm
Oracle cloud applications examples -
dues as the group ID to do server is the
artifact ID and 100 is the version to be
extra pedantic let's just compare that
with the pom and you can see it's the
same so we're activating it we got our
200 ok
and now when we check these things it
checks off and I didn't have to redeploy
anything I didn't have to restart
anything I just had to deploy the maven
artifact and activate it now let's say
we're in a cloud situation of course
this is the cloud map and we deploy
early - poor often it's a lot of
deployment here in the cloud so we're
going to just make a new version of this
thing and we will you know as sometimes
happens introduced a bug so thankfully
in the micro services world there are
many techniques such as canary testing
and Bluegreen deployments and any number
of other cute names
you mitigate the effects of this but in
our simple case we're just gonna roll it
back
so let's deploy it with the bug in place
and it should prevent it from running
again we won't be able to toggle it in
this case oh yes I forgot almost forgot
I have to increment the version number
because this is maven after all and
versions are immutable so if I was to
try to deploy this I would get a 500
error or something like that
access denied I'm not exactly sure which
one we've got it set to right now okay
we've deployed that let's inactivate 101
okay we got it 200 okay and let's click
this and it doesn't work and we click
this and that doesn't work either okay
well that's a problem let's roll it back
so we don't have to deploy anything else
we can simply go back to version 100 and
click on this and now you can see it
works again so it's really important
that you know you can see that we didn't
have to restored anything and it's a
very highly dynamic system finally on
the last bit I want to mention on the CM
local development story right now we're
not using these things but we will be
using this for castrator URL to point to
the cloud server that might be a load
balanced end point for our service and
also we'll have a core support for
worker everything we're doing in the
Oracle developer experience is really
trying to leverage a lot of other great
cloud technologies I'll be talking about
bare metal cloud but we also are going
to be leveraging worker which is a
really great pipeline technology that we
have
let's take a look at the multi-language
support by looking at the three
different two new clients that we've
implemented so far we've already seen
the JavaScript base one over here up
here we have a textual one written and
go and down here we have a Java based
one written in Java FX let's look at the
go one first
it's textual so we have a little CLI you
can say list to list your items to get
and you can say add to add a new item so
let's change let's add grapes and you
can see when I've added it here it shows
up over here in JavaFX and also in the
node one this is because we have a
full-featured event service in the state
service but I'll show more in the code
section but it basically uses the
capabilities of the language that you're
in and has a reactive based event system
that allows streaming and filtering and
all sorts of great things that you come
to expect when you deal with data
structures and maps in Java and I can't
say enough how we're taking the ease of
use of the collections and map API in
particular as a guide and adding some
additional features on top of that we
want the user experience to be very
seamless and not have to require you to
think of different paradigms to interact
with State ok I mentioned you can had
items you can also edit items so let's
list will change edit one to chunky
peanut butter and you can see it updated
there you can mark and unmarked them so
let's say we got cookies mark two and
let's say we also got grapes mark three
okay so you can remove also from the
list so we don't need milk anymore we
got a text and someone else bought it in
the family and the chunky peanut butter
we do want that still so we check that
off and you can also say clear completed
now we've got no events so I'll just add
a few more and just show the different
filtering we can do so now it's the
evening so we're going to be getting
some more fun stuff we'll get some beer
get some wine cheese and crackers having
a little tasting party here so we'll
check off every other one and then say
hey she'll only the completed ones
that's going to show you just the
checked ones and the active ones are the
unchecked ones ones we still haven't
gotten and that's a quick tour of the UI
let's take a look at the code of the
three different clients first we'll
examine how each of them connects to the
state service it's very similar in each
case first up here we have the node
JavaScript 1 we have a cloud map which
is part of the API that we provide you
ask it for a session passing the state
service endpoint that could be the local
development case or pointing to a cloud
1 then once you have the state service
session you say cloud map I'm sorry you
say session get map the architecture of
this to do is application uses a single
data structure a single cloud map called
two do's and and we store all of the two
duties where the keys are
uu IDs and the values are the JSON data
structures that have properties for user
text and completed or not very simple
three element data structure in the Java
case it's very similar you have a
session with a factory method called
create that takes the URL of the state
service and then you say again get
mapped passing to dues and this Java
example here we are going to be saving
this user filter because most of the
queries that we're dealing with and
filter out the user I mentioned that
each entry has a user property in it and
in the map we're storing entries from
all of the different users of the
service so we only want to deal with the
two dues that are relevant to the
currently logged in user so that's why
this user filter is employed here and
finally let's look at the go one the go
one we have a new cloud map builder
passing the host and port and also the
name and then we have access to this
cloud map and you can see that it's go
of course because we have the multiple
error response and we're using a builder
pattern here maybe now let's look into
using the cloud map client this is the
most important
the Code walkthrough here and it
provides Java eight map like user
experience with server-side code
execution filtering querying aggregation
and event streaming and will encounter
all of these aspects as we go through
the code let's go to the go one first
we'll show the simple pudding and
removing what alright so we've got our
cloud map and we're simply putting it so
very simple there for delete
we've got cloud map remove and we also
have a remove all this is how the
implementation of clear completed is
done in the go
so if we say DC it's delete completed
and now that's what that is that will
invoke this remove all so it's passing
this filter and here the filter is
saying I would like you to remove the
entries where the completed property is
true now let's look at the querying and
aggregation here that appears on the
list client our list method rather so
we're saying here's a filter again just
for give me the users give me the two
dues from the current user then we have
if the flag is active we're gonna add
equal is completed as false and if the
flag is negative we're going to say
equals completed is true and we're
enumerated the entry set so that's to do
list we're passing this to do list which
is a reference to a go native map which
gets populated with the values that
match the query let's take a look at the
JavaScript side to do API to j/s in the
first one I want to show is not get
listing all the to dues for the user so
here we're saying to dues which is the
cloud map we got from server Jas we're
passing saying values run over the user
he equal to the current user and the
JavaScript client uses JavaScript
promises so it happens everything that
happens asynchronously I mean which
means you can pass this then which you
pass a function reference and here once
we get the values back we're simply
sending them down to the react client I
mean let's look at let's see and they're
a little more interesting one would be
updating the to-do text here we go so
here we're calling the invoke method on
the map this is server-side processing
so we're passing passing the UUID and
then here we're passing the event
processor the processor is invoked and
this gives us the data local server-side
code execution so and then coherence is
a massively scalable multi node
architecture and your data is going to
be replicated and as much as needs to be
in it takes advantage of the maximum
network topology to give maximum
resilience so if you have a very widely
distributed network it will spread
things out to reduce the chances of the
data being lost of course it won't be
lost in any case but reduce the chances
of recovering and make it faster to come
back when it does come back anyhow we're
passing the entry processor and it will
be executed on the node that has the
actual data so none of the other
partitions will need to be locked and
and we're saying update the text so it's
an entry processor that just does
updating of a property and of course the
promise happens they're returned to the
404 the completion flag I mentioned this
earlier with the event the custom event
processor so here's where we're calling
toggle completed so that just calls that
Java code
child show again real here or quick
toggling the value of the completed
property okay let's take a look at the
remove all here we're passing again with
two filters equal user and equal
completed is true let's take a look at
the Java side to do is client Java
mmm-hmm
so that we already saw how to create the
map let's just take a look at adding and
removing very simple call them output
clad might remove thought might remove
also you can see it's very similar the
filtering and querying right there so
here we're saying cloud map give me the
values that match the filter stream turn
on the streaming the Java eights
streaming and passing this map generate
to do which generates this to do very
simple and here is the reducer so the
Java eight map API is an implementation
of the MapReduce paradigm and so here's
the map and here's the reduce let's go
back to JavaScript and take a look at
the events and this is how the clients
are able to become aware of what happens
on the other side in the node
application that's using server-sent
events so the react application will
make a rest call for this thing which
will return text event stream and then
we're filtering on the current user so
give me the events for the user and
we're sending her at we're installing
several different listeners for insert
update and delete so in each case we're
simply sending an SSE down to the client
and if we look at the client code
components app is you can see here we're
creating the event source and that makes
the rest call gets back to the event
source and we're
the different event listeners that
interact with our to do domain
application looks good how the events
work and go did you use go okay here we
are passing an event subscriber to do
entry event subscriber this is a struct
that uses this client subscription
that's the data type that comes from the
go client and it has a few methods you
need to implement on subscribe on
complete on-air and on next and here in
the next case if it's one or two that
means updating either the one is
inserting two is updating we get a new
of to do entry and we either update it
or just you know deal with it okay is
that paradigm for dealing with maps so
should be familiar to go programmers
mm-hmm and let's see how we hook that up
here so to do entry event subscriber
right there similar to what we saw on
the other clients cloud map events
filter equals on user and then subscribe
passing our the address of the
subscriber that we've just created here
alright
so we can see that uh cloud map is
distributed map with a lot more goodies
on top of it we have this distributed
persistence from coherence shared
storage is not required and need its
discourage it also supports snapshots
and archiving of the distributed state
so you can see lots of different
topologies are possible here and we have
at Oracle here a whole new platform that
we're building we brought you with the
community Java EE and now the community
is taking it over and we have seen
things changing a bit and micro services
and serverless and clout and we feel
that a new approach is needed for these
kind of applications so we have a micro
services project that's going to be
coming out and we also a job one we
announce the FN serverless project and
tying these together is the state
project the state service that I'm
talking to you about here today so
without the state service you know you
could bring your own thing you can use
some other kinds of things Redis or what
have you but those are not as good
tightly integrated to provide an overall
value experience with the other two
things and also in addition we're better
performance than any of those
off-the-shelf ones - we have a demo
based on the FN project and this is the
vista license plate demo it is a micro
services based thing but it's actually
even more micro than that it's function
based function as a service so you could
think of micro services I'm sorry you
could think of functions as like the
tiniest possible micro service it's a
single method invocation they are
intended to be spun up and turned down
for each request now you might observe
how do you deal with Java in that case
well you can mark your Java based
function as a service function as a hot
function
and this will enable the JVM to stay hot
for a specified time period we the
default is two minutes so if you get no
requests in more than two minutes the
JVM will spin down but in production
you're expecting to get more you know
than that so furthermore billing wise
we're not going to be charging for the
spin-up and spin-down time of the VM
because we know that Java is being
interpreted and being subject to
strategies like just in time and ahead
of time compilation and all of the
hotspot type optimizations there we know
that the VM gets better over time so
we're taking that into account let's
talk about the domain so this license
plate demo what it does is get some
license plates and tweet the map right
you can imagine a alert service where
you want to monitor license plate
activities so we have a number of
different functions that are here one of
the two of them are written in Ruby
four of them are written in Java maybe
one of them is written and go and
another one is written in Python what
happens is the scraper service queries
Flickr to get license plate images that
contain license plates then we call the
ALPR
automatic license plate recognition
software as a separate function there
which will do OCR on the license plate
and also give me the coordinates of
where the license plate is in the image
we have a detect diplucate service that
will prevent us from taking action on
plates we've already seen then we have a
draw service which uses image magic to
draw that box based on the coordinates
that were from the detects function and
then we have an alert service which will
send it out over Twitter we also have
these ones on the bottom
progress alert manager and publish which
sort of coordinate the UI for this thing
and also the progress bar and the alert
manager for sort of providing state for
how the admin will deal with the tweets
as they come through these services here
the ones that I mentioned were written
in Java are talking to the state service
directly and we could take a look at how
this runs so let me show you what this
looks like in practice
okay here is the Vista state service
demo so we're going to reload this page
and click go and we're going to send
some data through the system so this
will be querying Flickr and kicking off
the whole run of functions and indeed we
now see some functions coming through
the system the first function to be
invoked is the detect plates function
and the next one will be the draw
function and while that's running
ultimately our goal is to get to the
alert Java function and we can see but
we don't have any tweets sent out just
yet on this run but we have been running
this demo for a while you can also see
here the progress of the functions
flowing through the system here you can
see how many milliseconds it took for
each of the different phases and we have
a tag map here that will include the
license plate data the you know the
state for which the license plate
belongs getting our C and some drawers
come along
and we should eventually get next to the
clerk potentially if we notice here we
have 27 plate matches by state so far so
we should expect this number to increase
as more plates are detected and flow
through the system and while that's
running let's take a look at the Java
code for the alert service alert job so
this is an example of a Java based
function and the function is a service
platform it's just a simple Java class
and it has a handle request method which
is the one that's invoked by the
function service and when this method is
invoked we get the JSON and we pull out
the alert cloud map and we do a number
of manipulations on it there you saw
that one it went up from 27 to 28 so the
state service is interacted with in this
application by virtue of this number of
properties but the state filter here you
can put in a regular expression that
will only tweak through things that
match a certain state for example and
you can also have another service that
will filter out duplicates if you don't
want to see those okay now we went up to
29 so if we go back to the graph we
should expect to see some alerts on
there there's the two and we should also
reload the Twitter and we should expect
to see some tweets in there there are
okay 35 seconds ago and 53 seconds ago
and another pattern that I wanted to
show which was similar to the to-do demo
that I did is how you get the cloud map
so you have state service endpoint which
again is a remote in this case it's
remote running in the cloud and we're
saying endpoint session create endpoint
of and then we have a number of
different maps the simple to do app had
just one this one has quite a few and
the one I want to focus on next is this
request progress map this is how the
progress bar is drawn and how this table
is populated with data here so we have
two services the alert Java interacts
with this by putting some data in it
updating the progress so it's calling
the invoke method which sends this
function over to the server to run so
let's look at what that looks like
update progress this is a cloud function
that we're serializing and setting so
this code runs on the server side and
again if we wanted to deal with code
deployment that was outside of just this
lambda you can interact with maven
artifacts that you've previously
deployed to the cloud service and the
other service I wanted to show is the
progress update service this one also
interacts with the cloud map request
progress cloud map it also has an update
progress method which is kind of similar
in fact it could be shared between the
two different services but we haven't
done that yet okay and you've got three
more tweets let's just reload
Twitter is being a little slow too okay
actually they didn't give us anymore yet
so well that's enough it gets the point
across to summarize the serverless state
service is infinitely scalable it's
resilient continuously available it has
that map based continuously ubiquitous
he understood burning model data local
processing and pay-as-you-go so
hopefully it's coming to a cloud near
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
