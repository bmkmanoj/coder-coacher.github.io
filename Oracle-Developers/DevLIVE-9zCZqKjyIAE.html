don't care about me being here
runnin now he cannot hear you're right
we are always ready always ready yes
starting okay so welcome to the dev live
here at Oracle OpenWorld I'm your host
job at Mohammed with the Oracle
developer community formerly known as
OTN and I have as my guest today Baruch
from Jake J frog but haven't been on the
same stage for what like half a year yes
something like that
but I think last time was in Austin I
think DC yeah but thank you so much for
coming oh absolutely that's Java one I
couldn't miss it's now with or with or
go together
which makes it twice as fun yes right
and half the exercise going between the
venues oh yeah no we're gonna have some
talks on the gel one side and I have
some dogs on Oracle code side is good
and one in developer relations as well
okay so I thought because my focus area
is DevOps and that's kind of near and
dear to my heart as it is to yours it is
what's this carry CalPERS help us and
the audience kind of come up to speed
where are we at in the world of DevOps
and then we're kind of get into like
what J frog does in that space yeah so
and DevOps is maturing right he's not
and the innovators only it's not the
early adopters only it's not a radical
idea it starts to get into mainstream
and that brings of course the pros and
cons as it usually does because the term
got commoditized in some ways and it
changes its meaning and now everybody
that have a Jenkins server say we do
DevOps now mm-hmm
right which which and then there are
some weird concepts of DevOps engineers
which are just no no the system
administrator
you've got rebranded to make their
position look sexier but regardless of
all that regardless of the downside of
the communitisation and being popular
DevOps is going mainstream as it should
the only important or companies are up
so when you talk about going mainstream
are we talking about not only having the
continuous integration continuous
deployment kind of a pipeline but it's
getting deployed in a production
environment is as opposed to in a tester
kind of setting is that what you mean by
means yeah that's that's one of the
that's one of the steps to maturity
right I I'm talking about more companies
doing that different companies doing
that those who are maybe early early
majority now early adopters kind of
going early adopters and companies that
wouldn't jump on this unclear bandwagon
before now feel more comfortable doing
it and that's because we now have proof
that DevOps adopted correctly inside the
organization's allow companies to
release faster and with better quality
and that's what everybody want right
every company in the world now a
software company and all of them want to
release their software faster more
stable and with better quality and
that's the promise of DevOps that now we
can we see companies actually manage to
deliver and then the more cautious
companies the bigger companies the more
enterprise-e
side of the house and play with it first
and development environment then might
be incorporating some parts of
continuous integration going to staging
when automatic manner and continuous
delivery and also going all the way to
production in some example and of time
later or sooner in some point of time
all right
so tomorrow I'm gonna meet Patrick the
boy yep the file The Godfather of DevOps
what do you think this is kind of
happening live so what do you think
would if you had a chance to meet and
I'm sure you probably have what what do
you think from an our audience
perspective what kind of questions
should I
be asking him because I'm a little
nervous so I would say I would say the
intern I've never met a godfather by the
way didn't you man james gosling i have
done i have heard of him but i've never
met him okay so yeah we need to find him
I guess he somewhere here okay then you
will meet two Godfather's in one event
so Patrick he is perspective of what
changed it's very interesting you're
going to ask him how this vision of
DevOps changed from when he envisioned
it six years ago what what it is notice
now it's fascinating to see how their
adoption changed the concept correct
right for example aspects that weren't
there in the beginning like QA and
security are now a part of DevOps and
their kind
inside inside it building into it right
and and the other question that I also
love his answer is what what's next
right what do you think to happen to
this baby of yours that now went to
college what's next what do you what do
you think where it is going so those two
perspectives back on the journey that
DevOps made and in the future that it's
about to me I think Patrick is one of
the best people to ask and his
perspective is the most interesting okay
well thank you so much so let's kind of
bring it even closer to home
how does Jay frogface fit into the
picture of DevOps what do you guys do
and you wanna you wanna key can give a
little pitch here yeah so I'll try to
make it not very peachy for him Jeff ROC
we were helping companies release faster
even before DevOps was a thing right the
artifact repository manager that we
started number of years ago and keep
innovating and delivering and on it is
about how you how can you release with
more confidence and this is critical the
confidence concept it's critical to the
velocity of the release because when you
have trust in your software and I'm not
talking about secure
I'm talking about generally knowing
what's going on in your pipeline this is
where you go faster security is a part
of it and and and just other metadata
like what dependencies did you use or or
what's inside your components is another
part of it and additional metadata
builds more trust into the software and
in your process and when you have
process you can trust you can release
faster and that's what else is about so
we're from the day one our tools are
completely scriptable in terms of REST
API in terms of CLI a.m. tools in terms
of plug ability so we make it extensible
and scriptable so it can fit in this
devops pipeline so it can be a span of
automatically managed automatically so
the software can flow through this pipe
when you build this pipeline
automatically and then actually making
software updates so frequent so easy in
so confident that it looks like flow and
the software becomes liquid it always
comes through those pipelines from
development to production to devices to
end-user constantly like a flow of like
I think you've encapsulated it very well
and I think I think I'm promising my
time is probably up here but it's always
interesting having you on stage thank
you so much for coming down and for any
of the viewers who are out there come
and check us out on open world here in
the developer lounge or in the jay frog
booth which is right across from us we
have cool t-shirts he's a cool guy thank
you for dropping by thank you again
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
