technology Network welcome to Oracle
code our developer event here in Austin
and I'm here with Gerry ward he is one
of our participating companies and
sponsors of our tour viscosity hey Jerry
how you doing today
great thank you for having us tell me a
little bit about what you're working on
because I know viscosity because you
have a couple of Oracle eighth and a
sectors that work there and and so I
know bit Minh Charles and they are very
active with the Oracle cloud initiative
but tell me a little bit about what
you're doing with viscosity you're a
developer I'm a developer that's right
so you know I don't really get into the
installation and the administration of
things but I love building things and we
have a team there of about twenty-five
folks about half of our company is
dedicated to development I'm based right
here in Austin so thank you for coming
here and but yeah we do development
usually Oracle is a big part of that
either at the database or all the way up
from infrastructure to platform to
software as a service and we also do
open source and we connect open source
to Oracle Wow now so tell me about some
of your application development
environment I mean we were talking
earlier about some of the low code apps
development environments and tools that
you're using you were talking about apex
5.1 and
some of the cool stuff you're working
with there exactly what's your
impression of just the productivity that
Oracle stack brings for the developers
well I mean the best part about apex is
that it's free no option costs of the
database and recently there's been a lot
of traction in the industry among low
code platforms low code environments
there's been a lot of investment in that
area and people are starting to talk
about low code and Oracle has had this
platform embedded in the database for
over ten years and we've been using it
so I think really Oracle has a distinct
advantage in loko we're able to develop
applications in days or weeks and not
months and years we're able to do things
very quickly for our customers at a low
cost we're able to hand the application
over to our customers when we're done
and they can support it and extend it
that's really hard to do and in other
platforms so we're going to do a quick
shout out for David beep hey David hey
David about apex right now so what's
your favorite thing that we've put into
apex and what are you waiting for I've
been waiting for the Gribbs real excited
to see the good work that they're doing
there my favorite thing in Apex is the
idea that you can develop administer and
deploy with all in the same browser
window yeah exactly all right they're in
the same environment exactly and you
were talking a little bit about using
Oracle Jeff as well exactly so we've for
some of our more advanced options we've
included angular and other open source
libraries Exe jf Sencha and finally
oracle has brought a really robust
javascript framework and by using jet
when we extend Apex it looks like the
rest of Oracle's products that or the
SAS products HCM cloud sales cloud so we
can build applications that extend
or even standalone applications that
look and behave like the rest of
worthless products you've got a very
demanding marketplace because you're in
the healthcare industry right one of our
biggest verticals is healthcare and we
actually have some commercial software
that we've developed our clients to send
over 1,400 hospitals Wow so you know it
seems like you have to work within you
know these constraints in order to get
of the data in you can what is
consumable data given that vertical
space and having the right tools to
bring in and ingest the data and then
present the data it's probably not as
easy as it sounds right in healthcare
it's extremely interesting because on
the clinical side the systems that the
doctors use that data is largely
unstructured just as if you had a
handwritten doctor's chart that's the
way the data is entered it's entered
without any kind of validation epic and
Cerner they've built their systems
around this concept on the supply chain
side where we do a lot of work as well
it is more structured but what we've
done is we've built a universal data
model for healthcare that marries up
supply chain and clinical so that we can
do things like find the best cost for
products find the best care and the
efficacy of care for for patients so how
about the cloud are you developing on
the cloud I mean you've mentioned apex
and of course with Apex you're basically
on the cloud but do you develop on the
cloud and are your customers to point in
the cloud or you know how is that
working into your your world exactly so
almost every customer we start a project
where we prototype it in the Oracle
cloud we use Oracle cloud extensively at
discuss 'ti database as a service
platform as a service offerings and will
typically go in through a development
cycle
and we'll have those discussions after
we're well into the project and most of
the applications been built in the cloud
and then we may deploy on premise or in
the cloud some of our medium-sized
customers Texas de Brazil for example
their application runs entirely in the
cloud and they're basically a cloud
first customers so Wow Wow
well so what are you working on right
now I mean there you got a cool
application that's sitting at home
waiting for you to get back in code on
it some more yeah we just got back two
weeks ago we were at the healthcare
information management conference the
largest IT conference and health care in
the world
and we got a lot of great ideas and
we've got some integration to do with
clinical systems and we've got a product
to build and and post in the Oracle
cloud okay so now I have to ask if I
asked everybody that's what is the first
application you ever built it was a
blackjack game a blackjack yeah I wrote
it in did you do Pascal turbo Pascal
yeah did it in college
I stayed up that was the first time I
ever stayed up for 72 hours without
sleeping too much with it I I think I
think I won with it so I use it to
practice do you think that if we booted
it up today it would work it would work
I'm sure that it would work you just
have to find a das window to run it as
oh oh that's great well thank you so
much for joining us Gerry as Doreen it's
always great to talk with folks at
viscosity so and hopefully we'll see you
tomorrow of the cities later in the year
I think let's let's talk again OD tug
it's instant in San Antonio okay coming
up this summer it's just a mile or an
hour south of my house so oh great it
will
a load attack itself shoutout to OD talk
here to target all right thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
