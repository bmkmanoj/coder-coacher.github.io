talk to you about kind of help you get
started with property graphs running in
the Oracle database it starts with the
intro remarks if people walk in during
it that's fine so we can go ahead and
get started and make maximum use of our
time here also I'll mention I have some
literature here in case you're
interested in more stuff including got
some nice magnets that you can put on
your whiteboard with analytic poetry so
if you want one of those kits for an
elated poetry words like analyze
statistic protect bacon things like that
we have those available for you anyway
my name is Dan valannus with the lamo
software solutions have founded over 25
years ago we've developed all sorts of
bi and analytics systems also now
working as you'll see with the property
graphs in the oracle database
we specialize in enterprise bi analytic
warehousing data mining predictive
analytics and data visualization indeed
I'm an author along with my brother on a
book on data visualization for Oracle
business intelligence and have worked
long time in the industry as well I came
from a company that was bought by Oracle
for IRI and I'm an Oracle ace director
and I'll mention also a be-what board
member there's a conference we're
putting on I'll plug at the end that I'm
actually the conference director for the
called the analytics and data summit
taking place just on March 20 through 22
if you're interested in these types of
topics you'd love that type of
conference just taking place at Oracle
headquarters all right so today just
getting into this I'm going to start out
and show a quick demo by the way I'm
giving live demos so hopefully the demo
gods I did give an offering just before
the session started to try and help out
the odds of a good demo on this but
we'll do that quick demo of what you can
do with property grab
and then I'm gonna give a little bit of
background on going through how you can
use property graphs in the Oracle
database some of the background if
you're not familiar with it try and
catch you up to speed but the whole goal
is to show you how you can get started
with using property graphs in the Oracle
database and go I'll go through those
steps indeed there's a blog entry than a
colleague of mine Arthur Dayton wrote up
and it's in the PowerPoint presentation
I'm not sure how they're distributing
the slides they're also available on our
website but you can download and there's
a blog entry that goes through in detail
how to get started with a virtual
machine so you can go through and do all
of this that I'm showing then really the
the majority then is this demo of using
property graphs using some open software
called cytoscape is what I'll be using
to visualize those property graphs and
then we'll talk about some X next step
so you can use some resources that you
can use to get started with that and how
you can join the analytics and data
summit conference and some resources by
the way I'll give a quick plug in case
people walk out before Z is from Z was
from Oracle from the development
organization he'll be speaking later on
this afternoon and I'm sure either one
of us would love to talk to you more
about what you can do with the graphs
and more details and I'm kind of
standing on some of the stuff that Z and
his group has developed so with that let
me just give you an introduction before
going into that I don't know if you guys
have been in those yeah we're gonna give
you a framework what you're going to
learn and all these PowerPoint slides go
on I like to show kind of the stuff up
front to see why you would care so let
me just start out with a quick
demonstration of what this stuff looks
like with property graphs so I'm zoomed
in at this point this is a property
graph of you'll see individuals and how
they relate in an organization and so at
this point this is a hierarchical view
of what's traditionally an org chart and
in that I can see individual nodes which
are basically people and
then relationships between those nodes
so let me try and get a sense of the
audience all right how many people here
are familiar with network graphs RDF
graphs the concept of a graph of a
relationship of various entities and
links between those entities with which
of these edges that you see if you if i
zoom in and up you can see that those
people are managed by den Rafa Li and
cons how many people familiar with this
concept of links and nodes and edges
okay so people have seen this type of
stuff this is classic computer science
theory type stuff that I learned in
school this is the type of stuff that we
can do now and the graph is actually
stored in the Oracle database and we're
getting this data from there populating
the graph and then visualizing it
running in a virtual machine I'm writing
something called cytoscape in inside
this window to look at that if I load
some other visualizations of this let me
just show you and just trying to load
some previous things that we've looked
at if I look at this here's another look
at a bunch of relationships between all
of these different types of people and
how they interrelate with each other
we'll go through some typical examples
of why you'd care about this type of
stuff but these graphs this is just an
example blow-up of this very complex
graph this could be terrorist networks
that you're looking at how these people
are related they could have departments
they work for companies they work for
all those types of relationships and by
visualizing this type of data in this
mechanism you can have insights that
really no other visualization provides
this type of visualization for this and
in come uncover insights that you
otherwise would not have okay so that's
my quick intro of just what these things
are let me give some background then on
why you might care about this stuff and
how you might apply it and how this
applies
all right so that's my quick little demo
there are two graph models that are
built into then the Oracle database on
this and a lot of people don't realize
they unload soft with the unload data
from other types of environments just so
they can do this type of analysis and
they don't realize that a lot of this is
built into the software that they've
been using for years and years and years
two of the things in there right now
different types of graphs are a property
graph model I'll go through it's
typically seen as a simpler model to
work with and it's relatively new in the
Oracle database we've got this property
graph model often used for social
network type of analysis looking at
things algorithms like path analytics
shortest paths that type of thing or
social network analysis the different
entity analytics looking at individual
nodes or entities on a diagram often
used in financial industries retail
marketing social media how are people
related to each other smart
manufacturing that type of thing is your
typical uses of property graphs there's
also a RDF data model that's built-in as
well for things like a link to data
Semantic Web type things for data
Federation representing knowledge in
they're often used in places like Life
Sciences healthcare publishing finance
again all those types of things so there
are many different uses of this type of
data and you'll see how we can transform
from one set of data to the other set of
data I'm going to give an example of
that all right so then some of the
looking at Oracle as a graph database
some of the features of it it provides
for a lot of scalability and performance
because you're running on basically one
of the reasons is you're running on a
big server it is designed for just like
Oracle database has always done you know
page things in and out of memory you're
not limited by the memory size that type
of thing you're yeah it's designed for
scalability and performance you can do
the graph
analytics in here visualized the graphs
on there and there is a graph query
language we'll talk about that later on
there are also some standard interfaces
this is being done in a concert with
other bodies that are developing
standards on how to develop these types
of query languages and then there's also
integration with machine learning type
tools looking at this so some of the
things that you can do are things like
identify your influencers yet when
you're looking at a diagram of the data
if you are visualizing the data with how
many links are from a given node you can
find out who the influencers in your
organization are some of the examples
are things like if you are looking at
examples of data of who the knowledge
workers in our automotive manufacturing
plant if we look at the various emails
that are sent back and forth amongst the
technicians what technician is
responsible for most of the successes
when we are able to solve a problem
these are the types of things you can do
with graph analytics you can discover
patterns in Big Data and look at you
know the clusters that naturally form in
your data you can also use it for doing
things like generating recommendations
so a recommendation engine can often be
looked at as a graph if you like these
types of things we think you might like
this this is the type of thing you can
do by looking at a graph and as I
mentioned Z is going to get into more of
the application he's going to talk about
this especially in regards to blockchain
and how you use it with that but we'll
probably talk about more examples of
uses of this so some of the use case
scenarios include something like in a
finance looking at customer 360 type of
analysis things like fraud detection
look at how people are linked to each
other are their transactions that are
taking place that are really frankly
money long money laundering it's it's
easy to tell if it's just a
person situation but what if there's a
ring of transactions that end up
happening how do you analyze that in a
graph it shows up in public sector you
can look at things like tax evasion or
crime network analysis whose really
related to whom or who talks to whom a
natural way of looking at this is via
telephone calls each link between two
people would be potentially a phone call
and you see how those people are related
in retail you might look at
recommendations sentiment analysis this
type of thing or in manufacturing a
complex bill of materials look at those
types of things via a graph so the let's
dive into this a little bit I'll show
you how to get started in just a little
bit but here's what the property graph
data model looks like I might have these
nodes and the nodes are signified in
here as those circles that you see that
right now are known by their node ID or
their number that this is on so this is
node number 1 this is load number 3 6
and so forth then you might have
associated with each node you have
various properties and so you can see in
green the properties of for instance
node 1 there's a property called name
and that is the Marko node and I might
have for instance what Marcos ages sort
of the property of that person of what
their ages and you can display it on the
graph or hide that on the graph and then
do analytics on those types of things
and exception analysis and all that
based on those types of properties
everybody with me so far all right
then each of those nodes then can be
linked to other nodes via a set of edges
or links all right so each one has an
in-out there are arrows that are
indicating that for instance Marco
created in this case ello P all right
and the language in Java so you could
have entities that they don't have to be
the same type of thing you can have
different types
of vertices or nodes different types of
entities and so node number one created
node number three you can also have a
relationship between node 1 and down
here onload for and I can have that
Marco knows Josh okay as an example and
then for each of these links or edges
you can have a weight that's applied or
various properties of those edges all
right so that defines the relationship
between these different things and it's
a way of looking at your data to try and
figure out how do we best best visualize
that type of data all right so then how
do we relate this then I'm assuming most
people here are familiar with a
relational data model after all you're
in an event called Oracle code so you
probably have some familiarity I'm
guessing with Oracle and maybe the
Oracle database so you have a relational
model looking at the differences between
that versus a graph model in a
relational model you have tables with
things like people a code of 12 and
there might be Tom and then you might
have departments that have numbers such
as 1:42 and 1:45 various departments
therein and then you might have another
table with the various memberships that
says that tom is a member of all of
these different departments and then
these memberships are a way of defining
if you will those edges in a table
lookup you'll see how we did this in
loading this just as a quick getting
started example so let me show you then
a little bit of the architecture of what
this looks like so the property graphs
support that's in Oracle at the bottom
let me start down at the bottom you have
the our Oracle relational database
management system oracle rdb a mess by
the way it could also be in an Apache
HBase or no sequel database and there's
something called Oracle Big Data graph
coming out where you store instead
things on the Oracle database you store
it in
dead on the on the Big Data machine on a
Big Data machine really kind of if
you're choosing then you have a graph
data access layer that accesses all of
that data very via various Java API is
JDBC sequel peel sequel you should we'll
show you some examples of that and then
at the top you typically have graph
analytics that are looking at things
with the in-memory graphs looking at the
data via this language called PGX we'll
show you examples of that it's a
language that's being proposed by Oracle
as a standard by that then off to the
side we have rest Web Services and
notebook technology that then can get at
the data via Java groovy Python
something like that and then you have
various property graph formats and graph
ml GML graphs on and flat files but this
is what you're looking at when you're
looking at property graphs in the Oracle
database some of the things then
cytoscape which is the example that i'll
use it's not the only type of graph
visualization property graph
visualization software there are others
as well is accessing via the graph
analytics and goes down and gets at the
data through the data access layer so
then what does that look like when
you're visualizing your property graphs
with cytoscape cytoscape then supports
property graphs you just download it
will give you an example of that it
connects to the Oracle database or
there's no sequel database or at Pachi
HBase and then it has built into it all
sorts of different algorithms including
things like PageRank clustering shortest
paths how do I get from one node to
another those types of things and it
provides an alternative to having to do
everything via command line trying to
get at this via in-memory analytics or
and you have to first have the base
graph created so the thing that I'll
tell you I ran into in preparing for
this presentation was I want to show all
this stuff in cytoscape I worked with
another guy in my team by the name of
Arthur and Arthur actually created
trips that I'm showing you he's the one
that put together the blog entry and my
challenge was I just wanted to play with
the fool graph it's cool stuff right how
do I have at least some data I can play
with and this the purpose of the blog
entry that Arthur wrote plus what I'm
presenting today is to try to give you a
sense of this is how you can play with
this stuff too and once you start
looking at it you'll say oh you see all
sorts of opportunities for using
property graphs in the type of analytics
you may need to do for your company so
some of the examples of what you can do
with PG QL is look at pattern matching
it has an SQL type like syntax but
there's a graph this pattern description
and you can access the various
properties it's designed for interactive
and real-time analysis it supports
aggregations comparisons min max order
by group bys all these types of things
that you would especially want to do are
built into PG QL you can also find
patterns and graphs for things like
fraud detection anomaly detection
extract out a sub graph of this an ties
mentioned that's a proposed standard by
Oracle the specification is available
online on that and whoops has a open
source front-end parser and the
information is a github PG QL language
okay you can look that up the slides by
the way for all of this are available on
our website at the Lambuth calm under
presentations and I think they'll be
available for everybody attending the
conference through the normal mechanisms
for doing that I've submitted them
actually a couple times for getting this
so this is an overview of then how to
start with this it just wanted to give
this to get you guys going the blog
article that details this through where
to get the virtual machine to have some
data that you can play with how to then
transform starting with that virtual
machine into a your own property graph
and then all of the steps that I'm going
to go
through our in this blog entry with that
big long URL it's a blog entry and all
the details are in there so this is what
you end up doing this is the general
approach find some kind of data that
includes some nodes and some
relationships okay in our example we
used a schema how many people here are
familiar with the HR schema that Oracle
has that uses for a lot of examples
people there yeah heard of it okay if
you haven't there's others in your
organization that have its with yeah you
log in with Scott yes password tiger and
then I just started with that because
where Arthur started with that because
it was just easy to start with that you
have employees and employees have
managers and they have relationships
with each others with peers and that
type of thing so you find some kind of
data in some tables then get your
environment set up all right I don't
know about you I hate setting up the
stupid environments so I can do stuff so
I like to start in my case with a
virtual machine that's available for
downloading this one's on Oracle calm
out of tech tech network you just
download this VM or gee I think you
could actually run this on the Oracle
cloud I'm not sure but I'm sure you
could find somebody from Oracle that
would love for you to be able to do that
so anyway take that move it up to the
Oracle cloud or run it on your own
network and then start with that VM
installing eclipse you need some kind of
Java environment at this time in order
to instantiate the the graph I'll give
an example there's a little patch to
install by the way that patch is
detailed in the log it's not in the blog
article it's not a big deal you then
also need to download cytoscape and
cytoscape for oracle apt the cytoscape
for oracle apps so that you can link
cytoscape up to oracle that's all in
just getting the environment set up and
then you can create the views to get the
data into a graph
ready form so that's you know taking
what certain raw relational and
converting it in
to some some views that you can load in
as a graph then you end up using eclipse
too right just a little bit it's just a
little bit of Java code to create your
graph so you do that in our case we used
Eclipse you don't have to use a clip so
you could use whatever environment you
want for writing Java and then then
you're on to running cytoscape and you
can start playing with your graph and
start looking at stuff so let's go ahead
and get into that and I'll show you a
little bit of what that looks like
people got the general approach to all
this all right so let me show you what
this looks like I'm gonna minimize this
and I'm going to just show you around a
little bit this is sequel developer and
this is the schema that we're looking at
I'm gonna go ahead and let me come in
and connect up to this and let me look
at the raw tables that are listed in
here and I'm gonna look at these views
so I've got an employee's view and let
me look at the data behind that this is
a bunch of employees so you can see all
the different employee IDs here's the
names of them in this column I know
probably in the back you can't read them
but trust me there's a bunch of employee
IDs that's what these numbers are and
then these are the names of each one of
those employees then we've got a
department for each one of the each one
of the employees and we've got what
their salary is and who their manager is
and you can see a bunch of these are
managed by Stephen King happens to be
the manager name we've got a hire date
job title and just a manager ID now this
is actually a view that we created off
of the HR data but it could have just as
easily been this is the table you start
with okay we wanted to be able to get
the employee ID and the manager ID and
it's just a lot easier to describe this
stuff if you show the manager name in
here we're just doing a join to get the
manager name and such that's what I mean
by creating a view that then ends up
this is ultimately going to be the node
the list of nodes that we have
all right so then I'm going to come here
and look at this employee relation so
this relation is between individual
nodes remember you saw the circles and
how they're related to each other you
want to be able to say this guy manages
this so this is then a list of node a
list of edges that then have this
relation ID and all we did you know
there's no rocket science behind this
all we did was slam the source with the
destination concatenate them together
and so I have a relation ID of 100 102
is from 100 to 102 okay that's the edge
between those two and we've gone ahead
and described some managed edges and
then we also while we are at it we
describe some colleague edges so these
are two employees that are colleagues of
each other right you can do that through
joins my purpose is not to show you how
you can do that type of view my purpose
is to get into the property graph stuff
so I'm not going to dwell on this
portion of this all we need is some data
to load everybody with me so far alright
so and as I said all the details are in
the blog entry that goes through all of
this so now let me come out of a sequel
developer and see what do we do with
this thing once we have it all right so
I've created these views you can look at
the view description I'm not going to go
into that because it's kind of boring
it's not the exciting stuff all right so
now we need to get that into a property
graph so I'm going to show you the Java
that we wrote in order to create that
you just need a connection here's the
oracle connection and then you know
there's a bunch of things in here and
this is by the way right out of the
documentation in order to create this
type of stuff this is not stuff we'll
all we had to do is fill in the name of
our instance as opposed to the one that
comes out of the documentation and such
and then we just define a bunch of
attributes and a column to attribute
mapping here's my full name I'm going to
map that to something called name
I'm gonna take the column called
Department name and call it depth all
this type of stuff you end up doing in
Java and then this defines my vertexes
and my graph configuration that I'm
doing as I go through this all right and
then ultimately we load load the graph
with the files that's all this is and
down here load and create and
instantiate a property graph so all
we're doing is creating this thing in
Java so that we can have a property
graph that we can then query like I said
the details on what the code looks like
is all in the example so let me let me
then go ahead and show through then what
what we can do with this now that we've
loaded people familiar with oh by the
way yeah I would not be surprised if the
ability to then create a property graph
starts being added in other tools that
Oracle has out right now you road run a
java application to create this would
not surprise me if they make it a little
easier in the future you all are in the
forefront of this so you know dust off
the Java book you can do it that's why
when we created it we called it you can
do it it's not that hard that's the name
of our Java program so then what does
that look like once I create it so now
I'm connected with cytoscape so then I'm
gonna go ahead and create a connection
in here and show you what that's like so
this is cytoscape itself I'm gonna load
a property graph and I'm going to
connect to an Oracle database this is
the type of connection I have when I
created this whoops I forgot to show
that all right so the name of the graph
is third underbar PG guess how many
times we tried this to get this to work
this is our third try trying this stuff
as we were going through it all right
and this is where we set the name of
this and the password all that type of
stuff
not very super-secret on here all right
so I'm gonna say I want to create I want
to connect up to this graph using Scott
and I'm going to start from a PG QL
query so here's my JDBC
- URL this is I'm going to connect up
and I'm going to go ahead and type in
and this is the P gql language all right
and I'm going to select this is the
syntax that you use for PG QL you select
what you want and what you call this is
actually not that important what's
important and you can't see it very well
here let me try and do this
it's a little bigger because I think you
do want to see this see this select in
comma Y comma T whoops where paren s a /
n E - then those are in brackets E
that's what defines an edge points to it
then T those things define what I'm
going to call it but what's important is
the syntactic elements with the grammar
that's in there all right so I'm going
to go ahead and select that and actually
I want to make this a little simpler so
I'm gonna actually only look at manage
edge alright so I'm going to specify
select n E and T we're in connected up
to the edge just the manage edge so I'm
specifying that points to T and I'm
gonna go ahead and
want magnify this guy all right and go
ahead and execute that and that is going
to execute this query and load it into
cytoscape so here it loads and this is
what the result of that query looks like
all right if I come in you can see I've
got various nodes and one of the things
I wanted to point out is actually from
just the base way this is displayed can
anybody tell where the where the root
node is becomes very obvious when you
look at things via a graph right it's
this one in the center I can come in
here and I can also specify various
properties perhaps I want to instead of
looking at things via in the vertices
via their default ID I want to look at a
property label and I want to label it
with the name
so now when I I said I want to label it
with the name all right then apply those
changes and now when i zoom into this
guy so let's keep our eye on that guy in
the middle is that guy Stephen King all
right and so I can see all the people
that Stephen King manages and it
arranges it out on the screen and what
you've got built into cytoscape and my
goal here by the way was not to sell you
all on how great cytoscape is it's to
introduce you to this concept of
property graphs and what you can do with
them but now when I look at sighted
cytoscape I have a front-end that is
designed for manipulating and
transversing through this property graph
and display interesting information
about that property graph so I can come
in here change things like look at the
property I can filter down to just those
where salary and mind you I'm just
getting started with this stuff but you
know where the salary is greater than
three thousand three hundred let's say
something like that apply those changes
and then that will filter down to just
those parts of it I'll get everything in
this case I can also color code let me
show you some examples that I've gone
ahead and created for here if you look
at this here's one where we're using
yeah I don't care about this all right
so now this is looking at built into the
cytoscape app is the ability to have all
sorts of layout options and do things
like this says circular layout alright
or a hierarchical layout alright
developed by Y files are Gornick organic
layout all these different types of ways
of looking at the data filtering it
through looking at for instance color
coding by Department all of that is this
is a visualization tool designed for
looking at graph data so now when we
look at stuff hierarchically and zoom
into this I can see what the org chart
looks like right as kind of an org chart
so I can see down here this is what
Nancy Greenberg has these people that
she's managing what it looks like so you
can see you know employee relationships
is a natural way of looking at those
types of things let me show you some
other examples if I come in here and
look at this by all sessions in here and
look at this is all of the relationships
and one of those show in here is the
natural clusters that happen in an
organization as you look at this you can
see this is a series of people that are
related to each other and once you start
looking at things with graphing
analytics you'll find the natural
combinations in your data in how they're
related to each other and how you can
see stuff so now I can change what nodes
and and this is also manipulation area I
can come in here and look at for each
one of those I can diffuse edit look at
the
references for each one of these add
various networks extract out portion of
the graphs all that type of stuff look
at various properties of each one of
these alright so as we come in here I
can look at each one of these properties
depending on what you've loaded in let
me show you some other examples in here
whoops that's the same one that I showed
before
so now when I'm color coding these if
you look at a circular more layout you
can see how these individual nodes
relate to each other look at the various
departments all sorts of stuff like that
so that's what then down here you can
see the edge table this is the list of
edges network table and frankly I'll
tell you I am NOT a cytoscape guy I just
picked this up just a couple weeks ago
before preparing for this presentation
so it's not like I'm all into this I
just wanted to show you all how to get
started now let me ask anybody in here
specifically used this stuff and you
know is all over this and why isn't he
showing how to do the such-and-such
there's some cool features of cytoscape
okay well anyway you're welcome to come
on up afterwards and we'll work with the
graph together
I just wanted to basically especially
give you a way to start with that and I
want to be able to leave some time for
questions that's the whole goal is just
how to get started with looking at
things with graphs a couple of things I
want to mention I mentioned before a
conference if you're into this stuff you
may be interested in something called
the analytics and data summit it takes
place just later in March March 20
through 22 you can go to analytics and
data summit org there's information on
there by the way if you're serious about
this let me know I've got cards be happy
to give you a discount code that you can
use to get there's one coming out I run
the conference so I know when the
discount codes are coming out okay so
see me if you're interested be happy to
send you more of that there's one coming
out to give people a discount based on
the Saint Patrick's Day
so come and join us
there is a special we join with the the
spatial and graph special interest group
and they're putting on all sorts of ten
different graphs sessions 24 spatial and
graph sessions all in a three day
conference out at Oracle headquarters
there's they running before that is a
graph developer training day if you're
really interested this is a full day
just on graphs
full-day workshop free to talk to people
at the Oracle product team it's targeted
towards developers architects and so
forth here's an it where you can add
agenda again the slides will be
available and you can say hey I'd really
like to attend that and learn more about
that I got exposed at Oracle code and
want to learn more there's a bunch of
great resources on this this is what I
use to put together the presentation so
there's a spatial and graph Big Data
spatial and graph on OTN various white
papers software downloads the blog
articles on here in blogs Oracle comm /
Oracle spatial or again this is that
same URL that tells you how to get
started there's also a Big Data light
virtual machine you can get started with
and there's a hands-on lab that's
included in there all the resources in
the spatial and graph sig user group and
there's also every month or having asked
Tom office hours where you can learn
you see demos more frankly if this just
scratched the surface you want to see
more examples of use cases you can go
out to the ask Tom office hours and see
that and ask questions in there also see
if you wouldn't mind wave your hand Z is
going to be presenting afterwards at
4:20 on analyzing blockchain and Bitcoin
transaction data using graphs so going
through in much more detail a specific
use case of using blockchain and Bitcoin
transactions using that if you want to
learn more about volantis comm we've got
this this is the information for Arthur
the put helped me put this together and
my information my email address and
would love for you to tweet to me say
hey I'd like to learn more about this
stuff follow me on LinkedIn that type of
thing and then once again here is that
URL for getting the details behind that
that's what I especially have to present
today I'd love to be able to take
questions and we'll invite Z if he has
other stuff to share with you all with
that as I mentioned I've got cards on
this that I can talk about but let me
try and make sure I
over extended stay my welcome we see if
any questions people have yep
we can
okay so question was what specific
features did I use in order to get the
data ready to be in graphs this is just
simple joins folks know there's no
tricks up the sleeve here if we look at
that if I come into sequel developer and
come back here and look at the employee
relation and look at the details behind
this it's all in here these are the
views that I used create or replace view
employees as select blada t
blah-dee-blah as and then you can see
some we're constructing the name from
the first name and the last name to slam
them together complicated stuff using
concatenation I used Wow some left outer
joins in joins and then some where
clauses all I'm doing is doing that
there's no fancy stuff in here
yeah
yeah so if I what what value did this
does the Oracle database provide in this
the Oracle database is what's providing
the Oracle graph capability and there is
an option in Oracle database called
Oracle spatial and graph and the Oracle
the graph is provided by the Oracle
database this is not a set of other
software you're loading onto your
database server
the graph is created in the Oracle
database see anything else to add to
that I'll put you on the spot sorry I
warned you
so if you couldn't hear people in the
back I'm sure in the Oracle database
they also had some optimizations and
some algorithms such as for instance
shortest path is running in the Oracle
database so the big difference you have
is your big iron that's running your or
your Oracle database is available for
the graph itself and then over time more
and more algorithms when we added I'm
sure in the Oracle database to be able
to do some of those types of traditional
algorithms this is much like if people
have done stuff with data mining whether
it's data mining built into the Oracle
database and cube management that's in
built into the database in memory all
this is in the Oracle database and a lot
of people don't realize it's more than
just a relational store so what I was
trying to show is pulling data from a
relational store but then doing the
analysis and that's what I'm connecting
to is an Oracle database for them all
right I got time for one more question
anybody else some questions yeah go
ahead
what about overlay type of relationships
more than one layers what I heard
you could have individual nodes you can
have different types of relationships
and I think if understanding it's more
like layers much like an architectural
diagram you have an electronics layer
and you I am sorry an electrical in a
plumbing layer and you had the framing
of the of the building all those types
of layers looking at and would think you
could do the same thing with property
graphs where you have individual nodes
each of those could have properties of a
layer that you turn on and off and with
more time and putting together the
environments I could show you how to
expose those layers you can filter that
down and look at individual parts of
that and filter it down if I come in
here and cytoscape and just specify how
many nodes I want to see I can limit
down the nodes I can extract out just
the ones for Department X all that type
of stuff is available you know once you
build the graph now those graphs can be
huge millions of nodes that's where you
start to see the power on that yep
correct there are API calls correct yeah
I'm sorry there
yet there are definitely API calls that
are in there that are going directly to
the Oracle database to do all this and
that's where you're getting a lot of the
power in that the soft yeah cytoscape is
just rendering something the graph
exists in the Oracle database let me
show one one of the thing real quick for
those that are interested in business
intelligence type applications we've
also implemented this is just a bi
dashboard something called Oracle
business intelligence or Oracle
analytics cloud and this is a
implementation of a graph inside a bi
tool looking at this is something called
a force directed graph if you're
interested in more of this type of stuff
I can talk about this this is mostly on
you know property graphs but this is
then running in a bi tool and then each
of these things as I pull them out you
can because they're they have properties
with them force-directed properties
they'll move around as you do that
expand contract all that type of stuff
that you would expect on here so I can
explode each one of these and look at
the data for Eaton multiple departments
and such anyway with that I think I'm
out of time but I'm going to be around
all day zero myself would love to talk
to you more about that come get the
cards for the conference I talked about
or the magnet magnetic poetry take it
back would love to talk to you more
about this
