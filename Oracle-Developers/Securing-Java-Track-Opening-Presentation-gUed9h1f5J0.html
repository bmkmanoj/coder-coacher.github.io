one and our first brand-new securing
Java security track so so just that I
know there's a background that was
provided and on the internet and all
that so I'm my role at there's a lot of
people that are involved in security on
the Java team my role is I am the senior
principal security p.m. which is
basically the the leader for the overall
program but there are a lot of people
that are involved with with Java so my
background is pretty much out
programming probably like a lot of you
folks and then as time transitioned on
got into had some opportunities to get
into security hack hacking apps was
getting kind of popular so that's how I
evolved into it started i joined oracle
from yahoo about a year ago and we've
made a lot of ground since last year
when i spoke last year here at javaone
was pretty pretty new i think i had been
here like three weeks or something like
that and the climate was a little
prickly at the time and we've definitely
made a lot of roads since then in fact
you know this security track now
demonstrates that so we're going to talk
about several different things we'll
just you know kind of talk about the
security track a little bit and some of
the highlights of the security track and
you know things that we think are
interesting that you'll find interesting
in the track I think I have kind of the
good job here as far as all the
presenters because I just get to talk
about everybody else's highlights so I
think that's kind of cool remediation so
you know so beyond the security track
it's also a good opportunity at the
track opening to talk about things that
we've been doing in Java so you know
what are the things that we've been
working on you know bug fixing and new
features and things like that that you
want to know about as well as you know
some of the different outreach efforts
we've been involved in okay so how did
the security track evolve well last year
when I came aboard you know I I was
asked to you to present for java one it
was kind of last minute and I wasn't
really sure you know when I put this
presentation together well what are
people interested in and there just
wasn't any good place to submit my talk
to I thought well core technologies you
know there's a lot of stuff there it
just wasn't a good fit so so I took a
look at some of the other thing is i sat
in on different sessions that were on
security at the at the conference last
year and I noticed there was a lot of
sessions to sit in on and and so
security was important not only for
Oracle people working on security but
it's important to everybody in java and
java community and what do we need to do
to be secure and like an open source
projects there was so many things going
on so so because of the interest and you
know it's really unclear where security
content belonged and our desire for
outreach a lot of different things you
know we I approached the conference team
and said hey you know we've got a lot of
security content out there we're doing
these things anyway why don't we call it
what it is let's call it security and so
so you know we kind of thought about it
went back and forth and the answer was
yeah let's do that as long as you wanted
to lead the track it's okay I'm not
really sure what leading a track is all
about I'm more of a you know hand
computer tech guy but you know I'll give
it a shot see what happens so then I
started thinking about the track and you
know what we're what were our goal here
is really about education and teaching
people that do java programming the kind
of things that they need to know about
security and features and things that
we're doing how to be defensive so
that's where I started thinking okay
well how can I don't want to turn
security track into black hat so you
know
how do we how do we you know frame that
and so I kind of tried to to do the
wording for the track to just instill in
people that its defensive we're we're
educating that's our job here and and we
value offensive conferences that like to
you know tear things up and break things
but you know really the whole purpose of
what we're doing here is to build and
defend so since then we had a lot of a
lot of support we've had double the
submissions this year from from last
year so early indicators are that
there's even more interest now that
people understand what we're doing here
so I think it was my you know initial
impression was even better than you know
I could have hoped for there's actually
been some talk about you know where do
we go from here you know do we javaone
is is held in different countries and do
we do we do the same thing there and and
that sort of things I've been trying to
kind of hold back the torrent there and
just say you know let's just let's just
start you know let's build some success
here let's see how it goes see what
people think and then you know we'll
decide if we're going to do something
else so this right here is the track
leadership so over here on the left is
the team that helped me to review papers
and things like that so i'm gonna i know
i don't want to embarrass people but i
know a few years so if you would stand
up please Sean anybody else anybody else
here all right so anyway I just wanted
to acknowledge folks a lot of folks work
pretty hard to put this together the
program committee is on the left these
are the guys that are really in charge
of the entire conference and and and the
approval that even have it happen I you
know I'm not really in charge of writing
the checks for the event hear anything
like that more of a tech guy but you
know my impression is it's a pretty big
investment to have a number of sessions
allocated to security so I'm pretty
happy about that so thank you very much
to Sherratt and Steve
for making this possible and for the
program committee as well thanks okay so
with that I wanted to kind of call out
some of the session highlights wow I'm
going to have to really speed things up
I see it's my fighting time so these are
some of this I tried to break up the
session highlights into things that the
community is doing that you might want
to be aware of that are probably kind of
interesting and then things that Oracle
employees are doing kind of balance the
bull but we've got some presenters here
we've got some Frank Kim who has done
some work for sans institute which has a
lot of security training he's going to
be doing a session here on rest anatomy
of a zero-day exploit by Davis loboda
he's academic from Carnegie Mellon and
he's going to be kind of picking apart
java and so you can see what a real what
does an exploit look like what did you
know what do these codes look like and
how does it all work and so I think that
would be interesting to to developers
don't be that security guy Marcus is
he's a pretty good speaker I think he'll
have a very interesting session there so
we've got scaling web security by
Michael coats he's the security
assurance lead from Mozilla and the
OWASP president and so for those that
don't know or wasp is a group of
security practitioners and michelson
president top 10 defenses for web
applications by Jim Monaco he's a VP of
security architecture of white hat and
also holds one of the chairs I know wasp
also we're doing an expert panel I'm
sitting on that panel as well I'm
calling a community I'm filing it under
community here because there's others on
there too that I think folks non Oracle
employees that folks would want to ask
some questions from Oracle session
highlights one year of security
enhancements so my partner Aurelio is
going to be presenting their will
kind of come back to that later in the
discussion but I really want to
highlight that we're going to be talking
I'm really flying through a lot of these
I think I'm echoing here I'm really
going to fly through a lot of these
things kind of fascinating features and
things like that but it really is kind
of deep dive into some of it so I really
encourage you guys to check that out
meet the java SE security libraries team
Brad wetmore is going to be hosting that
and those are the the techies that
actually write the API so if you got
some you know deep questions that you'd
like to ask about crypto or any of those
things they can get them answered for
you building in security through secure
development so surely an stern's going
to be hosting that you know if you've
ever wondered what it takes to run a
security program for a hundred and five
thousand employees and three thousand
products surely can help answer that so
we have a SPOC program security point of
contact which is decentralized way of
handling security and I think is around
a thousand people or so in the
organization that are touch points for
the various products and she's going to
be going into kind of how we organize
that so if you're interested in and how
you know it might not be a program that
works for everybody but we can at least
share what we do okay security
deployment features and best practices a
lot of folks have been asking me okay
Milton I know the security features it
out there I can see them in the release
notes what do we do with this stuff
what's the best practice you know what
do we do if we're running java 6 all
those sort of things so you might want
to check out this session code signing
and deployment that's another thing
that's highly relevant you know we've
been encouraging code signing very
steadily by the features and turning up
the security dials over the last year on
Java so if you've got some questions
about what you need to do to sign code
and things like that Vincent Ryan can
help you out there and then we have
different sessions here on the bottom by
mark show and filled who
pretty much host these certain I know
like secure coding guidelines and things
we usually do every year so if you
haven't picked up one of those sessions
before and you're kind of curious about
how some of these guidelines could be
helpful or you know things like that
about those would be good sessions to
attend as well okay so from remediation
standpoint okay so now so now we've kind
of talked about the track a little bit
we'll just segue into some of the things
that we've been doing with Java so what
are we doing in Java security here so
really we've been defending against you
know desktops and things against attacks
from malicious applets we are concerned
about all you know security
vulnerabilities and things like that but
we're calling out applets specifically
because that is the the vector that most
appears in attacks and things and we'll
be sharing some numbers a little bit
later a few slides from now and you'll
kind of see how that stands out
accelerate remediation so increasing the
the tempo of fixing here and also new
security features new counter measures
to strengthen Java you know job has been
out for a long time security landscape
has changed greatly over the years so
when are these new features that we've
been working on and how can they be
helpful and again I think you know I'm
not going to be giving a lot of real
deep dives into these features so it
might raise more I guess some questions
in a way but I think that's good because
at least you'll be aware of them and
then you can you know find those things
and read me as a release documentation
or perhaps even see more details in
orillia session you know one of the
things that I wanted to call out is you
know how secure how how serious is
security and so one of the things I'd
like to highlight here is Mark Reinhold
Chavez chief architect in April
basically informed everybody that
you know we're going to miss the Java 8
schedule it's going to slide a little
bit because we're very focused on
security so if if there was any question
in your mind about what the priority is
it's clear here and it's and I will I
will say that you know there's a you
know on any organization there's a big
push to deliver features I mean after
all features of what what people use
it's what brings value to the product
but security is very very important too
and so I just wanted to share that the
tone of security with the audience okay
so remediation hot spots okay i
mentioned applets running in browsers
the highest risk area others areas of
java yeah we're you know we're concerned
about all areas or use cases of java
where vulnerabilities would be
manifested servers perhaps so if we see
things there too will fix them but went
on highlighting here is applets are are
an area concerned and so that's why we
focused on them so this is a little
chart right here of progress over the
last about the last year and there's
like rough monthly markers at the bottom
and then sort of release milestone swags
at the top so you can kind of get an
idea you know maybe date makes sense to
you or maybe release does but and then
going up the left-hand side that would
be vulnerabilities remediated and as you
can see you know if so on the left-hand
side june of 2012 if we thought we could
do you know say 15 vulnerabilities are
mediating the cpu we've definitely step
that up a lot so and then of course it
reached a peak there and about the
februari timeframe the data is kind of
normalized to the month so if you will
remember right in the februari timeframe
we actually had two cpus we had one with
about 50 vulnerabilities i think and the
other had around
five so this is just a both of those
aggregated so you can just get an idea
of the amount of work okay the other
thing I should include is that this does
not include CBS s 0 which are basically
like defense and depth fixes they're not
they're not hazardous in themselves but
they could be combined with other things
for you know deeper sort of attacks
those sort of CBS s zeros are not
included on here and I also say if
you're not used to seeing CBS s scores
it's just a scoring system that
government uses and things like that to
classify how scary a vulnerability is
what you can do with it so 0 is you know
very not very threatening whereas 10
would be you know Red Alert okay so oh
the other thing I would say to and I
don't know if I covered that but work'll
Oracle's patches are called CPUs
critical patch update so if I'm talking
about CPUs up here i'm not talking about
chips in your computer just thought i'd
make that clear something you know we
live and breathe this stuff all the time
and then you know when you start talking
to people that don't you know the CPU
might mean something different so CPUs
are are the regularly scheduled patches
that we have security alerts are more
the hot fixes for you know if we find
active evidence of active exploitation
in the wild then we will come out with a
security alert so that would be more
one-off sort of thing unscheduled so
these right here are remediated
vulnerabilities by component subtype and
so as you can see in this here once
again cvss zeros are not included and
then on the so on the left hand side we
have remediated vulnerabilities going up
on the y axis and then across the bottom
of course the component subtype and you
can see on the left hand side
deployment is very high right applets 2d
awt so there's a lot of things that are
kind of distinctly sort of client sort
of technology on the left hand side so
you can see how those numbers kind of
back those up one of the things that I
like to bring out too is that the little
analysis that I've done here is just
from information that's available to the
public so if you go to if you go to so
when it whenever we publish the CPU or
security alert there's a standard
document that we have that we make
available to the public and at the
bottom of it it contains risk matrix
data which has these components subtypes
and it gives some information about how
these vulnerabilities with the level of
impact is for business and what what
areas there in that sort of thing so you
can go through that data and throw it
into an Excel Excel spreadsheet and
aggregate it and you know that's what
I've done here okay so another thing I'd
like to call out is the CPU critical
patch update process is changing so in
October where we're going on to Oracle's
regularly scheduled CPU process which I
think from a greedy security perspective
we had three process or three
opportunities to patch on the Java
process but now as part of the Oracle
there's four so from my greedy
perspective I get one more place where
we can put security bug fixes from a
customer standpoint I think you know
there's probably a benefit there because
if you were scheduling outages on your
in your data center to deploy Oracle
products well now Java would be on that
same cycle so that would mean perhaps
you'd have you know less outages to
schedule and things like that because
everything would happen at the same time
so I think there's some benefit there
too
okay so now we're going to kind of roll
through the features fast here okay so
on the Java control panel we added a
control to enable and disable Java and
browsers you know should should be easy
to do but prior to the December
timeframe in seven you ten it was not
easy to do and so when you know these
vulnerabilities hit the press we get a
lot of questions for how we disable Java
and you know and of course the thing
that works for us is you know java's
multi-platform and all that kind of
works against us when trying to explain
somebody how to turn things off so we
needed a way where we could you know
very easily allow people to just
temporarily turn it off and on and
that's what that feature does hard-coded
best-before date feature you know I
think the best way to describe this is
like a loaf of bread so loaf of bread
has a date on it and you want to make
sure that you consume that loaf of bread
before the date code expires or maybe
the bread will be kind of hard right so
same thing with Java so there's a date
that is encoded in the binary and also
the Java will also talk to the Oracle
servers to find out if it's on a date if
java is out of date then the behaviors
change the dialogue boxes that
communicate risk may communicate more
risk if java is out of date because if
if for example you're using java past a
cpu then we know that you're using java
with known vulnerabilities so the risk
that needs to be communicated is greater
java security slider so this was added
as a feature of the java control panel
to let desktop users adjust the level of
security controls to match their
preferences operational versus security
trade-offs signing for sandbox
applications and 7021 so we
we want to been making improvements and
things to encourage signing for code to
really actually there's some
significance to this particular one here
because prior to this change signing
also meant giving privileges and so we
want to be very clear that that's not
the case now you know as with most
industry signing really means
establishing identity for the code
author and so that's what we've done so
we've implemented signing now we're
signing establishes identity it doesn't
necessarily give permissions so that's
handled a little bit separately and that
can be either you know set by the author
as you know full permissions or sandbox
only that sort of thing so there are two
separate things so now you can have
application that's only sandbox but
signed as well okay so 721 server JRE
this feature was this feature was really
too for right now it's a eliminating
plug-in support there was some confusion
and the public about you know for
example if you know 2d vulnerability in
a 2d library would put your server at
risk and you know the likelihood is very
slim right because unless you web browse
offer your server with applets and
things you know probably not very likely
but to just to minimize that confusion
you know removing the plugins support
from the distribution for server JRE so
now you can use that on your servers
okay so remove low in custom security
slider settings okay so in the and the
one of the previous slides there I
explained the security slider that we
delivered while one of the lessons
learned is that we discovered everybody
would you know change their slider
positions to basically turn off security
well you know we're all on a security
journey together here and I think you
know we want to allow everybody to take
responsibility for
you know managing their own environment
but we want to do that in a way where
you know there's at least some basic
security controls there so we had to
make some adjustments to remove the
lowest sort of settings to protect
people from exploitation via third-party
ads and things like that blacklisting so
we expanded blacklisting so right now
blacklisting is internal feature where
we can blacklist jars and code signing
certificates and things like that
generally we you know for those things
we tend to like to let the community
work out their concerns with pki and
things like that with certificate
authorities but but we do have the
ability to block list some of that stuff
as well deter applet repurposing there
was some concerns by groups that you
know if you had a certain application
code that that jar could be lifted and
put on a different site and repurposed
Tom so we added some controls there to
lock that jar to a specific domain or
our site enamel enabled standardized
revocation services so that's enabling
so crl and ocsp were turned on we're not
turned on by default so we had to do
some testing and things just to make
sure it was up to snuff to turn it on
for millions of people but the reason
why that was important is because with
encouraging code signing you also need
to make sure the there you know the rest
of Java works to do the enforcement and
that's really where the revocation
services come out so if somebody is
signing code with a bad certificate or
something like that then revocation
services allows the community to revoke
that certificate that sort of thing and
then uninstaller is an ongoing effort so
one of the things that we've learned is
is
excuse me one of the things that we've
learned is that when a desktops have a
lot of old versions of Java on there
sometimes authors will go ahead and
target those more vulnerable versions of
Java with payloads and so so where those
are not being used we're trying to get
them cleaned up and that's that's really
what this effort is all about dynamic
rule set is a branding feature for 7
update 40 you I don't know if you've
seen that quite yet it's but it allows
basically organizations to to implement
their policy on desktops so for example
as part of DRS your IT staff could
create a rule set that limits your
desktops to only your corporate servers
or the servers or your partners and we
think that's significant because
although it doesn't really address
vulnerabilities in Java per se you know
it limits access at least to your
datacenter assets and so those data
center assets are probably sitting
behind firewalls and very sophisticated
controls as opposed to just you know
letting these clients access anything on
the internet which is much higher risk
so this allows some flexibility there
and you can so what you can do is you
can allow access to your desktop from
your desktops to your corporate servers
and actually suppress some of those
security messages that you've probably
been used to seeing if you play with
applets because their assets that are
already pre-approved if on the other
hand they access assets on the internet
then they can be prompted for warnings
that they have to work through if you
want to block them all together you can
do that too so and they'll have no
option to use those so it's up to you
it's it's how you want to define it
option 2 yeah so as well and 7u40 we
provided an option for enterprises to
disable the security baseline warning
so the idea with that is you know that
to actually run through a test cycle and
some companies takes takes a significant
amount of time and you know they they
may not be able to to migrate over to
the new version before the software
expires and starts producing these
warnings about being out of date so the
point of this really is you know we've
always wanted to empower enterprises to
manage their assets the way that they
choose and we've waited until 7u40 to
deliver the feature to shut that off
because also we provided the DRS feature
to allow them to to restrict to their
corporate assets or assets that they
choose so now we're allowing the
vulnerability messages where java's on a
date to be suppressed but also providing
the feature so that you can manage you
know your policies the way that you want
to jack's p improvements i think some of
these are significant because you know
things that happen in these parts or
frameworks are occur actually before
your program is even engaged so there's
not much input validation or things that
you can do if you're being hacked in
your parser so I think that this is kind
of important as well so one of the other
things I want to highlight here is so we
have a so in addition to signing code we
want to begin deprecating self signed
and unsigned so self signed code is kind
of dangerous unsigned code is you know
dangerous as well and so what we want to
do is begin a you know project where we
start to move the community to more of a
model where everything is signed and so
that's really what this is all about now
one of the reason I wanted to highlight
this is because I'm not sure who's going
to other sessions or what you'll see and
I wanted to let anybody know that does
applet programming that
we're going to at least block self
signed and unsigned in seven you 51
which is the January time frame ok so I
think that that's significant so any
time that we make a change to the
defaults for Java security I think that
that's it's very relevant ok so that
means that you know you'll still be able
to use self signed and unsigned in
January but now you'll have to do
something special on each desktop in
order to use it so I think that that's
important to communicate and then once
again of course I'm highlighting Aurelio
session who will cover that in more
detail ok so industry and community
outreach so you know we've been you know
talking a lot on security I've been
talking a lot on security I talked at
javaone I lead the security track I
talked internally so these are some of
the I just kind of gathered some
highlights of things where I've been
sighs talk to your last year I've done a
couple of Java podcast with Roger
Brinkley on different subjects I
presented that Evans data here in the
Bay Area not long ago devoxx and in
London and also i was invited to black
hat and july to talk to 120 executives
technology leaders from around the world
and and then owasp i just returned from
a wasp app psyche you and germany not
long ago and both Mary Ann Davison who's
our chief security officer for oracle
and myself will be speaking at a wasp
OPSEC USA in New York City coming up in
November and then of course I want to
highlight our Java one security track so
we're doing that too for outreach so so
we've been pretty busy here and I just I
wanted to I know it's very hard to
communicate messages but you know I just
wanted to highlight a few of the things
that we've done there the other thing
that we have on outreach i would
encourage folks to take a look at is
we've got a brand new security blog Eric
Costello cost low on the team has been
kind of kicking it off with some
different sort of security things that
we think are relevant so one of the goal
of the blog.really is not to to discuss
things that are already been covered
elsewhere and release notes and things
we don't want to redo already good
documentation this is really about
topics that we think are relevant so we
might decide to cover code-signing or
dynamic ruleset feature things like that
and then of course our outreach effort
here which which we talked about these
are really kind of so kind of segwaying
here into action these are some things
that we'd like everybody to know
resources that are available to you that
sort of thing but if you want to report
vulnerabilities to oracle its secular
you want to suggest new security
features you know I'm always open to a
good idea support I'm not a sales guy
i'm not a support guy i get asked a
million times about support questions
and java 6 and things like that so I
just kind of included some lightweight
information here all the links are in
the bottom of the presentation which I
won't go over but they're there they're
so you can you know find links to
support and things like that java root
certificate program if you are a
certificate authority and you want to
include a route in java we have a
program and you can you can apply to do
that but one thing i would say is
there's a lot of different policy
bullets and things like that to look
through in there what we're really
interested in if you want to be a
certificate authority in java is we're
looking for benefit to the community
okay so if you just want to include a
root in java because you don't want to
install certificates in your enterprise
that's not a good reason right it we're
looking at benefit for the entire java
community upcoming cpus just in case you
don't have them handy these are the cpus
that we have coming up the security
patches the normally scheduled ones
so these are some things here actions
that people can do to keep themselves
secure so end users as well as
developers is actions on both sides so
you know for on the end user side
keeping your computer up to date it's a
priority from a security perspective
from a developer perspective you know
writing your programs in a way to allow
users to update keeping them safe and I
knew I do realize there's trade-offs
between you know operational versus
security but from a security perspective
is generally better to stay on the
latest stuff so if both sides can work
together to accomplish that that's good
from development side you know take a
look at the OWASP top 10 secure coding
guidelines for java language and then
these are all the different links that I
just included and then a plug for that's
it that's all I have we're past our time
now so if anybody has any questions feel
free to to come on down to the front
it's 905 so sorry anyway thank you and
