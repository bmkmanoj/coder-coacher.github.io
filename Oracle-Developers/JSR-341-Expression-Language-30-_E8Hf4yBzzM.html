colleague Kim minjun and I are gonna be
talking about jsr 341 al 3.0 I was very
pleased to see noted bloggers and Java
EE personality Adam being referred to
this as the hidden gem of Java EE and I
don't know how well hidden it is but I
do think it's a gem all right this is
our Oracle disclaimer we're gonna be
talking about stuff that's already done
and this talk so what you can do with it
you know that's great we hope you make
lots of great software with it but we're
not gonna be making any forward-looking
statements in this session I would like
to recommend if you have some time this
afternoon to visit the Innovation Awards
over at the Lamb theater next to Moscone
North off of yerba buena gardens there
and this is a most impressive innovators
and Oracle Fusion Middleware
so that's today 4:45 to 5:45 you don't
have an agenda slide but basically what
we're going to talk about is actually no
the next slide is the agenda side let me
go to that one first this is what we'll
be talking about today lambda
expressions these are the new features
in e l 3.0 so lambda expressions support
for standalone environments I just is
that's better I know you're recording
these right okay so on to make sure the
audio comes through on the recording
okay good
lambda expressions support for
standalone environments some new
operators we'll be talking about all
these in turn but first a bit of history
expression language has been around a
long time as long as JSF in fact and
that's a very long time indeed in fact
it's even older than JSF really first
introduced with jst L 1 dot oh the JSP
standard tag library and that was in
2004
in 2006 we moved it up to JSP 2.0 and in
JSF 1.2 we had a separate sub
specification of the JSP spec that
covered il so this is an interesting
example where we have an instance of
refactoring happening in the Java EE
specifications where started out just
completely baked into JSP then it moved
out into a separate PDF document that
was shipped along with the JSP
specification and now you know over well
nine years later it has been now put out
into its first independent specification
completely done and as though as its own
jsr led by Kinmen here the reason i'm
collaborating with Kinmen on the talk is
that we use yel quite heavily in JSF
it's one of the most important enabling
factors of the JSF technology value
proposition it's also used in JSP and
CDI and I think the presence of PL is
the key differentiator between Java
server and non Java server stacks if you
compare any of the Java server stacks
that use an al like thing even things
like tapestry and wicket and such they
all have some kind of PL type concept it
might be agna or it might be a proper
expression language but there's nothing
like that and then the other non Java
server based web frameworks like rails
or Sinatra or Merv or any of these other
things and I think that's a missing
point when you show someone that's not
familiar with Yale how easy it is to
glue things together from disparate
parts of your application with Al it's a
very compelling thing and so that's a
key differentiator between Java server
and non Java server stacks well the most
important feature that el3 auto brings
is lambda expressions and the most
important thing about that is you don't
have to wait for Java SE 8 to be
released and even more importantly you
don't have to wait for your IT
department or your
software architects to let you use java
SE 8 when it finally does come out so
this all runs right now on Java EE 7
which requires Java SE 7 so as anyone
already using SC 7 and their course
stack ok how about 6 okay yeah so we you
know you still you don't have to go that
much further you know so at least if I
was telling you you had to wait till 8
you'd have to be a few years but 7 you
probably be up to hopefully not too long
a quick aside if you're using Java SE 6
you are able to use JSF 2.2 just not all
the Java EE 7 specific parts of it which
are you know really a very very small
amount one of which is you know the e
l3o features specifically but everything
else that's in JSF 2.2 will work on Java
SE 6 on GlassFish 3 and a Java EE 6
level container but that's a different
talk so the big feature is its available
right now SE 7 and there are many other
talks about lambda here that are from
very good speakers and I have some
references to them at the end but
basically a lambda expression behaves
like an anonymous function and it's the
body consists of an e el expression so
lambdas in e-l are just yell expressions
and the nice thing about it is you have
full access to the whole al environment
within the body of the method of the e
lambda expression that is so this is
something that Java SE lambdas will not
have they don't even though they have
all this great or lambda syntax you
won't be able to refer to other al
things from a plain old java SE lambda
expression but with our al expressions
that our lambda expressions in jsr 341
you can do that so what are these funny
syntax is here with parentheses and
arrows well this is saying that X the
first one there is just taking the input
which is
ten and adding one to it so the
left-hand side of the expression shows
what to do what is the parameter what
are the parameters the right-hand side
shows what to do with the parameters and
over here you got the input to what is
you're passing into the function is that
correct yeah okay
yeah if I if I say anything wrong please
correct me or jump in anytime so we add
one to the input here we're summing the
two inputs or passing three and four and
then you get out seven and here we're
passing nothing in and we're just
returning the constant value 64 of
course the most important thing about
functional programming languages is that
they can be recursively invoked and the
lambda can be passed around as a first
class object so these expressions can be
named and evaluated indirectly so here
we have something that's just going to
the same thing we're saying increment so
take the input and increment it and here
in the second one we're defining a
factorial function and then we're
invoking it this is using the new comma
operator
I'm sorry semicolon operator in L which
we'll talk about later on the lambda is
encapsulated as a Java XEL lambda
expression so everything in the AL API
is declared to be in the Java XEL
package and we have a new class there
lambda expression the nice thing is it
can be evaluated programmatically
completely outside of JSF or JSP so this
is the standalone thing we're just
introducing it here Kinmen will give
more details on it so here we're saying
if you have a lambda expression from the
e L processor you know evaluate it and
then you can invoke it and this will
just return whatever the function gives
you so programmatically outside of JSF
it could also be evaluated
programmatically inside JSF so if you're
in your JSF code maybe a managed bean or
something like that
you know you can get the
raises context say this laser pointer it
is the other point yes there we go get
the faces context and we're saying
evaluate this expression and return it
from its get getter call the getter on
it this is not a new API this has been
in JSF since one dot o but we're able to
pass this expression so this expression
is saying for all the books
give me those that are in the category
of philosophical fiction and return them
as a list and so that will give me this
list of books they're an important thing
to note about this is sets lists and
maps can be constructed dynamically and
this syntax is entirely equivalent to
JSON so if you understand JSON you can
read it or more importantly if you have
some code that's creating JSON and
giving it to you you can just drop it
into Al and it works perfectly well you
also can have expressions in the value
or the key of any of these so we have
literals here but what's inside here
could also be expressions
the bulk in my opinion of the value add
of lambda which itself is the most
important feature in L 3.0 is the
collection feature and the operations
you can perform on collections these are
really heavily influenced by what we had
in JDK II and it allows a fluent syntax
which we'll see a lot of in this
presentation and there are about 20
different operations it's supported and
they're all explained in the AL
specification document now has anyone
here tried to read the jsf specification
yeah okay a few it's really big and it's
it's really intent and written for
people who are implementing the JSF you
know runtime which is not that many
writers Oracle and my phases and for a
time there were some others but really
it's just the two of us now so the JSF
specification is really written for
implementers but I will say that the e L
specification is a much easier read it's
much much smaller and much more easy to
understand so really if you want to get
a handle on what the 20 operations are
there's a section in the spec that just
explains each one in a very succinct way
and so it's not like you get lost in a
maze of musts and shoulds you actually
can you know read it and understand how
to use it so to get the spec you just go
to JCP org and type 341 in the search
box there and click go and then you'll
have to you know do a few navigation
links and you get the PDF and it's very
easy and good to read so I mentioned
collections of the most important part
of lambda and this stream and pipeline
way of using collections is the most
important way to use them so basically
the collection entries flow through the
pipeline so you have the same collection
instance that's flowing through each
stage of the pipeline and you have
operators that are applied to it and
then at the end you have a terminal
operation which sort of you know
presents it to the thing that's invoking
you in the first place most of the
operations that
but in the middle are evaluated lazily
so in this case again we're saying the
same thing for all the books only show
the ones that out of the category of
history pull out just the title and then
show the list of those titles so these
are some of the other operations that we
can talk about here
could you talk over these the different
operations on this slide okay stand up
okay if you guys are familiar with what
is in you know act ethically age you
know those operations it's a lot
familiar enough they they have the same
name you know similar parameters and
behave you know the same aesthetic a8
like you know HS said we have about 20
operation and you know it just shows an
example here the filter of reason you
know to a few turning on the stream of
object predicate that you know the
determinant what should be included you
know in the activity the output okay so
for the first one the filter only filter
only allow the countries you know duty
the countries in the USA to pass through
okay the Fed map it's like a map you
know but instead of the output is not a
single object in this but it is a
another stream so so if you have a list
of list then you want to apply the
framework of reason to it to to get to
threaten other the list of list in which
such a single list okay so this what it
does so so in this case you know the
customer have helped
a bunch of orders in the orders you
share you know is a list by itself okay
so the outflow from the Fed map would
take you know all the others or pour the
customers in you know in fitnah into a
list and so the outcome is you know all
the orders of other customers in u.s. so
this way is yeah no no you just in this
particular case you just get the orders
okay okay you want a name value land
value then you need to put it into a map
or something or at least yeah okay and
the sort of reason you know is it's it's
a sea of reason this sort the incoming
element obvious but the assorted
operation also takes knew another
argument in this case you know it would
take a comparator actually yeah and so
you know you have P and Q yeah two
element then you you could compare those
tools so it let you specify the key even
to sort in a sense and reduce operation
is also a very useful of resin indebted
a price a finally operator to
accumulator and you know the element in
the list and the first argument to
reduce operation in it the initial value
for the accumulator so in this
particular case you know you you add up
all the element know together and then T
the result is now you get the sum of all
the elements and some is so useful that
we also have another operation for it
in total videos in the some you know
they have the same behavior really in
this particular case you know precaution
of reduce could be you know more general
you could specify like you could use to
reduce operation to get a maximum when
or meaning or whatever so the important
thing about several of these is the fact
that we are having an expression and
we're passing another expression in as
an argument to the operator yes there we
have the comparative ends right right
the sorting is performed based on what
this guy is so this could be any other
yellow and any other lambda expression
just correct it all right yeah all right
yeah so yeah you know at the library in
the ticka ticka a lot of those things
and we just picked some of the more
useful one in including yeah so you can
use these straight up in your JSP pages
so if you're using JSP and jst l is
anyone still using just JSP and gstl not
a web framework type thing raj SP all
right sometimes all right well there you
go so you know here you go you have a
technology that's been in use for nine
years and we're still being able to add
new functionality that that you know
really expands the scope of what you can
do without having to throw out all the
stuff that you already have so you'll be
ready to use this right away so here we
have an email expression it's the same
thing right you just put it right in
your JSP page you can also do it for JSF
so if you have here a data table same
thing we want our data table to render
the book titles of all the things that
are comedies and you know right there
so now we're gonna switch to the next
that's that's lambda and L now we're
gonna do support for stand-alone
environment do you want me to drive it
you talk or do you want to also drive it
I'm not to drive it yeah you need to
spend one hour okay okay let me get some
water first yeah so how does this look
so far this looks something like you can
now make use of it yeah it took me a
while I understand the value for it but
you know now that I can see how easy it
is I think it's gonna bring a lot of
powerful people okay yeah I'm des with
oh we you know put in a lot of effort to
make it easy to use outside of a java ee
environment some of the use case of of
DL you know outside of Java EE you know
is you could use it in infinite vision
possibly you could also use it in in
persistence and you could also use CDI
you know in a standalone environment and
so yeah so you know in there you know
yeah oh you know what we support it yeah
so the thing I want to mention about
this is there's a pattern here where all
of the technologies are trying to apply
good practices with loose coupling so
that you can use them outside of EE so
it's very impossible to just you know
taken you know and an ala carte model to
take these little bits of Java EE
separate technologies and use them you
know an se out its on its own so all of
these things bean validation persistence
CDI and Al can be used entirely on a
plain old java SE stack if you have the
right implementation jars in your class
path you can use them and write exactly
in in its shell you know that's not
that's not depend on any other packages
so is they really stand along your cell
content package
and so I think that's important to point
out when you consider the possibilities
for cloud deployment if you have an app
that really you know Ollie's is a plain
old JDK and a few other implementation
jars there's a lot of software you can
write with this I think actually jax-rs
is also another one that can be run
outside of me right
yeah Jersey project so yeah you got a
pretty capable stack when you put all
this stuff together and you don't have
all that heavy weight which is one
person's heavyweight is another person's
like bread and butter and essential
features right so people often throw the
term heavyweight around as a pejorative
but you know I think it's there for a
reason people need it so but if you
don't happen to you have the option to
yeah pull it out and use it
standalone yeah I never thought of it it
could be used in the crowd vironment
come to think of it you know you're
right oh yeah so yep we used actually in
a lot of cases you want to talk about it
50 pins in the property and you don't
want to write Java program to to you
know kept all you want there so yeah we
were used for 10 okay so let me get into
a lipid detail about what kind of
features we add to the ELP old who
support Tanner long environment and one
of the complaints you know that I have
been you know getting from users of e-l
it's just so hard to use invest in
environment you know all these things
are there but to get it to work you know
you need to create all fittest
environment the year engine would work
on you know and anyone you see of you
all would know that you have to get all
the yield resolvers you know correctly
and then you also need to construct the
ear context for any expression
evaluation so in this you know release
of Yale we provide API is for the user
to use ear in Austin
and without pain forget the idea and in
yeah we provide it's you know a standard
phrase you know to come up with default
year contacts a number of default New
Year resolver and we put all this thing
together and in external environment we
also provide a local repository for
quantities for things like year
variables in year all function so all
these things you know is already filled
in the standard standalone environment
and we also let the user evaluate the
year expression directly without having
to you know do it a lot of coding took
to create the world so we provide
facilities the user to be very very
explicit directly we provide Pacific
here to let user to define penis on the
fly to different functions on to fry you
know a lot of this stuff usually in the
lighting JSP or to you know go through
at the you know deity tag library or
detecting is perfect kitchen tables but
we only need to do this in the
standalone environment let me give you
some examples of how this thing would
work okay - want to eat - want to you
want to be very very expressing what you
just need to do is to create instance of
your processor in you know call the eval
function on it directly so yeah you know
it cannot be simpler than there
and if you need to define a yo function
on the Fri then you could just call
define function and you pass unity unity
the name of the function in yeah you
know also you know have a looser on the
namespace and then you need to associate
a function with a particular class in
the static method okay so so you need to
pass this for a human in space potatoes
know on the fry similarly you can also
define a Yale variable and in this case
you know the second argument will 85
very separate variable is a year
expression and the first one is the name
of the variable that you are defining
yeah
okay so this is also another example to
show you how you could define beans on
the Friday but by pretty funny means I
mean you want to give a instance you
know between you know a name in so you
associate you know a instance of the
teen to a name that you could refer to
in the ear expression and so we have a
facility there so you know you define a
year in a variable called name and then
you create a instance you know of both
of you note at the printer you want to
define so the important thing to point
out here is that this bean this name is
right now on this slide is not a CD I
mean there really is a plain old hojo
you know people would say oh ho Joe is
great now spring and c-d-i they give you
pojos really not a plain old thing
anymore you have to instrument it with
ASM and property and twelve ways to
Sunday just to invoke a method so you
know pojos aren't so pojo but this
really is a real true POJO right right
you know maybe you could skip to the
next slide to whatever you're saying
yeah so there are new features in CDI
that let you you know here in the
previous slide we were saying here I
really just want a name a thing that's a
name I want to define that as an e el
bean so I can do stuff to it well you
can you can have the same usage pattern
using new api's that are in CDI 1.1 so
instead of just using operator new you
are now using this additional CDI API
and when you do that you guarantee that
all the value added CDI brings with its
injection and its events and its
proxying and all those really useful
things are still honored but you still
are get the important thing here which
is I know that I want to get a new thing
right now I need it
is what I need new to happen so it's
more of an imperative syntax so with
that CGI 1.1 you have this thing called
unmanaged and when you have an unmanaged
thing you can then instantiate it and
when you have the unmanaged instance
that's when you can manipulate it and do
all the CDI things that need to happen
so first you call produce which does
invocation of the producer methods then
you call inject which injects any of the
injections that you have then you call
post construct which calls whatever post
constructor is called on that beam and
then you say get to actually get the
thing so the red code on this slide is
just the stuff that you don't have when
you call new you know but what you get
instead is all of the other CDI goodness
so the simplicity of saying new is nice
but the powerful features of all the
injection and validation and all the
other things with CDI need get has to
know the complexity has to live
somewhere so that's what this index is
and they're trying to you know boil it
down as small as you can and and this
really isn't too bad but it's certainly
not as simple as you're saying new yeah
there are some examples later on that I
just used the new you know directly but
but what you know I just said you know
also apply to all those examples yeah
yeah you know get back to the previous
life you know we had talked about the
first part there is also another API in
Europe on all that instead of defining a
pin associate named or between with with
a e/l in a variable
you could also associate a map so that
number tells you how to lock up the pin
name and the second examples you know
show how to do it in Europeans here
okay so I'm going to talk about you know
some new operator if it was introduced
in yo 3.0 we there are actually a lot of
requests you know to add in a new
operator to the language but we you know
don't take in all these suggestions and
two of them so we actually only in
includes free operator the reason they
are really useful and really basic and
it actually add a lot to the year as you
can see the first operation is the
concatenation and it's surprising you
know that yeah you know a language a
process string does not include
concatenation operator so we just added
this new operator to the language
yeah unfortunately you know we cannot
use the press you know like the Java
language to specify concatenation
because you know price in DL means heh
arithmetic for us so we we have to you
know use a new operator for it
yeah he Anatoly you know useful operator
is not the assignment and okay and you
know the assignment operator
you know also also had been one of the
motions who operated with ethical ear
language and when we assign an
expression in the ER and what get ends
up in the areas you know that the de
target of the assignment you know we
could refer to it you know later on in
in this in the expression and you know
because you know all the like any other
ear expression you know a operators and
they are actually carried out not by the
ear engineer shell but by the ear
resolvers so so in in this particular
case the assignment is also done you
know by the year resolver and so you
wish it up the environment correctly you
could assign you know the approach of
the new value to the correct variables
in al let me take an example you know
like you know if if assignment is done
in a healthy environment then the
assignment is HVD kvl to the attributes
of the of the fridge context in JSP and
a tradition in jest FB also every
similar you know here we solver that
they could you could assign to okay but
I understand along environment you know
the assignment is done to a local
repository in so all this is done you
know behind the users it was fair so in
this particular collision we assign you
know the username you know to X X and
then in a week referred to the variable
later on in another expression so one it
is a sign it it it stayed there
okay yeah I'm not a useful operation you
know is this a semicolon so semi colon
operator you know is is just like a well
in the sense you know it's a fact you
know what you expect in Java except in
the case of e it is a question instead
of of its Damon
so what it is is you could string a
number of year expression together and
give the you know in this particular
example the first expression you know
it's the assignment and so you just use
it know for side effect and this the
expression you know get a value from the
second expression in this particularly
the last expression so yeah so what is
what you're doing here is you assign you
know something to a variable that you
use that variable in this 30-second you
know expression
okay in ELC oh we also allow the user to
specify you know a particular construct
with a palette with a particular
conversion like you know in year there
are cases you know you would like to
convert from a source type to a target
ID and a year specify you know the rules
for food for all those per thousand in
the spec but a lot of cases you know
those conversions are not what they use
the one in the user want to specify his
own converter and we also provide API in
Europe and OH for the user to specify
his own a converter in this particular
example knockety the last line over
there a yes right the last example you
want to evaluate the the function
John Doe but you want to specify a
target type you know for the expression
to be evaluated in so so in this
particular case the example you know
actually call the constructor to
contract
you know the my pin instant with not the
input such thing as an argument right so
the X empty the line of code it over
there you know is to specify how to look
on how to convert a string into a
nineteen instant yeah so you know at the
use of the tool you know a lot of
powerful thing you know with this
particular construct
yeah and of course no with this slide
and we also are using the Constructors
who may be entirely but if you're
working with a CD eyes and you want to
do you know more elaborate things to
tell CDI you know the new instant will
check for eighty
okay in Yeouido we also include you know
the facility to refer to a static class
or static members directly in the year
expression okay so it is also heading
you know one of the most requested
feature addition to the new spec right
so you know yeah so you know you could
directly refer to a static members and
you could also refer to a new constant
also this way because in incontinence is
just a static member but if it stays in
member fear so in this particular case
you know we imported a a class that
content the static member you want to
you know refer and then once is imported
then in you could you know written the
aesthetic members not directly yeah
similarly you know you could actually
also refer to a static method but you
know it's not shown here oh yeah at the
package no Java telling you know is
important so that the user does not need
to import a member a class in Java
top-ranked package so for instance
Universal referred to boolean to true
target there or I call a static member
of a integer
why so it is you know yeah we act you
know getting the end of this session
the in summary you know the e L is the
first independent specification of the
air and we could use Landers
right now on signal Java SE 7 yeah come
to think of it actually you could also
use it in j6 yes II you know at Java
se6 - was there a long work yeah but
work except that we you know we
published not the artifact will be
jetting it s is seven so you if you guys
want to use some changes you know se6
now you could get the sauce and compile
it yeah right because there's nothing in
year they use you know the special
features of a c7 class for the
diversionary 51 you don't want to get
that one again
okay don't you get when you try to run
it okay okay but that's good so you
won't have to recompile JSF because the
JSF builds we actually produce their
Mahara
complementation is built for seg6
although it runs in seven so you'll have
to recompile the e l if you want to use
these features so that's good to know
that's good right and in the two men
codes no of this in the spec is not to
make it useful standalone and also to
get you know a lot of new power to the
language lambda and new operators in all
that stuff
yeah and yeah so these are some
references no you know if you guys want
to look at the spec get a RI and yeah
and did you know you can be done with
the sauce from the hour I like I say you
want to build it noon with s s is sick
then it could be done you probably might
have to change the palm file because I
think the palm pile declares the
compiler version for seven yeah why
don't you go get the data file fine
Oh in there a lot of talking on on you
know lambda expression in other
conferences and other sessions I mean
and you know there must be you know over
ten of them you know we should pick you
know some of the things that we we think
might be useful yeah if you are
interesting lambda expression you know
please go to some of those yeah I'll say
Mary O Fusco session he gave a talk at
Java zone and also a couple weeks ago
they had the fortune of attending and
prior to that talk I just really was two
heads down with what I was doing with
JSF and didn't really make the time to
fully understand why everyone's getting
so excited about this so I went to his
talk and billing he explained it and
really got it across why it's such an
important thing so he's a very good
speaker he's you know giving a bit of a
different spin on it this time but
that's the one I recommend and you know
all these guys are great speakers Brian
gets its excellent venkatramana him both
of them are an active from the no fluff
just stuff symposium series
so therefore the very high quality of
speaking so I do recommend those yeah
Brian is a really good speaker in he's
also the suspect deed for atlanta
project okay so we'll leave these up now
that concludes our presentation
does anyone have any questions that
they'd like to share in the whole room
actually that's a very good question so
the question was is there anything
restricting use of L 3.0 in JSF two one
the answer is yes there are some things
that can man told me hey ed here's what
you need to put in the JSF
implementation so it works with the l3
oh and I put those things in it wasn't
that much but yes there was some code I
had to put in there to make it work with
resolvers so I think one or two you'll
be so good you know to the list of you
lose over 50 pieces use totally solvers
useful in resolving aesthetic mental
references but you if you don't use a
static member references then lambda ok
would work you know we're out there ah
yeah right right so lamb doesn't you
know depend on there so yes you know you
could some what you feel my wood but not
all of it it's all yeah everything
you're an uncharted territory they're
doing that kind of thing
all right good
any other questions
they're in there until you call dispose
on them so it's on you to manually call
dispose also when you do it that way of
course you know it doesn't make sense
for the beam that you're doing to have
like a request scope or sessions go on
because you know that's outside of the
environment that we're running there any
other questions yeah okay the question
was have I encountered any issues
running UEL 3.0 with spring at all so I
don't have an answer to that one do you
yeah we haven't tried it yeah it should
work yes does spring use a prior version
of yell
yeah yeah patina their own
implementation but not they're not using
okay not use oh right so you might not
be you know behave the same and
until they actually update their
implementation with vo vo I guessed a
lot of top warm water
oh so you'd be using it stand alone
inside of a spring context right yeah
that's okay that's what work though but
you know but in another place spring
would refer to a year expression so it
might not indicate you there so you know
you get to it that way though you have
to you sustain a long future you know
you know the ear processor and call you
where you're on or near and not so that
way the spring going to confuse with
which ear they are using all right but
they'll all be dead before we got the
spring they have their own way of doing
the collection of question mmm it put it
not the same is what we are doing here
anyone else have a question
okay washing clothes yeah thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
