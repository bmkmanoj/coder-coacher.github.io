you is in green foot but you can ignore
that imagine something like that in your
own favorite IDE and think about whether
you think it might be a good idea in
your context the whole problem with
editing is that it is based on a
technology that was developed half a
century ago we are editing text and that
is the heart of the problem that alone
describes the source of all the evils we
think we discover here the problem is
that the unit of manipulation in your
IDE is a single character you can edit
in your IDE every character individually
you can select a character you can
insert a character can delete a
character that is technology you know
that was developed in those times why
are we doing this well in those times
there was nothing else available it was
a natural thing to do that was all your
head now we have all the processing
power we want we have color displays we
have graphical displays now we can
actually now technically do a lot more
than just stare at raw characters and we
have to ask ourselves our sequences of
characters really the best
representation for those things we try
to show what you actually want to do
when you're writing a program is you
want to manipulate program constructs
you want to you want to create change
manipulate insert delete statements and
expressions of your language when you
think about your program in your mind
logically those are the atomic units of
your manipulation and your IDE
forces you down to the level of single
characters and I will show you in a
moment
why that is a problem how we could do
better now you might well say well my
IDE does a lot of wonderful things in my
text editor actually did get a lot
better over the last ten years you know
we have now Auto layout we have code
completion we have continuous
compilation with inline error you know
notifications we've got hints and we've
got so
a lot of things have changed 10 years
ago 15 years ago we didn't have those
things but even though these
functionalities address the right
problem I think the designers of the
ideas have recognized the problems we
think they are not the optimal solution
you can do a lot better than that
if you get away from pure text as the
representation of your program with what
you're going to show you I think we can
make improvements in all the areas of
programming that is the presentation of
your program readability we think we can
actually make it look nicer and nicer
not just in an emotional in you know
subjective way but actually reading to
better readability on through better
readability better understand ability
fewer errors we think we can improve the
entry of programs by making it actually
faster to enter your program then you
can do it now
and we think we can improve the
manipulation of programs so that when
you have to do changes refactorings
edits that you benefit from that as well
we have very few slides that was pretty
much it already we will spend the rest
of the time doing a demo I think you
understand much better is much more
interesting if I just show you what
we've done so here is Green foot and the
green foot IDE has always a graphical so
array here that we call the world that
is actually completely uninteresting for
this talk this is just some random
sample application I've chosen so that I
have some program text it's a
predator-prey simulation actually where
the blue things eat the yellow things
but what I I will not talk about anymore
but what I want to look at is actually
really only the editor this is what the
editor looks like here's one very simple
class actually just to concentrate your
mind I'll make that the only window that
I have open here so this is the
presentation of a program in our
language the language is very much like
Java with very minor differences you see
that we got rid of curly bracket
and semicolons but otherwise it is a
very much java-like language and the
principles I'm talking about you could
apply to straight Java or to any other
programming language the actual language
is not that relevant so the first thing
you see is that we are using colors and
graphic elements such as these boxes
here on the screen so a scope for
example is now represented by what we
call a frame a graphical box and that is
very simple but you know once you think
about it quite obvious thing to do some
programming language constructs
including for example scope it's much
better and much more clearly presented
by a graphical element than by a pair of
characters no you can have a curly brace
here and you can have a curly brace
somewhere down there in fact you
probably have 15 curly brackets
somewhere down there and you somehow
have to work out which one matches which
one and what IDs typically do is they do
some auto indentation to try to line
them up so that you can see it more
easily but still it is a lot more work
now it is visually and mentally
especially when the beginning or the end
of the scope is out of view it is much
harder to see here when you look at
these boxes you know if they are half in
view and you see pretty much exactly
that this scope here extends down beyond
your current view and this one doesn't
there it is much more immediate so that
is what I mean
we're saying you know to forget about
just using characters for everything you
have much more at your disposal now you
can make your program presentation much
nicer if you just are prepare to drop
the idea that everything has to be
presented by characters we obviously as
you can see already we use color for
some things in our case different kinds
of constructs are represented by
different color the class background is
green methods are yellow so here you can
see very clearly immediately where the
methods are if statements have a color
loops have a color and so on so you get
quite used to these colors very quick
once you work with us for a few weeks
you you you know you identify constructs
very quickly by color without any effort
it just happens automatically if you see
red you know there's a loop you don't
actually have to read the detail of the
program text anymore
the next thing apart from presentation
is the insertion of statement if I want
to insert a statement
I hit a single key for example an equals
key and I get an assignment statement
and I can fill it in I hadn't I hit
another key and I get an if statement so
a single command key inserts a complete
statement and if I if I want a loop I
hit one key I get a while loop these
keys you learn very quickly they aren't
actually all that many once you think
about you know how many constructs you
can insert at any point in your program
you it's usually less than a dozen
you know them quite quickly and the
point is a lot of syntax errors are
avoided here you know you cannot have an
if statement where the closing bracket
is missing in fact when you think about
it it doesn't even make sense why you're
programming IDE your programming
environment lets you enter half a
statement why would you ever want to
have half a statement either you want a
statement or you don't you know the
reason that is possible is pure
accidental history because it needed to
be represented by multiple characters so
normally you are responsible for
choosing which statement you want then
you have to type it and typing it means
typing out the keyword you actually have
to type every character okay somebody's
then use a bit of completion and and try
to try to make that a bit easier for you
and that means the designers of the idea
have recognized the problem they know
it's annoying to have to type it all out
but they have a solution that is only
half as good as it can be and you are
responsible as a programmer for the
punctuation you have to you know make
sure that the semicolons the brackets
are all there
even if your IDE puts it in
automatically for you in a traditional
IDE you can still mess it up afterwards
you can still delete a bracket without
deleting the other bracket why is that
even possible and then you are also
responsible for presentation you're
responsible for layout the indentation
is under you control of course the IDE
tries to keep you on the right path and
tries to sort of lay it out correctly
but I can mess it up I can delete some
spaces in front of the site I can and
believe me if you work in teaching your
students do they never get it right
layout of a program it's a simple
algorithm why does the program I
actually have to do anything about it
why can the programmer actually make it
wrong there is no reason what you
actually want to do is you want to think
about your program structure you want to
think about what kind of statement you
want to have where and the rest you can
automate the presentation the the you
know showing of the keyword the
generation of the actual keyword the
punctuation the indentation it can all
be taken away from you and it can be
automated so we can insert statements
and of course we can also insert methods
if I go here I hit a key I get a method
I can type a name I can insert some
statements here and it is all fairly
quick you have a single key to insert
the statement frame and then you have
what because lots slots are these white
things here where you then fill in the
details for an if statement for example
you have one slot for the condition one
slot for the body and of course there
you fill in your details and that is
what you actually want to concentrate on
because that is the important thing one
of the side effects also of using
graphics is you can elevate statements
program statements to become first-class
entities in your user interface now in
the user interface of your traditional
IDE you have a text pane
that's your interface element and then
you have characters and there's nothing
in between and here because it is
an interface element I can just grab it
and move it some else I can grab this
statement and move it here these
statements they now become entities you
know they can be moved around they can
be manipulated as one object you might
say well my idea also has drag-and-drop
if you use Eclipse on NetBeans or
IntelliJ or visuals or any of the big
ideas yes you have drag-and-drop in your
text editor but first of all selecting
the text is quite a high effort high you
know manipulation interaction because we
have to target very precisely you have
to target the exact right characters in
fact little details such as whether you
include the trading new line or not in
your selection make a difference because
when you drop it somewhere it messes up
your in the indentation if you get it
wrong and that is quite fiddly you know
that is so you fiddle with mouse
selection why you actually want to think
about your program structure and here I
can grab this anywhere and draw drop it
not anywhere that is also another thing
in your text ID you can drop any
selected text anywhere you can take a
statement select it and drop it into the
middle of a keyword why why is that ever
sensible when you move statements around
95% of the locations your text editor I
invalid why does your edit editor
actually let you do this here I can drag
the statement only where it's actually
syntactically valid if I try to put it
outside of the method it tells me that
doesn't work and it offers me only
locations that are actually valid where
the syntax tree remains intact or
remains valid so your IDE knows exactly
where it can go why does it not help you
with putting it where it can go and that
now hopefully you start understand what
I mean with it is a mistake to
manipulate your program at the level of
individual characters characters
individually have no meaning you want to
manipulate statements you want to
manipulate you know your program
which constructs so drag-and-drop
becomes a really easy quick low overhead
operation you can select statements also
for the keyboard I just did the drag and
drop of the mouse you don't have to
touch the mouse know this this whole
editor even though it uses graphical
elements can be driven entirely with the
keyboard so we it was important as we
know we are programmers ourselves you
know you don't really want to take your
hands off the keyboard once you use no
your editor value of much faster with
the keyboard and the mouse we can do
everything with the keyboard you have in
addition Mouse based drag-and-drop
operations but you don't need to use
them we have selection so I can select a
statement or a group of statements I can
if I have a group of statement I cancel
it I can drag them together if I want to
one other thing I can do if I have a
selection and then I insert an if
statement I'm actually surrounding that
statement with my if statement so some
simple operations like that become much
easier in the user interface and they
become much easier to implement I can
delete I can delete statements I can
delete that if statement here or I could
delete that if statement including the
body from here I can do that with keys I
can also do that with mouse if I want to
I have a right-click on my statements I
just told you they are first-class
interface elements so of course they
have a context menu and there I have for
example a delete of the whole statement
or a delete of just the outer frame of
the statement leaving the body intact
just there are sort of common operations
that you would want that you can much
more easily offer once you can offer a
right-click menu because you have a
present representation of your statement
one thing that goes away completely
which is a sort of permanent sort of
ongoing drive in big teams is layout and
presentation now the layout here it's
not your problem anymore you know you
can forget all the you know debates
about are we indenting four spaces or
two or three or eight you know what is
the god-given right number of spaces for
indentation this is all automated and in
fact if you like a small indent and your
other colleague likes you know the
eights within eight space indentation
and you think that's crazy you can both
have your way because the amount that
this is indented here can be just a
preference setting in your installation
of your editor changing initation does
not change your source code anymore you
know it's if someone changes the
indentation that's just a visual
preference of your particular
presentation that you're looking at at
the moment it's a mattre beaut of your
editor not of your program anymore
indentation has nothing to do in program
text it's not program structure and it's
crazy
that just because someone wants the
indentation to be different because they
they or they they like different colors
or so you know that that's that changes
your program source and then it messes
up your versioning you know you're it if
someone changes the layout of something
someone uses another IDE that uses
different default layout suddenly you
get lots of conflicts in your aura these
changes in your in your version
repository um it is completely
nonsensical also screen size know if I
for example let's say that's oops I'm
closed instead of selecting it let me
just open that again because I've got a
class here that has a few sort of longer
statements here if I've got long
statements and I have a very narrow
screen wrapping lines is done
automatically and you can debate whether
this kind of indent with the wrapping is
is looks nice or not if you don't like
it right a different layout algorithm in
your own editor but that is automated no
it's not in the program text
so if someone has really a really narrow
screen you know because they work on
their sort of little tablet thing or
they like to have you know 15 windows
next to each other open on their screen
and you have a really wide screen you
don't have to fixate anymore that you
know everyone should use only 80
characters width because someone doesn't
like long lines and every time you know
you you indent a line differently it
changes your your repository again
wrapping is completely under control of
the presentation system it does not
change the program text and it shouldn't
so layout is automatic some layout is
also adaptive so if I insert a variable
here and you see our variables have the
VAR keyword if I insert another variable
underneath then the second line the
second variable does not get the VAR
keyword at the beginning because it
knows that there is a variable
declaration block here already and so
visually it's a little bit lighter now
so it can adapt or if you have a loop
somewhere and somewhere here you have a
break I insert a break of the loop that
break can indicate with color and with a
graphical element exactly which loop it
is breaking out of now so once you start
thinking in terms of graphics for
president there's a lot you can do okay
I'll hand over here to Neal I will show
you some of the other goodies now edit
thank you so Michael has given you a
sort of overview there of the general
structure of the editor and how we're
using these frames as also the
first-class interface elements what I'm
going to show you next is just once the
sort of lower-level stuff so we could
take that to the frames idea all the way
down and have frames in expressions and
things like that but it tends to get
very fiddly and annoying if you do that
we were sort of experimenting with our
prototypes but ultimately when you get
down to the expression level you do just
want to be able to type and just have
sort of fairly standard text editing
capability so here I've got my F frame
that I've just created I'm in the
condition and if I want to just have
some expression in there I can just type
you know one plus two plus three there's
no sort of special command keys once you
get down to the expression level you're
just typing expressions like you would
sort of in your usual IDE but there's
just a couple of improvements we've made
on top of that so for example one
difference where you enter the
expressions is so I just type they're
literally one plus two plus three with
the only keys and they touched and yet I
actually have space between my operators
so this spacing here is again a
graphical element so we automatically
add space around the the operators again
you could have this user configured if
different people like different amounts
of spacing around your operator but you
don't actually have to touch the space
key to insert a space character between
them you can't have sort of runs of
spacing between them which means so it's
easier and it's faster so if you never
have to touch the space bar while you're
entering expression you are bound to be
faster entering that expression there's
somebody that is putting the spaces in
manually the sort of theoretical limit
on speed of program entry is the number
of keys you have to press I mean we've
known that for ages you know VI in Emacs
and all these sort of crazy key
combinations they're all about trying to
minimize the amount of key presses that
you have to make to enter will
manipulate your code so we're again
looking for places where you could just
sort of take out unneeded effort in this
case pressing the spacebar it also make
entering your your program
faster and then from there that sort of
spins off into other ideas so we've got
one plus two plus three
but if I take that back and make it one
plus two times three we actually
dynamically reface the operators based
on their precedence so tighter binding
operators get less space between them
that's a lower binding operates as you
get more space between them some program
is actually sort of obey this rule with
space characters sometimes might put in
more space between the ones that the
binding less tightly so obviously you
can use brackets you know make it
unambiguous and generally programmers
sort of learn their their precedence
rules anyway but it's just a tiny
presentation difference just to give an
indication here okay the two times three
is one thing and the the one plus you
know is sort of less tightly bound it
doesn't go all the way down we've got
sort of three spacing levels but if for
example you then put the Equality
operator in there that's even lower
precedence so that gets further spacing
around here so we've got three tiers of
spacing that we dynamically add and so
generally in the keyboard entry we're
trying to not get in the way of what
you're used to doing while you're
editing so as I said there well you
don't have to press the spacebar if you
do press the spacebar we don't get in
your face about it we just ignore it
so spacebar just is sort of a no op
while you're editing the code and
similarly here if you want to insert an
assignment frame here so you there might
fill in the the left hand side for the
particular variable name then you want
to sort of get over to the right hand
side so obviously as you might expect
the left and right cursor keys just you
know move across the positions but what
you used to typing if you're writing
java is x equals so if you type that
equals you're just automatically over
type the equals that's there and move it
to the other side so you can type
basically Java as you're used to and it
still fits in perfectly with our editing
style you know with web programmers as
well we're using this it gets really
irritating if somehow what you're used
to type in you know
your other editor when you're developing
suddenly wouldn't work in this so
similarly if you insert a method call
here we automatically put the brackets
in for you but once you get to the end
there again if you just type an opening
bracket there you just over type the
assistance that's already there some IDs
do this when they sort of fill in
templating you kind of end up over
typing the structures there but we
didn't want you to accidentally insert'
another set of brackets before that and
they get some sort of irritating so
although we're providing editing help
and sort of structure once you get down
to the expression level you can just
basically type java and once you hit the
end so again here you can type the
closing bracket and I believe as well
although you can't put the semicolon in
I think that's our to-do list is we just
ignore the semicolons that you put it as
well you'll notice that you don't need
any semicolons in this editor because
you know the line ending is all in
integrated already into the structure so
again if you never have to type
semicolons you're again saving key
presses potentially saving time on the
entry of your code and you can't mess up
the semicolons and get them wrong or do
what a lot of beginners do which is put
a semicolon at the end of the if header
just there I don't know if any have ever
done that by accident but it's a really
difficult bug to track down because what
that does is the semicolon forms an
empty body of your if and all of a
sudden your if condition has no effect
professionals tend not to do it
beginners do it a lot and it's really
sort of pernicious error so we're sort
of is on the education side we want to
eliminate the possibility to make these
kind of stupid errors that you know
nobody is really looking to make and so
ways of doing it in this structured way
we can actually avoid a lot of those
errors
realize
yes a good question the question was oK
we've got this distinction up front
between writing a message called and
writing and assignment what if you
change your mind
is it really irritating to back out of
that and change the other one and the
answer is especially in that particular
case no so if you want to insert a
method call click there on the right
hand side obviously you can then just
sort of type the method call but you
then might decide ok I don't actually
even want to store the result of that
message though it's my plane method cool
as you suggested you just backspace and
delete the assignment it changes between
them if you then decide oh actually I do
want that back just typing that
assignment operator switches between the
two so we just make it very natural to
change between the two that's a
particularly common case things like
changing an if to a wild you actually
very rarely want to do we had some
functionality in that originally so oK
you've got an if you want to turn it
into a while I don't do that very often
while I'm programming I don't know about
you guys but there's very little time we
actually want to sort of change the
overall container construct but there
are sort of easier ways to do it so if
you were so let's say for example you've
got this if here you've decided okay I
want to scrap that and turn into a while
you can always just delete the F select
them and use the wild shortcut key to
get back so it's not you know crazily
difficult if you do want to change
between those constructs but one
additional answer to that is any frame
you insert after you insert the frame
backspace tape
type straight the after there remove
that frame again so you always back out
of any accidental insertion with the
backspace key yeah all the Escape key
for that matter so if you accidentally
press an insert and you didn't want it
just escapable will back it out okay so
another example where we sort of have
structure in our editors and also the
over typing is you might for example
want to add the parameter to a method so
of course you'll know in formal
parameters need a type and a name and so
we have these two different slots here
one ready for the type
and one for the name sir pie but an it
again if you use this as a java editing
behavior you'll want to press space
there
and since we're generally ignoring space
and a lot of slots anyway space is just
a navigation key pushes you over to the
next item so you can just type as you're
used to you then put in the neighbor for
the parameter and if you want to add
another one well if you were typing in
Java you just type a comma and so typing
a comma here is just adding sort of
extra structure and then you can add the
extra parameter or if you decide oh I
didn't want this one anyway you can just
backspace across all of it
and the structure just sort of goes you
know as you type so we're trying not to
be really annoying sisters of actually
create and manipulate the structure
we're trying to sort of hard to fit in
with your standard editing behaviors so
we took a programmer who's used to a
text editor and put them in this there's
a little bit of upfront learning to
actually learn you know for examples a
couple of shortcut keys to insert the
initial frame but actually while you're
just sort of typing and you've got this
muscle memory and you're not even
thinking about it what you type
shouldn't just work in you know sort of
nineteen ninety five percent of cases
you don't actually need to adjust your
behavior but hopefully you can get
faster as you kind of learn some of the
tricks in the new editor so another
feature we have is code completion of
course you know we will use code
completion a lot in our IDs I'm sure so
if you're you know you make you a
message frame with you want code
completion control space of course just
loads up the code completion in general
is pretty similar to a lot of IDE so you
know it's a pretty good system that we
use often so you can just you know type
in your message you're sort of
suggestion and it will show up both the
ones that start with that prefix
and it'll also it gives you related
suggestions which come up in two ways it
either looks for an infix search
basically so you know it's looking for
mo within these method names but it also
potentially looks for typos so if you
accidentally type T rather than V for
the next one there's nothing there's no
methods available in our system the
begin MOT but there are a lot that begin
mo some
see if you didn't mean to hit that tee
obviously the further away you get you
know it's a demented edit distance
system but we at least protect against
the single typo so if you've made one
mistake in there you know it shows you
some some nearby methods that you might
have meant instead the code completion
is also contextual so one advantage of
our system that a lot of ideas try and
replicate but it's easier here is to
know what context are you in at the
moment so if I'm here I know that I'm in
a method call context and I just show
method call names in this particular
zone whereas up here if I go back to my
parameters in this slot I've been a type
context and I know that immediately
because of the sort of structure in the
system in an IDE you can try and work
that out by looking at tokens around but
you're having to kind of pass half ways
of the structured code that might be
incomplete or have errors but for us I
can just hit control space there and
what I get is a list of tight
completions no method names are shown
because they're not valid here and so
then I can just select my sort of in
type from the list and finish it off so
we get a lot of context information for
free from the structure which we could
use to kind of be more intelligence in
what we're suggesting you so for example
the types and Method completions
okay so there was a paper written a few
years ago that looked at habits of
programmers while they were programming
and one sort of you know what edits do
they make what functionality do they use
and one interesting finding was
programmers don't undo which I think
would make a really good t-shirt slogan
if anyone here does programmer t-shirts
so why don't program is undo well you
can kind of boil undo down into two
different things that you might want to
undo so what is that you're a sort of
syntactic undo so you're typing along
and you accidentally type that method
name wrong oh whoops I meant to say move
now very very few programmers will use
ctrl Z or command Zed at this point to
undo that mistake right so you either
just backspace back to where you were
and type it again or if it's quite far
away you might use the cursor keys you
know to navigate across to your mistake
and actually correct it but you don't
use the actual undo functionality you
just sort of you know use your you're
typing and the other time that you might
want to sort of use undo is perhaps what
we might think of as a semantic undo so
let's say I'm up here I may be saying oh
let's try changing a few of these
parameters I want to see what effect it
has in the simulation so you change a
couple of those led you down here
releasing this code and I don't need
that anymore that break now I'll get rid
of that other do you think yeah okay oh
actually maybe I didn't want to increase
the litter size now if you undo at this
point undo is a linear stack of
operations
you're gonna undo the edits you did way
down there and you don't really want to
do that so very often you're trying to
undo something that you did a little
while ago but you don't want to undo the
edits in between and I don't know of any
idea that sort of has decent support for
that because it's it tends to get you
know version control level at that point
isn't it you've got some change down
here you want to preserve and some
change up here you want to take back for
us of course we can actually narrow the
undo scope down to a particular
structure so if I now right click on
this particular thing if I go to recent
values I get a graphical menu showing
the recent states of that particular
frame so if I then click the
one I've then reverted back that
particular item back to its previous
state but I haven't had to mess with all
the other ones that I did in between so
we can actually have sort of localized
undo setting which makes it much more
useful and so we put on this particular
menu because it also helps you know sort
of see what the previous states are that
you might go back to we keep a list of
about three or four of them
so I'm a bit hard of hearing at the
moment I'm afraid okay okay all right
cool okay thank you
okay so the other thing I'm just going
to talk about here is some of the
display elements so Michael is showing a
couple of these already for example the
break frame automatically indicates
graphically you know where it belongs to
there's a few other improvements that we
look to make to try and sort of provide
more context when you're editing your
program and some of this arises as
Michael said from once you stop thinking
about your sort of tech you know your
program code as a text pane you start
having all these other ideas you know
we're developing this thing you you
could do that now and you could do this
so for example one thing that's often
very useful to know when you're editing
is which method you're inside and kind
of if you're in say a long if statement
or a long while loop you often want to
know you know okay which where am I
basically what's the context of this
code that I'm editing so to enable that
we make it so that when you actually
scroll down if you look at the top of
the screen here just by this header once
so that she Scrolls off the top of the
screen we don't scroll without a view we
just pin it to the top okay this is a
you know simple UI trick that's used a
lot on mobile phone displays and that
kind of thing that you just keep the
header as you scroll past and we've just
taken that across into the code editor
so you can always see at the top of the
screen which message you're editing and
you can see its parameters and if you
scroll further and take an if header out
of view we consider doing exactly the
same thing with if and wild headers but
they tended to sort of you know you tend
to get huge stack at the top of your
screen if you're not careful the actual
edit zone disappears so we then realized
well hey that indent space nobody's
really using that right it's just sort
of a color bands that nothing's going on
so why don't we just draw it in there so
once it Scrolls off the top of the
screen again you can actually
see the context here if you want to and
we try to make it fairly subtle so it
doesn't you know annoy you and get in
the way but you can just kind of glance
across the gut you want to say okay
which for mood from my inside again and
you could sort of just see it over on
the side there of course these things
scroll up and you notice sort of
disappear as you head down the the
program file so it's quite a subtle
thing but you know doesn't sort of annoy
you too much but it's just there as
useful information if you actually want
to glance across and see it I mean these
changes these couple of sort of
visualizations in particular I think are
a good example of why if I sort of you
know point that graphical display of
program code enables you to do a lot
more than kind of you know
terminal-based display a program code
maybe with some funky Unicode rotate
thing you could sort of you know emulate
this in your your text editor or
something but you can just do so much
more with sort of finer grained spacing
with annotations with visual display if
you're willing to accept okay I work in
a GUI you know I'm not just sort of
working in some facsimile of an eighty
by twenty five character terminal so
there's a lot more that you can you can
do it of course modern ideas are still
doing this to a large extent you know
red squiggly underlines pop-ups overlays
that kind of thing we're just taking it
further and thinking okay if you
completely abandoned the requirement to
be plain text what can you do and and so
these are some of our ideas similarly if
you want to insert for example a method
call you'll see we've already got this
sort of grey prompt text there reminding
you to type a method name okay there's
maybe not necessarily so useful
professionals you know we aim of
beginners and for them it's actually
quite useful to remember what the hell
am I putting in here or the fact that if
has a condition but one thing that is
useful is once you type a method that's
recognized the system you know does
dynamic look up the messages in the
background it actually copies across the
parameter name of your method into that
saying gives you a prompt if you there
mouse over it it gives you more
information
so I ease have this knowledge and you
can get popups like this often if you
hit a shortcut key
in your IDE but we're just automatically
giving you that sort of prompt there so
you can see okay are this takes a
distance and it's just looked up you
know from the better definition this is
not some magic blessed method we just
look up you know if you had a message in
the jar or whatever I think jars keep
this information on the parameter names
you can actually just sort of display it
so for for any available method
yeah
also so the the pop up so the pop up was
onmouseover but the prompts text there
so the the distance text was automatic
and that goes away as soon as you fill
in a value it's just while it's empty
but these yeah so the mouse over does
sort of display this pop up but if you
don't want it it's only while it's
focused so if you mouse over the focused
field and it's got a particular
information then it shows it but if you
mouse over some other parameter field
that hasn't got focus it doesn't get
your way so it's only if you've
deliberately gone out of your way to
move your mouse into the focus field
after you've done that but yeah yeah
okay yeah certainly obviously it's a
it's a design decision which we could
take differently you know it's not a
requirement for this particular editor
is just our our choice so just to show
you one or two final things before we
turn it over for some questions
so here I've been scribbling in this act
message but if I just take it back to
what it was to begin with where there's
no parameters then act is actually a
message so what we've got here in green
for in general we've got Fox which back
down the class hierarchy extends from an
actor an actor is a particular sort of
class in our API and so what you do if
you want to sort of have a new Actuaries
you override the act method and so the
fact that this act overrides a message
in actor is actually displayed as a
little sort of graphical annotation here
so obviously there's a programming
language design thing here should
existent be the ones telling us that
we've overridden about it or should we
be the ones telling the system that
we've over
method or both or neither or whatever
obviously in Java we use at override and
we tell the system what we're
experimenting here with is just doing it
the other way around to tell the user
okay this thing overrides our methods
for our educational purposes it's
especially useful for beginners to
explain why is the act method special
from their point of view when this is
some of the first code they've seen and
the answer is over here because it
overrides a method and therefore you
know it has a particular other status it
also is useful because it tells you
which class you're overriding from
originally so if you've got a
complicated class hierarchy and you
override you know some adlistener method
or something like that it'll actually
tell you which adlistener method you're
writing what the sort of the original
base was and just to show you the final
mode and so one thing that is often used
in IDs is things like a sort of overview
of your code so you know you've got this
other little dockable window that sits
on the side and it shows you a list of
all the methods and all the variables
that you've got in your code now
personally I tend to either be looking
at the main window and kind of doing
some editing or I'm looking at that open
they usually for navigation so you know
I want to sort of okay
what methods were there in my class and
which one do I want to go to so
something we've experimented with here
is we thought okay let's have some sort
of you know overlay view they're kind of
useful and then we thought well if I'm
mainly looking at one or the other
why not sort of just boiled them down to
the same one so if I hit here
particular command come on D the code
also actually collapses into the
overview view so now I can see all the
matters that are listed in my class up
and down just skip between them and if I
want to jump to another one I just hit
enter and I jump back there
alternatively if I decide against that
and I don't want to sort of hop around
you just press escape and you're back to
where you started and again this is
something you know this animated
collapse is something we can do because
we're thinking in terms of sort of
graphical elements
rather than in text obviously this is
quite similar sort of code folding and
ideas like that
but it's just trying something a bit
different to do with you know ok
navigating between things and having
this overview of the difference some
methods available so I'm just going to
give a quick summary of some of the sort
of key points of this work and then
we'll just hand over to a question
section so one key thing is that we're
separating content from presentation in
your code so in general in programming
you know we recognize that separating
content from presentation is a good idea
as Michael said why is you know the
indentation in your file the placement
placement of the curly braces you know
all these different things are there in
the code when they should be a purpose
of the client basis you know it should
be I like this you like that you like
that we don't store it in version
control and yet that's what we've ended
up with in programming so the what
you've seen here is just serialized into
xml but of course all the spacing is
added graphically so if you want to sort
of change the spacing or change the
layout and things like that you can just
do that on your client but the core code
is basically stored as the AST not as
this textual representation so you can
you know you don't have to argue with
other people about how its laid out you
have different editors behaving
differently and you don't have all these
sort of false conflicts and confusing
things like that it also means of course
that we can present things that are not
in the content so things like the prompt
text you know we don't actually have to
insert that as text in your editor for
you to delete which some sort of ideas
tend to you know it's just the graphical
elements it's not actually there in the
content at all it's just for your
display and simpler with a lot of other
things so it works both ways this sort
of separation
so we also get to sort of improve
presentation okay you might disagree
with the color scheme or particulars of
it but you can see as a general
principle that you can customize more
sort of what's going on in your code and
you know especially things like the
boxes for scope rather than the curly
brackets we just think make a lot of
sense and just sort of superior to the
textual representation we've also talked
about how you can have faster entry less
key presses required to enter the same
code in almost all cases means that you
can actually enter your code much faster
you can also manipulate it more easily
by having easier selection either with
the mouse or with the keyboard to just
select chunks of code and move them
around of course we've got cut copy
paste you know all the interactions that
you would expect for those those frames
and this is all done by making these
statements so the first-class components
so in the current IDs
you've got characters you have to select
characters at a time here you can just
automatically grab a whole statement and
it comes as one you know even if it's
graphically wrapped onto three different
lines it's still just one entity you can
just drag it around you don't have to
worry about you know this display or
selecting bits missing bits out we also
get better error avoidance so this is
one of our key motivations because we're
interested in education we don't want
people to be able to make complicated
errors the amount of time that beginners
lose on messing up the semicolons
getting the curly brackets out of whack
their code is always horrific ly
indented if you've ever seen a beginner
have a go at it it just ends up terrible
see that we try to work this out in the
past with Java we've got Auto layout
functions you know little hints when you
make common mistakes but ultimately it
seems like just the model is wrong and
when we've changed the model of how the
program is represented suddenly loads
and loads of these errors just become
not applicable and so we think for
education it will be an advantage to
have error avoidance but also
professionals nobody wants to make
errors you know if you could avoid
errors but not sort of lose your
flexibility in your path
your ease of entry that we can all agree
it's for the better the question is just
you know can we do that can we avoid the
errors without making it sort of you
know horribly unusable and sort of you
know in your way and we hope that we
have managed to do that and there's lots
of opportunities for improved
presentation we keep thinking of them as
we start working with this or you make
that you know you could add that
information there or you could sort of
you know change the display and so we
hope that there will be sort of more of
these that we can discover and the in
general is to say once you choose the
right model for your program code
there's just lots more scope for doing
interesting things ok so I'm gonna hand
back over to Michael and we'll take
questions if you have any we actually
managed to stick in our time and leave
ten minutes for questions there I don't
know where to start I'll stop on the
left and come over there yep
I would love to see that we don't know
of anyone who is who is working on that
but that's why we're here we try to see
the idea there and maybe someone can
start that I agree I would like to see
that I would like to use it because of
course we don't program in our own
system because it's a beginner system
okay something to look at yes
yes exactly we haven't talked about that
because we it's not about education in
this session here but our motivation is
very strongly driven by this view so we
work in programming it to education in
primary school systems like scratch or
snap OLS or pencil code or there's a
whole lot of other the block based
systems are very popular very successful
fantastic systems you know eight year
olds can program but the transition to
text is actually a fairly big step and a
lot of teachers are struggling and a lot
of students are struggling and we think
this may be the answer to go that in two
steps you know in this of smaller steps
forward yes very much so
the principles of this adding editing
style applicable to any structured
document so you could just as well write
an editor if frame-based editor for XML
or for HTML or for you know for any kind
of structured language in terms of
programming languages there are some
some constructs that make it a bit
harder than others so for example in our
language we have not yet incorporated
lambdas it becomes a bit more
complicated because suddenly you can
have you know method calls within
expressions and and and and the other
way around and you can nest it
arbitrarily deeply and it becomes from
the user interaction a little bit more
complicated so not all languages are
equal in the sense you know there are
some constructs that may be more
complicated but certainly simple
structure documents you can build a
frame based editor form there's nothing
stopping you yeah
it's not a plug-in it's it's a part of
the Greenfoot system now so it's it's
it's the editor in the green foot system
yes yep yep
yes that's right
so here
well I mean it is a fall for team
projects it's a big change this will not
happen within a year or two years or
five years you know because this will
affect the whole tool chain because this
affects how programs are stored and so
there is an interchange format between
different tools at the moment that is
ASCII stored in in text files you would
all the tool builders would have to
agree to use a common cold storage
structure and that may be XML or
something similar but we think you know
that that layout and presentation should
be removed from the stored structure
because it's not necessary there but it
will be a very long process because you
know any tool builder that touches the
source code you know your version
repository your view or whatever you
know would have to agree so you need
ideally you need a whole tool chain that
agrees on this alternative storage
structure and that is why it's not an
easy change you know to go down the hole
no tool stack in a professional
environment it is if it sketches on at
all it will take many years until sort
of a full set of tools is available but
we think it is bound to be the direction
things have to go okay so it it's I
think it's not quite as bad as that
because if you imagine our languages to
Java as CoffeeScript is to JavaScript
you know it's a so the nicer thing on
the front end but we compile down to
Java and then from then on it's the Java
tool chain so we're you know JVM
compatible with any other JVM library
that's out there so if you build one
component in our language you can just
cool Java libraries you can have Java
libraries
our components so we're at least by
compatible you know almost straightaway
we would obviously you'd need to have
you know if you're editing that code you
both need to be using an editor capable
of that language we use XML as a storage
format but if you think about it Java as
a text language is you know it is a
commonly agreed format that a lot of
tools support you just need to have
another IDE supports you know our
particular XML structure so they
wouldn't be able to pick up their Java
answer and if it's our code but if you
had an editor in your IDE that you know
dealt with our language then that would
work fine so there have been similar
projects that have tried to do a
bi-directional mapping so that you would
actually be storing java in this rather
than xml there's a couple of things
reasons why we don't do that why it's
just a bit better for us to not store
the Java but it is a different route you
could have an editor like this the
stores Java it gets really awkward if
you've got a structural syntax error in
your Java because that doesn't matte
back deliberately but that's actually
less of an issue in professional
environments because if you commit a
code with a structurally wrong syntax
error what are you doing you know you
should be committing at least code that
parses and compiles and runs you know
maybe it doesn't pass the tests or
whatever but it's pretty rare that you
actually shared between each other a
syntax error so that's not necessarily
an issue but in our particular instance
we've used XML and sort of gone for a
different language but the principles I
think would apply and potentially you
could actually have even source code
compatible between 215 IDs okay time for
another couple of quick questions let's
go
so sorry
well we haven't got that built as a tool
yet so that's something that we can't
show but in principle there is nothing
you know stopping you coming up with a
nice graphical representation of a tip
you know this it's already in existing
idea is even with text-based systems
there there is sort of that's actually
one point where color is often used
already and some graphical a notation if
you have it side by side and draws lines
from this to this section that is that
is an area where there are ideas already
out there it's nothing in principle
stopping you from doing it at least as
well in this system
we ignore that so that is is a possible
operation in these so you can drag a
variable out of scope it is it's just
it's structurally still a valid syntax
tree and you're creating a type error
and that is just displayed as an error
as if you had just typed it in that is
related to that we are not trying to be
too over restrictive you know we have
various places where we quite knowingly
allow errors for example we also allow a
call to a method that doesn't exist so
you can insert a method call and type a
method that doesn't exist we could
easily prevent this but I think it would
get very annoying because you know
sometimes you want to write a method
called you know I'm just gonna write the
implementation in a minute and I don't
want to be stopped from from typing
something because typically you know I
know what I'm doing I don't want my IDE
to stop me from from doing this and that
comes down to a very fundamental point
many of these ideas are not new that has
been tried before in the late 80s early
90s you know if you're old enough
structure editors were a fashion for a
few years there was you know a hype
about structural editors words of the
answer to everything
this is a structured editor this is a
particular example of that idea it
failed spectacularly people hated them
and threw them away
after a very short time because it was
really annoying you know you couldn't
leave it in fact visual studio still has
had that a few years ago I just finish
my sentence and then we change I don't
know comes from the you know yeah it
didn't allow you to move the cursor out
of your line when it had a syntax error
in it something like this you know this
is if you just actually edit the syntax
tree you very quickly if you're not
careful become very restrictive and that
is just annoying you know if you do this
so we knowingly allow many errors just
to get the Edit flexible
we want this editor to feel flexible and
fluid we are out of time you have to get
out of the room they will they're fairly
strict with the time we will stick
around for a while if you have questions
please come up to us and ask the
questions but we finish the session here
