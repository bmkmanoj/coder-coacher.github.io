aqua aqua Dixon best practice for
skinning Java fix controls
yeah I'm Henry kvass and this is coyote
Zuma
we are from gooey ganache calm that is
our clock and noise and yeah we talk
about Java it's tough
skinning custom controls and all the
stuff yeah maybe you were visit our
block after the talk and yes the title
of the talk is against get wet and when
we submitted to talk we sing oh we need
a tighter and it's about aqua and then I
had an idea and this is what I was
thinking when I had the title in mind
and I think Carradine was thinking
exactly the same okay so okay about the
content first we want to talk about ax
ax and then we had a forget topic some
CSS which is claudine style sheets for
me and then we want to talk about
elements and you asked about style
okay stop was a quick fix and a are
doing will I want you to tell you
something about eco ethics just share my
experience which I made during making
aqua fix so that if you have in mind
doing your own skin you maybe have some
tips and tricks which might help you out
in some situations so first what is aqua
fix it's a skin for Java fix it just is
the native look and feel for oh it's ten
and it's for all default controls of
java fix it runs on closed
cross-platform
but only for development it's licensed
across license just for OS 10 so for
developing to see if everything's
alright you can try it on other
platforms but that's just for OS 10 so
never ever started on her we never never
so just to show you some controls these
are not upper controls this is aqua fix
so pure Java fix you have several
buttons check
usual controls and for example the
progress indicator the little round
thing with the 50% there's no really the
same thing on all this tents so I had to
think how could I make a look at lie
look like so that it just matches
everything because you have it in Java
fix and sometimes you might need it and
maybe you want to use it in your apps
even when using aqua fix so some other
controls we have different trees we have
pagination we have the tab pane or
tables everything you know from JavaFX
so maybe just to see it in action on the
one side there's an OS 10 dialog and on
the other side there's a coax as you can
see there's pretty similar so maybe you
think ok I want to try it where can i
buy it you don't have to buy it because
it's free we all put on aqua fix -
project calm there you can download the
jar or you just add in dependency
because it's in maven central oh and
maybe some people in the room may ask
can I use it for production and we know
that canoe is using is so it's working
inside that's funny
ok so now when you have everything how
can you use it it's pretty simple we
have a facet called aquatics as well and
everything you have to do in your app is
to say aqua X style and when you add
this line then your whole application
will be skinned and aqua fix so to the
basics what's under the hood that's the
way Java fix is doing it you have a
control which is start by a skin and on
top the CSS and what we are doing in
aqua fix is just we take the usual
button so you don't have to use other
controls special controls it's just the
same as in Java X and then we extend the
default button skin and put our own CSS
to it and that's the whole magic behind
it so if you want to tune your app there
are some thoughts you have to think
about because I will stand for example
has just lots more of controls than a
quad aqua has so how can you handle this
oh you have to meet you need additional
controls and our stand for example has
different sizes too you know it may be
from preferences dialog the buttons or
the text views are a little bit smaller
there are three different sizes and even
this is very simple when you skin your
own app we have done it with a styler
and just give everything OS 10 has with
regular small and mini buttons it's just
an extract that you can see what we have
and you use it with the code below I
will explain it a little bit more to you
it's in the aqua fix for said you have
stylus for every control there's a
styler there you have to get it through
aqua fix then you choose your style we
have sizes we have other styles I will
show you and then you say to which
control this style should be applied and
then it's in your hand and you can do
what you want and all these styles are
done by announce who know the mecca
asking for swing for example there you
have only strings that you can set for
switching the size of a button and doing
and we created in amps for all the
different styles that you have in actual
so by code completion and no strings yes
please it has its own style sheet I go
back to the yeah the question was of
aqua aqua X has its own style sheet yes
it has
we have our own CSS oh maybe I could
just explain it a little more we extend
the skin and the skin has its own aqua
fix has its own CSS and there the new
skin is defined so no you're completely
independent of Caspian or Medina I
started over just using as
spean because it was the default skin
this time and I thought okay being
dependent is not that good because when
they changed something then maybe
aquatics looks different and that would
been wouldn't be fine
so I started over and took every control
and just died one by one and give it own
CSS so that it's completely independent
yeah we have skin stool because of our
some things for example the button in
Mako s has when it's the default button
it has an animation it's glowing and you
can't do this with CSS so for example we
have the aqua f6 button skin and this
animation is implemented in Java as an
example yes we have Java code - it's not
only CSS yeah I will show some examples
so okay back where have we been
okay we have been here you have
different styles for your controls and
things like this are possible and what
happens was within the stylus is they
add some CSS classes to the control and
these CSS classes are just defined in
the aqua fix CSS so there you have for
example the rounded rectangle or the
share or help buttons or the special tab
pains because I was oh as 10 has
different tab pains like for example the
preference menus and these are just
simply tap pains just start in another
way so another example is the search
field the search field is nothing else
than a usual text field who has a
different styling in CSS and additional
code just to get this behavior so when
you start writing your search term then
the X I couldn't just appears and if you
delete the text then it disappears again
and this is all possible by CSS with the
new aqua scheme
so let me show you a demo of this
I have prepared three dialogues the
first one is the one I've shown you in
screenshots so that you can see it live
it's just a simple dialogue I can show
you the real dialogue as you can see
they are pretty similar the icons are
really PNG is this you can add them to
the tab pane yes
yeah not not at the moment we think
about it and I hope we can do it and
we'll do it but it's a moment we have
Society yes it can style the concrete
scene it was a graphics yeah you may be
and yeah you can I don't know I think
for the search fit you you can do a heck
- to edit - an normal Modena job an
exemplification for example but it's at
the moment it's not really supported by
default okay
the next dialog I want to show you it's
just the overview of the controls which
are specialized for example the
different sizes or the help buttons or
we have this pain on the below which is
just a group box and the last one is
usual preferences dialog from hours 10
which you might know such feeling yeah
here's the search field so I start
writing and the axe disappears and when
I delete it it's gone and I can delete
it by mouse and it's gone okay so back
to our slides
and the next point I will give to
Hendrick and he will tell you something
about flatter okay yeah we have the aqua
ethnic skin and it was mainly done by
Claudine and I said I want my own skin
and so we started to create together and
Ferrara is a second skin for JavaFX and
it's a really flat skin so it's as
simple as it can be it's for maybe touch
devices or for the Westbury PI so maybe
you know my box of X project I needed
some contours and skin ik for it and
yeah this was the way recent ok yeah
make a new skin and I will show you some
examples so this is a screenshot of the
if you have skin as you can see there
are no gradients there are no effects no
Ikuo it's very very plain and only a few
knots in in the scene craft it's very
simple it's simple as it can be I think
and yeah it's a moment it didn't it
don't support all Java fix controls but
we would try to support all of them so
that we had another complete skin for
Java going on with skinning yeah and
forget ah yeah we want to do more with
Fiat ah with weave did with aqua fix
because we want to have some new
controls in faretta that are actually
not part of Java fix we want to use some
additional skills for example we've
created four agreements text skin if you
have some text in your application like
text text where you can check documents
and all the stuff we've created special
skins that look like the text you know
from Mac OS or something related so you
could see it in the data ethics session
on I don't know Wednesday because it's
in the demo applications there yeah and
another thing this we said ok we won't
forget her to be perfect for embedded
devices and touch devices so Viera has
an email and you can set okay it's on
touch or it's on desktop and some
controls have completely different
behaviors and sometimes different skins
on touch or on desktop I will show you
another new control for example is the
Avatar view it's a view made for yeah
login dialog and all the stuff where you
can simply pet put a picture as an
avatar into this control and it always
fit and will always look good yeah the
last new thing in faretta is the overlay
pain because we said okay we want to do
it for embedded or the
I you normally don't the application
nominees run in full screen and so you
normally don't have dialogues pop-ups
all the stuff and in faretta we created
the overlay pain
it's and pain all of the complete
application it's like maybe you know
it's a jag är or JX gaya in swing and
all dialogues and pop-ups that are shown
in the forget our skin shown inside this
overlay pain and they have its own UI
too and there are some cool effects we
got clear in the background and yeah
maybe I just show you some demos okay
because I can't move I think we don't
need them anymore
okay maybe first avatar demo yeah you
know only Cesar the two doctors as
avatars and you can put any image into
the Avatar view and it will fit so that
it always look good yeah we have to
forget a demo dialogue with other
default controls on it
Oh what's this it's working what's set
into the text fields I don't know okay
well there's a bug I don't know but you
can see we have all these controls and
and for example the buttons and all the
stuff are bigger than the normal talk
report because it's for touch yeah you
can touch the buttons they are not too
small you can yeah touch the radio
buttons or the checkboxes doing all the
stuff and yeah you see the comic books
and this is the normal combo box it has
the pop-up and choice boxing
and now we can have a look at this over
gay pain
it's another combo box and whenever I
click on the combo box you don't have
the normal pop-up you have yeah and the
other gay pain and dialogue and this is
done by the skin ID in the demo I don't
create other stuff I only add a list of
strings to the combo box and set forget
to touch and yeah that's what you get
and yes you see the background it works
out whenever the dialog opens okay yeah
that was the first preview of forget ah
it's it's not open source at the moment
because it's yeah there are some hex and
other stuff you know Java doc and yeah
we will release it yeah
some weeks later okay the next one is
CSS I have absolutely no idea about CSS
so it's clear each time okay I will give
you some hints in CSS because when I was
when the work was in progress
there were some points where I thought
how okay CSS HTML I've done this but I
nearly forgot and bit of confusing so
let's start over maybe with style
classes this was the part where I
thought oh okay
um there are some special things I have
to remind them you maybe all know this I
class for button it's a simple class and
it defines the look for the control that
you can put your gradients your font
size or whatever you want to and then
you have soy classes and those soy
classes are for different states of a
control so when your button is focused
for example you give them the focus
border or whatever you want to and then
there are here are keys for your
selection in CSS so not just the button
you can put the button in the hierarchy
one more down beneath the menu bar for
example and this is just the difference
between the both
lower points is that the button without
the greater than greater than I think
greater than sign is just somewhere in
the hierarchy and if you use this
greater than then it's the next child
it's completely that the next child and
and all other buttons deeper in a
hierarchy you won't be affected and we
have a great to tell you about the stuff
at Google as calm if you want to know
more about it okay and then my first tip
use global definitions that was
something I hadn't I hadn't done at the
beginning of acquire fix
I just got went on diet controlled by
control and every control had its own
its own color definitions so I really
took a button loop the gradient up and
then put it in there and then I took the
next control and looked everything up
and if you start with CSS just look
which colors are the same which have to
be the same and put them in the root
node so you can use them very
comfortably in your other definitions
you don't have to put the color strings
everywhere the next thing is used to
arrive so if you use different shades of
your color different types of the same
rat just use derive and then you still
are dependent on the same color and
don't have to pick it up every time and
this is a problem we had we have with
it's because when we started the
graphics we didn't know this and I scary
okay I want a pet Acrobat Ania to do
this don't touch this button stuff all
the green one for a qui button encoding
to say we can't do it because we're so
in actually fix at the moment all caius
are hard-coded all the radians and we
hope to change it in future but in
forget oh we did it so it's very easy to
create a green cetera instead
only one attribute in CSS
kaya's depends on this attribute yeah
just right as you know it from Caspian
and Medina so then you have to define
your skin if you extend the skin you
define it in the CSS and as soon as you
put the ethics skin tag in your button
then your defined skin will be used for
the control and now you can completely
completely freak out in code and add
Java code for animations or for effect
chaining or whatever you want to do so
another thing is you can enrich your
skin by properties so that you don't
have to do all those kind of things in
Java code because wouldn't be fine just
for for example if you have effect
chaining and you use different blues so
encode know better in CSS so it can be
better changed and therefore we have
there are style properties and with
those you can customize the skins better
and make them more flexible and that's a
fun effect when we started using this we
saw all the sky above properties in the
Java X controls like the call of a
button yes for example an SEC but you
can use it in your skin class too and
you can if you have a skin you can
define additional CSS properties only
especially for the skin we found out and
this is really correct so you can say my
button has all those properties but if
you define a new skin you can add CSS
properties to the skin - and now yeah
you can do whatever you want with CSS
for example the icons are available
through the CSS properties so you can
set the icon in the CSS and it will
appear in the control yeah to have more
guidance just look at the usual
implementations from JavaFX they are
made pretty pretty good and you can see
look up everything you need there okay
now we have everything and we want to
apply it to our app so there are
different ways to do this you can as the
question was before whether its
dependent or not
can make your style dependent your own
skin or you can make it independent in
the one way you can set the user-agent
stylesheet and this will replace the
whole complete style of your application
or you can make it all dependent on
Caspian or Modena and just add this
style sheet to the user the usual one so
when you style control especially for
skins if you do it for one control yes
but if you use skins don't do this in
Java code if you want to change
something just add a style class and
leave everything in CSS don't start to
define colors or everything else in the
control in Java code I'm freaking out
now okay there are some limitations with
the JavaFX controls for example the
effect chaining or the animations you
can't do them in CSS but with the
different properties you have the chance
to put the the definitions of colors in
your CSS okay as conclusion when you
work on your skin with CSS that's part
four really good eyes and really hard
work because you have to be aware of
what you're doing there as a good hint
just use the reference guide there are
lots of lots of information you might
you might really need I just had it
opened all the time or you can look at
our block where I posted some things I
just realized when I was working on aqua
the devices stuff for example we found
the CSS reference yeah right okay so we
come to the next topic it's the style
manager and it's Hendrix playground
again okay yes this time manager is no
control and no skin and yeah we have
echo F X now we have forgotten our other
stuff and yeah we was thinking okay for
archive X we created this facade where
you can simply say octave F X style and
we could do the same for
forget our two we can simply say faretta
of X dot start for example a but but the
problem is yeah we don't don't really
like it and yeah we thought it's time
for an hepa
api to skin your application and maybe
you know this from swing where you have
the UI manager and you can set a look
and feel or get the system look and feel
out from the UI manager and set it and
then your app for example will use the
swing exa look and view or under windows
windows the book and figure and we try
to do the same for java ethics and
created the java fix time manager it's
yeah it's mainly the same as UI manager
and swing it's an API to to easily
switch styles at one time and by doing
so you can create a definition for each
size as a simple interface it's called a
sync application style and we created an
application store medina and application
style for caspian so implementation
sources interfaces and EXA and fretta
using this too in the next version and
the cool part is that we are using spi
so service provider interface and other
types of plugins that are simply loaded
and you can search simply search for
styles or say ok give me the best style
for my OS for example the interface has
a method like is it a system look and
feel or for which system is it and
faretta for example has there's an enum
cross look and feel or system look and
see you faretta is a cross platform you
can feel actualize the system look and
feel and equi is especially for mac OS
so you can say ok star manager give me
the best look and feel for my operation
system and you will get actual fix if
you are on mac OS for example
don't have just to tell you don't use it
on other platforms we just can limit it
yeah yeah you can set it by hand but if
you say okay give me the best for my
operation and another one we had this
problem we talked with a control of X
goes to do some special access
exclaiming for example for the waiting
control because there's a waiting
control in action on Mac OS and there's
a rating control in control of X and
ruku is there some actor i thick-skinned
for it so in this time manager if you I
recreated the plug-in system so you can
write plug-ins for style for example you
can write a controlled FX alpha FX
plugin where you define the skin for the
wedding control for control of X in a
clerics and by doing so actually fix
don't depend on control to fix and
control 2x don't depend on ax I fix so
they are separated yeah yeah and it's
similar to use here's an example how to
switch from Medina to to acquire fixed
I'm Anita dots tie and then you can set
the stai class for example or you can
search for anything this is a simple
example in in this moment you know that
you want actually fix style this is
exactly was what the facade uses when
you use a choir you say a graphic style
and then this is what happens behind
yeah we have the aqua of X and the
theater for set to but internally they
are using this now instead of going over
the application or I don't know a class
in Java fix this time miniature here's
an example how we act in code to look
react it's it's the interface of the
plug-in and you can this may be this is
the actual fix waiting plug-in for
example where you can define the skin
for the control to fix waiting control
in Excel fix and yeah you only need to
at the CSS file for the skin and you
need the name of the original estée
which is access X for example for
ActiveX we used strings there
by doing so we don't have the
dependencies to the basic skills okay I
will show you a very short demo
okay here we have two buttons and I can
simply switch to Caspian or to Medina by
just clicking the buttons and what's
inside you see it here we get the
applications time minutes tag
application and use the medina tile for
example I can go into the moodiness tile
and just use the medina CSS the CSS okay
Modena is cross-platform and we don't
have a preferred OS for example yeah
that's the time in it we hope this will
help for styling application and making
this more easy let me see what's the
next one ah okay
I could have experiment so actually
Karen's party so we were just thinking
home AK was nearly ready what can we do
more just to offer some something to
people and Henrik was thinking about red
buttons and green buttons and something
you could use additionally to the use to
the usual OS 10 style and I told that
it's not possible to change for me
that's simply because I worked in every
CSS class and put there the colors but
we did it so what if I hit blue I choose
another color so we created elements
those are just style variations for aqua
that are just different colors for the
different elements so we thought about
aqua as water so fire earth and air we
just defined it like this how to use it
you can have it by the usual aqua fix
for say it and just choose another style
so your whole application will and be
created in the element styles and while
talking about this time in it sure you
have the access X time and fire earth
and I don't know I don't we don't know
it we don't have
finally got in for this time inertia for
the active a pigskin
yeah right so what happens behind the
scene I thought oh it would be so much
work just to define everything again and
again but then we thought a little bit
more and said okay what we have to do is
to create another CSS file for example
for fire and just different define the
color not more and when I define the
color I used my tip put it in the root
and I could reuse it in every control so
it wasn't that much work you can really
just go to your controls and change the
colors in the root and then define just
the color in this CSS file and what we
did to you we've seen it in the CSS part
we extracted all Kyah informations that
we had in code like for example I talked
about it the blinking animation of the
default button we extracted all the
current information from this animation
into the CSS so we can yeah just switch
it to Queen by element properties
glowing in Queen and blinking in Queen
so I will show you a quick demo of the
elements
this is just the usual progress bar it's
blue in determinate and indeterminate
and now we change it into red and
everything I had to do for this is to
define in the style class the color red
yeah that's the gradient way change
which I changed to and this is for all
different stars so okay let's get back
to the slides
oh and we have plenty of time we leave
much of time I thought no okay I'm ten
Ric will show you something else so okay
this is the last thing we did we did one
gas control and yeah we did it because
all the kids really are fit and I also
control but yeah my my girlfriend always
towards me I'm the biggest kid so and we
made an emoji flow
I think you know all the emerging icons
from whatsapp or all the iOS and Android
applications and yeah in Java 58 you
have this rich text component and we
used it to create an emoji flow based on
this which text component and the cool
thing of these all these emoji icons
they are defined in Unicode so each
emoji I can have a specific character
code in Unicode and it's unique so you
can simply use it and yeah so what we
did here we see the emotion flow and now
you can set the text like hi and then
this is only yeah one character it's a
unicode character and on the bottom you
see what will happen you will see highs
this alien cool okay yeah and as I said
it's uses text or internally for people
who don't know what text rules text to
us a new yeah control it's something
between a control and
container in Java fix 8 and by using the
text feel you can do rich text without
HTML and CSS you can create you can set
text to board or change the font and
doing all the stuff and we yeah we
extended it for using others funny emoji
Smiley's and stuff and additionally we
created an immersive view where you can
simply show only one emoji for example
yeah you can't type these emojis on on
your keyboard because there are no emoji
keys on the keyboard and you can use
this emoji view for example with action
listeners to to add Smiley's to your
emoji views we created an enum where all
emojis are defined by using the Unicode
code or C emojis and the last one this
is country in work we want to create
control panels react you know from
whatsapp for examples of that can simply
add emojis to your text yes that's one
problem all the emojis I've son or on
the scribes are licensed by Apple so I I
don't know what happens if I commit them
to the GUI garage project there are they
were all on github but I have searched
in the internet and all the stuff and
nobody can tell me if it's okay or if
it's not okay I don't know and so we
created a plug-in structure and there's
an open-source emoji theme at github
there are three examples at the bottom
of the CI and normally the emoji view
will use this icons but if you hardcore
you can download the epic license icons
and create your own jar based on it and
it will be a prac in and you have the
same icon so I can watch them or
whatever but yeah we can't provide it
because we don't know what's happened
then
so we don't do this okay maybe a short
demo
you know it's actually part of theater
yes excuse me I don't understand it's
actually it's the third part you can
it's open source you can it's hosted a
bit bit packet and there are many
artifacts at Mayo central and you can
simply download Essen website - it's
actually fix - project comm there you
can add we don't have maybe we don't we
don't have the complete documentation
about doing all the stuff and all the
different sty managers what's guys
inserts open-source do we have a guys I
think we need a license and it really
the best license for them sauce so no
problem for using we want we want to we
want that this will be used in
productive application because it we
have done is its crew it's part of this
thing so no problem
yes that was a ok great ok here we have
this cool app and yeah when I kick the
button there are some emojis coming to
the text and I will show you in court
what happens it's really very simple
we ask this here it is it's which text
through the emoji floor and first we
says us ok hello this is emoji style was
no emojis and when I press a button I
simply add as this is the emoji Enon
that we created and we simply add this
and this is come on to trip it's it's
only a character yeah it's it's one
character in Unicode and it's edit and
you will see the emojis on screen and
there are there are really a lot of
different
I think most of the people know them
here we have then we go to Java
applications that showing all the emojis
that are currently yeah
part of the license epic emojis so don't
use them
yeah that was a demos so I think yeah
that wallet we hoped you liked it and we
hope you will use it thanks for watching
are there any questions okay excuse me
oh I see yeah I pre a truce with iOS 7
and trying to do a screen and all the
stuff but yes the problem is we're doing
just after work and this is the main
program that's not enough time for doing
all this crew stuff so I give you a tip
just you have to talk to Hendrick and
you have to really get him so that he
says oh yeah we need we need it and then
he forces me to do it it's working
I say Joe Dean's boyfriend I say hey go
and watch soccer we record yes another
question
it's guys it's questions so I says don't
use this on other platforms and Mac so
there's an open source across screen for
swing 2 and we talked to the developers
and they said yeah we edit this
paragraph that we say ok only use it on
swing it would work on Linux or Windows
for development but only use it on Mac
OS and yeah we do the same so we we
don't know what to do at
this moment really weird when you want
your Windows machine to look like a Mac
OS so I don't know if everyone every
anybody needs it he has right but we
want us to look JavaFX
really like a Mac OS yeah
yes
okay so the question was if you have a
default component like table how can you
add special controls like a filter field
or something like that into the control
yeah it's hard to do this we hanging
there too because most of the inner
controls are private or protected in the
skins and so you can't use them and it's
yes that's a point why I can't do an an
emoji text field at the moment because
it's very hard to remove the base text
note from from a text field in the skin
and that's the problem I actually
there's no emoji text field where you
can yeah simply type it's it's hard at
the moment that's right yes yes it's
it's yeah because the skins the inner
part of a skin like all the text fields
and rectangles and so are private and
what you can do you can remove them in
the layout method and at your own stuff
but but you need to find them you can't
access the attribute the text attribute
you need to find them in the in the
scene graph hierarchy we move them and
at your own stuff for example okay
one more question
okay
more questions good thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
