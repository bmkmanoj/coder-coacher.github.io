scrum start being agile i'm peter van
board or if you speak Dutch you can call
me Beethoven the world I know there are
some Dutch speaking people in the
audience I'm a community developer at
atlassian and if you want to tweet
something please do my twitter handle is
here on the screen before i start
working atlassian I've been in Java and
agile consultant for nine years and I'm
going to talk about those years and
those experiences so probably the first
thing you tell us when you sell these
types of this title of this talk was
stopped doing scrum never well i'm not
against scrum scrum is great but a lot
of people are abusing scrum are abusing
agile and that's what this talk is going
to be about so now you might be thinking
okay you might have a point maybe we're
using scrum but we're using it around
way or we are trying to be agile but we
don't really know where we need to go so
maybe we should just listen for 50 or 60
minutes to this guy if you hate what I'm
talking about you can always leave I
don't mind feel free to leave if you
want so what is wrong with doing scrum
well nothing scram is wonderful scrum is
a great agile methodology but it's not
the only edgell methodology and there
are lots of problems with scrum because
scrum is the first methodology people
her hear about and sometimes well who
knows this one that's easy that's
waterfall everybody has been using it
and then you know they learn about scrum
and suddenly it turns into this well we
do in scrum we have a product backlog we
have a design sprint we have a
development sprint where the QA sprint
and we have really spent we're agile
we're doing scrum actually a lot of my
previous clients were like this they had
nope an old process waterfall or
something else and then they learned
about scrub learned about agile and they
simply scram ified their process the
project manager became the product
the technically became the scrum master
and the word out start doing sprints
every two weeks they were going to at
least something and then in the end is
to do a couple of QA sprints and then
they still release every six months but
they were agile they were doing spreads
they will do it scrub that how many of
you recognize this problem that's quite
a lot of your wonderful another problem
with scrum and with actually almost
anything is that in theory it's really
easy you have two wires you connect them
and then it works but sometimes you get
something like this it still works but
it's a mess and you have no idea how
it's working you have no idea what's
happening behind the scenes of and you
have no idea how to solve this problem
again it's something I see I saw a lot
as a consultant people start using
something scram ified or some edgell
methodologies and then they just get
themselves into a mess they're thinking
okay we are doing strength so we take a
little green book about scrum and we're
going to do exactly what a book says
we're not going to take into account how
our company is working how we are
working no we're just going to do two
weeks prints every day we're going to
have a 15-minute stand up we're going to
answer two or three questions what did
you do since the last stand up what are
you going to do by the next stand up and
which problems that you encounter you're
going to have a demo you're going to
have a retrospective and probably during
the ACT respective you're going to be
like this isn't working for us and we've
problems with this and we cannot release
anything and we are stories are too big
and whatever that's because well you're
making a mess out of it another problem
I noticed a lot is that you're the only
person or the only team in your entire
organization that's being agile for
example you're a developer workshop and
you want to be agile you want to
describe more can banner or extreme
programming / ever but your business
users don't care they're like well here
are thousand pages of requirements
please make them and deliver something
in one year
and no don't come back don't ask us any
questions it's all explained in the
requirements who has they had this
problem okay some people one of my
customers was actually it was federal
governments are always difficult they
loved making requirements they had an
entire process for making requirements
but they had no feedback process so that
somebody somewhere making requirements
those people didn't even talk to the end
user they just made up some requirements
and then gave them to the development II
and then they said okay no I'm off don't
talk to me anymore just make what I
asked and the developer team made
something to try the best they really
tried they delivered six months later or
a year later and then finally the end
user saw the product and was like this
is not what we need we can't use this it
draw it back and then a couple of years
later we actually might have a working
program that our end users what so
another problem I noticed a lot is there
is no definition of Dom who recognizes
this one wonderful so it's like you have
documentation or requirements when is
requirements done when is requirement
ready for the product owner it could be
well when I understand it it's okay but
maybe a developer has certain questions
about it or maybe the QA people have
certain questions about it but well
there's no definition of them they just
give you the requirement and they tell
you well this is the requirement fix it
do it build its planets saying when is
an issue and is a book fixed what's the
definition of a fixed bug what's the
definition of an completed feature is it
it works on my machine because I got a
lot of developers and they were like
okay it's no longer my problem it works
on my machine it's qas problem if it
doesn't work on our key environment it's
not my problem what's the definition of
done for an issue again people just
start using agile they start doing scrum
or can bail or what
they want but they're forgetting to
create terminology created definition of
done another problem i encountered
frequently was QA is considered a second
second hand citizen the first thing
you're if you're over budgets the first
thing you're going to drop is QA because
we can always fix it in the next release
because that's crumb that's agile you
have lots of releases and you will just
fix it in the next release but of course
there might be some more problems in
your next release and then even some
more in the least afterwards and before
you know it you have an enormous amount
of technical debt all because you didn't
invest in QA anybody recognizing this
problem okay some people and the last
one is nobody's fighting for the user
there's like three or four layers of
people between the developers and the
actual users and users and this causes
problems because people assumed certain
things and the everybo everybody knows
to assume is to make an ass out of you
and me people think well our end users
will probably need this feature or they
might be using this feature and they're
not basing themselves on data they're
not basing themselves on interviews with
end users but off because of course
didn't know how end users think actually
one of my previous plans did it
completely reversed it was the Belgian
postal services and it took their entire
development team and said okay now
you're going to go to the post office
we're going to work together for an
entire day with the people that are
actually using your application and
you're going to make notes on how they
are using the application on what
features they want and what features
they don't care about and then you're
going to build the features they want so
some companies even government companies
do it the right way but still so who
recognizes this problem still some
people so
what can we do about this we know there
are problems there are always problems
but let's see them as opportunities to
improve because we're agile we want to
improve continuously improve so maybe we
should go back to the roots of agile so
does anybody have any idea when the
first concepts of agile and remove
reducing wastes started just give me
guess what early 90s actually Benjamin
Franklin yet he actually had an almanac
and honored erode he that idly loses
five seconds word of time loses five
seconds I might have prudently drove
five seconds into the river if you waste
time you're wasting energy you're
wasting money Benjamin Franklin was
actually the first guy thinking about
lean manufacturing about how to be as
efficiently as possible in manufacturing
goods because it didn't have software
yet and then ND forth came alone
everybody know the 40 was the first
mass-produced car first assembly line
but did you know for based himself on
what Franklin wrote down and the one
thing fort focused Muslim was quality
control before the 40 everybody who
created the car created manually every
single part of the car was manually
created for this specific car by a
craftsman specifically for this one car
and fort wanted to create lots and lots
of course but didn't want to spend lots
and lots of money on it so he came up
with QA quality control every single
part of these cars had to be quality
checked quality controlled for very
strict regulations so for example if you
had a tire it would fit on any of those
cars
if you had a bonnet it would fit on any
of the scars without having anybody to
need to need to change a little bit of
it or to adapt it to the car because
there was strict quality control and
then came Toyota Toyota actually before
they started building cars they made
fabrics and already in the 1800's they
were thinking about how can we do this
better more efficiently they already
introduced Kasim teams teams from people
working and the factory floor
continuously thinking about it how they
could actually improve the way they work
and then once they started creating cars
they start thinking about well how can
we reduce waste in our manufacturing
process they actually came up with a
pool version of building something while
Henry 40 just produces scars and cars
and cars and then try to sell these cars
toyota didn't build a car until this was
sold and then would actually pull the
car through the assembly line and then
okay they were pulling cars and you were
only building the cars they were
actually selling but is still had major
stockpiles of parts so then they were
thinking about how can we reduce the
stockpiles and there came just in time
delivery now teota is only like a
stockpile for 24 hours of production and
every time turning low they simply ship
in more so again reducing waste and they
still have guys in teams they still have
every worker on the assembly assembly
line at Toyota has the power to stop the
entire line to fix a problem and based
on Toyota we got the lean manufacturing
and now almost every manufacturing
process across across the globe is doing
some kind of lean and waste reducing
manufacturing and then software came
along and the agile manifesto came along
14 years ago we wrote down for nice
values so I'm going to take you through
these values who knows them all who
knows the edge' manifesto first off
okay so your guys are in for a treat so
there are four values in the agile
manifesto first one individuals and
interactions over processes and tools so
it means that we want to have people
working together and that's the most
important thing and the processes and
tools should be there to support them
another one is working software over
comprehensive documentation you can have
the nicest documentation in the world if
you software sucks sorry I want to buy
it I will not use it so you need to have
working software customer collaboration
over contract negotiation again story at
a certain time a couple of years ago I
wasn't a fixed price contracts and there
was a fixed curb fixed timeline and
fixed budgets and then suddenly the
customer wanted to change just small
thing like maybe two hours of work but
oh no said the project manager we can't
do this it has to be a change requests
so then it took like five managers put
them into a meeting room at the two-hour
meeting and then they decided okay we're
probably going to do change requests
we're going to write it down going to
make contact about it you're going to
sign it and then the developer will make
a change so in the end it costs them
let's say 10,000 euros or ten thousand
dollars but if you just did it directly
it would have custom like one hundred
dollars so that's not a job last one
responding to change over following a
plan again agile is being open to change
being ready to change anything in your
design requirements whatever but so we
have the agile manifesto it's very nice
websites but how many of you know what's
written be low those four values on the
edge of manifesto
please one person here this one that is
while there is value in the items on the
right we value the items on the left
more a lot of people misinterpret the
agile manifesto and they think well we
only have to do the things on the left
we don't have to do the things on the
right so we don't need processes and
tools we don't need contact will break
we don't need documentation no that's
not agile documentation is not agile we
just need to build working software no
clearly says we also see value in clear
processes and tools but they have to
support people interaction we see clear
value in contracts because there need to
be contracts sometimes even just if you
want to create an API you need a
contract for the API because otherwise
you can't work but this is something a
lot of people miss first time they're
reading about agile even a plan so
you're thinking oil we don't need to
plan you're just going to adapt to
changing requirements but like george s
patton sets in World War two I make a
plan I think a lot about a plan and then
when soon as starts executing a plan I
drop it but because I thought about the
plan because I've made a plan I already
already thought about all the possible
solutions to my problem so it gives you
something at least to start with and
something to think about but how many of
you know that these four values are
actually based on 12 different
principles okay something wonderful so
now yes I'm going to take you to through
all those 12 principles
first one and the most important one
satisfy the customer to continuous
delivery of valuable software
continuously make the best software you
can make and the software your customer
needs that's really what agile is about
what agile software development about
welcome changing requirements don't be
afraid of change embrace it it will
improve your software it will improve
your product and it will make your
customer happier deliver working
software frequently because if you
deliver your software frequently you
will get feedback frequently your users
will be able to say okay well we don't
really like this can we change it and
you can say well okay in two weeks it
will probably be changed if there is a
back two weeks later it's fixed instead
of six months or a year later business
nit need to work together daily you're
all working at this on the same product
you're not different Department you're
not different silos you're working for
the same people creating the set and
you're creating the same product you
need to work together as a team interact
and then you'll actually be able to
build the best product possible build
around motivated individuals if you want
to start a new project no products find
somebody who's really passionate about
it and let them build their own team
give them the trust's they need to just
do the job and they will succeed they
will find people that will make them
passionate the passion will spread and
then it will get the job done have
face-to-face communication really really
important how many of you know how much
communication is actually being done by
simply body language it's about eighty
percent of all communication written
texts only trends us about ten percent
of what we actually mean
body language for is eye contact all
those things are really important when
we're communicating when people are
communicating so don't put your trust on
documents only don't put your trust on
emails only if you're in a distributed
team well use Google Hangouts use
HipChat video use skype whatever i'm in
a distributing i chat with my friends or
my colleagues and friends fairly
regularly always try to do it
face-to-face working software is the
primary I would say the only measure of
progress if your software isn't working
you're not making progress promote
sustainable development I'm not talking
about eco-friendly whorehouses or
eco-friendly cars I'm talking about get
a sustainable pace for your team
something again I notice that as an
agile consultant was ok we are sprint
was successful let's add some more stuff
in our next sprints oh this was also
successful let's add some more stuff in
the next one and before you know what
your team is working late they're
working weekends just to finish the
sprint because they committed on
finishing this sprint and then they burn
out does it sound familiar for some
people yeah so get a sustainable pace
and don't be afraid to sometimes say
well no we can't do this dis print
otherwise we just burn out ourselves get
a great space and then you can just keep
on going forever have continuous
attention to technical excellence and
goods design always be ready to change
what you're doing always think about
what are we design how is our design
helping our customer it's all about the
customer so don't try the latest
framework because you want to use it
only used if it actually helps your
customer
a really nice one and also a nice quote
I think simplicity is essential it's the
art of maximizing the amount of work not
done keep it simple it's the KISS
principle don't build features you're
not going to use don't build features
the customer doesn't want only build
what's necessary and then improve upon
this but also don't use design patterns
you don't need don't build it ap eyesore
be three don't don't start doing fancy
stuff in your code if you don't need it
keep your coat clean and simple keep
your application your product clean and
simple create a self-organized team
bring your people together around
motivated passionate individuals and
then let them figure out how to work
better let them figure out how to build
the product your customers want give
them the opportunity to do this give
them the time and place to do this and
develops really they will amaze you at
how well they will do it and the last
one and also a really important one is
look back reflect and adjust take time
every now and then to actually take a
step back look at but your entire team
what what you've been doing and think
about how you can actually improve the
things you're doing what should we drop
what should we add what should we change
and X upon these things so
does the twelve value principles how can
we start doing this because it's really
nice in theory and theory and practice
it's quite different sometimes well I
like to compare it with getting several
levels of belts in like judo or karate
or Taekwondo we all when it's about
agile we all start as novices as
children we enter this world and
everything is possible and as national
novice everything looks cool and
everything is possible you have no idea
about the limitations of agile you have
no idea about any rules surrounding
agile you just want to learn about agile
because you heard somebody talk about it
or you read a blog post about it and you
want to start finding out what is agile
what can a jalene for me and how can it
fix my problems and then you start
becoming an apprentice you start reading
books about agile you start actually
following these books to the letter you
sometimes become a scrum demanda lists
so actually following scrum to the exact
letter or otherwise saying you're not
doing scrum you have basic understanding
of the principles behind agile you know
about the agile manifesto MIT you might
not know about the fifth line or about
the actual principles behind tomato
agile manifesto and you will probably
try to apply the same solution to any
problem so if HR is a problem let's do
scrum if the development team has a
problem let's do scrum if the manager
has a problem let's do scrum if support
has a problem let's do scrub because
scramble fix everything if you're going
to plan a marriage let's do scrum there
are actually people planning marriages
using scrum so anybody recognizing this
right so people so then what is the next
step what is the next belt you're going
to become a kick-ass fraction here you
know what you're doing your feel
familiar with agile you've read lots of
books lots of blog post may even already
written a blog post about it you're
trying to spread edgell within your
company
you know there are different flavors of
agile you know about scrum Kanban
extreme programming test driven
development and you tried at least to
apply a different solution to each
problem so instead of having everybody
to scrum you will say well the
development team can do scrum but maybe
support you too can that because that's
easier for support so then your action
here and you're doing great but you
still feel you can achieve more so then
we come to the last level which is
become a master at what you do actually
become aware of the rules there are
there that you can actually break those
rules if you want you can bend those
rules just like in the matrix you can
choose which pill you take but you still
know the values and the principles and
you're actually going to create your own
agile methodologies you're going to try
something new something specific for
your problems for your company for your
products but always based and on the 12
principles and the four values to agile
manifesto and you're going to go out to
conferences and you're going to go out
to user groups and talk to other people
who are doing agile you're going to do
your managers and talk about agile
you're going to split agile within your
company and you're going to continuously
keep on learning about agile because you
know you will never have learned
everything so that's cool I want to be
like more fusion in the matrix where do
I start well let's take a look like this
child at the current existing and
popular methodologies and the first one
is of course scrum who here is actually
using scrum okay and who here was
thinking I was going to bash scrum okay
sorry I'm not
actually I think scrum is a great
technology it does structure for the
developers so developers actually know
in our sprint backlog this these are the
things we're going to do in the next
iteration we have our daily standup so
everybody gets to know how things are
going and we can do a demo at the end
and people get customer feedback about
what they did and we of course have a
retrospective and our customers again
just change whatever they want in the
product backlog so that's cool scrum is
actually a cool if applied correctly
it's really a cool methodology and lots
of my previous customers used scram one
way or the other another one is komban
who here is using combo some people
wonderful I always like to see it as the
simplified and easier version of scrum
you don't have any meetings you have to
do we can do that but you don't have to
do them you don't have any strict
timelines you don't have any iterations
you just simply have to get the tasks
from the left side of the board to the
right side of the board from to do to
done as quickly as possible and the only
real rule there is incumbent is the
work-in-progress limit who knows about
the work-in-progress limit okay for
those who view dot it's really simple
each column on your board or eat status
in your workflow as a certain limit and
only this many items can be in this
state at any certain point of time if
you want to add another item into this
state you first have to move one into
the next column so for example if you
have a small developer shop you have to
developers you don't have ten features
in development you might want to have
two or maybe maximum three and if you
want to start working on another feature
well the first have to fix or have to
finish one of the previous features this
helps your team to focus on those
features and this helps your team to
really focus on getting things done
getting things done as quickly as
possible getting things as quickly as
possible from to do to the dump color
and this is also called the cycle time
time it takes to get an issue from to do
to them and Kanban Sims he wants to get
this as low as possible so this is
actually quite useful for support teams
for example next one any guesses which
one is this extreme programming actually
but pair program is what most people
know about extreme programming but
extreme programming is actually about
taking all the good programming
practices to their extremes so working
together writing many unit tests
continuously releasing writing small
changes in your code writing as little
code as possible to fix the problem but
of course everybody knows about pair
programming and well these guys seem to
be doing it another one any guesses come
on this is easy test driven development
you blow it up first and then you fix it
that's what's that's different available
is about you make a test and it's an
automated test and it fails once you
build and then you build the minimal
amount of code you need to actually get
it to succeed and then you refactor this
to your coding guidelines and repeat
that's it let's test different
developments in like two or three
sentences and one image of course and
then we get some mixes also for example
scrum BAM who knows about scrum been
quite a lot of people this for example
is if when you're doing kanden but you
still want to do like the daily
stand-ups or regular retrospectives then
you have a combination of scrum and
Kanban and you do instrument so once you
start doing this once you start basing
yourself on the methodologies basing
yourself on those principles and then
start trying to become a fraction a year
or a master in agile what will happen
well you'll fail you'll feel hard you'll
feel fast and that's not a problem
because well failure
is just a lesson you haven't learned yet
you shouldn't be afraid of failure you
should learn from failure and it's
better to fail fast so if you fail after
two weeks okay we lost two weeks if you
fail after six months you lost six
months which is way way worse and well
for example I had a company one of my
clients and they loved doing scrum and
it rides to do scrum everywhere so they
did scrum for the development teams at
work brilliantly and it is come for the
supporting and they always failed
because they didn't know how to handle
bugs bugs well the knee bucks camp came
up and then well sorry we can't work on
this back because our sprint has just
started you can't add anything to the
sprints so you have to wait for two
weeks yes but this is a credible
critical bug no sorry it's scrum we
can't do it so the kept on failing and
actually customers started complaining
and then we were like okay maybe we
should learn a lesson from this and then
they started implementing Kanban and if
it was a critical Burke it went to the
top of the Kanban board that was the
first thing they did so it's okay to
fail another thing that's going to
happen is you're going to hit walls and
sometimes people are going to warn you
about these walls and you're still going
to hit them for example another story in
other clients I was hired to be an agile
consultant to an IT department of 18
people they had read something about
scrum and they wanted to have certified
scrummaster explain it to them and help
them start getting it started so okay I
was create let's split up the team in
like four or five groups based on
projects let's do a scrum for each of
these different projects and then let's
do a scream of scram who knows what a
scrum scrum is ok I'll quickly expand
its actually simply another scrum
meeting but it one person of all the
other teams going to disco meeting and
then again we're just doing a Staley
stand up but across the different things
so they were like no no no
no we don't want to do it well the scrum
well do two weeks prints with our entire
team or entire department 18 people
daily stand-ups retrospectives every two
weeks and I was like okay you hired me
to help you but you still wanna do it
like this well let's make a deal I
actually went was going to leave on a
one-month parental leave I was like okay
you know what let's do it like this
you're going to do scrum the way you
want it to do but i'm going to bed with
you if you're still doing scrum when i
get back after this month i will pay all
of you a belgian beer i'm from belgium
saw a light beer and they like beer i'll
pay you some beers but if i come back
and you've stopped doing scrum you'll
pay me big bottle of beer so what do you
think happened I got beer so I came back
and the first thing that was like okay
here's your beer yeah it only lasted for
about a week because well by the end of
the week their daily standard that took
more than an hour the manager was like
talking for 45 minutes nobody wanted to
hear what he was saying and even in the
15 minutes that actual team was talking
people were like okay but does it
completely different projects I don't
care about this project it doesn't
impact my work why am i standing here so
after only one week you already quit so
lessons learned now we're actually
working in four different scrums based
on projects there's daily stand-ups are
like five minutes at the moment and they
have every two days they have a scrum
scrum and I got a beer out of it so
you're going to hit balls and even if
people warned you about well walls
sometimes you will need to feel them
before you actually learn lesson which
is not that bad another one another
story
you will get messes really big messes
all the cables will be mixed up and
sometimes you'll be too close to the
cables and too close to the mess to
actually see the problem and to fix it
so again another clients I had lots and
lots of clients during this 99 years
they for some reason was a really big
company that like 400 developers and
they had a really strict process for
from requirements to approving
requirements to budgeting for
requirements development design and so
on because of auditing reasons and stuff
so we couldn't really change this
process but we could try to make it
agile as possible again pacing ourselves
on those principles but again they heard
about scrum so they were like okay we're
going to take one product owner we're
going to take one designer we're going
to take one develop are we going to hate
one QA person we going to take one you
weeks designer and we're going to take
one operations person put them into a
team and call it scrapped and then of
course what happens well there two weeks
prints so in the beginning only the
designer was working and everybody else
was waiting all the design that the
developers were working and then the
last day QA had testability which of
course didn't work and everything failed
sounds familiar yeah so any were like
okay what are we doing wrong we're doing
scrum we're doing agile but it's not
working we're failing and people are
getting frustrated and people are
actually quitting their jobs so and then
we took a step back and we noticed well
okay we can't change the process it's
there and we have to live with it
whether we like it or not but can we
change the way we actually use implement
a process and then we're thinking okay
maybe we should just see that like a big
can then process with different phases
like first one is simply getting the
requirements and getting approval a
budget for those requirements second one
is actually creating a technical and a
UI design then we have a development
phase then we have a user acceptance
phase and then we actually have releases
to production
and they were like okay maybe we could
do this but then well this faces are way
too big to follow alrighty so okay let's
dive into each different phase first of
priority acquirement gathering let's get
people from every different group into
again gathering requirements so we want
to have a developer won't ever somebody
from QA won't to have somebody from
operations to help build requirements
why because they will have different
questions then a product owner will ask
a developer will might note limitations
of the current technology stack a
designer will note limitations of the
design operations will know what's
possible on their current service so
they can already start asking those
questions from the end users and from
the product owner and in the process we
actually made it so that everybody has
to approve requirement and only then it
would move to the next phase to the
design phase and we applied Camden on
this project process so we had a Kanban
board specialist specifically for
product requirement gathering in
approval next step design again we did
Camden style we had a technical designer
several technical designers and we had
several you weeks designers again they
also soft feedback from developers from
QA from operations so again when there
was a problem they got immediate
feedback and of course because
developers were already involved in the
product requirement gathering in the
design they already knew what was coming
their way they were already preparing to
accept those features so then we came to
the developers and they really really
like scrum so we tell them okay you can
describe no problem so the disco there
are two weeks releases and they're the
clear definition of done and the work
together with acuity already during the
design to actually make automated tests
tests for all the new requirements so
it's bit that's driven development over
there so then
they ship it off to the QA team and they
didn't actually have to check anything
because it trusted the automated tests
they only did user acceptance testing so
the to the product went to the users and
asked the well is this what you want and
you know what most of you said yes this
is what we want because the users were
already involved in the process and then
they shipped it off it was released so
that's not really scrum that's not
really Kanban that's a combination of
different methodologies but still based
on the agile principles another actually
now but only this team is using that all
the teams in this company are actually
using this way of working which also has
more advantages that if people switch
teams below using the same tools are all
using the same processes and they're all
doing the same methodologies and every
time you're doing a retrospective it's
an individual from every single team and
it's about both their own small face and
about the total work flow in a total
process so but of course there are also
good things that are going to happen
you're going to get to party a lot
because now we have released parties
whenever we do a release but we are at
least like once a year so we only have
one party if you release every week or
maybe every day you can have a party
every day it's going to be fun it's
going to be great and of course don't
forget the belgian beer you're actually
going to have happy customers they're
going to come to you and say thank you
you've changed my life I can finally
work with this application I don't have
to click 16 times to get something done
I can click once it's wonderful thank
you you might actually feel a certain
kind of Zen certain kind of flow when
you're working a well of oil team
well-oiled machine and you know when
when there's a problem you'll fix it
your team will fix it it will be the
first thing you will be doing it's
fixing the problems you're encountering
and if you fail you know it's not a
problem it's a lesson we've learned we
haven't learned yet and it's a lesson we
will apply next time so
what's next what's going to happen now
well it's up to you so when once you get
home from Java one or maybe even today I
know get some post-its get some sharpies
get a whiteboard or whatever you want
and start thinking about those
principles start thinking about those
values and how you can apply them on
your problems on your organization and
free will be creative and tried out
direct respective take a look at what's
working what's not working don't be
afraid to throw some rules out of the
window and bringing some new ones it's
all about experimenting and read books
read blogs go to talks and just to get
you started I'm going to show some of my
favorite books on the subject and
they're actually only one of the three
books is about agile so the first one is
about change management it's a it's our
iceberg is melting who knows this book
it's actually about a group of penguins
and their own iceberg he don't get it
the iceberg is melting so yet have to
change it's actually a parabola about
how you can actually change an entire
company and if you want to start doing
agile in your company you will need
change management the second one is like
my favorite book ever drive by Daniel H
pink who knows this one great you should
all go and go and read it it's about
motivation especially it's about
motivation in a modern age it talks
about three kinds of motivation
motivation one dot oh he likes software
so it's motivation wondered oh it's
simply the basic instincts to survive
get shelter get food and F sorry to say
sex to get more people the second
motivation was the carrot and a stick
and does invented during the industrial
revolution if you work hard and you
produce more you get some more money so
you get the carrot if you don't work
hard enough you get the stick get fired
now we're in a modern day society we're
now talking about motivation treated oh
it's not it's not motivation that comes
from outside its motivation comes from
inside int ristic motivation it's about
how you can get people to motivate
themselves it's a really really
interesting book and he also has a TED
talk so if you like YouTube videos just
search him on youtube and you'll find
this TED talk about this subject and the
last one is actually about agile and
scrum it's a really small book you can
get it for free Olympic you and it's
about how swedish company implemented
scrum and XP and well I work for
atlassian we love agile we even have an
entire sites devoted to how we see and
do agile so feel free to browse it feel
free to give us feedback about it we
always are looking to improve ourselves
and just that atlassian calm / agile
really simple so what is i will just
want to let you go out experiment try
new things throw some old things out of
the window bring some new new ones and
just have fun even play with Lego if you
want it's cool it's fun but always keep
on looking at what you're doing keep on
looking at and reflecting about how
you're doing this and how you can
improve yourself and even sometimes get
somebody from the outside to come and
look at how you're doing it because the
certain time we're actually going to be
noticing that there are less and less
things you think you can improve then
it's time to get somebody from the
outside take a look at your process and
to bring some new ideas into the process
get a consultant or get somebody from
another division but in your team and
get their opinions and then simply
repeat do this every time keep on doing
this keep on repeating this so that's it
thank you for listening are there any
questions
so does anybody has a question
we ready
how do you release frequently
you don't have to so the question is if
you are continuously releasing but you
have a really big project wait does that
I think it's just stuff whatever yeah
okay so you have a project with design
and with lots of lots of different
features and also different modules it's
almost impossible to release like every
two weeks well then you release every
three or four weeks but you still try to
release as much as possible as fast as
possible and you might start looking at
well maybe we can release the modules
separately or maybe we can already
release part of something but the design
isn't there yet depending on on what you
want it's always possible but it could
be that you only released like once a
month or even once every two months as
long as it is the shortest period
possible for your team for your projects
they work any order to the view today
Ronnie why he could create a UI at the
end so please
the volcano seconds of each one
so going to try to rephrase it so if you
have partly software and maybe you why
that's using the software do you wait
until to release until everything is
ready y you can already release your
software but it's not well nobody can
access it already but you can test it
you can test you can test it you can
have maybe users working with a mock up
against it and then you can release your
why it's all up to you you can change
whatever you want just as try to make it
as soon and as fast as possible get us
get feedback as soon and fast as
possible from your end users butters are
of course certain rules you can't go out
if it's a really big project it's of
course really difficult but even then if
you look at for example Flickr or
Facebook they're released several times
a day and they're massive so there are
always ways to it then not they might
not be easy let's do it still so any
other questions yes
yeah that's also good remark and just
release a slice so instead of releasing
your entire you why you just trees one
small part not a small part on a small
part so instead of thinking horizontally
think vertically so instead of thinking
okay I have to do the back end then the
front end no think I have to do
everything so a little bit of front a
little bit of back end a little bit of
database for this one feature thank you
very much for sure anybody else okay
come on yes
so
before even the project stops
you know what you have to just give them
a deadline you want you you know you
won't make it just if they want to date
you can just say okay well here's date
but I'm not behind this date you want
the data i can give you date but I'm not
invested in these days yes it's a
tentative date yeah but that's actually
that's actually a different problem it's
because your management isn't thinking
agile it's because your company isn't
thinking agile and then you have the
problem of being the single team doing
agile and you get all the restrictions
and all the problems it's all your fault
without going to go with him first none
sorry
I haven't seen it yet so most of the
companies I work for except some of them
were rather small so we didn't really
need safe I think the company was
talking about with the entire process
actually implemented something like that
but i already left so I haven't seen it
it sorry so yes
yes yes well but it's normally this one
person at a time talking it's not normal
not only one person suck no no no it's
normally everybody needs to talk but
only one person at a time talks
and actually one of my clients it's a
sad story they were all talking at the
same time so we actually brought in like
these inflatable hammers and week
everybody was talking we shouldn't be
talking well if the start asking for
dates and then keeping you to those
dates even if there are no requirements
if they just want dates and nothing else
that's already an indication that there
might be a problem something else is if
they say well yeah but we have our own
methodology and this is what we're going
to do for example the ministry of
finance in belgium they had like this
really complicated version of rep so who
knows here the rational unified process
officially it's agile but the first rule
in the manual is drop everything you
don't need they didn't read it but the
entire rap is like 100 20 or 30
documents you have to fill in for every
projects and stuff like that and if
these many faces and stuff so it's like
okay the thing they're doing agile but
it's a mess and especially governments
are really really bad at this so
our software and we have a defense
contractor they
yeah another example if you're building
a rocket to Mars you're not going to do
it recursive developing you're not going
to try fail try again now you want to
get it right first time but you can
still do it in simulations of course but
so yes some products some products are
really difficult to but then you can
still start looking for having
simplicity for example making the best
you can you can make about removing as
much waste as possible so still some of
those principle can principles can still
be applied to this just not the
continuous release
well I would never if your team is
bigger than eight people I would
probably already split it whether you're
choosing Kanban or scrub it's really the
guideline to have a scrum team you
should f between four or maybe two three
and eight or maximum nine people for
Kanban of course if you want you can
have a team for 100 people doing combo
then you will just have a really big
work-in-progress limit so it depends but
for scrum it's really try to limit it
and if your team gets too big spit it up
and then do a scrum of scrums anymore
gosh yes
yeah get somebody get somebody from the
outside in your team and get feedback
from that because it will probably still
be the things you can do better yes talk
about Toyota talk about Henry Ford's
talk about Benjamin Franklin tell them
this is not based on stitches not for
software this is for manufacturing this
for everything don't don't say yes we're
going to do agile software delivery now
we're going to become agile as a company
it's more than of course people think
oiled software and we're not creating
software actually business users are
helping to create software they're like
the first step in to create software
never already saying well this is not my
problem then it is their problem and
should make it their problem yes
send up some developers thats Sarah your
experience any way we can encourage them
to things it happens that I know what
they're doing
me
well talk to them about this but not in
the entire group take them separately
and just talking why are you just saying
it's good why are what's the problem why
don't you share things you're doing do
you feel uncomfortable maybe you can do
something about it don't you just don't
you have the feeling that the stand-up
is not necessary it could be that some
teams actually just skip on a standard
because well the extinct close together
they already know what everybody else is
doing so it's also a possibility but
speak to them separately ask them what
are the problems they're seeing and try
to find a solution for those problems
too sorry to go further on that one
actually we use hipchat atlassian and we
have a standard bot so you can just type
/ stand up and then whatever you were
doing and if somebody else just to stand
up they will actually see what everybody
was doing that's also something you
could use yes
you
okay thank you anybody else I think we
ran out of time so thank you very much
again for coming and don't forget to get
feedback just present the green button
