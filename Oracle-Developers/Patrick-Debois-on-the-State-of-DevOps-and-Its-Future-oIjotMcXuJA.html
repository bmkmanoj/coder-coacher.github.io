with Java run the first servers running
you know some servlets and all that
stuff I saw a lot of agile people
getting more productive and I just
wanted to have the ops people included
because I thought that was the
extra-mile having the background team
boast I kind of brought that together
and by accident call it DevOps I think
that side guys that the pain was there
these groups weren't working functioning
well to get all over the world
we're running software on top of systems
we don't control anymore and so the real
challenge will be like we just got Davin
ops in our own company to work together
and now we have to figure out how to
work together across companies what if
something fails in a situation that you
have don't have control on like how do
you deal with that so that's part of
what I see as an evolution the pitfall
of any technician is over engineering
and focusing on the tools there's a lot
of brands that use DevOps as the term -
like productize their toolset so that's
definitely like a pitfall the other
pitfall could be like over democracy can
creates a kind of impasse where you know
there's no real decisions to be made so
there needs to be somehow a captain
putting a direction as well very similar
to let's say the Linux kernel where like
a strong leader a lot of community the
other pit full of bees that we see it as
two groups collaborating on a technical
level where we need to really align it
on the business level Oracle fits into
DevOps by their ecosystem of tools they
have you know the build system the code
validation the database and so on
they've seen a lot of environments in a
lot of use cases of problems so I think
if Oracle comes in
really listens to your problems and then
you know puts the almost personalized
solution for your problem and I think
the nice thing is there that they have
the whole suite and the whole set of
products so they can bring the
combinations that will fit your problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
