want to create a new robotics world
creating a new robotics world and what
does this mean exactly creating a new
robotics world we are selling a lot of
robots into the industrial area into
automotive but this is not enough we see
in a future robots that are working as a
co-worker that are acting and working
together with humans in a closed in a
closed area with our safety fans we see
robots as assistant to a surgery you
don't get me wrong making cast is very
cool but seeing that the robot
technology can help in the surgery of a
four-month-old baby this is really
heartwarming we have robots there are
companions that helps elderly people
that has the Alzheimer disease to get a
little bit more kinetic to the reality
we have robots for every task this is a
mobile robot with an arm on it on a on a
linear axis it's specially designed for
for aerospace so it's really
multi-purpose robot here we have robots
that are should extend the limits of
automation that we have today and of
course what we want to have our robots
that have really really easy to use
before I going into further details how
can we realize and create this new
Warrick's world to get out of Java I
just want to introduce myself
my name is Chris entire gonna I'm head
of software and control development at
cookie laboratories I'm here with my
colleague green tadorna people introduce
himself later sokku kakuka is a robotics
company in the line building companies
we have three branches one branch the
cooker systems is a libel law then we
have cougar robotics which makes robots
for industrial environment and we have
cougar laboratories is the company i'm
working for whose modern innovative arm
and making robots for medical and
service environments you see here we are
old company we was we were founded in
1819 eight and we introduced 1970s read
first the first robot in germany so up
to now we are trying to to innovate
because our competitors are the big ones
the big eyes the abbs and Phoenix we are
a medium-sized enterprise with
approximately 7,000 employees now let's
speak a little bit about Google
operatories as I mentioned before you're
making robots for medical environment
you see here an application by siemens
healthcare with doing x-ray with lift or
what we have also technology for patient
positioning this this is especially
important for tumor treatment if you you
have their to position the patient or
his head right into the particle beam
you do this with a robot technology with
our robot technology and of course if
you could cut to the next slide you're
making service robots this doesn't mean
we are making robots for every home but
they may we are making robots for
professional service area for example
warehouse logistics aerospace assembly
all this new environment or newer areas
of
of application for robots so speaking
about creating in your bollocks world
and then how can java help us this is a
larges of you on an industrial
revolution industrial automation we want
to go to a support robotic evolution the
first robotics evolution has already
happened is industrial automation if
robots are fixed they are static they
are really dumb we are now entering
already entered the second robotic
evolution where we can have robots that
are sensitive they are safe that can we
are close to two humans human robot
collaboration see at the feature and of
course the third robotic evolution will
bring a more flexible automation which
have mobile robots with arms on it we
call it mobile manipulation because
throughout arms and the mobile robots
has to interact very closely here and of
course towards the force robotics
revolution this is a more intelligent
and perceptive robot systems and later I
will explain how we can be fighty
technology with Internet of Things and
Java we can go our path towards the
force robotic revolution you see here
like some key features that are
necessary for the for for this
revolution human / color relation
already mentioned that so you can really
work with an robot without a safety fans
these technologies already established
and we are providing the first robot in
in this area sensor integration we need
a close sensor integration because zens
ORS are making robots smart so we are
going from dumb robots to more and more
smarter robots and sensor technology
this one's one important step to that
multi kinematics of course today the
most robots are six axis robots but in
the future we will have robot hands
complex Gruber's with whichever several
x's several kinematics on under device
selfs also is very
important to address all these things
that are coming with multi kinematics
especially if you want to program as an
application programmer those multi
kinematics there are hard requirements
that we have to consider are easy to use
everyone's robot out of the box
graphical programming we are not quite
satisfied if using Java in this
environment Java is a cool it's a really
cool application language for for
professional but maybe we all need we
are needing some kind of graphical
programming language for let's say hi or
easier task and last but not least this
is the topic connectivity and community
connectivity we want to use mainstream
or more mainstream 80 technology because
today automation is a very proprietary
technology environment and we are using
we want to use and we are using already
mainstream IT technology because there's
several reasons the IG technology
already solve problems that we have in
robotics and you already solve that we
want to have let's say if you have on
terrific on the connection to the
community because we had cuca via we
have 10,000 side years but out there are
millions of ideas and of course speaking
about a numbers there are 9 million Java
developers out there who have great
ideas we have a few companies here in
the valley which are using our robot
technology for for the ideas and it's
nice to see how they I realize the ideas
in your potential for software
developers this this is quite obvious
chart what I want to express ear is that
sensors and software we can push
innovation and I give you an example
speaking about smartphones and
smartphone has already 10 or 11 sensors
are on it this makes it possible for
hundreds of thousands of applications
are running or smartphone so a
smartphone which sends us in software
and you see how much an anonymous
duplication will rise further boosters I
already mentioned it community and the
connectivity Internet of Things if you
see the integral sings from robotics
perspective then it will sharp such an
picture we have a cloud robotics
connectivity to cloud is very important
because we see much potential in cloud
technology because you want to extend
the limits of controller software that
is localized on the robot with cloud
computing or cloud technology big data
machine learning these are the keywords
we have their houses I already spoke
about logistics we have smart parts in
some kind of flexible automation you
will have passed that know what what to
do and they are searching by himself the
next robot was free and it was capable
to do at work so this scenarios that we
are calling Germany industry for point
4.0 very very interesting very
interesting yes they are of course we
want to connect to factories and to
smart tools on the other side we have to
we want to use more tablets smartphones
classes or all your devices to operate
in to program our robots Hospital
hospital logistics we want to connect
our robots hospital logistics and it's
still emerging market home automation
and of course we have the connection to
other software enterprise resource
planning software like or claw recipe
and such initiatives like the robot
operating system rose from Allah garage
so let's have a closer look on the cloud
robotics all you have to do a lot of
work here go to the next slide we have a
lot of ideas what you can do if you are
connected to to the cloud
simulation simulation the cloud so that
means that if you want to simulate doses
of robots you have to put the virtual
controller into the cloud you can do
that with using for example Java
technology you have preventive
maintenance is very important very
important topic so if you are our robots
are connected to the to the cloud to us
then we know how to maintain then
maintain then and to prevent them to to
break and a when they should not you not
must know Adam production line that is
working 24 hour 7 7 days a week 50 52
weeks a year so I'm preventive
maintenance is really really really use
case and we have lots of other topics
here we have a lot of use cases
identified how we can use Internet of
Things and and Java and connecting to
the cloud to create business models or
to optimize our business warehouse we
also this is another example the CEO
over there this depiction of a con the
on the left side but it's already
happened that you have smart robots that
are driving through a warehouse in the
parts and packages pellets are smart so
they know how where to go so the robots
have picked them up and through reading
connecting them to these things they
know how to transport them are to
deliver them you see only on the right
side on the videos and the top is in one
of our robots mobile robots of the
smaller mobile robots and on the bottom
there these are huge mobile robots are
already deployed in aerospace and why I
meant they are they are able to
transport up to a payload of 60 tons
they are making the very flexible
production the Dreamliner with tall
things and they have a laser scanners so
they are able to move free and
environment
using also a technology and they also
have java application language establish
they're now coming coming further into
detail into dollar robots you see a
you're speaking about sunrise sunrise is
a controller software for sensor based
in safe multi kinematics or oakland
robot and when you see how we want to
use java yet so this software has a java
tile channel apart and the hard
real-time is written in c++ ginda will
later explained it but we can use java
to orchestrate our real-time control so
it's prolly application programmer he
orchestrate the real time we can connect
to other things i already described how
we can speak to grip us two hands to
Paris packages on to our boxes this is
the internet of thing and we can enhance
and extend the capability of sunrise
with using cloud robotics so so we
decide to be a cooker decided our next
gen controller software will have java
application programming interfaces for
the footer for the user and we have 11
FBI to rule them all you see you hear
lots of robots and I already explained
it that even the big ones that are using
a laser scanners for mapping and
localization program while same API as
any of these robots so Java is very
important for us and we are using Oracle
Java VM but we are also XO mining the
jermichael vm is real-time return java
it's real smart solution and up to now
we have a solution that works very well
with the Oracle of Oracle VM you have
separated real time in one return stuff
so we're we're satisfied with the
solution that are provided by Oracle
now I'll give you I have given you a an
all of you about our visions and where
we want to go about the next robotics
revolution and maybe a small hint why do
you see that Java is the glue and very
important step to to go towards the
fourth robotic revolution now we are
going a little bit more into detail so
this will this is the opportunity to
introduce my colleague Guinta is a
protocol and software engineer at Google
operatories control Thank You Christian
well industrial robots application in
Java this is really new its new very
unjust will field because there's a lot
of legacy out there it's new for
customers and it's it's new for us and
that's until now programming of robots
was done in propria propriety languages
and every robot vendor including cuca
has its own now I want to give you a
little impression
what we mean when we talk about robot
applications in the industrial field
while what you see here is typical
father first step in the first robotic
revolution everything here is completely
deterministic everything runs like
clockwork there's not much sense of data
involved or other influence from the
outside like human beings they're kept
off as a safety fence the main
challenges here are reliability those
plans have to work 24 hours a day seven
days a week the Holy issue and of course
the cooperation and synchronization
between the machines and last but not
least the main challengers beat the site
a time is very important because time is
money here but now a new generation of
industrial robotics begins these
requirements they stay but new
challenges are added and we sink one
step in is bringing in sensitivity safe
human machine corporate collaboration
and connectivity and I want to want to
show you our new sensitive of guts for
what yep a new sensitive and lightweight
robot the LBR ey well don't be afraid
this is not going to be a marketing
presentation for that i'm not a
marketing guy but i want to show you
this robot because it can be programmed
in java and you should get an idea of
what you're dealing with evar stands for
intelligent and dust will work assistant
it can carry up to 14 kilograms of
payload has seven degrees of freedom and
so we have some redundancy when reaching
positions in space but what is really
special about this robot is it has
built-in torque sensors and every joint
so that it can measure forces on the
robot structure and that means the robot
becomes sensitive and due to the
sensitivity feature a huge field of new
applications is opened
now our sunrise product family you have
this lb our evil robot we have a
controller or a cabinet robot controller
you have a operating a penny that is
suitable for those rough environments
you have our software running on this
machine and also the Chow applications
are running on this controller and in
addition you have to sunrise workbench
which is the engineering software for
all aspects of application development
configuration and and handling well why
did we choose Java for robot
applications well as I said the new
applications bringing bring in a lot of
complexity the principle of
object-oriented design like inheritance
encapsulation abstraction they proved to
be helpful to deal with those complex
applications in general RT so why not in
robotics we think that our d can help us
in the same way in robotics that it
helps in general IT the second aspect is
the available tool landscape for all
concerns that are related to application
development so we at Keuka can
concentrate on robotics and don't have
to spend our time preventing our own
solution for those side effects of
development cert Java is widely spread
for more and more young technicians is
the first language they study so there
will be a lot of Java programmers and
upcoming generations and of course the
existence of many many libraries are
there that could be used in those
applications is very valuable last but
not least Java has a strong community
where do that developers can connect and
find help now let's have a closer look
what it means to program such a robot in
Java in this example I want to command a
motion to the robot arm while motionless
of caused major thing
robot should do first of all we need an
object to be moved to robot itself it's
of course modeled by a java class so you
could write robot don't move because you
have an instance of that robot why I am
writing TCP here if I would say robot
move that would mean demotion addresses
to the flange of the robot that is that
point at the hand where tools are
mounted and well one hundred percent of
all use cases you have a tool mounted
here it does not make sense to move the
robot without a tool so when you
physically physically mount that tool to
the robot you can say in the robotics
API to will attach to robot and then
it's logically attached for the API and
then you can define any point on your
tool as the tools and the point that is
the point where the motion is referred
to so the system knows a geometric
transformation between your points on
the tool and the robot and this chain
can be extended so example you have a
grip amounted to the robot flange this
rope this grippa can grasp for example
pen here and then the pen becomes part
of the chain so any point below that
could be your new tools under point and
that also works of course which
workpieces normally cripples are
grasping pieces that goes to the
production and then any point on the
work piece can be moved so imagine now a
large work piece that is too heavy to be
carried by one robot alone you could say
your piece attached to grip of one
workpiece attached to Cooper two and
then workpiece meet move so the systems
knows everything it has to know to move
this this work piece
now the next argument you need here is a
description of the motion in this
example I have choosen a PDP motion
which means a point-to-point motion that
is a motion that is optimized and speed
it's not so interesting what exact pass
the TCP is having in space you're just
interesting in the speed of course we
have all kinds of motions we have
splines for example in space so it would
be easy to let them move the robot move
on that dotted line here to go a linear
pass from one point to another next we
use a fluent interface to specify more
parameters on this motion object and one
interesting parameter is the control
mode normally robots aren't position
control mode that means to have a close
control loop that aims to hold a
specified position or task or or pass so
if you push your hand you push the robot
with your hand this loop will give all
strength to hold that position so for
you the robot is completely stiff with
impedance mode what I'm using here the
thing changes impedance mode is like a
virtual spring if you push the robot it
will move and the direction you push
there's also follows that aims to push
back but the amount of force is
proportional to the position deviation
and the rate can be specified by you by
the application programmer for each
degree of freedom so like in this video
it's hard to push the robot force and
back but it's easy to push it left or
right that can be easily programmed and
parameters of that soft and tedious mode
well the stiffness can even be set to
zero that means the robot can be hand
guided no matter what weight it has this
leads to something like we call gravity
compensation I know this sounds a little
bit like science fiction gravity
compensation but you'll get this guy
he's moving that heavy weight was a
fingertip and next what I do is use the
break when clause to add a real-time
decision to this motion in this case or
break when means stop this motion as
soon as the condition i give you becomes
true in this case I use the Force
condition when the fourth condition just
measures the forces at a specified point
for example to TCP and then check set
against the given threshold so if this
condition comes true becomes true the
robot will stop as you see in this
little demo as soon as the TCP touches
this water glass to robot stops and
that's the way you would program such
same
okay let's get a little deeper behind
the scenes let's have a look close look
at a brief look at the sunrise I texture
well first of all as Christian already
mentioned we have to divide the world
here into a real time and non-real-time
world the real-time world we have to
sunrise real-time system which is
accesses all the devices does some
abstraction of the devices we have our
control loops running here we do all the
motion planning interpolation this is
all done in real time besides that we
have to safety this is a completely
separate process which achieved which
with which helps to achieve functional
safety in performance level d while
going deeper in debt safety process
would exceed that session so I stopped
us here and then we look at the non time
a non real-time part here we have our
application server this is hosting and
executing your robot applications
written in Java it's also managing the
life cycle for example you can pause
such a robot application with your
operating panel and then resume it and
all that control things are done by our
application server it has a connection
to the sunrise workbench to deploy the
applications to do debugging and things
like that and yeah the good news is the
sunrise workbench is based on eclipse so
it's just a customized eclipse and
contains the complete java development
toolkit so all the application can be a
programmer managed in a well-known way
and finally we have services running
here they are also implemented in Java
and they bring us the connectivity to
the outer world for example our own
operating panel you see on top is
connected over the services and here we
exchanging data a lot of
different protocols could be imaginable
here we are currently using our own
Jason based protocol to talk to our
panels so now you see everything under
non real-time side is implemented in
Java while the system normally
completely runs on one of the robe on
one robot controller but we are able to
address more than one device with this
one controller but in it's obvious that
there are limitations you because of the
power and cpu performance we cannot add
too many devices to choose one
controller but what we can do is
separate our system at the real-time non
real-time border the sunrise real-time
system and the safety they must run on
the robot controller because they have
to special real-time requirements but
the chava part could run for on an IPC
for example get connected to several
controllers and then you have the
ability to control all these devices
from one single application so this
system is desired texture is highly
scalable I have your little example of
such a multi-robot application to robots
are controlled by one signature
application and as we are from Bavaria
this is a typical task we have there you
see how they serve a white or wheat beer
now this is programmed in java and we
use object-based motion and every part
you see here is modeled in an
object-oriented manner so you have a
class for for the bottles for their
trays and everything here and you can
imagine how the source code will look
like you just say class
Smoove battle moves and so on
this show you
everything that is controlling the robot
the robot is running in return no no no
time no it's just course they can go
faster it's just to be able to watch it
and not to slap it because you have to
consider you a few things because if you
want to to have no safety fancy and you
want to have a close cooperation between
the robot and human you have to limit
the velocity because as far as robots
goes very fast then you can really hurt
you before he stops and so in a human
Roman collaboration the robots use slow
so this idea minded well the system we
showed you is already in the field but
it's clear that we're not finished yet
we had cuca have lots of ideas but as
christian already said you the java
community are millions of creative
developers and we want to invite you to
join so the idea of sunrise as a robotic
software platform means we at Keuka
provide a core API we have our own
domain specific extensions to let our
API but there's a lot of space for a
third party for other people to bring in
their ideas to make libraries for the
platform for commercial or
non-commercial purposes why the end if
you get in touch go to our homepage
here's him this link might be very
interesting for you it's like an
e-learning where you can get more in the
details of this system questions
order or ceiling design add some code
that of course you don't have
the question was how good is the support
for simulation those machines we ever
simulation environment for photos but we
are working hard to include a physics
engine inside those simulation and why I
meant this is a physics engine stanford
university as a lot of research done in
this field so we have a simulation or in
the next in the next few months we will
have a quiet better support because we
are using than the physics engine to
simulate the impedance mode for example
further questions
great so thank you very much for your
attention thank you very much and have a
good trip home take care thank you very
much goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
