enjoying the conference so far is it
been a productive morning for everybody
excellent good before we begin I maybe
just a quick survey from the the crowd
here who works for an organization that
absolutely does not use open source yeah
there's some chuckles I'm happy that
there's chuckles we run into people we
run into organizations like that fairly
frequently the funny thing is is if an
organization tells them tells me that
they're not using app they're absolutely
not using open source that they totally
are who is actually using open-source
software as part of a deliverable by
actually incorporating libraries perhaps
Apache libraries or or something along
those lines Oh who's using open-source
development tools probably everybody to
okay Wow any Eclipse users in the crowd
okay good Oh excellent excellent all
right so who actually gets keep going
who here actually contributes who has
actually made a contribution given back
a patch for example or or a significant
contribution of code to an open source
project excellent is anybody a committer
on an open source project all right yeah
so the numbers get smaller and smaller
and smaller as we go for is anybody here
work for an organization that is a
member of an open source okay probably
the same the same people is it that's an
interesting thing anyway okay well we're
talking about oh say three what are we
talking about we're talking about
contributing to open source software so
gutter my colleague gunner and I are
going to talk a little bit about some of
the things that you need to think about
when you are planning to participate in
an open source project my name is Wayne
beadon I'm the OPA director of open
source projects at the Eclipse
Foundation it's an interesting position
in that I one way of thinking about it
is I am a manager for about a thousand
software developers that I have no
control over so my job is primarily one
of respond
in civility my I try to help software
developers be successful in open source
projects and but at the same time having
no power to tell them what to do what
but I have a few levers that I that I
can that i can bring but it's an
interesting it's an interesting thing to
manage different organizations and
different organ individuals coming
together to collaborate on software for
mutual benefit there's lots of different
reasons why people get into our
organizations invest in open source i'll
talk a little bit about those as we move
forward yeah right um thanks Wayne I'm
goona i work at Salesforce on open
source offer we have we have an IDE
based on Eclipse we have tooling based
on Eclipse that is open source I've been
doing Eclipse development for over a
decade now in a couple of different
walls of different companies and I
really like working with open source
communities or with open source project
in general that's also how we actually
got to know each other it's because of
just engagement in open source project
and not because we live closer actually
she lives in Canada I live in Germany
well it's almost the same almost except
in the winter so what we'll be talking
about today um I think it's it's
interesting or it's important that we do
say a little bit of context so I'd like
to like give an overview of a typical
open source project in the
classification of like there's many
meanings of this but like what it
emphasized the different walls different
people then we talked about open source
communities because there's many there's
not just one and each one has
differences the importance that a part
of this is how you actually connect with
those communities because like in open
sources is there's lot about
communication in interaction which is
really in my opinion it's an important
critical piece of being successful as an
open-source contributor
and then actually Wayne is going to give
an example of with a view into the
Eclipse Foundation of how that actually
works contributing code what you have to
what you have to just pay attention to n
and the little the little details that
no one tells you up front alright so I'm
a typical open source project they are
of course a lot of people think about
open sources as a source code is there
right so that's obvious but and that's
why I'm saying the critical piece is
about communication there's people
participating in those in those projects
that it might be people working at a
company and the company is has an
interest in that particular project or
it open source that project but it might
be just a group of individuals that have
a shared interest in a particular topic
or particular tools for example the
Eclipse IDE and the beginning was it the
nation of the code base from IBM because
they had that as an internal tool for
themselves they made it open source and
all of a sudden there's a lot of
additional people and a lot of
additional companies coming in with a
huge interest in in that particular
project or that particular platform so
that's why I'm saying like there's
people and of course what happens when
you have a lot of people or even
different companies with an interest in
the same things yes there there need to
be some rules or some policies to to
follow and and that's also what we're
going to talk about here ok so the the
people when when you have an open source
project there's typically a few
different worlds that you that you find
in every single one of them of course
there's sometimes there's this one
person like projects the smaller ones
that's typically where all of those is
in the same like all of those roles or
fulfilled by the same person like most
of those worlds offer
by the same person but I think the key
here is that no matter if it's a small
project or large project it's typically
you would typically find persons or
people fulfilling one of the task of
this the the owner ownership is an
important thing in open source because
just because it's free it doesn't mean
it's not owned by anyone right usually
there is someone that is taking care of
the project in a way that they have it
in there well I wouldn't say control but
it's a stronger but to some part it is
control right there it can be a person
like in those individual projects they
put it up and get her github the next
day they take it down or go to somewhere
else and similar for organizations or
companies recently so privacy for
several NetBeans was out by by Oracle
for a long time and now it's been moving
to a the Apache foundation right which
is also some kind of an ownership
transfer similar model success with the
Eclipse on that right so that and and I
think the critical or the interesting
detail here is that if you look
carefully typically with all those
projects at the foundation it means that
they cannot go away because they are
typically owned by the photo well owned
is a strong word but typically there's
this governance one of the foundation
gives it's not like it the individual
single person projects that all of a
sudden you can take down right so the
idea is that foundation will hold the
project on behalf of the community part
of the role of a foundation is to ensure
that no single individual can dominate a
project or take it away if you you know
it provides a certain safety net that if
you are contributing to that open source
project that you will continue to be
able to reap the benefits of that
contribution I think that doesn't that
should not be confused with with the
right to for projects but that's a
different topic okay the the next role
is actually
the people doing like working on on a
project these are you can call them
maintain errs committers collaborators
whatever you want but they they run the
show right they continue today they work
on code they go to conferences they talk
they promote it they answer your
questions on the forums and they they do
they do everything to keep it running
for the larger projects sometimes they
are employed by an organization and
sometimes and there's also very
successful and source projects whether
people do it on their spare time
successful by the mean of let's say it's
a library that's used in a wide variety
of other project the the third the third
role that you typically find in is and
that's also like in the order that we
asked the question earlier is the actual
contributors that are people they do
submit code mostly in the form of pages
but that's not all they also write like
they write wiki pages they were knocked
because they blog about it that all
contributors because they add value to a
project in one form or the other and yes
and then there's a huge group of
community members which use a project
either in their own code base because
they integrate it into their into their
product or into their deliverables or
into the service we I'd like to call
them or we typically call them adopters
and then there's users like putting the
Eclipse IDE you as a developer you would
be just a user and but again there is
those tasks that that these community
members can propel it is just by raising
their voice for example right they run
into an issue they open a bug report
they have a question they posted on a
forum or even they they even start
participating in discussions how the
project should evolve or they start
answering questions to other people like
they help
themselves that that's very typical an
open source because like you don't have
there's no support team for anything
it's all about sharing and helping each
other so gonna mention the recent
decision for from Oracle to move
NetBeans to Apache and you know I guess
from eclipse guy you probably think I'm
you probably have some preconceived idea
of how I should feel about that I'm
actually really curious to see how this
works how this works out Oracle is
bringing NetBeans to Apache but they're
not just doing a big coat dumb they're
bringing their developers to write so
the people who are working on the
project will continue to work on the
project now business plans change
business motivations change so that's
not a guaranteed thing for the rest of
time but you know at least for the short
term that means that NetBeans is
probably going to get moved into into
Apache in a complete form it will
probably have solid builds and and you
know be able to actually do some simple
you probably work towards a release
fairly quickly and that that's that's
pretty cool and interesting what will be
interesting to see is what it looks like
in a year apache is really about
community Apache look a project is
considered successful at Apache when
other people step up and start
contributing to to the project so it'd
be curious to see how well that happens
how well the community decides steps up
and says we want to contribute to this
project and this is really kind of where
the onus falls on people like us and
well you I'm kind of already busy with
eclipse but you know if NetBeans is
something you care about then it's
something that at some point you may
have to decide if you want to contribute
too because ultimately the success of an
open source project running at Apache is
based on the organization's the people
who step up to do the actual work I have
a question who knows github
quite a lot and that's that's also an
important an important role or in
feature while in the future or
functionality often often community is
like the outreach right everyone knows
github probably Apache or eclipse
foundation and like if you intend to
give your projects onto one of them
right you immediately also participate
from the outreach from their marketing
message you and you also do it on a
purpose you you adopt a culture as well
right github is just that make it open
and fork it and work on something and
hang it out that that's a cultural thing
same is with Apache an eclipse on edge
new you bring your produce there you
kind of doubt the culture as well which
is set by which is set by the people or
that that all typically working in those
communities so um those keys keep that
slide up for a little while longer we at
the Eclipse Foundation actually an
Apache we're very similar in a lot of
different ways and there's some
significant differences as well but we
talk about openness and transparency and
many people think that those are the
same word same thing just the different
words meaning the same thing and we we
regard them as very different things
transparency is the way that a community
works where they are keeping keeping
their work out in available to people so
when you do when you're when you're
doing work you always work through a
public-facing issue tracker
communication has always done through
public facing channels we've it's one of
the I love observe I've seen this where
I've been in bit in one of the IBM
offices and they're talking about some
work that they're doing you know kind of
around the water cooler discussions and
at the end of the discussion they oh ok
we need to go capture this on the
mailing list right it will capture that
discussion because that discussion it's
important to the community that
community see that discussion that's
transparency some organizations regard
that is also being open I am open i'm
showing you what i am doing at eclipse
at apache
openness is really more about being
inviting it's about what we refer to as
a level playing field if you show up at
an open source project you should be
able to have the same ability to
interact and contribute to that project
and not just contribute code but
contribute ideas to that that it maybe
even change direction change plans
change scope of projects you should have
the same ability to do that as anybody
else right so you know if you come to
one of my projects ID Clint at the Eddie
Eddie clips and and someone says you
can't contribute to that project cuz you
don't work for company X you know if
that happens I lose my mind right and
then I actually when I said I have no
power earlier I was kind of lying I do
have some abilities to to coerce
behavior right now that's not saying
that you should be able to show up at an
open source project and say take my code
stop arguing with me right the project
team will have a plan and you know you
have you should have some ability to
impact that plan but you really also do
need to fit into the plan they may have
coding standards they may they have
quality standards right so there's
there's different things but as long as
the rules the rules need to be well
defined and understood so that everybody
can control one example is NetBeans
right netbeans is currently an oracle
project they are changing that that's
going to be very cool there's a lot of
community contributions in there now I'm
really looking forward to seeing what
NetBeans looks like in two years because
you know when community steps up and
people start contributing on a level
playing field we're going to see some
it'll be it could be really awesome
that's pretty exciting and also very
scary because I you know what don't like
competition anyway ok so we have a
couple of you know different examples I
of different open source communities
now github is github is its in all cases
all of these projects the teams are the
ones that set the rules in things like
Apache and Eclipse places I OpenJDK
Linux Foundation certainly in Linux core
projects there's a set of rules around
there's some governance around how
things are done we have Apache has very
formal rules regarding how releases can
be issued github you can open up a
project on github and have at her and
it's really up to you you know you don't
even have to pick a license I don't even
have to pick a life basically they
basically what would get up basically
provides the infrastructure and the
culture that's what they said there's no
rules like project should behave right
or there's no of course you participate
in the github brand because you're like
your project is on github everyone knows
it that's why they are so popular and
you participate in that but again that's
sort of a I would say well light white
model like sometimes communities do just
that and they look very good at it right
and sometimes they go further and say
okay you have to pick like Apache it's
all about projects being licensed under
the apache license that's clear Eclipse
they have the Eclipse public license but
you can also do a license on a different
one but you have to at least pick the
Eclipse license that's not true well the
edl nope yeah it'll be lies there we got
to talk about no um you know so one of
the things she is what do you do when
you get an open source project and
there's no explicit license what are you
allowed to do with the code from a legal
point of view nothing you have no rights
right the the people who wrote the code
are the owners of that code you might
imply that there are certain rights
available but if there is no explicit
license on an open source project
lawyers are gonna they're going to hate
it or love it depending on the you know
that's the side of the equation you wind
up on so if the in picking licenses is
actually pretty challenging and licenses
can be used strategically I'll talk a
little bit about licenses in a few
minutes
but if you find a project that has no
license using its there's some legal
proper there are legal issues with that
legal concerns so anyway so foundations
like Apache and eclipse we provide a
certain level of governance an example I
don't want I'm not going to mention the
project to by name but there was a
community that's recently come to
eclipse and and they're moving their
their software all over into an eclipse
project because one of the the person
who had the keys to the project the
person who owned the github repository
decided no I'm going to turn this into a
business and and I'm going to we're
going to take over the project name and
we're going to kind of do our own things
and you know we're not going to be
nearly as open and the community just
started screaming right what are we
going to do what are we going to do well
they move the project over to the
Eclipse Foundation we assumed ownership
of the trademark of the project so that
we can help the project provide who
provide some legal legal guidance legal
framework for for managing that
trademark and basically we help we we
were the organization where the theory
were the the company that's capable of
actually owning the thing on behalf of
the community and managing it in such a
way that no other single organization
can dominate it right so this leaves the
project open to the community which
ultimately is better for the community
it's better for the project and really
for everybody involved certainly if
you've drinkin the open-source kool-aid
already so there's lots of different
ways to connect with the community
perhaps the easiest way is to just
answer questions i love stack overflow I
actually turned have a love/hate because
I kind of go to stack overflow every
once in a while and think okay I'm gonna
roll up my sleeves and help some people
and I start going through the questions
and it's like someone's already answered
this it's just the community is so
active there that by the time i get
there to answer a question even about
some eclipse ii thing somebody else
probably has already stepped in and
answered the question so you know i go
through periods of time where I just
don't bother anymore but it's probably
time for me to go back and revisit
helping other people joining project
forums and just answering questions even
if the answer is not right you know
that's how we learn sometimes the wrong
answer corrected can be valuable you
know somebody else will step forward and
say no that's not true this requires
sort of setting some ego aside and
accepting that maybe you might post the
wrong thing but again that's you know
that's part of it part of open source is
putting yourself out there exactly and
that's actually exactly the way how I
started is like just using a particular
source project and then started to
asking a few questions in the forum you
don't need to start with answering
questions but like the first step is
already asking questions as I said there
is no like there's no support address or
support number that you can just call go
to the forums ask a question are you shy
like that is it really it's really
sometimes it's really just a sing a
question and as we used to say there
there are no stupid questions that might
be stupid answers yes but no stupid
question oh yeah I I sit next door i use
it for a while anyway i was sitting next
to our administrative office
administrator and she gets about every
week or so we get a support call for
eclipse and you know to find the phone
number that this person would call you
have to go through a website with
multiple line saying we don't provide
telephone support you know go over here
is this the nature of an open source
community eclipse the apache is the same
way there's no phone number you can call
to get support for tomcat now you can
contract with a company maybe that
specializes in that technology and I
think many of the Apache projects
provide you means of finding those
connections that's awesome but there's
really no numbers that you can call and
the same thing for eclipse eclipse is
this sort of beautiful open source
organization which can be very
frustrating because people think we have
a product that we sort of do but you
know it's open source right it's open
source it's built by members of the
community I don't actually that's
something that a lot of people don't get
to it the Eclipse Foundation employ
none of the developers who write Eclipse
stuff right the Eclipse IDE is all done
by people that I don't employ so we
depend on the community coming together
and doing good work but then again some
come some communities actually follow a
different model linux for example links
foundation does employ people that work
that ensure that's also a way for them
to ensure that the core that's at every
every piece around Linux is is around
the colonel and their brain system at
the core is may properly maintained and
the Eclipse Foundation actually started
adopting that model as well recently
just recently right well we started yet
we've started provide doing sue
providing X on development resources but
cielo Linux is actually an extremely is
a really good example though to write
like is the playing field level at you
know on Linux core well yes but the bar
is really high for participating right
that you know you could probably get
access to court but the the level of
commitment and the level of skill that
you would have to demonstrate to get
that is really high but then around the
periphery there's lots of other places
that you can contribute to linux and
where the bar is not nearly so high so
the playing field varies depending on
the technology the Eclipse platform is
pretty used to have a very high bar but
the bar is where the community is
getting much better at at growing
growing into the role yeah it are
actually folks are other people in the
community that start to help make
lowering the bar now the next fight
don't do this no this is this is
actually yeah this is very important
this is not about reporting problems on
Twitter this Queen dress it just
demonstrates how to report a problem
with a particular area in this case the
example is just twitter but let's say
you have an issue that really looks like
a bug right and there every open source
project has something like an issue
tracker or some way of reporting this
and by doing so it's not just write
something it doesn't work that sucks
right that helps nobody what do you know
buddy but if you take like like this one
you take a screen
are you making some annotations say
what's not working how it should be
that's a really good contribution to a
product to a project right because
you're you're you're explaining the
problem you're helping the developers
understand the issue that is causing it
for you and you help long-term you
actually help improving the project yep
sometimes it can be frustrating because
like you you open and you open a problem
and then you realize it's it's it's a
bit of a debate sometimes it's not a bug
it's a feature so it's classified as
enhancement it doesn't get the right
priority but that's actually where the
next opportunity opens up right so at
the development the existing developers
don't have time for it or decide it's
not a priority for them maybe you can
make up a case and get some time because
like you have four or five people within
your company affected by the same as you
work or by the same deficiency so you
start you ask your manager can I spend
some time a little bit and try to come
up with a patch for it that could that
could work as well so the partner
actually where I was saying don't do
this is please don't report bugs using
Twitter they scroll past too far it's
too easy to lose track of them that's
it's not yeah and in some cases you can
not it's not a great vehicle some
keyboarding can't control what's Benno
twitter feed yeah is there's just really
no guarantee that the people who need to
see the / report will actually see it
but don't worry if you're not good at
writing code or if you just don't know
that language or if you'd like there's
other ways to you for example you use
you use your project to do some very
special great things with it go to
conference talk about it like show other
peoples what you're doing it can be as
easy as an experienced report you don't
have to talk about very specific
technology you just can talk about your
use case at every single conference I
know that that the the program committee
the people doing putting the program
together they're always interested in
real world use cases like you're using
apache solr for something for a search
service or for something very cool
that no one else is doing that way go
and tell them about it doesn't need to
be a new rock solid technology just
needs to be a way of like just telling
other people how to do things you can
even run a beginner's tutorial for
eclipse if you want to edit clips con ok
and once you aren't that conference the
important like the conversation goes on
in the evenings you don't go home too
early stay there late night at the bars
and then you meet the people and that
that's very critical that brings me back
to the first p is like why people are so
important open source like if you
sometimes it really is necessary to meet
someone in person like just to see
understand the understand the way of how
they're communicating and then you can
just when you the next day or the next
time you write something on the mailing
list you you know your whom you're
talking to right and the other one knows
it well right so can actually talk to me
while looking for I think it's eric
gamma in the middle yeah that was from a
very old eclipse come picture he's he's
doing the visual 3ds and microsoft now
these are the language serve yourself
right yeah okay this is me well now
let's look into Connie building code so
there's all sorts of different ways to
contribute code or contribute as we've
been talking about bug fixes new
functionality actually a quick question
who uses Apache again who has an Apache
jira account so if you're using XOX yet
that didn't work out as well as I'd
hoped the most many of you had your
hands up saying or using apache actually
have an Apache jira account that's
actually pretty awesome normally
everyone puts their hands down and I
make some witty crack about how you've
never found a bug in apache software but
apparently you found bugs and you've
reported them that's awesome anyway so
bug fixes are a great way to do that
follow ups right let's see what we got
here following conventions that the
project establishes can there's actually
a lot of things going on that need to be
thought of one of the cool features that
people don't know it exists in Eclipse
actually is a
a save action where you can tell eclipse
whenever they save a file automatically
do all of this stuff format the code
turn things into lambdas where it's
possible you know put this to me I think
you can actually put a trademark you put
a people to license header in a file
don't think that's actually one of them
separate but there's a whole bunch of
different things that you can do it with
that which which which helps you with
the project can establish these
conventions and encourage and force
people to actually use them most most
projects I know have source code
formatting rules and some projects are
really picky about whether you use
spaces or tabs I find discussions like
that very bizarre but that's the kind of
thing you need to know I've seen patches
rejected because you use two spaces
instead of four and it seems silly but a
certain level of consistency is
important and if that's what the project
team decides is the definition of the
level playing field that's sort of why
that's kind of what you have to do patch
sizes are problem to our consideration
smaller patches are easier for project
team members to absorb and confirm and
contribute if you show up with ten
megabytes of code and go here and walk
away chances are that contribution just
is not going to get accepted to give you
an example the I worked a few years ago
I worked at a sub and who runs the milam
project and the rules we had said there
is that the lines of code in in a girl
in a patch that you submit or gallery
you should not exceed 300 and the reason
for the reason is pretty simple it's not
like it's really just like we figured
out that if the changes or the get
commits that I'll propose are around
that time frame it's easy to review them
in less than 10 minutes like in less
than a few minutes so you can actually
get a lot done in a much shorter time
frame but as soon as they exceed a
certain level of lines of bro you
actually need to switch context I'm
talking about in the way of the
committers the existing p
that are reviewing your code so they
have to stop there suspender Brook and
now get actually into into the code
change to do the review the pull request
whatever right so that's just an example
but then again those rules and it's
level of playing field they're not set
in stone for every project sometimes
well actually the projects are open for
them right it's more about don't try to
change the coding conventions of the
project with your very first
contribution right but is yourself in
some some time ago they get the Eclipse
get client implementation right a car
dealer showed up who actually did a
couple of pages and then recommended or
made a suggestion to change the code
formatting from their setting to
different dating because his personal
opinion was it's it's it's easier
readable or whatever right so and he
actually managed to convince other
contributors which in the end also
convinced the existing committers right
because they like if they see the
majority of the cordilleras actually
likes it much better then they started
they accepted that that by the way i
would also classify as a thing of
openness from a project perspective
right don't like just because you
personally do it that way all the time
don't try to enforce it on your own open
source project if if you also want to be
open for contributions right so patches
of a certain size to so 300 is actually
three hundred lines of code is an
interesting metric and it's a real again
it's really about how much energy you
have to put into it certainly as larger
contributions if you need to make a much
larger contribution to the project and
larger is sort of a nebulous term and it
means something different in all
different sorts of contexts saying
here's a bunch of code take this is a
lot different from here's a bunch of
code and by the way I intend to stick
around and help you maintain this code
all right a project team may balk at
taking on well in fact if they don't
there's a problem taking on a great deal
of new code is a great deal of
responsibility and is a liability for
the project moving for
it needs to be supported so project
teams that are thinking about the future
which is what you want are also thinking
when contributions come of code come
they must come with development
resources as well so just keep that in
mind into it so small patches just have
at it right and you know I gunner was
saying it's certainly within Apache it
certainly within eclipse I think a lot
of the Linux Foundation projects kind of
work this way too although there's a
little less like a little less rigid
rigidity there you have to earn your way
in you earn your way to responsibility
and the way you do that is by submitting
patches that show the project team that
you get it that you that you will work
with them and and that you know adding
you to the team is a good thing and
after a after establishing a pattern of
making these quality contributions the
project team will invite you to join and
become a contributor make sure a
committer a devout proper develop or
full full full privilege developer on
the project a lot of projects won't
accept the patch if it doesn't come with
unit tests this is something
traditionally we've done very very well
in eclipse and most of our project to a
very very good job of this is having
really solid unit test coverage in fact
showing with a patch that is just tests
is very often you know very happily
received contribution proper comments in
code this is the this is herb the only
important sort of I you know I think
obvious things right your do any code
that you put into an open source project
needs to be supported for potentially a
very very long time we've started
working with an organization that puts
like I say devices but they're a little
larger than this devices into into
business into service that are expected
to last for 70 years running software
that my grandchildren
great-grandchildren will be supporting
great-great-grandchildren oh my goodness
anyway this you know these are the
organizations like this have realized
that open source is really the only way
that they can do tools to support the
cert the systems that are running in
these rather large devices that fly
so by putting your tools in open source
you have a fighting chance of supporting
you know supporting it when you know
business models tend to work on nine or
ten year cycles and you know software
that you use to build things tends to go
away by putting in an open source
somebody else can come in and pick it up
and move the project forward but having
good unit tests having good code
comments when you start talking about
supporting something you know how hard
is it when you come back to something
you haven't looked at for six weeks or
six months how hard is it to figure out
you know get to reacquaint yourself with
that code now do that 60 years right
like then of course it's not going to be
you well maybe it will life spans are
increasing of course I guess if I'm
still working nevermind I'm tangent Inge
so these things are really important to
open source projects right making sure
that the code that comes in is actually
supportable over long extended periods
of time this is a key one which is sort
of hard to this is a discipline that
takes it takes a lot of work don't mix
up things and commits make your commits
and this is sort of just generally good
for development anyway make your commits
focus on one thing right while you're
doing it you're doing some work on one
area of the code you think oh oh I
forgot to put a license header over here
in this unrelated file i'll just add
that quick and jump that into the same
commit don't do that all right make
those two separate commits right don't
make sure your commits are focused on
one one particular thing and again
that's about long-term support at some
point somebody may need to go through
and figure out what happened get does a
great job for example at blame tracking
when when was this line added and having
that having it that attach to a commit
with a proper commit message it will be
very very valuable in five years when
you're revisiting it or again even three
months they want her to Milan by the way
if you really care about you know making
it easy to find stuff need to
investigate that but I don't want to
tangent as come to the Eclipse
Foundation boots and i'll show you Milan
communication is huge the
the separate commits thing also helps
with like for example the what I
mentioned earlier the 300 line change
rule or kind of guideline that were
talking if you if you're on a bugfix
you're fixing an issue and you realize
and oh there's an interesting or
refractory I can do if you make that a
separate clean it and even if the
perfect drink affects a lot more lines
of code than at 300 but if it's just
about the refactoring it's also much
easier to review because you actually
look at the quarry fracturing and then
well I personally that's the way I do it
then I do a few inspections of the
refactoring meant finding other files
and then I generally trust that it's
really just the refectory right and it's
not confused with actual bug fix it
requires discipline I was also like I
was also in the early days doing much
larger commits and doing all in ones and
then got pushed back a couple of times
by people on the on the particular
project as I learned it halfway well
we're talking too long yeah that's great
the screen saver is telling you that
telling us it's time to move on sokkia
communication is huge intellectual
property management is something that
software developers really I don't want
to say hey because i think you know you
have to actually you know know something
exists to hate it most of us really
don't think about intellectual property
rules and different open source projects
have different rules about opens so
about intellectual property apache and
eclipse you know my to my two favorite
again and i like them in the other order
but anyway something again most people
don't understand is when you make a
contribution of code to both of those
projects you are the owner of that
contribution right so if you add some
code that is your code or are actually
frankly more likely at your employer's
code you probably have an employment
contract that says all of your
intellectual property that you generate
is owned by the employer but anyway what
you're doing is you are retaining
ownership of that code you are
contributing it to the project under a
license terms right so generally it's
the same terms that the project itself
works under so most of our projects do
do work under the Eclipse public license
I want to say all Apache
Raj X use the Apache License one verbose
like most likely Apache License version
2 when you contribute code to those
projects you are can contribute you
retain ownership but you are a licensing
the project to use your code and part of
that license is the project has the
ability the legal ability to
redistribute that code and distribute it
I let others others use it that's an
important distinction not all open
source projects work that way some
projects require that you sign a
contributor license agreement that that
basically states in legal terms that
your contributions to the project become
the property of some other legal entity
right so the Eclipse Foundation actually
doesn't own very much of the Eclipse
code it owns the stuff that I've
contributed because of my employment
contract but that's that's about it when
I guess make al there's a few of us
there's a few of us that have
contributed here and there so this is
these are in questions these are
important questions who owns the code
you wrote when you show up to an eclipse
pride sorry when you show up to an open
source project and that you know again
how is it license now how is it license
depends on our has a big impact on how
it can be used you may have heard of
recent lawsuits of code that's been
distributed under the GPL license white
finding its way into products that
didn't follow the terms of the GPL
license right the GPL license has this
keep it very low low level or high level
if you use GPL code and link to GPL code
your code itself must be distributed in
open source right so if you have a
product and you're using GPL code guess
what you may have to be doing right you
may have to actually make your source
code of your product available pub in a
public means the Eclipse public license
doesn't do that the Apache License
doesn't do that MIT BSEE there although
there's all sorts of different licenses
out there that have various levels of
complexity one of the funnier things
that actually happened is one of the
things we do with the Eclipse Foundation
is we actually have a whole team that
vets contributions to make sure that
the the people who wrote the code said
the say they wrote the code actually did
make sure that they actually have
granted the rights necessary for us to
distribute the code under the license of
stuff we have a whole team that takes
care of this sort of thing one of the
things that they came across in a in a
in a contribution was a license with a
customized license that had an extra
line that said this code can be used for
good but not for evil apparently the
definition of good and a definition of
eagle the evil is legally ambiguous so
if you you know you're trying to be
clever and you you say hey this code is
to be used for good and not for evil
chances are there's organizations in the
world that can't use your code I love
that evil is legally ambiguous but
anyway so we've run into different kinds
of things like that some projects are
you even allowed to contribute we've
talked we've labored that one a little
bit that's important right you know yeah
especially in larger organizations like
if you book for a larger company check
there's a process that you have to
follow as well to actually make the code
you wrote available to an open source
project I can speak for us we do have a
process and a lot of there's actually a
group called the to do group which helps
organizations or companies to do an
outreach or like get Pamela with those
participation and open source and
typically what is there's a process of
was a few steps that you need to follow
which includes legal review and other
reviews to make a particular piece of
code that you wrote open source and even
for for a patch if you just submit a bug
fix you need to chill like just check
before if there's some approval that you
have to get or some company make this
really easy for people so make it very
very hard unfortunately so yeah so
before you contribute to an open source
project make sure your employer is okay
with what you're doing and in fact so
for to be a comic a committer on an
eclipse project we actually require that
your employer provide us with paper
documentation saying that you have
certain rights and privileges they grant
you the ability to do this are you
allowed to
licensed the code you are submitting so
again that comes to ownership if I own
it I can do whatever I want with it am I
giving up ownership or their other
provisions some sort just against other
thing about some projects have a legal
document it's are fairly lightweight
legal process of either a contributor
license agreement or a contributor
agreement there is sort of a trend and I
want to be careful here there's a trend
when you see in a contributor license
agreement those tend to have some clause
about you assigning ownership
reassigning ownership of the code not
entirely universally but there seems to
be that kind of is a trend we in fact
actually stopped we had a contributor
license agreement and we've turned it
into just a contributor agreement
because of the because of this tendency
anyway so and the process to follow yeah
that that's not just that's not just
about the actual code that you're
contributing most of the time some
projects also have a very particular
process about tracking the dependencies
they rely on right I keep mentioning the
example eclipse because that's where I
have the most experience in but apache
sm similar stuff when you add a new
feature or let's say even as part of
your picture you want to use a new
library as talk to the projects before
sometimes they don't do it for specific
reason because they don't want to have
too many dependencies but sometimes in
the example of eclipse it requires
actually doing performing a few
additional steps to get that usage of
the third party library being approved
yeah we find we actually are we have a
legal team that reviews things and they
find problems with with contributor
permissions and what things things that
would prevent a product that would
prevent open source code from being used
in commercial products for example so
anyway these are these are just
considerations the big question is about
all this stuff is why should you care I
actually asked a series of fairly
leading questions at the beginning
we was a gentleman named Tony valetti a
researcher at Carleton University he
came up with this open-source maturity
model I found it very interesting most
organizations are you know certainly
when we first started doing this 15 17
years ago and of course I guess the new
foundation has been around for a lot
longer than that a lot of organizations
basically just denied they were using
open source at all we don't use open
source today I think it'd be relatively
hard to find an organization that
doesn't use open source in some capacity
but a lot of organizations think that
they don't use open source and they
probably do at some point you start
adopting open source software start
sneaking in it's usually the technical
people that do this I don't want to go
and re-implement a whole bunch of
functionality it already exists why on
earth would I do that I have all sorts
of other things to do so I'll go and
find an open source solution and bring
it in very often that first entry is
kind of clumsy for an organization it
certainly things like licensing
considerations often aren't thought
thought out too much but over time a
team will start adopting these
open-source products projects at some
point though they start to find
deficiencies that need to be fixed and
again the trend tends to be is okay fine
let's pull the source code will fork it
will do some customizations locally get
makes this very easy back in the day you
know back ten years ago when we're doing
this stuff with CVS that was incredibly
painful not so much but not so painful
but it's still kind of painful every
once in a while you know the code base
with get you can rebase and you can do
all sorts of clever clever things and
gets very helpful but every once in a
while the code base just moved so much
that you're going to spend days rebasing
your changes on top of top of the those
changes so at some point you start say
this is foolish let's give this back to
the open source project and let let's
maintain it there let them maintain it
and this where you start getting into
the problems we were talking about
earlier if it's a small patch fine if
it's something more significant than you
have to start thinking about
contributing resources which again is
the next step in the evolutionary chain
and it's still at this point this is
still
mostly driven by very technical
considerations right this is the
technical people this is the developers
deciding that we're we're doing this now
we need to start actually contributing
back maybe start working on your regular
contributor start becoming a committer
on the project and then at some point
you start to become the project lead at
some point you start to open up your
role create your own open source
projects and you start to contribute
collaborating with the community again
we're still very very much in a
technical people driven stage at this
point at some point though suddenly open
source becomes strategic right suddenly
your organization depends very heavily
on open source projects and the
continued existence of those open source
projects becomes important to the
organization this is when your
organization this is when the business
side starts to kick in and start to say
this open source of sir stuff is
important to us maybe we need to become
a member in that foundation become a
member of the Apache foundation become a
member of the Eclipse Foundation become
a member of the linux foundation so that
we can contribute in other ways to
ensure that the wheels stay on these
open source projects right so you
finally that's where companies like IBM
invest heavily in a lot of open source
communities and they they put in as
weird it's weird to think about right
and this but it makes sense i know that
hopefully you hopefully i laid out the
path properly but IBM and wind river and
gets its until now so Microsoft got to
be careful there lots and lots and lots
of very very large named large companies
that we all know put development
resources onto these projects they have
committers and contributors coming out
their ears on these projects and they
contribute financially so that they can
give software weight to the world right
and the reason is is because they depend
they've made a strategic decision on the
to use this software the software is
important part of their bottom line
right so anyway why do you care well it
really depends how much you care really
depends how far along you are on that
path that I just described right if
opens so if you're using open source
then you probably don't care about you
know the level playing field if you just
want to use a little help answers but
you really should care about the
licensing stuff that's pretty important
if you are contributing to a project you
really do need to think about the
contributor license agreement if you are
giving code to an open source project
and they don't ask you for some kind of
contributor agreement chances are
they're going to you know that maybe who
knows what they're going to do with your
source code you know you have you you
know that your property or are you
assigning the guy said earlier are you
assigning ownership of your property to
somebody else so again depending on how
far along you are on this chat a chart
you know the level of how much you care
changes well and and the other question
is like if they just take your code you
sent them my email they take your coat
that to put it in you don't know
actually what code you're already using
where it came from right so as part of
the code review that the Eclipse IP team
is doing there were a couple of
interesting libraries that we wanted to
use but just couldn't use even though
the license was compatible to turn out
that they had no good province model to
show like they have really a system of
record or even records of who to code or
who actually contributed code to that
particular project so you don't know
like if you don't have a if you can't
prove your opponents as a project
yourself right chances are there's code
in an open source project that isn't
really allowed to be in there that's the
other that's all there are other reason
why you should care when you contribute
to an open source project or when you
are an open source project and are
accepting contributions that you may get
in some form of process like whether
it's be like I said there's there's some
sort of record that documents that this
and that basically asked the author or
the submitter of you basic questions
which most of the organization's these
days do by the country tubular
agreements so I think with that unless
you have some other comments I think
we're done I thank you for your
attention today I think this look based
on the looks on faces and the occasional
nods that I'm saying I think this was
valuable
if nothing else I would like to take
away to be if you're not already
contributing to open source please do
like I'm certain that you're finding
problems you have to I just know there's
no perfect software out there you know
there's and there's a great opportunity
it does require putting yourself out
there you have to you know and in fact
actually it's a find it interesting some
organizations actually as part of a
hiring process now we're looking for
evidence of contribution to open source
because this is a way of taking a look
at some contributor or something they
work that somebody is done and taking
you know under understanding the their
their skill level based on that I hope
nobody looks at my code for that purpose
well your coders all over the place yeah
I know some of it's a mess anyway so a
are there any questions yeah
so choose a licensed com is probably
about as close as you're going to get to
that yeah so that's a that's an open oh
that's a github project github is a is
actually taking some interest in this so
when you create a new did hub repo now
one of the options there is add a
license and it all comes from choose a
license so the question was is there
some website or some place where to go
to to get some easy terms for or common
terms for what licenses do because like
you don't have all the time to read
through every particular technical or
legal detail of the license but there's
like one website is 20 license com which
actually tries to express what the
license is all about in particular in
easy terms they distill it yeah they
just still it down other questions a
question back here yeah oh ok excellent
same question
how can you start out participating in
any open source project I well I think
that the simple answer is start by
communicating right so engage with the
project team right project team should
have a communication channel so monitor
that channel see find out what the
values are for that project most
projects will have a getting started
page if you go to their find their
project website and they would have some
advice should hopefully have some advice
for how you can contribute another thing
it's sort of a trend that's happening
now and we required of all of our
projects is to put in the root of all
software repositories a contributing
just a file named contributing in all
caps that says how do you know gives
people instructions how do you find our
issue tracker how do you find our
communication channels how do you build
or those kinds of things
hmm
well so so I think you've asked two
different questions so you want to
participate in an existing project on
github or create a new one so so github
is actually a pretty fluid space right
so different projects do have the rules
vary greatly right but i think you know
again I think I think my earlier advice
is probably the best is communicate
right connect with the project team
follow what they're doing if it's a get
a project for kit and maybe you can you
can start working on your own your own
patches and an issue pull requests back
to the project you know that could be
that's a very simple way of
communicating I would strongly recommend
a void going away for three weeks and
coming back with a monster contribution
right start off with simple things we do
hackathons and you know simple things
like provide translations right so I'm
going to hackathon in Germany in a
couple of weeks and one of the things is
we're gonna make it real easy people
people to show up and help us translate
some of the strings that are in Eclipse
right it doesn't have to be big you know
it could just be simple like answering
questions or asking really good
questions that you some people think
about that even asking really good
questions on a projects forum is a great
way to participate because if you're
having a question that needs to be
answered you know you're the tip of the
iceberg right somebody else probably has
that question too and and you know you
know if you ask questions that show that
you've done a little bit of homework
right so if you know you know when you
should when you show up to an open
source project and say how do I make it
go that's not going to be received
really well but if you say I was looking
at this issue and I you know I found
this bug report and the bug report said
you tried a couple of different things I
would like you know to add my input or
something along light show that you've
actually done some research project team
should if they care about their project
respond to that but there's really no
there's no single answer like some
project some open source project teams
are going to ignore you and there's just
nothing that we can do about that right
we could for kit and
for kitten yet start your own depend on
their license of course if you're going
to fork something make sure you confirm
the license other questions yes
okay so if you do create your own open
source project how do you go about
making a contributor agreement I suggest
theft no in fact contributor agreements
themselves are actually under license
right so I've seen projects use the net
vanetti project has 1 i've seen projects
use that as their own you can grab the
Eclipse committer you can grab bars use
ours right we even provide
infrastructure to help people sign them
for a long time we add a rule where any
contribution needed to have in in our
bugzilla system you need to actually
make a statement of you know ah I own
this code I have rights to distribute
this code under the project license and
gosh what was the third one my employer
knows what I'm do I think I just said
that one anyway we used to have a just a
statement that you had to put with your
contribution so maybe make it on you
could that the simplest possible thing
is on the github pull request ask the
individual to make a statement that says
these five things or these three things
or whatever you know please confirm that
you are able to distribute it is under
the content of the the terms of the
license but yeah I think you know use
ours use the neti projects that the
Linux Foundation had in fact we're using
linux foundation's a certificate of
what's another certificate developers
certificate of origin yeah we just use
that in our ECA or eric are there's our
contributor agreement why reinvent the
wheel it's licensed we just followed
their license how we doing for time well
we're up okay thank you very much for
your attention thank you for staying
