from the Oracle developer community and
I'm here with Ravi Pinto
hey Jim Oracle and I can see there's
hundreds of people lots of people yeah
so Ravi you just came off the keynote
stage yes that's right before we start
with you know what do you do at Oracle
so Jim I'm product manager I'm part of
engineering and I do talk to customers
to our partners about the Oracle cloud
platform some of the technologies that
we talked about today is a subset of
these services that we have so I talked
to talk to customers and partners about
this and also present that at public
forum right so I'm interested just
initially what your impressions are here
because this is a packed house and we
were up in high said last week yes pack
yeah so Bangalore has always been the
the IT capital you know for for India
and the bus here in terms of you know
trying to uptake understand what
technology trends are what is happening
is much more so you can feel the vibe in
the in the environment it's palpable
yeah yeah I had a lot of people come up
after the keynote which is why I got
delayed coming over here but you can you
can feel that buzz in the air here yes
I'm actually glad you were delayed
because we had some configuration issues
so thank you for that ok now I was in
your keynote yeah it was very good I
think you said some things that really
interested me and so I'd like you to
talk a little bit about you mentioned
some of the trends here that are
happening but they're not just trends
they're very paradigm changes yes these
are the major changes that are
have big ships that's true so can you
review some of the trends that are going
on some of these ships so one of the so
there are three things that we talked
about in the keynote right so there's
the chat bot as the conversational UI of
the applications there's serverless
which is you know get off the headache
of trying to understand what
infrastructure you need for your
application to run and then there is
blockchain which is emerging technology
for how do you get untrusting parties to
interact and transact with each other
now if you look at the first one which
is the chat board it's what is called as
conversational UI so you are conversing
with an agent that's executing something
on behalf of you with the application so
it's not traditional application where
you open up a screen a menu comes up you
select an item and you proceed or you go
to a website and just you know start
entering details here you're doing
something that is very natural to us as
human beings talking to each other so
you are talking to the bot and then the
port is doing something in the backend
with the with the services and gets you
the answer that is going to be a big
change in the way we've been designing
and delivering applications because chat
bot would mean that I can do away with a
lot of applications mobile apps on the
phone right now you do away with yes yes
and okay so why is that is because some
of these applications people install
just for one or two use or a very rare
use so for example I travel but I travel
to different cities and when I travel I
use different Airlines different
airports each one of these has its own
app exactly yeah so with the chat bot I
can do away with these applications
which I don't frequently use ice and the
chat board becomes the interface for me
to interact with these you know airports
Airlines itself so that we feel is a
very you know it's changing the way we
perceive applications what we are also
doing in the chat board is we are
putting in or we put in a machine
learning platform that looks at the
conversations that happen and then
starts to figure out sentiments around
so we are working on that we are working
on integrating with you know visual
api's or visual so you saw you saw you
know I uploaded a license plate and it
was able to figure out what the license
number was and then go get the details
yes so this might actually be different
applications yes correct correct the
same thing on on the Internet
the second paradigm that we think is
going to be very different is the
serverless and the whole functions as a
service what's happening here is that
people are moving away from the
headaches of trying to understand when
do they need to provision infrastructure
how long do they need to run what sort
of bills they are going to run into and
just focus on coding and deploying it so
she was showed you you know an example
of exactly that and what we will have is
a managed pass service that enables you
to invoke functions as a service and the
third thing of course is blockchain
everybody knows about Bitcoin but here
is something that uses that underlying
technology underlying thought process
framework and puts it into a business
context it does away with the proof of
work which takes a lot of time lot of
computing power and brings in a
different consensus mechanism to order
the transactions
and then put those transactions which
are then non reputable nobody can go and
change or question that that particular
transaction happened at that point in
time because everybody has a copy of
that transaction and you cannot you know
physically go and change each one at the
same time right so so these are just a
part of the three technologies that we
feel are becoming very important the
application developers should know about
them and start looking at how they build
next set of applications using those
great thank you so you also talked about
open source a lot of these things are
open source community involvement here
as well that's good but I also want to
get you actually if I'd like you to you
know actually discuss that but also talk
a little bit about how this changes
development it changes me as a user I'm
gonna actually use these things yes but
it also changed in how developers write
code yes don't actually create these
applications
- I feel open-source actually cuts down
a lot of development cycle because there
is there are a lot of concepts or lot of
technologies that people are building
and there could be just that particular
technology that you you're thinking of
leveraging within your application and
instead of you writing the code for that
you get it from from the internet from
the open source community and then what
you can also do is contribute back
because that's the spirit of open source
right if you're not contributing back
and just consuming it that's not going
to help anybody right it's not going to
progress the project further from that
particular perspective as Oracle what we
are doing is not only setting up new
open source projects like the FN project
which was open sourced in open world at
the stage you know right in front of an
audience job of an audience but we are
also joining in
in those technologies which are becoming
cold to our offerings so blockchain for
example is powered by hyper laser fabric
we've joined that particular project and
we will be contributing in terms of you
know new feature functionality into the
platform so I feel you know it's a it's
a give-and-take open-source will cut
down a lot of the craft that you would
probably be developing because there's a
better project available already but you
need to also contribute back and that's
how the ecosystem grows otherwise you
know it will it will just start ok well
Robbie thank you very much I appreciate
your time are you coming by thanks
that's the first interview here we have
many more actually all day today so
we'll stop by and for some more later on
thanks bye bye thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
