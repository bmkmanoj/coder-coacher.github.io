hear intok attack so today I'm going to
be talking about distributed lambdas
what they are and I'll talk about why we
got into them why they exist what was
the reason for them right so but a
little bit about me I start off in a sea
background I've been working in Java for
the past ten plus years coherence of the
product I'm one of the core architects
of the product and we have multiple
languages that we support so we support
net C++ Java and because of that I have
little soirees into these different
languages which is kind of an
interesting part of the role but today
I'm going to talk about lambdas and you
know I really want to talk about the
experiences we had in adopting lambdas
and you know we can like so I was one of
the the authors on our distributed
lambda stuff and so I can talk about you
know what we had to do at a bytecode
level for those of you that are
interested right like if you're bored
then please I guess I can tell by people
snoring right so that would be my my way
to tell so the agenda was first is to
recap on lambdas discuss what they are
in Java right and talk about a couple of
the kind of what we needed to introduce
to make these distributable functions
and you know it kind of inspired by the
keynote today by Adam I want to get into
the IDE as quickly as possible right
I'll try I feel bad for having like 5
slides so I apologize for that up front
so lambdas here is on Java right or plus
all right he was using lambdas cool all
right
so I think most you can tell me what
they are and so just a brief
introduction I - so they're introduced
in Java right and as well as having some
some of their own requirements in terms
of changes to the language like in Java
7 there was a very popular or very
important
instruction as introduced to the bike
code right like invokedynamic
introduced in Java 7 and that kind of
you know helped pave the way for an
implementation of lambdas and what it
really allows you to do is this kind of
oh and sorry ask questions if you know
anything becomes unclear or anything
comes up but what it allows this kind of
hybrid where you can stick to the
traditional java way of doing things and
take advantage of object orientation you
know polymorphism etc or you can dip
your toes into the functional pole pool
or pond or whatever the correct analogy
is right so you can embrace these
lambdas as much as you want or you can
forget they exist it's entirely up to
you
well like conceptually it's a very nice
thing and actually what you know why I
find quite interesting is as soon as it
bleeds into AP is an API take advantage
of lambdas that what you realize is that
the language is obfuscating you from
doing certain things well I'll talk of a
little bit about that when I talk about
completable futures and things like that
but so you know what it is is this kind
of this block of instructions that you
can pass around right and you know the
the important point is that there is no
state to these functions right they make
they have side-effects
they take inputs right they have a
return value but they don't hold any
state and yeah there's been a number of
mountains to the Java library to take
advantage of these and so hash map as an
example I don't if that's clear to you
at the bottom but you can now do a for
each and pass the function and if you
think about this like the shift has been
on the control and who's doing what
right so previously how would you have
done a loop you would have said entry
set iterator right and you would have
gone through and the onus was on the
user of that data structure to do that
iteration right but also it meant that
whoever was implementing map had some
cost in terms of how they would return
that that object that allows you to
iterate right I add two new up and
iterate and give it back to you and Mark
where you were in that
duration so that when you ask for the
next thing I could tell you what it was
or you know I could tell you that it
been exhausted right so what this allows
is for the implementations to make a lot
of optimizations like if you do a for
each on a null map well guess what I
don't need to do any allocations I don't
need to call you I can do some
optimizations though right so it's you
know it's a really cool feature the
other thing that included as part
lambdas is what's referred to as
captured arguments all right so in this
example we can see that we have a map we
introduced oh this example I'll put in
like throughout I guess just as the f1
please in the side I sort of put an
example with the previous f1 champions
and when I get into the IDE we'll we'll
start using this kind of same start for
the code so you know here what we do is
we do a for each but instead we try and
work out who the latest f1 champion was
right but the what's really being shown
as like the fairly trivial example is
there's a captured argument which is an
last and it's referred to in the lambda
but like so people have used anonymous
classes before right what was the
biggest pain with anonymous classes like
anything you refer to in that anonymous
class you have to like as soon as you
typed it you'd see the ID tell you oh
that thing's not final when you have to
jump back and like make it final and
then like this whole kind of ceremony
has to exist but with the stuff that's
effectively final the great thing is
that as soon as I refer to it after that
point if I try and change it or try and
change it in in the lambda itself the
compiler will argue or complain of me
right so it it's exactly what I won and
I don't need to go back and declare it
as final so these things become
effectively final so you know if if you
think about what you had to do
previously with anonymous classes you
have to say you know this new runnable
and it what's really kind of brings the
point home is when you're I des when
things like IntelliJ start removing code
for youth you know there's a problem in
the language right when they start like
if I was to write this in IntelliJ it
would gray out everything except the
system.out.print line right which is
great because that's all I want to see
but like I've all this boilerplate that
I have to include just to create kind of
a anonymous function right so so you
know the great thing is afterwards with
lambdas you know I can do this this very
simple statement and like just to just
to go back on the anonymous classes or
you know the difference between the two
think about anonymous classes what the
key difference is anonymous class can
hold state right so right in writing
this point here I could include some
class variable which I can then update
in the run with lambdas don't allow that
that's a fairly key difference between
the two so you know what is the lambda
how do you qualify to be a lambda well
one thing that I find really interesting
about this and those of you that have
used lambdas you know may agree or may
not have kind of realized this yet but
one thing that's really key is that a
number of interfaces are required to
define unique method signatures right so
the point is a lambda because of type
inference and how it works within java
ray and you know so the right hand side
is inferred by the left hand side right
so what it means is that we need a
number of interfaces lambdas that
conform to those method signatures right
so for example runnable right it's a
method that takes no parameters and
returns nothing right so like you know
going back to this example I can write
lambda barely believe it take nothing
and have no return equally I could
create another interface called my
runnable has the same signature and I
could assign it to this same lambda
as a single abstract method in this case
it's an interface but it could be a
class with an abstract class with a
single abstract method and you could
like that as a lambda okay so there are
a number of these that were introduced
into into jarvan we'll go through those
in a little while but kind of getting to
the crooks are like we've spoken to our
lambdas are you getting to the crux of
what this talk is about is well it would
be great to be able to distribute may be
great to be able to say like like Java
is really concerned about you know a
single JVM what's executed in that JVM
right so at the moment we've been
talking about that how you can pass
things around you know between data
structures in that same process you know
how you can execute things concurrently
using lambdas I but I'd be really nice
to do is to be able to make them remote
able to be able to like you know for me
to request it to be executed and it be
executed over there right whoever I
choose or maybe you know close to some
data that I have over there right so
that's that's what we really want and
kind of my sort of background with and
with coherence that's exactly what we
want for coherence so how do you how do
you see rows lambdas I mean it's not
like the JDK team completely didn't
consider this at all right so you can
make lambdas serializable but what it
means is like we go back to these these
interfaces we have they're all runnable
right they're also they're all
functional interfaces and they all have
a single method that requires
implementing but none of them are
serializable right so we need to make
them serializable what serializable it's
a marker interface it says this thing is
serializable right like java do your
thing in terms of reflection to work out
what serialized state and you know write
it to a stream we need to hint that
these runnable x' are also serializable
and how do we do that well unfortunately
it requires us to do a cast if we want
to use the existing interfaces right so
like all of this you know gray
work that was done to transition from
like anonymous inner classes across the
lambdas now requires if I want to make
them serializable requires like some
boilerplate like we just remove the
hundred lines and added like five right
it's it's really really quite painful to
see but as soon as you do make your
interface serializable it becomes a hint
to say in you create some serialized
information for me please write and what
Java actually does is when it generates
the class it creates what's called a
serialized lambda and when you get a
reference to a lambda you can actually
request that right so what happens is
who's familiar with the right replace
read resolved in serialization right so
so there are a couple of methods in Java
serialization that allow you to
transform the thing your serializing
into something else before it goes
become serialized right so that's the
right replace side so if you have an
object that's going to be serialized
serializable and you want to change the
thing that actually realizes then you
can implement right replace and return
some different object right which will
then the serialization will be called on
that and that will get thrown into some
byte array and then you can deserialize
that by of the thing that you converted
to so you'll then when you deserialize
you'll be converted to back to that same
thing and then read resolve what we call
it and it could return the original
thing right so that's that's what they
use and that's what lambdas you so
lambdas implement right replace on each
of the lambdas if they're serializable
which means that they will return a
serialize lambda which is the state
that's required to send that put it into
a byte array a pd serialized and
executed right so serialized lambdas are
very important to us to determine what
what we need for that lambda to be able
to serialize it includes the captured
arguments it includes the what's called
the capturing
so when you write a lambda it's written
in a capturing class and includes all
that metadata that you really need so
going back to the interfaces number of
interfaces that were introduced so I was
mentioning earlier about these unique
method signatures that's exactly what
these interfaces provide right so
function it takes a T returns an R
predicate it takes a t return the
boolean supplier supplier returns a T
consumer takes a T by consumer take the
T in a unit takes a t returns the T
binary operator takes a T and another T
and returns a T right so now we've got a
number of kind of primitive functions
that we can use lambdas for right and we
can bake these into our own api's which
is really quite cool because by just
using one of these interfaces it means
that you can now accept lambdas right so
it's very very very cool and then some
you know some familiar friends runnable
callable comparator but again none of
these are serializable so when we were
working with the java team when we first
so with incoherent and we we wanted to
implement the in support java right and
you know it was a fundamental thing that
we wanted to do and to do that we needed
to support some of the new methods so
Mac introduced a bunch of new methods in
the interface you know what reason
become because of the default methods
allowing us to or allow them to
educating to introduce these new methods
without breaking existing
implementations the problem was within
coherence that those so our you know our
equivalent interface our derivative of
map is called name cache so we know we
extend map so we get all of these
implementations for free but a cost
because the default implementation
assumes certain characteristics assumes
as local in memory assumes that you know
it can't be done any more efficiently
like if you look at concurrent map
compared to hash map the
imitation of something like computer is
completely different as you would expect
it to be right it's safe to be used on
multiple threads well we need it to be
safe to be used across multiple
processes in a cluster right so it's a
very very different concept so we need
to provide our own implementation so as
we kind of you know got into that effort
we realized that we needed to do some
work with lambdas to make them work in
in a distributed way so you know one of
those one of those challenges we had so
if you consider an example actually I'll
come to a slide that has an example but
what one of these challenges is that to
avoid this this problem of kind of
making everybody perform a cast of the
you know the interface they want to be
and making it serializable and then
dropping the serializable part which is
essentially what that is doing right
you're saying our is a runnable but
consider it a runnable and serializable
for the type inference don't just take
runnable so that the JDK when it
actually spits out the class that
represents this lambda it will be both
runnable and serializable and then drop
the serializable part right so instead
of making everybody go through those
hoops and and do that and as well for us
to make sure that everything
serializable one of the key things we
had to do was introduce a number a a
derivative of each of those interfaces
that were also serializable right so
what it meant was a function is now
function and serializable right so
that's kind of one piece to it the other
piece which I'm hoping is the next slide
oh two slides is the existing methods
need to have this this this type that
we've introduced this remote function
but it's a function is non sterilizable
remote function is serializable so if
you look at map right map has computed
absent okay so we already inherited that
from map but we need to provide our own
version of computer hansen and the great
thing is is that with the JDK they
choose the most specific method it's
also when as a caller if you were to
call
- named cash compute if absent then and
provide a lambda it would actually
choose remote function rather than the
normal function which would mean that
it's automatically serializable without
any effort right so it was a real really
nice realization and well we you know we
work very closely with the dedicating to
work this out as an approach but it
means that all the functions they get
past are the underlying interface and
serializable okay which allows us to do
a couple of things which you know we'll
we'll come to and so before I I kind of
jump into the demo just a little bit
about coherence so who's head of care in
T know a few number very cool so for
those unaware coherence is a consider a
hash map which is a number of buckets
right coherence is a hash map a lot of
people say on steroids
but I don't think Sarah's are a good
thing so it's it's those buckets
distributed across multiple processes
right and you know you know clusters up
to like 500 JVM thousand JVM and what it
means is that you can scale out the
amount of data you store like incredibly
but the other thing that's really cool
is that you can a so you know when I was
talking previously like what you wanna
do with these lambda to be great to
execute them remotely well you can
actually execute it next to your data
right like let's say you have a function
that needs to actually like if we go
back to compute
let's say you want to manipulate the
data close to the data well you can do
that now with Java eight compute methods
right so let's let's have a look at that
remove the water before I knock it down
and cause an electric storm all right so
can we see that oh no we can't see that
let me
let me try and switch the resolution
very quickly does that does that change
the there we go oh yeah you're on the
floats better cool thank you so I have a
class here going back sorry gone I can
make sure it is yeah absolutely
yeah yeah sure so here I have a class I
call it f1 and it's just basically your
main right it's a way for me to to load
things and important like a scratch area
for me to work with so the only thing
that I've got here at the moment is a
load right so the so first of all like
here here's an example of how how you
can use lambdas within your own API
right so I have this for each champ for
each f1 champ I take it takes in a
consumer right what does it do it reads
the file sorry the file is here f1
champs read the file and for each entry
it calls the consumer passing it the
thing it read right so it reads from the
file creates a champ with the year that
they were the champion and as well as
that their name and so what I do is I
pass in the lambda which when when that
champ gets passed in it puts it into a
name cache okay so pretty trivial but
what we want to do a little bit more
than that right so now that we've got
this let's let's go through them and so
don't forget this is name cache now
right so and for for each person I'm
going to receive a year and a champ okay
so when I receive them I will say I will
just output
let's output this guy sorry
was they one therefore on in this year
oops sorry alright so to do this
unfortunately I'm gonna have to get out
of presentation mode briefly and you
really content I am going to try and
change the resolution quickly because
I'd like you to see the run dialog as I
go through it
let's see if this is any better
right
I'm hoping it's going to show but while
we're waiting for that well it's it's
showing but it's not any better right so
let me just describe these things so up
in the top I'm going to start something
called I call a Java cloud server what
is it it's a coherence node to JVM
that's going to start and it's going to
be responsible for storing data right
but the key point for this discussion is
that it's a separate process ok so I'm
going to start one of these things I
don't
here it goes we can see that start up
and then here we can see it forms you
know we can see certain things right the
first thing is that it forms a cluster
with one member in it ok so the next
thing I'm going to do is well the useful
to have some data in there so let me let
me run this F one example so what you
can see here and if you look at the top
here is that the second member this
second member joined alright so we
become a part the cluster but we're not
throwing any data and you can also see
that we're loading champs which means
there was no data there previously and
the last thing we see is the for each
right we go through them and we we
output them so a fairly trivial example
it's do something a bit more complicated
so we have so we're only going to load
champs if they're there right and the
point is that I shouldn't see this
message again loading camps because the
service although I'm hoping it's not
going to lose any day so the next thing
we can do is well Java right introduced
this really cool thing called a compute
method right and I can pass a function
here so let's say let's make a
prediction so who's going to win in 2017
let's say it's going to be well so first
of all for this interface it's going to
take a year right
oh yes sorry let's make it a computer
absent not a compute so it's going to
take a year and I need to return the
value to put it into the cache if it's
not present so let's create a new champ
and let's give him a year and as well as
that that let's predict Sebastian Vettel
is going to win controversial but I
think probably likely say so that's so
let me run this and we can see like by
the way so the disc loud server is still
running I haven't like I've literally
just defined this lambda and I've not
updated that Java cloud server it's not
running in debug mode you know classes
aren't being there's no like IDE magic
happening here right if I run this f1
said oh you know it it'd be quite useful
to see the output otherwise so let's
let's also look what I won't run the
computers absent again but now I'll just
view the results of oh shoot finally we
will see this output all right
so we can see that you know that work
without bouncing the server or anything
amount to be able to insert this data
which means this lambda got executed on
this remote server right but now but I
mean there are a bunch of other cool
things we could do as well right like
let's say I want to say out of all of my
champions right
I want to stream all of this data across
right but you know so when you stream
like who uses streams on apps and a few
people cool so the the nice thing with
with streams is a it allows the
implementer to make it very efficient if
they can and the second thing is it's
incredibly fluent right so let's say I
want to do this right first of all I've
got a stream of entries right some of
running ads map let me get to the value
okay now let me collect write which is
kind of an aggregator but so what I said
previously about you know being this
remote function making everything
serializable we have to do the same
tricks for the collectors as well all
right so I need a remote collector
because if you've used the standard JDK
stuff there's a collectors right so we
have to do a parallel to that and I'm
going to group by well so I have this
champ right and the champ let's group by
their name and so what am I trying to do
I'm trying to work out all of the f1
champions and how many times they've won
so lastly let me say have a look at the
counting values and this time I will
also
help with them
okay I can get rid of this and run safe
one example
and we can see that tribulus a Bolivia
Lee but in a readable way I can write
this this function which does a group by
and collects each of the and and each of
these each of these are different
functions as well and they're being
executed on the server right so one
other point that I kind of want to
wanted to really mention is here you can
see I have this function defined here
right and when I started that cloud
server the Java cloud the coherent
server this function was or has already
been defined right so what does it do it
says whenever the function gets called
it returns a champ
which is Nico Rosberg at the year that's
been given right so I can I can easily
use that function here so let me reuse
this let's use compute because I'm not
really concerned whether it's absent or
present and I believe so 2016 Nico
Rosberg already won so let me go with
2015 where we know the Lewis Hamilton
one and instead I'll say you know I'll
reference this dysfunction so and
finally I'll actually do the output in
the same stuff as well for 2015 right
and what we should see is that actually
so let me do it before and afterwards
okay so what we should see is that the
previous champ was Louis Hamilton and it
gets converted to Nico Rosberg right I
mean suddenly you realize oh I just
changed history I shouldn't really been
doing that so let me switch it back so I
go to my enforcing function and they say
okay let me switch this back so that it
puts Lewis Hamilton in place
right I'll run it and I'm hoping it's
going to going to change back to bread
dozen right and and the reason is
because I'm referring to a class that's
already been defined right so this class
is not going to be automatically
redefined like there's no way the server
knows that this class has been redefined
but with what we call dynamic lambdas I
can easily take something that takes you
think I'm taking both this time so it'll
be a year and champ and I will return a
new champ for the given year and it's
going to be Lois
great I can do it but you know what the
the point of that example is to really
drive home that it's it's non-trivial to
to actually have things just redefined
in the server it's kind of its kind of
difficult to illustrate and without
maybe some some animation and I should
have probably put some animation on a
slide or something but you know what's
happening under the covers here is is
really quite cool and let me so I'll
switch back to the slides now and talk
about you know why what were some of the
issues we we faced and then and then
I'll start talking sure yeah absolutely
yeah Salem let me talk about and talk
about that actually I think that's it
that's a really interesting point so so
the first thing was well so we already
mentioned that everything you need to be
serializable all right we've already
covered that so the the other thing is
that not everybody wants to use Java
serialization okuu does anybody use any
other kind of serialization format Yeah
right so there's some popular ones out
there right like Avro Google protocol
buffers we have our own implementation
of a civilization framework called
portable object format which is you know
very compact and and navigable as a byte
array structure so the point is that you
know you should have choice you should
be allowed to and unfortunately we
lambdas today you don't have choice it's
either Java sterilization or nothing in
you know that there is some work to
improve Java serialization but that's
kind of something that's enforced but
the other thing is the point that you
are mentioning right so first of all
lambdas need to be consistent from a
senders perspective right if I send you
know like in that previous example if I
send Lewis Hamilton should be the new
champion then
you know I expect that to be executed
and I expect the side effects of my
lambda to be the side effects that I
instructed to be executed all right so
now there needs to be an understanding
of versioning right so so first of all
like we made it serializable and by
making a serializable we got that
serialized lambda instance right and
that gives us a bunch of metadata that's
really important first of all the
capturing class second of all all the
input arguments so what we what we do
when we when we detect that that lambda
it needs to be serialized we go and
introspect the capturing class and work
out the implementation and then what we
actually do is work out whether that's
consistent with something that's been
sent before right so from a senders
perspective it only needs to send it
once right and from a receivers
perspective it already it ensures that
it's executing the right thing based on
this unique version right so that that's
one of the very cool things of this kind
of kind of framework that that we've
built is that it allows you to ensure
consistent execution on the server side
and I know it kind of drives home this
other point of you know as well as
having consistent execution while being
able to introduce new lambdas as well on
the fly is a fairly fairly nice feature
but there are a couple of limitations
right so when we like if you have a like
headed eye analogy where you know you
pull the thread in a jumper and all of a
sudden you get left with a ball of
threads right well that's one of the
issues that we we try to kind of stop
and and that is like if you have a
lambda the lambda itself can refer to
instance methods it can also refer to
instance variables in the capturing
class right if we pull that thread and
end up kind of taking everything then
you know every time that you do that
then we end up like shipping an entire
JVM across just to reiax acute this
lambda so we did draw a line in the sand
and to draw the line in the sand we said
well your lambda needs to be a truly
static lambda ie it should not refer to
instance variables or
refer to instance methods right and so
the unfortunate thing is that we can't
put that constraint in and so that the
compiler can pick it up it's unfortunate
that we have to we have to barf at you
at runtime if that happens right because
obviously we know when we're trying to
ship it whether it's referring to
something outside of itself but one kind
of nice way to to do this is is this
kind of pattern where you actually you
make the thing that returns the lender a
static method right so here you can see
that the lambda is returned by calling
this method change name it takes in a
name and returns that same name for this
trivial example but the fact that it's a
different static method which you know
sir is static just to kind of say that
one more time means that it can't refer
to any other state so you get that
compiler enforcement the other
limitation is imagine if you have a
lambda then has a nested lambda within
it currently today although no I think
we we can work out a way to do this
currently today if we consider how we
actually ship a lambda so you call our
method we realize this thing is a lambda
all right we work out there at the
lambda we then get the serialized lambda
we get all the information we need a
lambda has if you have a look at the
bytecode
of a lambda so you let's have a look at
the blank feel of a lambda
all right so
we have a couple of lambdas here so
we'll we'll just pick this this initial
for each now we'll actually go with the
second one so and you just have a look
at the Java PL put so well it doesn't
matter I'll just pick this one because
it because it's here but you can see
this is this lambda this is the
implementation of the lambda so when you
write the lambda it gets baked into the
capturing class as a synthetic private
method right so when you when you call
us with this lambda we know the
capturing class and we know the method
that's embedded in it which has the
instructions to execute right so what we
can do is we can then go up read that
class itself
grab those byte codes along with all of
the captured arguments that need to be
taken as well include it into a single
create a single class for it and ship
the bytes across to the server to then
execute right so I mentioned previously
about this kind of write replace read
resolve dance that happens with lambdas
well the the way the lambdas also work
is that they put in a deserialized
lambda the deserialize lambda is a
central port point for any of the read
resolve methods for any of the methods
for any of the lambdas sorry right so
any of the lambdas need to be
deserialize they'll actually come back
into here and you can see down here
there's a there's a lookup switch which
will point it to the correct D
serialization routine right so there are
a number of things that the happen was
lambdas I really wanted to do more with
them and but without writing a custom
compiler or a compiler plug-in because
the way lambdas work is there's this
invoke dynamic instruction right so as
soon as the invoke dynamic instruction
gets hit it calls a bootstrap method and
the bootstrap method is a thing that
generates a class right and that class
is your lambda right so if you ever get
a lambda you can call get class on it
and it will tell you something really
useless right it'll tell you like some
random name and as well as that if you
try and like call get protection domain
get code source it will give you novel
right so you can you can't really get
back to it but way you can get to is the
capturing class right so when this class
gets generated it's a really simple
class all it does is call back into the
capturing class for the relevant method
right and the only other thing it does
apart from that is typecasting but you
know until the legacy of generics then
it needs to cast to the appropriate
parameter types as well as caster return
type correctly right so what we've done
is we've kind of we like we know what it
does we know it generates this thing we
know that this method over here so we
bring them together and we ship over one
thing and execute it in a completely
sandbox environment right so it's a
separate class loader that's not going
to be affected by you know your other
classes and it was a very very cool bit
of work that that we did actually so any
questions on that
alright so summarize look we did a lot
of work to support Java eight lambdas
and I think it's incredibly cool a what
lambdas introduced and to you in terms
of usage terms of into your API and
we've fully embraced them completable
futures something that I failed to
mention that is a you know like dynamic
lambdas is a huge one of the one of my
favorite features in Java right
completable future is a very close
second like it the combination of the
two is it allows you to do non blocking
code very very easily and allows like an
API implementer provider sorry to
embrace those things so that you know
our customers can introduce non blocking
calls create pipelines trivially so yeah
again it's a very very cool feature
allows you know serialization and you
can choose your serialization so you
you know we can use pass instead of Java
serialization if we want to and as well
as that it means that we can support
multiple clients with multiple versions
and all the existing stream stuff
through so a couple of pointers to sort
of some coherence related sites and
social media if you're that way inclined
so yeah give us a look and if you have
any questions please reach out to me I'd
happily discuss any of this stuff I hope
that's been useful thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
