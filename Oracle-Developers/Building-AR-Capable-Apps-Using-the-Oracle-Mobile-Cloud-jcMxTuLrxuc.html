accessible like something that you you
could have an ordinary eyeglasses that
kind of give you all that capability
give you more information and you know
what what's going to happen is what is
real and what is kind of you know made
up you know pretty much
computer-generated is going to be hard
to decipher it's going to be difficult
to differentiate between what is real
and what's not and that's the premise of
this whole book right and I can tell you
that you know it's already happening
right how many of you have tried out an
augmented reality app nice okay and how
many of us here have tried a virtual
reality experience awesome how many of
us have done that virtual reality
experiences with you know a fully
virtual reality capable device not the
smartphone kind of virtual reality like
the Google dream or whatever right now
you how about somebody having used
oculus or something like that okay
there's one in the room so that I I
wanted to draw your contra drawn kind of
contrast about that so virtual reality
right it's an immersive simulation
excuse me I don't have any signal here
so it's an immersive simulation of a
three dimensional environment
experienced by you know the control
moment of your body your eyes or even by
spoken commands right so but when you
come to augment reality it's super
impose imposition of a
computer-generated image of the user's
view on the real world okay so this is
something that Microsoft did with there
hololens it's it's a very you know it's
a slam based introduction we say you
know it's a based on simultaneous
localization and mapping so pretty much
this person has a heads up display is
right next to an elevator he wants kind
of you know go and see what's her what's
you know what's wrong with the elevator
pretty much go
through the entire debug process and he
has a lot of information on his heads-up
display so he does not need to kind of
you know go back to his manuals he does
not need to kind of you know it could be
any person who does this right and does
not need to be an expert to do all this
right and then there is a desktop
interaction here you pretty much you
know it could be an education use case
it could also be a field service use
case you're training somebody to use a
particular new thing that he he comes
across here they're showing a pump and
you're pretty much trying to figure out
you know how to repair it what's inside
it
without having to break it open all
right so these are augmented reality use
cases so what's happening here right so
Tim Cook say is that you know AR can be
huge and when it comes from Tim Cook you
know there's a lot of a lot of effort
behind behind that statement right now
there's a lot of work behind that
statement right so the smartphone found
factor is totally changing so you know
you've seen already you've seen multiple
different heads-up displays already
right and you could say that you know
some of them not as good some of them
you know getting there but we are still
waiting for Amazon or Apple to come up
with the heads-up display and that's
when all things change right now that's
that's that's what I think is it's a
point where we go and look into these
things with more flavor actually but in
effort right now we are getting started
right now right it's a I would say we
are at beta right now now with all these
apps that have come up and things are
going to change professed and let me
show you some air enterprise use cases
that are relevant to us today so the
Oracle field service team has a bunch of
air demos that they made all over last
year and one of these demos they showed
at Oracle event at Las Vegas so pretty
much this is a slot machine as you can
see right you know you're you have this
person hold up an iPad and he's trying
to you know fix that I've fixed that
slot machine using the
information that's shown on his
augmented reality interface this is you
know this is on YouTube already so you
can see it's a probably at 30 minutes of
your time but it kind of walks you
through the entire thing and shows you
have all other Oracle technology like
IOT all come together here the next one
here is something that the IOT team has
done with a company called daiquiri you
know there is it's a construction use
case it pretty much you know the person
he's not an expert he comes in he tries
augmented reality out and he gets all
this you know tasks laid out for him one
after another right on its head set
display kind of you know it's an
efficiency play here you want this
person to be more efficient with his
augmented reality application and he
kind of you know goes through uses this
application and completes his task this
is another use case I want to kind of
show you guys this is a logistic
warehouse augmented reality use case so
as you see right I Amazon tons of other
companies in India they all have these
huge logistical you know applications on
their warehouses right now they have
huge warehouses they need to know where
things are where they need to go to pick
and place pretty much and squeezing
every little efficiency out of it is
what they are trying to do here and
augmented reality really helps them
think right so pretty much with this
particular you know iPad here that's
being shown you get Direction you know
you pretty much know where you want
where you need to be how you get further
and into navigation is a tough or not to
crack actually people have tried it with
Deakins before you know and this one
pretty much you know uses markers but
over a period of time I think all of
these can be bunched up as omelette
reality you know using advanced image
recognition object recognition do the
same thing so again you know they these
use cases are pretty much relevant to
transportation management cloud service
warehouse management cloud service and
all other products
this is an oil and gas remote expertise
case there's a field services case
pretty much you know Oracle maintenance
or service cloud use here what's
happening here is this you know oil and
gas industry it's very expensive to send
an expert to the field every time you
have a problem right and most of these
tasks simple tasks can be done by the
field service person but it is really
difficult for him to kind of go through
a new something here seeing and seeing
it for seeing for the first time right
so what's happening here is this field
for a service person is connecting to a
service you know an expert who's back in
the office and pretty much you know he
is kind of being guided to every single
action that he needs to take and then
this heads-up display really helps him
with the debug with the you know getting
the repair flow and there's also this
aspect of life sharing so whatever he
sees right in front of him is being
shared and the expert is able to see
what he is with his eyes right so this
kind of helps of helps with this process
and he can he can really solve a lot of
you know issues imagine writing if you
could connect to a customer service
person in the future and you are wearing
one of these glasses and you have a
problem with your refrigerator probably
want to change the filter on your
refrigerator right this is a common use
case right and you don't know how to do
it and you get to them on the phone
they'll send you a manual maybe you'll
send you an email with pictures and all
that takes time you could do something
like this in the future all right so I
want to make a call-out to a demo that
we are showing and I could probably have
my colleague Vikram nagaraj come and
talk a little bit about the demo this
pertains to the same use case and I
think it will be a good thing for you to
hear them out
for those of you haven't visited the
booth we have a booth which is called as
a very interesting use case for field
service that we are showcasing out there
so if you are not very clear on you know
what is field service it's pretty much
about servicing assets machinery or
products that has been bought by a
consumer which is situated out somewhere
there in the field for an analogy sake
you could think about something like a
refrigerator at home and what do you do
if something is broken with your
refrigerator you call the manufacturer
you know it could be go through age or
LG or Samsung or anyone repair it for
you so field service is very much in the
focus today for a lot of organizations
because of two important changes the
first thing is we see that a lot of
industries are moving from what we call
as an ownership model to an as a service
model you know about all our you know
about uber right so that's one so this
change strategic shift is not happening
only with the new industries but it's
also happening with a lot of traditional
industries for example the industries
are used to manufacture power turbines
so historically they used to manufacture
the turbines and then sell it to the end
customer would you know install it who
pretty much won it and then use it for
power generation
so these traditional industries are also
offering what is called as power
generation as a service today okay so
because of all these changes because
we're moving from an ownership to an as
a service model Field Service is pretty
much not a revenue stream at all but
it's actually an overhead for the
manufacturer to maintain the equipment
so so what we're showing is we're
showing an Oracle solution that
optimizes companies in field service
that helps them to do more in lesser
amount of time in a cost-effective
manner all right so that's about the
asset so feel free to walk by if you
haven't been to the booth and we can
talk about it moderator thank you
can you guys still hear me okay okay
moving on there's this retail use case
that I think you guys would be really
interested in so this lady comes in
front of a big screen and you know there
are cameras embedded in his career in
her screen and this is a little
futuristic you know you have to you have
to believe this if I say this is this is
not going to be something is this is
just a demo video that somebody put on
YouTube right but this is going to
happen it's going to happen pretty quick
right you're going to be able to go in
front of screen change all your try out
different clouds and all this technology
is already there right it just needs to
be put in and unmade right so there are
many such Oracle retail cloud use cases
for product fit and personalization
product configuration and and and it's
all about in-store engagement right now
people are moving away from going to the
store they're doing everything through
the app and one of these use cases
pretty much you know brings the customer
back to the store and helps a kind of
you know figure out you know what she
really likes right and not all of these
experiences can be done all through the
app now there are tons of education use
cases right and I think you know there
are a lot of biology students here who
are to do dissection of a frog you know
I had to do that long time back and that
was one of the toughest thing I had to
do and I don't want to do that again but
these kind of VR experiences right you
know pretty much you know you put put
this app in the students hand and you
pretty much can do all that you know all
the teaching element of how to go do all
that you know lab work pretty much using
this in your experience it's not just
that right now in large campuses I would
say you know even some IAT campuses here
pretty huge right and it's difficult for
you know for students to go from one
place to another they don't know where
the services are who to talk to right
and one of that use cases again
navigation right indoor navigation where
you go from one place to another
then there's aspect of training right
you know there's a huge machinery you
don't know what's inside it so that's
another use case so pretty much you know
training students virtual graph for
students collaborative education not
only that you're you're looking at an ER
experience in front of you it's not just
you who's looking into it other students
can also collaborate and they don't have
to be in the same room and they're doing
it and for you know University
onboarding right when you have new cast
or new students come into the university
you could organize a virtual campus
visit you know you see all these ads you
know it's been bombarded with ads
everywhere to come and join somebody's
college right now you could offer a
virtual campus visit do campus
navigation non-boring all those things
and there are tons of use cases right
now this is just a small snapshot of
what is happening it with augmented
reality but you can imagine industrial
use cases you know you could talk about
design visualization here in a large
room you want to see where things are
actually there's a use case that came
from Starbucks they want to kind of you
know have their people imagine how a
Starbucks new Starbucks location would
look if one of the elements changes or
they want kind of redesign the whole you
know layout for the Starbucks it's kind
of difficult for them to do that for
thousands of such Starbucks right so
they want to kind of use a norm to
reality use case do that
similar thing with marketing too right
you know you you want to kind of you
know sell new furniture for example in
this last use case kind of shows you you
know you're trying out different things
you know in your room within your budget
of course right and then you figure out
know what works for you and what looks
better so that's about all with the use
cases so let's talk about the air cloud
so let you know in in effect right how
do you make all these augmented reality
experiences right so first you have to
have a 3d model right the 3d model needs
to have texture the 3d model needs to
have something called rigging it has
textures it has animations and then
there is also this interaction design
right you know what happens
you go and touch an augmented reality 3d
model right maybe something changes
right that's a trigger that goes in
right so you move on from something that
you have values to will developing
mobile apps which is you know you have a
mobile app you you have a user interface
it's pretty much you know you click on
something you touch something and
something happens right and you get some
information back you have to really
imagine this whole thing for augmented
reality experiences it's not just going
to be a flat you know surface anymore
right it's a 3d object right in front of
you right so how do you interact with it
so those triggers have to be created and
each of these triggers needs to kind of
interact with the system of record and
somewhere in the back it right so the so
first of so pretty much right this you
know all these things a model ringing
and textures animation design
interaction design pretty much gets done
with today with all sorts of open source
tools with all sorts of tools that
people are very comfortable using like
Autodesk blender my ZBrush and unity
unreal right so all of these things are
already there so that is not where we
want to spend effort we really want to
bring something about called the air
club now I'll make the case for why that
is important in the next few slides so
pretty much you know you'll have
platform SDKs to make this happen
you will have the air cloud and move
left back and Nestle is supporting
you're supporting this AR app so let's
talk about what do we really need for
these AR experience that we talked about
right you need a persistent point cloud
you need to be able to figure out where
this person is in the real world right
and then you want to be able to you know
have a shot you know a shared soft copy
of the world pretty much you know let's
talk about this building here right so
somebody has a layout of this building
and it needs to be somewhere in the
cloud so when you take an AR experience
and attach it or or anchor it at a
certain point right somebody else can
come out and look
and see the same air experience a few
days later a few months later right so
pretty much what we are trying to do is
kind of you know melt the gap between
the real and all these computer
generated a our content so the ability
to instantly localize ability replace
virtual content in the world soft copy
and interact with it in real time on
device and remotely so there's these are
the things that we need for an AR
experience now just to kind of you know
reset our thoughts a little bit right
you know what really is an AR experience
right so you want to be able to download
a 3d object on-demand and in context
right so you know you're in a particular
location all these 3d objects get to be
huge right these are kind of gaming
elements right now these objects tends
to be depending on how many vertices
they have it's not as simple as a simple
notification that you know which is like
30 40 KB right these objects run to
multiple megabytes and sometimes even
gigabytes if there is a complex model
but together with all its animation
everything so you want to be able to
download these 3d objects in context and
based on you know and you want to be
able to do a download mini-subs objects
you know and you don't want to be
limited by the space that's on the
device itself right or the capabilities
of the a pizza so the weight apps built
today is you package everything together
and put it in app and build it right now
what we are trying to do is being able
to download these these air experiences
in real time and then you want to be
anchor those 3d object instance to a
location right so that's that's you know
that gives this context you want to
interact with these 3d objects like I
was talking before and then you want to
share this experience you know in real
time with your co-workers or with your
friends right that's a very important
you know very important for a near
experience and then you one more
important point that I want to mention
is these 3d objects have a state right
and today right now most of
these apps are stateless lightly they
hold the state on the client right now
this changes because you know when you
have a near experience and when you
interact with it and it's anchored to a
particular location if you want that
change to kind of be shown to everyone
else right you want that state to be in
the cloud so that's very important and
you know for for these device to be
really capable right to give you a
context right so you're in a conference
setting you're in a room like this right
so that is context right and that
context is very useful and how do you
decipher this context that only happens
through object recognition so you
recognize where you are you recognize
things around you and you argument over
them it's so these are all the air
experience capabilities that we need now
what is the air cloud right so the air
cloud that we are building right now at
Oracle has the AR object management
system so all these 3d objects need to
be in the cloud somewhere you know you
need to be able to host it in the cloud
you want to be able to stream this air
experience we have that capability
through WebRTC as part of this package
we want to be able to take all these
maps that we were talking about and put
it in the cloud that that capability
will also be part of the cloud and then
I will show you a demo about in a few
minutes
the AR object recognition this is very
cool to this user experience right
you have hundreds and thousands of AR I
mean objects in the real world right you
want to be able to recognize them and
only that recognition really had needs
to be very seamless right so that's
that's something that we will do the
idea there is you want to kind of reduce
the friction for the users you want to
have you know you want the user to come
in do a quick video and be able to
recognize that object going forward so
that's something that we will bring
bring about and then all the analytics
and the API is that go with all this
right to make many different kinds of
apps right so all of that will be part
of this package to
so just to kind of give you a marketing
just slide here we we were talking about
mobile apps you know it's the just the
bottom over here right you have an API
call it log API shaping connectors all
those things we have mobile services we
had intelligent thoughts layered on top
of that now we'll also layer the AR
cloud services with comprises of the AR
object management system the web RTC
that goes with the machine learning
training that's part of it and then on
top of that we'll be there is DK that
will support all that ok so let's talk a
little bit about change topics a little
bit talk about AR object animation so
this is a code event I was asked to show
some code so bear with me there so so
let's talk about object recognition
right so I had a nice video it was on my
laptop and I wanted to show you there
but no worries I'll have you guys do
this demo yourself right after we finish
this conversation right so what do we
need write a mobile app for data
collection and testing right so you want
to take a mobile app samples are you
want kind of you know go take a real
little object and recognize it so you
want to capture a video under the light
writing lighting conditions
now after that video is captured it goes
into the cloud and there we have a bunch
of machine learning algorithms for
object recognition and once that object
gets you know the model gets created it
gets squeezed back and sent like you
know and send back to your app your app
that then uses that object that model to
kind of do all the recognition and you
can test it right there and you find out
that you know this is the same thing
that you want it to happen you know the
testing is working right and then you
can use the same object it kind of you
know take that model life and then you
use the AR SDK to build any app and from
there on right it's so simple to kind of
go recognize any such related object now
how to record a video right so basically
this video recording right let's
you want to build us all yourself right
you want to record the video from
various angles your shooting should be
under the light right lighting condition
and you ensure the right contrast and
lighting so what I'm going to go show
you here is a quick video I don't know
if it's working let's see if it's
working oh so here's one of our people
and they're showing you how you would
you know capture that video and then
from there on you know you could
recognize that it's pretty much a
MacBook keyboard and we kind of wanted
to use that to show you guys how it
works so it's more on to the next step
here so object recognition flow right
what happens right let's say you wanted
to build this yourself what we did was
we used tensorflow
and you know there are a bunch of
tutorials here's simplest one that you
would see online is an image retraining
tutorial so we used to pre train mobile
net models so this model that mobile net
is pretty famous now there are hundreds
of thousands of objects I think and
dragon eyes using mobile net and we use
the same object but we retrained it with
our objects right maybe we trained it
with a Cisco phone with with a keyboard
so what's happening here is we take the
videos we deconstruct that into multiple
images on the cloud and then once once
that's done you know there's a process
to kind of you know target you know we
have a bounding box over it right
coordinates around it all that is
automatic in the cloud and then we tag
the images and we make a file called the
TF record right from there on right we
use the MOR the algorithm that you can
use it same algorithm
the tensorflow has right and user a
right parameters for editor with the TF
record and you will get a model alright
then you will test the model to make
sure that it's actually working with
some sets of training data pretty much
like every other machine learning tasks
that you do right you take some amount
of data you've trained with it you make
a model and then you test it back see if
it's really working and once it's once
it work it works right then you know
okay you have a model now for the models
that need to go back into mobile phones
right now the problem with all these
smart phones is there you have a limited
amount of memory right so you want to be
able to remove the nodes so let's say
you have a machine learning model right
it comes with multiple nodes and
multiple layers right so you want to be
able to remove the nodes that are
necessary right and you know basically
optimize a model for faster calculation
so what you want to do is you want to be
able to capture or recognize images and
you know with live video that's car
hitting your 24 30 frames per second
right now I you know you want to be as
fast as possible because you know where
users are going to shake their
smartphones they are not going to be
pointing to one single object all the
time right so you want to be able to
remove the nodes optimize it for faster
calculations and then you know you also
want kind of you know reduce the size of
the model by quantization right pretty
much help you you know compress the
model the right size that can go back
into the mobile phone right so you add
the model to the files to the project
you build the app you know this is a
tensorflow app that I'm going to show
once you build the app you test the
results now the the thing about what I'm
going to show is you know even though we
are using tensorflow something that you
guys can all use today we are going to
kind of you know optimize this even
further and we don't want to kind of you
know have you go through the process of
learning how to do all this right all of
this will be part of the cloud as soon
as you are able to capture the video of
a particular object it goes in the cloud
all the machine
happens behind the you know behind the
scenes and all the model gets ready and
gets downloaded back into your app right
so that's the experience that we want to
provide so let's finish that's about all
that I had folks so if you have any
questions let's take that and after that
what I'll do is I'll do the demo right
here so you guys can come in and try it
try it out and we'll do that for like 10
or 15 minutes and answer questions more
questions but if you guys have any
questions right now please go for
anybody
I'll be here for some time so if you
feel free to ask me then - hi I'm
Phillip am from concentric so can we
upload custom artifacts using unity or
models yes yes so this you know we will
support unity so any 3d object custom 3d
object that you'll have that you would
have made right this you know you will
be able to upload it into the cloud to
the air cloud and based on the context
that you want to program your app for
you know your let's say at a certain
location you're at a certain time you
know then that gets automatically
downloaded right and gets shown to you
okay any other questions okay let's
start with a demo and just give me a
couple of minutes to get started and
we'll go with it you're welcome to come
to the stage and see it and please be
like you know we be in a line and we
will do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
