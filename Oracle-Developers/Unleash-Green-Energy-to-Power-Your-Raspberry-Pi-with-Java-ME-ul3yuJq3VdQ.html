off I'm a product manager of Java ME
embedded from st. Petersburg Oracle
surface and I'm Alex Miller inc i am a
software developer from st. Petersburg
Russia as well from Java ME embedded
porting team so I'm responsible Joe is
working on small device such as
raspberry oh another one arm devices
Alex actually a fleet of Portland team
he is responsible for port in Java meto
different platforms and Alex I have a
question for you do you really care
about alternative energy stuff actually
I'm from Russia rock is the world of gas
and also I'm doesn't care about it okay
that's that's like the most part of
population at least in Russia currently
thinks however there is a life besides
of rush and Europe and the United States
especially we already started to use a
lot of this have to have slide already
started to use a lot of alternative
energy and for instance like the Denmark
currently produced the quota of their
electricity by using onshore winds and
the leaders in the in depth industries
as I said like United States under them
and the not Northern Europe but other
countries started to catch ketchup as
well the next of your source of the
clean energy is a son and here here the
California is absolute leader in
California where r to the biggest Sun
generators one use like concentrated
sons and power to boil the water and
like rotate the turban and the another
one is
the Ivanpah solar panel I have facility
this this is a this one is used
concentrated solar energy and another
one which produce almost the same amount
of megawatts is using the solar panels
for their like huge fields of solar
panels and we are not so of those energy
sources for instance like tried all
generators the biggest one the biggest
Idol generation placed in France called
the runs and it produces significant
amount of power i was really surprised
so it produced like 240 megawatts of
power however not all alternative energy
sources so so nice and excited because
verizon others then this one is is a
wave generator which is which works near
the Scotland seashore all right the
power of those generators is not so big
now like is only one megawatt but that
they already started to produce the
electricity that is interesting how are
not all sources of clean energy really
clean some of them a little bit stinky
actually so those guys are produces a
waste which can be which can be utilized
and used in biogas reactors to produce
the gas and then to at least to warm up
the facilities and the germany is the
leader in the amount of gas reactors way
as around 8000 guess raters across the
country
and and yeah that that's that's are we a
little bit look around what what can we
do and tried to understand the
requirements what clean alternative
energy industry might have and we came
to free things so that that industry is
growing really fast so some brass a new
research so if you have the software
like the algorithms which works on your
for instance like wind generators in
some time you probably need to have to
update the software there and you need
to be able to do it remotely because
sometimes that those generators are
placed and really unreachable places and
it needs a supportive wireless
technology and of course it is very
important to have like secure connection
to that and those generators those
appliances has a very very long life
cycle and we know that our like
electronics is not so so durable so in
some several years you need to be able
to replace like broken parts and you
need to be able to do it with the future
hardware and we place the requirement
that we need to be able to port our
software to the future platforms and of
course you need to have a back-end
connectivity so you don't like to
connect to your dedicated device you'd
like to manage them as a group of
devices easily so you need to have some
back-end and for back end you need to
support your plate for me to support
significant amount of protocols like
REST API authentication JSON and of
course like security stuff Alex what do
you think if Java ME embedded is capable
to be used in
alternative energy industry yes I think
so Joe mean by a specially designed
platform special design job platform for
such products such as green energy or
another one embedded device in volt
project because it's very flexible
platform so if you set about long life
cycle you need to use one device and the
one time or you need a new device or if
you write this application in Java you
don't need to both all the one device
adjust by new device and upload to your
application you draw application without
no computation to the Java device and
just run so a lot of requirements to the
communication for to the platform which
is running our application in green
energy application another one embedded
application first of all is a restful
api rest api because we are living in 20
century and all web servers are talking
losses devices we are rest with HTTP
requests so we need to support it we
need a security system in JSON XML to
refer formatted data and not just a
plain text using circus or something
like this so we have to use a ps4
formatting our data and of course we
need authentication to provide server
information who calls him who sent
information and all of these
requirements I need to be supported in
embedded device which run which used to
run our embedded application in green
energy so for us api we have a solution
is this is a GC GC GC f api so this is a
commonly the device common limited
device configuration is our
specification which includes virtual
machine and api so it contains DCFS oil
is the generic collection framework
result of interfaces such as HTTP
connection and so on so on the second
security scoot is
what is as well I mean is a security
transport layer you can use sss sockets
to send you information to the backend
to protect your debt data from a bad
guys from our Corrections on something
like that I am 42 out indication we are
supporting walls to do it all it's
commonly used in a web server stalked
and killed our application application
requests to the server and of course for
sending formatted data we are supporting
xml GS are as well as json api so just
just for example i have several lines of
code how to send information to the
server for example if you need to use
the HTTP connection you just create HTTP
connection using generic nation
framework connect with the factor to
open new connections and then you can
get data output stream or just plain out
posting and send in your data or it now
of course if you need a secure secure
connection or doing just change cell
lines of code and you have a secure
connection to the server it's pretty
easy how many people did program a
native device MC use only one do know
how to connect to the server using HTTP
ssl using native libraries with a witch
one library did you ok well but it's
specially designed for particular device
orgies just like this yep so when are we
miss communications on the native do
Isis is actually a lot of libraries a
special device for particle platform for
example for linux or for particle device
and we don't have to we cannot use these
libraries on another one devices in java
we have we have which out of the box
from a standard specification
okay if you don't want to use htp oks
it's not a problem you can use the
circuit is less overhead connection type
oh of course you can use secure sockets
as well you can use Siri secure sockets
of several circuits to connect device
outside to use device it's not a problem
as well now for example if you're
writing your own gateway which connect a
lot of devices of the small devices to
invited gateway this gateway is
connected to the back end and gateway
can connect over using client connection
and he can accept incoming connection
using server connections serio socket
connection or Siri secure socket
connections not a problem as well so the
next requirement to in by the system is
application management system you know
is when we are using devices embedded
devices for example devices in the
desert in Sahara Desert we don't know
will be no waste devices but it's not
not like idiot in your ass you know the
Wellington near maintenance team so we
cannot go to the device about our
application rebooted and so so using
application management system we can do
all of this just send comments or just
program it so on just blast for example
Oracle have one part is the common line
interface so I can show you right now
how its work ok so for example we have a
Raspberry Pi on our table it's connected
to the router our computer is connected
to the router as well so we can come run
in Java ME embedded on it so oh it's an
active just restart the a-league's
probably make the font a little bit
bigger so oh yeah yeah people would be
able to see yep what you do yep one
second
false appearance Renji it's my god my
better so okay you just go into our and
Becky device we need to start java or
Java ok I just one right it's not this
one device it's our bicycle so just
connect to our solar panel fault Alex
font yes sure of course yes ok my data
so yes so we are connected so just go to
the in e h dot one folder and start ja
you can download java me budget eight
from the Oracle dotnet website and you
can just download or put on your
raspberry device for example and just
run using the following comment so uh
huh not enough family always oh I
understand what's going on actually
so okay so Jay joey is working and how
to connect to the gel you just use a
device connection manager and put
address device so it's connected and and
then we just go to the application
management system so let me clarify Alex
okay she soon as you start java runtime
java runtime had opens the port which
you can communicate and manage the
virtual machine remotely that's what
Alex do actually he is excess in our
application management system by
accessing the port 22 01 yep so there
are a lot of commons not only for
application management we can change
device settings / command-line interface
so the a lot of concepts SI and AMS
commons is for application management
for instance for application
installation so and so on so for example
we can to know how much application
installed on the no vacation installed
on our system so the next step we get we
want to upload our application to the
device how to do that it's pretty simple
we just go to the folder where we have
our application for example I have
applications here why do you remember
how it's cold so okay it's like I just
another one applications I have a lot of
Java mean by it image some on my laptop
for example I have hello world
application here so so I need just go
amount install
in stop so how do you guys know where is
the application so on my local laptop so
I just host download flag and it's
installed for from micro of course i
forgot about application yep it's hello
world to the jad file and host download
so it since ok installation is completed
you can see it's installed and we can
just run this application why index ok
it's it started and we can see it
started for example in locks so okay
it's working it's working fine so this
is the first part we have for
application management right and
actually go online interface it's it's a
one part and the second part is a swm
api which is used to install your
application for for example for join me
in bed platform is little bit different
enjoys you have no application model is
gel public static void main we got used
in Java Sea but we have emails in so we
need only one instance of Java ME
embedded application running on device
and we have a lot of a lot old
application called immediate so we can
install application from another one
application on our device so user can
stop a user can just write her own
application for application management
for example we have persist company who
written an application for application
deployment likes
yeah thank you Alex and processed
process you'll know but what process
does right it is it is the company who
has their own OS j implementation and
currently we are providing the service
for provisioning we're able to
manipulate we are able to manipulate
before SGI bundles can applaud to the
devices manage them run stop them
remotely do a pageant and recently we
announced their support for for the mid
l-e-e-et's now we can manage midlet and
i will show you how it looks like no
data browser Alex where is my places
yeah this is the process management
console and you probably saw a tad
immigrant we have a Raspberry Pi on the
table and the debt raspberry PI's
connected to the process back end here
and there is a raspberry pi like their
cursor mine cursor is I will try to make
it a little bit bigger not sure if I
will be successful Alex yes control
unscrew it doesn't work unfortunately oh
yeah yeah that what works okay yeah
that's raspberry pi and what can we do
with that we can see like what tasks it
has now it has a not so good actually
yep it has a swm mediate their as I'll
accept does the special API we provides
for management it runs there and it it's
connected to the deer back end and we
are able to install a manage
applications for instance that test
midlet which runs currently on those
raspberry and emigrant we can just stop
it stop it it takes some time because
the it is the device initiated
connection there so it can works behind
the proxy or behind the nut easily and
it is exited now we can remove the
midlet now or we need to go to this huge
port look what kind of mid l-e-e-et's we
have installed on Raspberry Pi on them
aground then see just bringing the
midlet out of there and then probably we
have a potion of midlet we need to place
it into repository and now we'd like to
distribute it into our devices once more
we need to click install suit it shows
us the issues that can fit our device
now we can we can say just just upload
it to there and let's check what's going
on in tasks no it's it's installing yeah
it is installed now we can run it very
simple but very powerful you can
manipulate with the groups of devices
doing batch operations for a lot of them
with thousands and that's that's the
address the needs of internet things now
and what is next Alex
distance the most interesting thing oops
I think we have run presentation yeah
this is what we have yeah this is the
actually who have been to Gemma ground
and try to our bicycle there nobody okay
that's interesting yeah we have a we
have a raspberry pi powered out of
battery at the back of the bicycle and
we have a bio generator which connect to
the battery and can produce the power
there will also have the solar panel
however will estrogens in Petersburg
accidentally and why do we need our ass
bleep I hear raspberry pi is gathering
and information about the voltage in
different points of the scheme and about
current also will see on the next slide
at next light alex is my ass too she's
too small okay that's yeah while
gathering information and different
points of raspberry pi by using its it
is now you have a wiser Coonskin buzzer
buzzer buzzer okay doesn't matter no
latter this is unleashed unfortunate
isn't yeah this is the ADC
analog-digital converter we can measure
the voltage in different points as you
can see like at the battery and at the
generator at solar panel we know that
the energy sources start to generate to
produce the electricity and we gather
information and also we have their
current sensor they're like below the
generator we have a current sensor we
know the amperage and the circuit and we
can measure it as well we were gathering
that information from the by using our
device access API and calculate the
energy the biker producing for instance
and and send it to the cloud using our
high-level api's HTTP connect so the
idea of that gemma is to show that Java
ME can can go very deep into the
hardware to measure to get the
information out of different sensors
this one with a DC has spi interface and
we have an ability to connect to spi I
to see you art and gpio our export also
we have WM pwm yes and the jitter tonal
converters it's yeah it's basically what
we have now I think and we continue to
work on different interfaces and we can
play some logic on your like edge device
and you can connect the back end using
secure connection use the security
protocols use alpha education
Jason wherever I want actually and they
think that Jammeh means address most of
requirements that Internet of Things ask
us to do I think that's all Alex don't
have something to add I can just start
them again with you is false Sookie you
can go to the Democrats but i want to
start again because i believe it should
work actually okay yep so we
unfortunately wasn't able to make it in
a cloud alex has a cloud instance but
here the local network rules is not
allowed us to go there we want and do
what we want actually Daleks made his
own instance on his laptop now so it's
it's here and just I'm just saying
bicycle and
Joey me provides developers with very
nice developers tools Bethesda key so
you are able to remotely deploy debug
the application at your devices at
Raspberry Pi for instance in our keys
it's working or that works now finally
great Alex congratulations so who want
made some poor for us there were pear
phones go here ok so a bit bigger it is
it is a like car generator so to
generate we need to place a little power
to the yeah you can just just right
non-stop non-stop it will be a little
bit harder now yeah yeah and you now you
start to produce the electricity you can
see the bicycle voltage there and the
energy what is your name and well energy
when producing now when I'm horsepower
and putting into the hour battery and
thank you for a power we will use it in
proper way with progress yeah so yeah
you can see it works you can see
actually at the screen like the voltage
you're producing bicycle voltage so 14
volts yeah thanks ISA yeah probably yes
to get the electricity back to grid
because not wasted not not like heat the
air thank you n very much
I don't see halls no I think so guys if
you have a questions that our pleasure
to answer it is the process currently
has that ability and we have just
announced it yesterday we did a press
release about support of platelets the
management console is a process
management system it's not an Oracle its
third party yeah processed process this
is german company right yeah german
company way no no its commercial just
commercial way we're selling the service
section actually no I didn't hear about
it actually it's not so it's not so
difficult to write your own application
management system because software
management API is it's pretty easy to
use and just every company I know
actually every company our customers we
are going to talk into humans they
written their own application
measurement system from scratch that's
that's not very sophisticated that Y is
1 million management midlet which
operates with the light cycle of the
application your device and it's already
implemented like internal part you need
just to write the back end connection
that's all
how to place it onto device no no no
it's completely different out of OS j
way web yeah we support so is Jai
bundles and we started to support midlet
as a separate yeah yeah that's right but
no no it's it's nothing to do before
this job we have our own life cycle not
there is j-1 the question is where I'm
it let in osgi life cycle in osgi model
how web bundled and yeah I forgot to
mention that the Raspberry Pi actually
is not the target platform for our for
our platform it's not the target
hardware for our platform we recently
released the early access for free scale
k 64 and freescale k 64 is a cortex m4
with 256 kilobytes of RAM as Raspberry
Pi has almost half of more than half of
gig of ram we can now work on 256
kilobytes and we are able to placed on
one megabyte of rome on k 64k 64 is a
system-on-chip is the only one small
cheap microcontroller produced by
freescale
spur spark a spark that's huge it is
huge it's real yeah we we are going to
the microcontroller lost market so
address the needs of millions of devices
so so and don't forget that
microcontrollers is our way cheap
actually right now and they become
cheaper and cheaper day to day and for
example g64 costs to picasa g63 only
cheap for production costs about iono 10
those ten dollars no no 5 verse
reachable at les less than five ten
dollars like in microcontroller
industries is a huge amount of money
Alex okay I'm just developer it's a c64
teenagers is can it is federally
freescale yeah well you now can use it
with Java oh thanks a lot guys thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
