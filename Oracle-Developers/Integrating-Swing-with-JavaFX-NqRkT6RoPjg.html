north / client architect and development
manager for JavaFX
I have a long gooey history that dates
back to the old wonderful small talk
programming language up through Eclipse
I was involved in eclipse deeply and I'm
sorry for that too
and now I've I've been working at Oracle
for the last couple years working on
Java effects with me is my good friend
Kevin Rushworth technical lead for the
project and I've been working on not so
gooey things mostly graphics is my
background but I've been at Oracle for
well ever since they got our acquired
Sun Microsystems it was the Sun and a
number of years before that sort of the
beginning of Java days so between us
we're good JavaFX guys he's released
JavaFX guys that try to be good yeah
this is the useless lawyer slide if
there are any useless lawyers around in
the audience we're please read it and
there'll be a quiz afterwards and all
things safe harbor etc a wonderful area
docks there but anyways and here's our
agenda so I'll give a quick introduction
and we'll get right into the Interop and
then I want to talk about the threading
model and it you know its limitations
and whatnot well one thing if you have
questions at any time feel free to
interrupt with those questions rather
than holding them to the end we'll leave
some plenty of time at the end for Q&amp;amp;A
but we won't necessarily answer them but
you can try that's right okay
so we take we think Interop is really
important for the obvious reasons that
there are a large number of AWT swing
applications in the world and they don't
all need to be rewritten and you know
other there are other examples of GUI
toolkits that have taken Interop
seriously for example when Microsoft
switch gears from win32 into WPF they
made sure that out of the gate you could
interrupt with win32 applications and
mix them together
not so with Apple when they switch gears
from carbon to cocoa if you had a carbon
application you couldn't mix them
together eventually a few years n they
developed a bridge in trop but they
didn't come out of the gate which is
rather shameful for them in the case of
Java effects we take it seriously and we
ensured from the start that you could
embed Java effects within swing so I
mean another important thing is we
wanted to enable third-party components
so that your existing code would just
run it's also important for getting your
feet wet you're gonna you know you've
got this big AWT swing base and you want
to try out Java effects but you don't
want to throw out your existing
application you're not sure Java effects
is gonna do everything you want it will
but you're not sure at this you know at
this juncture so you can try it out a
little bit mix and match and one of the
biggest uses for Interop is to provide a
browser component for AWT swing so there
are a lot of people that are simply
embedding the browser component
component and using that just add one
thing I don't know how many of you were
at the NASA talk next door right before
this but that was a perfect example of
Interop what they did is they used some
Java FX 3d components inside another
wise swing out in one of their
applications which I thought was pretty
cool
so I mean we are providing a migration
path for people we wanted to give the
full power of FX in an embedded
application like I don't mean embedded
obviously in the sense of you know small
device but embedding and we wanted to
way embedding and of course performance
is a critical to us right we're all
about that so if you're if it's if
you're embedding and your molasses is
glacial or molasses slow it's not
particularly useful right we didn't want
to fall back to software rendering just
because you were embedding one way or
the other
yeah so as I say we came out of the gate
JavaFX chilled that was the the reboot
that was the first I was a was just
around for that it just happened where
we'd switched from FX script and one
point X which I had missed and so sort
of the first real reboot of the first
reboot of JavaFX that was all java and
not script whether j' whatever the
script language was called we had one
level of embedding and very quickly we
came up with the embedding of SWT so
that you could mix SWT and FX
applications as well
the first embeddings didn't do
drag-and-drop and had some performance
issues and and whatnot so we fixed a
bunch of bugs and kept going and the
latest at FX 8 which is you know why
what we're here for was embedding the
other direction of the embedding which
by the way we did have in Java FX 1 is
just people missed it so much we had to
add it in its - ok
so let's talk about the toolkits working
together so as I said the embedding
works both ways jfx panel goes used to
embed FX and AWT swing swing note to
embed AWT swing and java effects and of
course this leads to recursive halls of
mirrors and in fact I have no idea what
happens if you embed swing into jazz
effects and then add a swing node into
GFX but I'm expecting somebody in the
audience to try it and report at the end
of the talk and tell me that either
works or doesn't work this is the kind
of level of recursive insanity that you
should probably avoid Kevin you should
start working on it right now and sure
I'll get right back to you okay so jfx
panel is a swing component it's a
lightweight J component you can have
multiple of them in your application in
its implementation it uses the event
handlers AWT swing event handlers and
forwards them to JavaFX the performance
is comparable to standalone java effects
and it supports accelerated painting
drag and drop and all of the features
that you would expect right and the key
here is whatever pipeline you're running
on if you're on a Windows machine we're
still gonna run the JavaFX prism d 3d
renderer and if you're on a Mac you're
still gonna run the OpenGL renderer
exactly the same the only slight
overhead is in pulling out the bits into
the thing and even that's accelerated
but but we copy from the off-screen
buffer into the swing panel the swing
back buffer it's otherwise I'll fully
Exelero the drawing this happened it's
fully accelerated as if it was a regular
Java FX app this delightful wad of code
is embedding of FX panel inside of J
frame and if you run it you get this
nice circle you can see that there's a
invoke laters and run laters that's to
do with the threading model which I'll
describe in detail later on in the talk
but you can see how much nicer it is -
with its lambdas rather than runnable 'z
it actually fits on the slide now and
one of the things I forgot to mention
was we should have used lambda in the
title of our talk which would have been
clean increased attendance that then we
would have needed the bigger room yes so
maybe if you just every second word you
say lambda then we'll have people's
gonna start streaming he bombs off the
street winos so anyways anyway that's
the running example that's one way of
the embedding so AWT swaying on the
outside FX on the inside so I could run
this but I'd have to go and get the
Internet and whatnot so I probably skip
this
yeah Wireless is this is like the you
can see the swing buttons and whatnot
around the web view FX web view node and
that's actually a great album if you
like guitar sound won't read this so
that's one side of the embedding so this
is the other direction of the embedding
embedding swing in java effects and that
came later on because we had determined
by you know that that the the level that
was most important of the embedding was
getting was doing it the first way which
is FX embedded in swing because we did
imagine that that would be the direction
people were going with large swing
applications who wanted to include FX so
like jfx powell you can help multiple
swing nodes in a single application and
it's the same idea overriding event the
implementation overrides event handlers
and forwards them from one toolkit to
another performance is comparable and it
also supports accelerated painting and
whatnot the first release of swing node
had various problems in it as you might
expect with a first release many have
been addressed and fixed in eight you
forty so I encourage you to if you're
you know upset or discouraged by the
first release or
I encourage you to go and get the early
access build right in fact and they
weren't even all JavaFX problems what we
did is when doing swing node we
uncovered a few swing problems so we
actually had to fix them in both places
and so you really do need eight you
forty you can't just go get JDK 8 and
run FX out of eight you forty just goes
download the early access of JDK 8 you
forty with FX and it'll run a lot better
it should be comparable it depends on
how many you have if you have a mostly
swing application and you want to do a
Java FX chart you're probably better off
using a jfx panel if you have a mostly
Java FX application and you just have a
few custom third-party controls then you
could do it the other way using swing
node I don't think it would matter too
much
I I would think you'd probably better in
that case embedding that into a JGL
panel which is what world wind kind of
comes with anyways it will render into a
swing lightweight component if you take
that and then also embed that into a
swing node into a jfx application it
wouldn't quite hit that recursive thing
that he hit it actually should work but
that we haven't tried that that would be
something that would be interesting I
think Anton did embed some all I I know
he tried something out I know he had all
that don't Pleasant world wasn't
whirlwind but he did get opened some
OpenGL embedding I guess I would say try
it and see if that works the one example
that we saw if you were that the NASA
one next door they actually had a swing
out with a JGL panel and then a jfx
panel so by now everyone's had a chance
to look at this WOD that puts up the
click of a button the exciting click Me
button and a new lambda with another
delicious lambda for yeah so there's not
much there nice short code but again
having to talk from one toolkit to
another through these invoke leaders and
run leaders so maybe I'll run some code
let's see let's so this first thing if I
can actually see his swing set and both
these are examples of embedding swing in
JavaFX with the swing node yeah we
didn't bother with the other running the
other yeah the other one we've seen
enough oh so this is a swing set kind of
thing which is embedded don't is
embedded in J effects so it's like fully
reflections work effects work everything
works and the only reason you know that
it's embedded in fact FX is just playing
around playing games with keys
this is J free chart node I don't know
if any of you are familiar with J free
chart it was a it's a swing set of swing
utilities to do charting so there's some
what's this one so this one is the Glee
mark bitmap test this is rendering using
Java FX nodes for each of those little
monsters there each image views and then
on top of that we've overlaid a swing
node with J free chart in it and so it's
a trance beauty fully transparent we can
support that very easily either
direction and in this case we have a
transparent J free chart showing a
performance meter on there so what's got
you are getting 60 frames a second I
can't see it yeah we're getting 60
frames a second and it's got that nice
transparency and and what not because
it's just a node and right I wonder and
reflection your reflection reflection
yeah I wonder I'll just if this thing
would I could just quickly run it on but
yeah it's just taking a second we'll
just run it quickly on went same thing
on windows let's do the same thing on
windows same sort of performance and I'm
running VMware so this is time we're
executing accelerated yeah so I mean the
takeaway is it's working well on I
suppose I could go run Linux if I really
felt like it but I'll just quickly do
this
probably more fun to do it with
something anyway
okay let's go back to the presentation
so anyway the takeaway is that swing
note is working well performing well and
and flexible like any other node having
said that nobody's perfect and there are
some limitations and problems still in
the Interop one of them is that you have
to explicitly exit you have to get rid
of the implicit exit of java effects so
JavaFX
right we have a sort of a different
model by default so unlike swing where
by default it's closed does nothing on
JavaFX by default the last window that
closes shuts down the JavaFX runtime
that kind of those two models generally
don't mix and so what we found is that
the default just doesn't work very well
for most swing Interop apps that this is
particularly for jfx panel apps so if
you're a jfx panel user the first thing
you'll want to do is just turn off
implicit exit
so I guess unfortunately FX doesn't shut
down to the faff X shut down and start
it up again one of these bugs is
probably chocolaty indicating that that
would make this not a problem oh yeah
another one is traversing out of an
embedding that's something that you if
you've got mixing to gooeys together you
probably want to do that and by
traversing in this case you mean Mouse
traversal without by the tab either so
keyboard not Mouse tab I'm sorry that's
a mouse yes arias yeah tap traversal so
that's a little bit clunky there there
is a an issue of all involving modal
windows because you've got two toolkits
and to do the modality you have to reach
through one toolkit to the other and get
the operating system cookie underneath
to block its input or some such hacks
and you know just hasn't been it hasn't
it's a little tricky it's another one of
those things that when we do it it will
require changes on both the JDK
and they're a swingin effort and of
course the jdk making its cookie
available to the world is also it's it's
uh you know window handle available they
could make it available to us well
Stuber special yeah um and as I said
before the initial swing note had some
problems with performance and and
painting which of there's some problem
still exists nobody's perfect ok so let
me talk about the threading model a
little bit
so AWT swing has its own threading model
in its own event loop kwt is free
threaded not really because it doesn't
really work but you know you're supposed
to have been able to talk to the GUI
from any thread but the only free
threaded widget toolkit that i've ever
really come across in in life is motif
and that one is quite interesting we can
go into that one sometime later with
your GUI history lesson but we don't
need to do it today
swing is apartment threaded with a
single UI thread called the EDT the
event loop is running native in another
thread it's not the ADT EDT but it is
apartment threaded so there's one
dedicated thread that is pump that is
dispatching events to your application
and you are running in that thread right
and anybody who's done any swing
programming knows about invoke later for
the swing utilities or event queue
invoke later to just you're required to
do that if you modify any swing to talk
back to talk from one thread from to
talk to talk to the GUI thread from
another thread JavaFX has its own
threading model and own event loop and
Java affects his apartment threaded just
like swing but its event loop is native
and Java effects code runs in the native
GUI event threat and this is really good
from in many respects because it's it's
actually how the operating system
expects your GUI code to run and a lot
of nice features come out of that and
there were a lot of problems in aw
swings implement
because it has these threads that so
when we were doing FX well it was prior
to me but I mean I probably would not
have come on board if there had been the
threading nightmare no but I remember
some of your earliest comments were
exactly around this don't get it wrong
don't say that it's wrong right so so
JavaFX has it right
AWT has the right model but hasn't got
the implementation that matches it but
but there are two separate separate GUI
threads and that's that's why you need
to talk between them using invoke later
and run later because that's how you
talk between different threads anyway so
this little diagram with various arrows
is kind of explaining what happens
operating system issues events and
sticks them in an event queue if you
just look at Java effects on the top
that little two arrow is chasing each
other represent Java effects pulling
events operating system events and
paints and whatever off the event queue
and processing them for itself and if
you look at the same picture underneath
you can see a WT swing doing the same
thing and the the chasing arrows are a
WT and swing processing its own events
and the cross arrows which could maybe
have been a skull and crossbone in there
indicate the tool toolkits talking to
each other through invoke letter and run
later so they are putting events in that
event queue to be pulled off and run in
the GUI thread of the other toolkit
right and I should note that both our
internal implementation does this for
things like drag-and-drop and event
forwarding but also your application has
to be aware of this as you're running FX
code if you want to modify one of your
swing widgets you have to do it invoke
later as you're running something in
your swing widget if you want to do
something in FX you do run later yes
coming try to run them in the same
thread coming oh really
interesting so that's kind of the state
of the art today so there's obviously
problems with that you can't wait
because you'll get deadlock yeah and
there is no running wait at FX we have
not exposed that on purpose and it's
like programming the web so it's that
probably run a little it's like call a
continuation or do a little code and
call me back when you're ready and it
that tends to make code bloke bloat
although lambda fights that but still
code bloat and your applications are
more complex so the other thing which
it's interesting is that threading is
not consistently enforced and what I
mean by that is there are thread checks
and Java effects but they're not in
every single API so if you talk to
something from the wrong thread well the
most common cases will catch and throw
an exception and catch it and throw an
exception and warn you but not every API
is protected so in fact I'd say most of
our note modification is not protected
and it'll work some of the time and it
will not work other times but one thing
you really don't want in a GUI is
non-deterministic behavior where are you
you know and you're gonna get that with
threads so I think somebody suggested
that we ought to fix that someday yeah
and and and it may still happen but of
course clipping a default to be the
other way anyways if we fix it would
have to be compatible so anyway that
guy's got a horrible headache from the
model that was forced on us so the new
model is a unified threading model so
let's just walk through it they're both
Java effects and swang our apartment
threaded but they run in separate
apartments neither toolkit can wait when
running application code in the other
toolkits event queue because it'll block
and so if
regular JavaFX application in a callback
for a mouse press if you just block and
wait there
no more events will be just dispatched
from the operating system and the window
will go gray and that notice I say
correctly because that's what people
expect and you know the operating system
will correctly gray your window out
right and and show that your organ and
or give you a little spinny beach ball
right oh you know it'll do that properly
so and also swing code should never wait
in an event handler as well I'm not sure
because of the threading and the hidden
native event queue and all this I'm not
sure exactly if it does the same thing
but anyway knew neither toolkit should
wait when running application code so
people don't write code that waits in
both of them so that's a input to this
little to this description so the and a
final restriction is that the Java
effects apartment must be the native GUI
thread and that is enforced and that's
by design for all the good reasons of
running in the native GUI thread and it
can't be changed in effects right we're
never changing that it's the correct way
to do that so yeah so the thing is FX
can't be changed to run in another
thread but could swing run in the FX GUI
threat if you remember there was a
hidden event loop thread and then there
was the this EDT thread that was
dispatching events the normal way to
sway a WT swing button presses etc and
what are the restrictions on that thread
it in a WT swing it can't be the native
GUI thread but it could it be the native
GUI thread of FFX and so this is why not
make the JavaFX platform GUI thread be
the EDT thread for a deputy swing and
this is essentially what I just
described so the unified threading Moll
model marries these threads and this is
what it looks like there's that same
arrow cloud diagram thing and you can
just see that a WT swing events are
being posted into
JavaFX JavaFX is dispatching events for
both JavaFX
and AWT swing and a little arrow that is
between the two clouds is indicating
just the ability to just talk directly
and not fool around with the skull and
crossbones
posting and cross posting into the other
event loops the other toolkits there you
don't know yeah this is the operating
this event queue is a kind of rough I'm
I'm purposely blurring the operating
systems event queue that it has for its
native mouse clicks interleaf with the
run laters and things that are not
native to running in the operating
system the things that you're describing
which are run later so the event queue
is a this is represent queue in here
it's representing the fact that there
still are two native gooey threads and
there are still two queue so to answer
your specific question if you have a
bunch of JavaFX run laters as long as
you don't spin up a nested event loop in
the middle of one of them they will run
in the order that you submit them yeah
the swing ones will also run in the
order that you submit them but
absolutely no guarantee between those
two which will run me and they could run
in either order that is the short answer
that's not generally that should be okay
yeah it's not generally a problem ater
because the contract of run later or
invoke later is just just do this right
right if someone is typing really fast
maybe it won't happen right away because
it is interleaved with the normal mouse
and keyboard and whatever input so
unified threading works the codes been
released for awhile it's controlled by
this flag which is turned off by default
default right and I'd say at some point
we should provide an API to do this so
that it's a little cleaner than just
setting a flag but the question is
should we ever change the default well I
think I think not we should change the
default but at this point we haven't
really like threading a super calm
located I mean if you're just talking
about mouse and keyboard I believe that
diagram when you get drag-and-drop in
there Maroons nested event loops
sometimes those event loops are in the
operating system themselves like on
Windows there's a do drag drop call that
doesn't return has it's nested event
loop inside the operating system drag
and drop is appearing to work dragon
there's a dragon right there drag and
drop is appearing appears to work
everything looks good but we're you know
we haven't really beaten it to death and
one of the issues is yeah I don't know
are you sure one of the issues is is if
you make this flag default and you say
that the toolkit scan can inter I can
talk to each other freely without the
nonsense of invoke later and whatnot if
you run into a problem later that is a
stop ship problem you've written your
whole application to to talk freely and
then you're a lot of trouble because you
need to go back and find all those
places and and on you know fix it to go
through the noise of invoking later
having said all that NetBeans is making
use of the flag other we know a lot of
people that are making use of this flag
and to have success with it yeah in fact
we had a buff the other night where two
people said oh we use it in our
production application never had a
problem so that's why at the very least
we'll provide an API ami yeah I was in
there they have a preview mode where you
can use a web component yes there
they're using FX as the embedded at the
use of the embedded web
on all planets on all platforms this is
on all plus not Mac specific which I
know was your earlier equation and I'm
forgetting to repeat the question so
here I didn't I forgot to remind you
yeah so there you go
when I forgot to remind you to remind me
and so and then we go recursive and
explode okay uh did you have a question
yeah that was sort of the meta
discussion we were starting to have so
that you asked the question directly
maybe it would be something we would do
in a major release I could not imagine
doing it in an update release so yeah
JDK 9 would be the absolute earliest we
could do before that the best we would
do is provide a proper API rather than
just a system property that's a little
harder to get to yeah I think that's not
a bad idea anyway the only problem with
that is is unlike some flags as Steve
pointed out earlier it's not just turn
the flag on and see if your same
application runs the reason for that is
that if you actually code knowing that
you're coding for a single one you then
have a program that will not be correct
and won't run correctly in the other
mode obviously the converse though it
isn't true if you code assuming that we
have separate threads it will still work
if you you know I mean I suppose you
could put a shim in between that
controlled the use of it did either just
execs acute the runnable right away or
forward it and be able to flip that you
know back and forth but it's you know it
seems quite artificial and you know you
understand what I'm getting it
invoke yeah it'll still work
everything's fine it'll it'll work in
the same way that it worked before why
did the flag you're asking what does a
flag do no they're not they actually do
run later so so in particular if you're
within the FX thread and there's the
same things true for swing I execute a
bunch of code call invoke later on a
runnable execute a bunch more code the
bunch more code will run to completion
until you return back there's no way
that code run you see you're just
throwing a runnable to be run sometime
later whether it's from another thread
or from the GUI thread itself it's just
gonna run at some point no because
that's what happens today with 2/3 it
actually it won't change at all
yeah so that that's why the idea of
switching threads is actually a little
I'm switching the default is actually a
little scary in a way because going the
one way yeah it the way it is right now
if everybody codes for the current
default you're gonna run either way yeah
anyway did we ever have to do a lot more
thinking before we do it i test anchor
line an api first and then decide if we
ever want to switch the default I think
there was a question over yeah what sir
another question we didn't get to
were distributed
so you want to so could the run later
and invoke later be combined to give it
to the correct thread so you won't have
this problem later and I have to think
about that for a minute because if I go
back to this picture the correct thread
is the FX thread for the I mean that's
that's where the run leaders are going
everything has to run in that thread so
I'm not quite sure you'd do that
yeah I'm not quite sure also I mean the
other thing too is the invoke later and
run later they just take a runnable it
doesn't even have to have swing or
JavaFX code in there it could be
anything so I don't see how we could do
that then so we want everything running
in FX's GUI thread in this model okay so
I guess I'll just quickly go over some
implementation details so there are two
possible approaches for implementing
Interop one is a heavyweight approach
and the other is a lightweight approach
heavyweight I put easy in quotes because
it you know depends what you mean by
easy so a heavyweight approach would
mean embedding it one toolkit another
using an operating system handle so on
Windows it would be an H wind and an H
win for the top level stage and the
embedding would also have an H wind in
it as well
so it's easy to implement in the sense
that once you get the low-level C code
and unuse the mechanism for the
operating system to place one window
within another which is different on the
different operating systems that is a
tricky bit of code but all of the stuff
on top is going to work exactly as if
you were running as a top level window
however that if you do that it brings
along with it all the heavy weight light
weight issues which are generally
unacceptable for most applications I
could imagine a small set of business
applications where there's not fancy
glowing and spinning and whatnot where
you might have you know a browser or
something embedded in a pane that stays
there forever
but that would be you know that would be
pretty restrictive so that is the
heavyweight approach so it's not really
easy but it does mean that you get
exactly the same behavior as if you were
running in a top-level stage the
lightweight implementation is harder to
implement because rather than hooking
together the low-level see part of the
two toolkits the toolkits are hooked
together using the event handlers of one
toolkit to forward to the event handlers
of another toolkit and the drawing of
one it's it's a Java only solution so
it's harder in that sense because
there's kind of more code to write but
it provides better integration so all of
the effects translucency etc is all
available to the embedded swing node or
and and whatnot right in fact if you
remember the demo that Steve ran with
the swing set in there
showing it rotated you saw an effect
under there he was using a reflection
effect yeah so the there were two
possible approaches there is some
advantages is that the heavyweight one
but we chose the lightweight
implementation fits better with how we
did the entity and web view as well so I
think I described this is really the
only viable alternative it has one
serious disadvantage in that the
embedding toolkit must implement all new
level
no low-level features so if you can
imagine embed a heavyweight embedding
where you're you glue together the
underlying operating system cookies any
new functionality involving mouse and
keyboard or touch or what-have-you
is automatically made available in this
idea where one toolkit is getting input
and forwarding to another and all
written in Java you've got to keep
adding more Dinka deforming code and
that was a case with drag-and-drop so
the first embedding didn't support
drag-and-drop because that code hadn't
been written so now having said that
we're getting to the end of things that
might be added right so and there I
talked about Java jar
drag and drop swing doesn't have touch
but Java effect does which means that
embedding can't do it because it's just
the underlying toolkit doesn't have
that right so let's go in one direction
where you using JavaFX seen in a jfx
panel you're not to get a touch yeah
so to think about the lightweight
embedding it's if you think about it as
X Windows it's a it's a good analogy for
what's happening in X windows keyboard
and mouse events are being sent down a
pipe and drawing is coming back this is
a rough in analogy and so that's what's
happening in the implementation that in
the implementation of GFX panel right
now so feeded events and it spits you
back textures that need to be converted
to for swing to draw on one way for GFX
panel and swing node is the same idea
but the opposite direction
swing giving back images that get turned
into textures for jfx to to draw and of
course when we have a texture we can do
all kinds of interesting things with
that texture reflection etc so I don't
know where we are in time but oh good
I've got a question so ok
it should be what release of JavaFX were
you running yeah so that would have been
in the FX - I guess I'm surprised that
even then it didn't work but we've tried
it ok oh ok that you you were just
running into the problem that you know
that's wasn't supported on your platform
no I
that's so I think that you hit something
very different if you take JavaFX 8 and
JDK 8 you'll run into the same problem
we don't support older version makes we
require Red Hat version 6 so if you even
have Red Hat 5 you're out of luck it's
because we were on Linux glass requires
gtk 2.18 or later yeah so and we didn't
add isn't really an interrupt ish and we
didn't repeat the question oh so I'm
gonna repeat this question please do
were you running on I didn't repeat it
thanks Jonathan JavaFX J free chart
embedded in Java FX was slow when
resizing and what version are you
running eight you forty or you're
running eight u xx which version of Java
effects because as I said a lot of that
has been fixed recently I would suggest
that you go get the latest and greatest
and give it a whirl right and then if
there's still problems file bugs yeah
okay I'm gonna do it this time
go
okay their question was there is redraw
problems on involving a JavaFX menu and
a swing application on was it
Linux windows and I would say again you
should get the latest and if it's still
happening file a bug because I don't
know of any problems and especially on
Windows I don't know a problem like that
in in that area right where as there
were in some of the earlier releases I
think some of what they fixed in 8u 20
and then some additional things they
fixed in 8u 40 which is out an early
access would have done it but if you got
anything before 8 sorry if you got
anything before JDK 8 you 20 I could
imagine there were some known problems
that would have affected you
over to job at that
the jtextfield now I have a rapper class
round that inflicts abuses
and how many I mean you have an effect
beyond that question so the question
that let's see if I can summarize it I
would like to have a million jfx panels
in my UI and I'm wondering whether the
universe explodes is that a reasonable
summary the universe should not explode
I don't know how many hundreds yeah I I
don't know how well something like that
would perform well I think your fear
into the thousands you might get trouble
yeah oh yes absolutely yeah but but the
thing is for each jfx panel you'll have
a scene and a JavaFX scene is not the
lightest weight thing in the world
because you expect it's supposed to spec
if I expect it to be a one-to-one
mapping between that and tens of scenes
is more what we expect rather than
hundreds of scenes but so you get into
thousands that we know you'll have
problems hundreds try oh I wouldn't say
ILC with hundreds you might be okay but
I suggest your homework is to go write a
benchmark and find out yeah find out at
which point we wrote right whereas the
other way around I think a swing node is
not nearly as heavy weight that the idea
there is that that's just using a swing
J component which is a lighter weight
thing than a JavaFX scene okay yep
question is is there a glass plain pane
or J layer for JavaFX like it's the
closest thing we would have to that now
would be sub scene you can have a sub
scene which is good for doing overlays
as well as I mean it's it's there to do
multiple things one of which is mixing
2d and 3d but if you have just a
top-level scene and then a sub scene
that covers exactly the same thing make
it transparent it should do the same
thing for you okay let's see so if there
are no more questions I'm not going to
read out this conclusion summary thing
because everybody has had time it hasn't
had time to read it but the Interop is
there it goes both ways
it's ready to be used and that's all I
have
oh one last question go ahead and eat
you didn't say going wise it's part as
part of the speaker yeah most of these
will be uploaded since they were all
uploaded to Java one that's really up to
the conference and we didn't repeat the
question and and we didn't will the
presentation slides be online
my understanding is yes will the
presenter ever repeat the question will
the presenter ever repeat the question
not if I'm the presenter that's never
gonna happen I don't know okay well
thanks everybody and happy Interop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
