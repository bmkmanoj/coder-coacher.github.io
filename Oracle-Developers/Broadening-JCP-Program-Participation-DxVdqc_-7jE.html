session today our panel is broadening
JCP program participation so the way
we're going to set it up today as will
do introductions and we'll give about a
10 minute overview and then we'll hear
from our panelists on their different
perspectives that they bring to us about
JCP membership so at this point I will
allow the panelists to introduce
themselves starting with Scott Jamison
and the mic is right in front you just
need to just know it's working I
think yep so all right Thank You Heather
and thank you all for coming actually
you've got us seated properly in order
you're going right down the list as the
slide indicates I'm the executive
committee representative from
hewlett-packard I've been on the EC
essentially since it's except inception
and actually prior to that and some of
the precursors to the JCP so been seeing
quite a lot of change in both the
industry in Java and and that you see
itself and so you know this work that
we're doing around continually
rethinking the how Java and the
community should interact with each
other it's a healthy ongoing process and
look forward to this panel thank you
thank you Steve next hi I'm Steve
millage i'm founder of CTB too we're a
specialist java middleware consultancy
I've actually been an expert well JCP
member since about two thousand five and
as an individual member and a number of
our employees have been in individual
members and various expert groups and we
just bought a month ago joined as a
corporate member
so thanks yes thanks for participating
Arun yeah my name is Aaron Gupta I work
for red hat being with one of the
founding members of the java ee team
I've been with JCP all along I run the
developer outreach team at Red Hat for
middleware now thanks for now hi
everyone thanks for coming I think that
discussing the expansion of the JCP is
extremely important I have been working
with the JCP for far too many years I
think it's I was the first individual
track should join the JCP when do they
open up for for individual participation
and so Java the user group that I
represented at the ec was the first job
as a group to join the JCP as soon as
Java sea's groups could you join the JCP
at some point the past and so I think we
are we're very very excited about you
know I think that the JCP is the place
where we all have to to come and meet
and discuss and we all see that you know
although is extremely important for our
for developers as you can just look
around yourself you're going to see that
that participation is lower than what
we'd like to be right so I think that
this is like a continuous discuss that
we need to do is how how we can broaden
that participation how we can excite
more people to come and participate
because by the end of the day this is
what defines the technology that we are
invest all our time and lives in the
efforts you know you know on our
day-to-day job so if things are not
going well in to JCP it's probably not
going well with your technology we use
so we need you to be part of it more yes
very good good point Bruno that's why
we're here to talk about how we're going
to broaden the participation so get all
the different perspectives and now
Patrick can introduce himself so I'm
Patrick color and I'm chair of the ACPD
organization and Saul I have to say on
that subject I'm heavily akira
I'm the watch okay so we were I'm not on
the slide I cuz I'm here okay I mean
she's invisible force behind JCP that's
why yes so I managed to program office
and we put together you know some
questions for the panelists but first
Patrick is going to walk us through a
little bit of where we've been over the
last several years in terms of evolving
the JCP and some of the directions that
we're heading in to help us to get more
java developers to participate in the
JCP so i turned back to Patrick okay so
how do we how do we evolve the
organization how do we change our
Constitution we have a well-defined
process for that we have two documents
that determine define the legal
framework that we operate in and our
governance the way we're structured and
organized first is called the JSP a Java
specification participation agreement
that's the legal document that you sign
when you join the organization and it
addresses intellectual property grants
and licensing terms and stuff like that
all of our documents are online so you
can check them out second document is
the process document that defines our
governance we organized how we
structured the voting processes LGS are
developed and move through the process
and so on and in order to change the way
we function we need to change one or
both of these documents and the way we
do that is through the process which
already exists the process that we use
for developing specifications because
those two documents really are the
specifications for the organization so
we filed a JSR and we say we want to do
X and as a result of that GSR we will
change one or both of those documents
typically I act as the spec lead for
these process changed ASRs but Heather
is acting as spectra lead for one of
them and the executive committee
collectively forms the expert group for
dcs ours and they go through all the
same stages as regular J srs and we as I
said we change one or other of those
document since earlier 2012 i think
we've been working on a series of four
jrs that we call JCP dot next to reform
our processes the first one 348 we like
to summarize that as no more smoke
filled rooms in other words we did this
fairly quickly and it was pretty simple
but it was important we said instead of
the expert groups kind of going away
into a closed room and deliberating
among themselves and months or sometimes
years later stuff would pop out the
other end and nobody in the developer
community would have any real idea what
they considered and what they rejected
and why they made the choices that they
made and they didn't really have much
input into the process although there
were formal review processes so instead
we said do everything out in the open
public mailing lists public issue
trackers let everybody see what you're
doing we finished this in late 2011 and
we modified the process document to
bring it up to version 2.8 result of
this we saw a big increase in developer
participation in the JCP and one
important way that that happened was
through java user groups joining and
through the adopt to jsr program the
second of these juicy billion xjs ours
was gos our 355 it was very simple we
used to have two executive committee's
14 me14 SCEE combined we smush them
together we did that because we knew
that the MU and SC platforms were going
to converge over time and it didn't seem
to make sense anymore to have a separate
Amy jsr we did reduce the total number
of members from 32 down to 25 but
otherwise we didn't make any other
significant changes there we finish this
one in August 2012 that was an easy one
the third one is the big scary one JCB
don't next three jsr 358 this will
modify the JSP a that's the legal
document hasn't been significantly
changed since 2002 but the the world has
changed around us is widespread adoption
of open-source licensing and open-source
development processes and it's time we
brought our legal agreement in our
licensing mob
model into alignment with that the
documents long and it's complicated it
really does need cleaning up but it's
kind of like legacy code you've got to
be really careful that you don't break
something you know the language was put
in there for a reason we think some of
it may be vestigial and doesn't no
longer serving a purpose but you know
you've got to be really careful plus all
the lawyers are involved because it is a
legal document so it's taking us a long
long time it's important because this
document defines the way intellectual
property rights are granted and it
defines the terms under which the output
of the process the spec the RI and the
tck must be licensed excuse me we need
to make sure that the stuff gets
incorporated into Java into the Java
platforms is safe from an IP perspective
that the people who granted it had the
right to do so and then they gave the
appropriate rights so that it can be
incorporated in the platform and people
can implement the jsr s safely and know
that they have all the rights that they
need to do so our goals with this jsr
which we are still discussing are
maintaining the compatibility guarantees
which are at the heart of java if you
get an implementation of a java spec a
java technology you know it's complete
and you know it's going to work the same
as other implementations we want to
embrace open-source licensing and
development processes we want to
simplify the IP flow and the licensing
model and we want to the extent that we
can enable even more openness
transparency and participation that's
geocell 358 it's still ongoing we
originally included in that jsr some
proposed changes around membership and
when we realize that was going to take I
want to say forever I was taking a long
time we decided to spin off those
changes into yet another GSR 360 for the
fourth of the forum for JCP to next
year's ours and focus here specifically
on membership since Heather is the spec
lead for this particular jsr I'm going
to let her talk about what what it's
doing great thanks Patrick so yeah I'll
just explain a little bit jsr 364 is
currently an early draft review stage of
going through the JC
p and its title is the same as this
panel broadening JCP membership and as
patrick said our goal here was to
encourage more individuals to
participate in the JCP while at the same
time ensuring the IP was safe as patrick
just mentioned so in the working group
what we decided to do with this proposal
was introduced some new classes of
membership so we'll have a new level
called an affiliate membership for
individuals with a simpler agreement so
the JSP a right now is 11 pages so our
goal is to make this a little bit easier
for people to join and participate and
we would not require their employer to
sign this agreement either which takes
away another barrier that some
individual Java developers space in
terms of participation in the JCP and we
also discussed that Java user groups are
often wanting to get more involved with
the JCP since the adopted jsr program
was introduced in 2012 there's 500 user
groups around the world right now we
have about 50 that have joined as JCP
members but the current structure of the
organization only allows for them to
join as a full member and sign the full
JSP a which for many Java user groups
really doesn't make sense because they
aren't legal entities so we will be
creating a new membership class for user
groups Java user groups and we'll call
that the partner membership class and
the other thing that we're doing in
terms of removing barriers is we looked
at the cost there used to be a
five-thousand-dollar fee per year to
participate in the JCP for corporations
and we decided to eliminate those fees
as well as any other so it will be no
charge to have a membership in the JCP
so this is not final yet and so it's not
fully in effect but we are going ahead
and granting this to new corporations
now in order to enable better
participation in the meantime so we our
goal here is that we complete this jsr
at the end of the year in 2014 and
december and we would like to have a
public review very soon so you can keep
your eyes out for that and give us your
feet
back oh did we already change for me
this is where i can tell you you can go
to participate this fly 19 so we have a
java.net project as you know we talked
about the current version of the JCP
that we're operating under requires that
we're doing our work out in the open and
being transparent so we have the same
types of issue trackers and minutes and
mailing list that you can subscribe to
for you to give us comments at any time
you don't have to wait for the public
review you can go comments on the
mailing list or the issue tracker right
now so this is 3 looks like java denied
project home page and there's links here
in this page to the mailing lists so you
can sign up to be on the mailing list
there's links to the issue tracker those
links to the document archive where
there's all a minute or meetings and
interim documents and so on and so on ok
ok very good so that kind of sets the
stage for you so I'll start off with our
questions to hear from our panelists so
i'll start with scott as a long-standing
EC member and been involved since the EC
was started back in two thousand what
are your impressions on the evolution of
the JCP over the past 15 years since
we're now celebrating the 15-year
anniversary this year and obviously
speak to that quite well you're assuming
i can remember back to feed years ago
which is a often a challenge here but i
guess to start i I'm going to probably
touch on some of the same points Patrick
mentioned in his introduction here but
hopefully I'll provide a little more
color because I I think it's important
to think back to what kind of
environment we are in 15 years ago linux
was seven or eight years old it was
achieving a little bit of adoption in
companies but certainly all of that
leaves the us-based industry and
probably worldwide all had essentially
their own proprietary unix systems
solaris AIX hp-ux digital unix whatever
and that was really kind of the
predominant
you know non windows-based operating
systems that were in use of the time
open source is a concept had been around
for some time with the new work you know
the utilities around trying to come up
with UNIX compatible stuff but
organizations like the apache software
foundation were founded roughly
contemporaneous Lee with the JCB I think
they date back to nineteen ninety nine
or 2000 as well so the whole idea of
doing community based development under
commonly accepted open-source licenses
was really a new phenomenon now I mean
companies were paying attention to it
but it certainly wasn't mainstream in
either in my company at the time or any
others as well so the proprietary
software still really you know kind of
ran you know the day there and so you
excuse me drill down a little bit and
think about Java as a technology it was
probably five years old at the time and
the benefits were becoming evident there
write once run anywhere mantra the
compatibility again some of the points
that you know Patrick had mentioned
earlier were recognized and so again
much of industry was beginning to
embrace of the idea of Java you know
that from a customer perspective the
demand was beginning to build you know
the value there and you know from a
company standpoint knowing that our
customers didn't want to be locked in
anything along those lines but you know
it would still sons technology at the
time so there were discussions amongst
you know at the time primarily industry
players that were used to operating in a
standards or a consortium based type
environment and those discussions led to
the initial creation of the JCP and I
think the some of the initial principles
that Patrick mentioned we all subscribed
to when we started the JCP it was that
the notion of having strong
compatibility you know across whatever
platforms we want to deploy on them but
we saw the value and we knew the
importance of that to our customers to
the consumers of the technology
similarly that the confidence and or the
surety that we would have around the
intellectual property issues so there
there's been agreement since day one on
really these founding principles you
know for Java for the JCP but i think we
all welcome the opportunity to to bring
our contributions to the table so it
wasn't just your son's product at the
time but the companies like you know at
the time IBM others Red Hat I mean you'd
look at all the contributors over the
years and we've all wanted to bring
something to that to help basically you
have support and enhance the ecosystem
built up around Java so over the years
you know there's clearly been a
recognition that the world is changing
its no longer 1999 that the types of
development that's happening is
different the move towards
community-based and there's some kind of
key milestones here i think it was at
javaone in 2004-2005 when jason hunter
who represented apache the apache
software foundation on the executive
committee and scott mcnealy basically
hugged and kissed on stage at javaone
you know basically saying how great it
was that we're going to do you leverage
some of the innovation that was being
done in open source community is like
apache and embraced them in the in the
basically in the java technology base
similarly when sun made the decision to
open source java and recognized again
you know that there was a strong you
know desire from the community to both
you know contribute and consume
technologies under open-source licenses
and contribute to him in that fashion so
this has all been kind of again it's a
recognition that really the way industry
works today and the way industry
develops software is changing and so
much the work that we've been doing
particularly in 358 but also in jsr 364
has been to acknowledge that and
recognize that and really embrace it
Patrick highlighted some of the goals
for 358 which was certainly maintain the
compatibility maintain the surety but
also oh sorry I was just checking my
watch okay throw something at me if I'm
talking too long but it's okay but also
that I think that sets the stage pretty
well in terms of yeah where we came from
and where we're going now but let's make
sure we get to the rest of the ok
question so I'm kind of coming out right
step so again basically that's where we
are today both recognizing you know the
world has changed and we need to change
along with it but from a process
perspective and how we engage with
everyone yeah and I think that's
something to keep in mind not to take it
for granted how far we have come so
thanks for your perspective on that so
I'll move on to Steve who as a new
corporate organizational member as he
mentioned transitioning from
participating on a JSR as an individual
now recently joining with see to be too
what are your expectations of the value
that you'll receive from your
participation in the JCP both for your
company and for your employees
developers ok last on yeah ok I mean the
original reason we while i joined JCP as
an individual's was back 2005's because
i was writing an open source portal and
wants to get on jsr 286 that portal
failed but I carried on in the JCP but
the reason then was that there was no
other way to find out what was going to
go into a specification unless you were
on the expert group in those days it was
very explicit that discussions within
the expert book with secret and could
not be leaked to outside the expert
group so originally I joined for that
reason and then the benefits to that are
individual if you look at it from a
selfish point of view having an expert
group membership of a jjs are on your CV
has a some crazy effects I remember
going into a client and they were like
oh my God we're not worthy we have a JSR
specification you know expert group
member here who knows portal which is a
bit bit overwhelming at times but so
from a purely you know
from that perspective getting involved
in the JCP is very good for your career
and nowadays you don't actually have to
join the next book group to see what's
going on in a specification so one of
the key things to get involved is you
actually now if you're interested in
that specification you can actually see
why is how it is which gives you a much
deeper understanding of the spec and you
know what's involved in it why certain
decisions were made so that when you
come to work with it that it's it's
easier to work with when you come to
explain it to other people you
understand the in depth of how the
specification was designed and and the
compromises that go into making a public
space specification and then recently
we've joined as a company I mean one of
the key benefits of obviously joining
the JCP and sign in the GSP a is you can
then become an expert crew member and
some extent I think the term expert
group put some people off many people
don't think of themselves as an expert
and therefore feel they don't deserve to
be on an expert group I don't I don't
think that's true an expert groups just
a steering committee any so so the first
level is just to get involved in the
expert group gives you credibility and
then the next level beyond that benefit
wise is once you actually get your feet
under the table and you can understand
what's going on you can then actually
contribute and start driving where that
specification goes and my biggest
feeling was when I joined to a six was
that many of the expert groups were
driven by vendors and not the people who
actually use the api's so a lot of the
api's were being designed around product
limitations and product capabilities as
opposed to how a developer would use it
so I'd involve you know I'd encourage
developers to get involved from a
benefit point of view to actually create
api's that are nice to use rather than
are a nice to implement which is a
different thing yeah and and finally
from a corporate we joined corporately
mainly because we already had like four
or five employees who were working in
two expert groups and then selfishly we
don't get recognition
as a company and we give them time to do
they do the contribute to the expert
groups so from a corporate point of view
is easier for us to sign a single
agreement they don't have to sign
agreements and therefore and also if
they leave we can change our change our
expert group members so so that's that's
the co the benefit I wait yeah you can
try became corporate I mean we did it
does i haven't mentioned that the price
bari has gone away we couldn't justify
before that on the price go already
paying a lot in effort but now the price
bar has gone away we joined as a
corporate member and we're glad to
happiest oh thanks for bringing out
those points in it those are good things
for us to consider and confirmation of
some of the things that we're doing and
a ruin as a java champion and java one
rock star speaker evangelist around the
world how do you think the proposed
changes that we're talking about will
impact java developers participation and
experience and the JCP yeah i mean the
changes that we are made to JCP
themselves i mean even in the current
stage are very fundamental for example
open expert groups open aliases open
issue tracker those themselves are very
very cool because as we have seen in
java ee 7 how how many jugs participated
in the adopted jsr effort to really you
know give feedback early in the cycle
unfortunately we started the process
light but with job I e8 you know you
have already trillion the process for
adopt a JSR so that's pretty cool that's
definitely going to help more the specs
are built in the public so that allows
typically when I go to a conference and
I ask people hey you know what I have a
issue with the jpa spec okay where did
you send the feedback I'm giving the
feedback now as that remains only your
feedback and my statement is if you
didn't file a bug there is no bug so if
they have an issue file a bug i always
encourage people to go file the bug you
know a lot of it to me really is about
education the process I think has overly
simplified you know from that white
tower to this open impressive process
it's a lot about education as in
telling people that know it is easy to
participate is nola I mean people who
come at the conference are not the
normal developers we have the keys we
are geeks now we are at very advanced
developers unfortunately there are a lot
more people who are just developers that
would don't go to conferences and who
don't read any books don't go to any
website we need to tell them about you
know how the process is simplified
encourage them to participate once we
start doing that i'm pretty sure i am
very confident that we can definitely
increase the outreach of JCP and the
steps that you outlined earlier in the
present you and Patrick outlined in the
presentation you know how we are saying
so as an individual I have a lot more
confidence and applying that if my
submission get rejected then I would be
actually given qualification what is it
that I did not do right and then I know
that okay maybe a different expert group
is well what I need to apply to in order
to qualify so I think in general i'm
seeing lot of traction how people are
excited that the process is lot more
open i think the onus is on us to
educate the people that this is actually
open and encourage them to participate
mini littlest like three steps you know
hello ABC this is how you can actually
participate in expert group adopt the
JCP or whatever it is yeah yes good
points thanks for your feedback in
perspective I think we're already
working on putting together some of that
content together so good things to look
for in the future and Bruno a question
for you as a jug leader and EC member
serving on the EC representing your user
group so Java how do you think JCP next
an adopted jsr can be promoted to
developers to get the word out in
general and also to reach as we talked
about earlier this week the younger
developers in addition to the more
experienced kind of similar to aaron's
point that he just made how come me
where some thoughts on how we can get
the word out yeah i think that's one of
the interesting things that by embracing
the participation of Java Sea groups I
always like to say this Java Java
scripts are the real java community
because that's like the real people that
start working on job on their day-to-day
jobs not the ones building Java but the
ones that are using Java
and you know just by embracing these
groups into the community you get you
know you get them excited to be part of
it and that helps out in reaching lot
more people I think we've done you know
there's three javis groups they're part
of the EC right now what I think is very
very powerful you know in thats thats
that shows that it is a you know it is a
organization that wants to embrace that
wants to be more open that is doing a
lot of work to try to reach developers
and but of course you know and we have
like 50 almost 50 user groups that's
yeah I have around 50 user groups there
have joined the process but there is to
like 400 that have not right so so I
think that one of the things that we are
doing is lower the barrier to entry for
java groups you know because a lot of
Java scripts are not legal entity so
they can't really join our organization
legally speaking so we're making it
easier for java Scripture participate
and of course Java scripts are great for
as an evangelism organization right
that's that's what they're you know
that's that's that's what they do that's
me a lot of people kind of think about
all Java Sea groups are a place where
people come and go hacking code and
everything actually Java scripts are
plays that that people people join
together to learn to you know to talk
about to see new technology to learn
about new things because a lot of most
of the members of Java Sea groups they
actually go you know they participate in
things to learn and then they get that
knowledge and go back to their to their
companies to actually apply that
knowledge in some project right so every
time that you that we do activities
there are evangelism activities their
arm you know learning activities that's
where javis groups are really powerful
and really a really strong at and I
think that dr. Jeff's are for example is
an excellent example because in also
they adopted a openjdk a lot of people
kind of see those projects and also that
the projects being done by user groups
but actually the main thing the user
groups do is that they educate people so
they so so developers can participate in
JCP so the
our skin participated on the JK because
you know if I if I jumped so I'm here
this fiber from so job right there
Mohammed from the from the ship's user
group you know if we are here more to
help developers should come and
participate then to actually come and do
the work right and a lot of times who is
actually going to do the work it's
something of someone that's working for
some company that in a way they could
just kind of join the JCP directly and
you know just don't even do an adopted
yes our music gene can just participate
in the user group on the mean part
spending JCP as a corporation for
example but in fact the fact that we are
all together and that we teach each
other right can I talk about autographer
second is whatever here so top is right
here at a visa is an amazing developer
he just won the JCP outstanding
contributor award right so for this
year's that's an award it's a lot all
the EC members vote and and you know top
of you you know he's been participate
and open source project for ages right
and he's his you know he's a comedian
openjdk has like thousands of lines of
code on submit a joke to open jdk and
when he came to join to JCP right here
he was we used to an open source project
right so so he didn't know exactly what
needs to be signed how how to
participate how to compute who to talk
with and i think this is where the dr j
sr makes a huge difference is right
because we we were i know we javis
groups we're there so he needs he needs
help we can help and so this is what you
need to do this who you can talk to if
you have any questions we're going to
we're going to intercede for you and
everything and then this support that
jeezy groups can do makes his work
actually succeed right so that's a huge
difference because there's nothing more
frustrating than you know trying to
participate on a process that you don't
know a lot about and then you try to do
some things and then you know you don't
know who to talk to and in
and you don't get to do what you wanted
to do yes oh yeah I think that is good
point so basically you know as we evolve
the JCP and it becomes more open it's
true that any individual can participate
but without having that structure and
support of the local Java user group and
the worldwide program of collaboration
together it can be difficult and
frustrating and a little bit isolating
so it's nice to have that support and
community around it so I think the two
things working together with our efforts
to increase the participation with the
JCP program itself and its governance
together with the adopt a JSR program
are really what's going to push the
continued growth in our participation so
I have one final question for the panel
and then we can hear some of your
questions and I'll give this one to
Patrick what Pete feedback have you
received Patrick ad and leading up to
Java one from community members based on
the changes that have been introduced
over the last several years and the
upcoming proposed changes that we just
discussed okay so let's start with the
changes that already happened the first
of the three JSI was 348 was really very
easy for us to sentiment no-brainer
since we started thinking about I said
yeah it's obvious what we need to do
here just make people do stuff in public
and that simple idea which there was no
controversy within the EC right we did
it within just within a few months and
I've been amazed and people have told me
you know the effects of this have been
tremendous because suddenly you know as
Steve said I hadn't quite realized it
was that bad back in those days but you
know have you had me no idea what was
going on behind those closed doors and
now it's the exact opposite you can see
everything that's happening so people
love that and it was those changes that
enabled and made things like a top to
jsr possible it wouldn't have made any
sense without those changes so that's
the first thing looking forward from 364
people i think are excited about the
notion that individuals will be able to
very easily join with no need to get any
employer permission we're currently at
how many individual members we have
800 I'm aiming for 4000 within 2-3 years
I think we can get there I see no reason
why we shouldn't we will have a renewed
campaign of recruiting but the other
thing that I think is important and
we're already beginning to see this as
we've started to wave corporate fees is
the corporations are beginning to come
back we had a very significant decline
in number of corporate members over the
years for a number of reasons mergers
consolidations people losing interest
after a particular jurors are that we're
working on was completed but now we've
had several 1012 new corporate members
in the last few months alone and we've
hardly started on I'm sorry oh we're at
70 somewhere like that Oh a little over
100 courses we combine the two groups so
it's a little over 100 corporate members
and then of course at the same time
what's driving these corporations to
join is also the java ee 8 jsr is being
submitted and the expert groups forming
and that is that one of the key drivers
for joining the JCP is you want to be on
an expert group so it's kind of a
combination of having a motivation if I
want to be on this expert group now and
not having a fee I think it's gonna be a
little bit more difficult in terms of
inertia if there isn't an open expert
group that they're interested in
participating in but it's true that you
know with these two things happening at
the same time of contacting companies
that want to be on the expert group and
asking them to join as a corporation
yeah yeah so a challenge is going to be
to come up with a program like adopted
Jess are targeted at corporations there
are many many many developers inside we
mean to a guy the other day works at
alibaba they have 20,000 Java developers
you know we can tap even a tiny fraction
of these folks than the amount of energy
and enthusiasm we can bring into the
program will be tremendous so that's
that's what we're looking forward to in
the future okay that's it for me okay it
did any target for a jog than individual
or corporate members as well um I
haven't set an explicit number for
corporates with the Java user groups I I
think we really should be in a situation
where every act if you have a user group
ought to be no reason why they're not so
I would say we should aim for ninety
percent of the active Java user root
yeah I think I think with the new rules
for for jobs groups to join the JCP you
know it's it's going to be a lot easier
first gets to get most of them to join
yeah yeah you know there's a there there
are there are some usergroups that just
don't think that they have to actuate
the time to join everything but but but
the new under new process we're trying
to get the reasons why Java Sea groups
going to join to be should be more in
line what what everyone wants to do so
right and i think the agreement being
simple or will help and then of course
you have to keep in mind that all these
changes we can't go out and do this
right now this isn't final yet so we
have to actually finish the work of the
jsr and then we can get started on doing
the recruitment but obviously we're
making plans to do this yep I think
there's one key key point if you were
you know pushing corporate is that
people don't realize that you can
actually propose a new jsr if you're a
full member they always think the jet
number jay sowers is fixed by some God
somewhere but actually it just comes
from members right that's one of the
benefits yes okay cool well can we see
if any of the audience has a question
any audience member have a question that
you like to ask to the panel overall or
a particular panel member just let me
know and I can repeat your question just
to make sure everyone hears it just
shout it out if you want or you can
raise your hand because it's a mobile
Coleman yes Daniel you can make a
comment do you want to come up here if
you're gonna make a comment so you can
speak into the microphone where
Patrick's standing well because they
won't be able to hear you cool so just
following on from men in the comments
written everyone has seen particular
Bruno there I think the key challenges
ico that all these things is sort of the
marketing what a better word in terms of
getting it out there you look at em
certain companies in the no sequel
domain and even dare sets spring I don't
know I've mentioned spring but they're
very good at the marketing campaign
which gets the hearts and minds of a lot
of developers which i think is something
we need to work on a bit a bit better
and the second thing sort of in the
trenches doings on the JCP in the GSR
stuff and
with fellow developers is actually
having some kind of leadership I think
that's really important as we scale out
tickets Patrick's goals of bringing say
lots of you know 4,000 individual
members on you do need some form of
leadership they're not necessarily a
hierarchy but I think you're doing some
form of you know probably through the
user experience because you're
mentioning i think is fair but it's just
something i want to sort of threat as a
comment i think that's a real challenge
for us as a community to think about
those things marketing is you already
said getting stuff out there how do we
do that but also then when we when we do
have success how do we manage that how
do we lead to that I think they're
really big challenges which I love to
hear thoughts from the panel on actually
but thank you nice comment and question
Daniel Daniels with the london java
community just so people who don't know
oh yeah as you said I think the Java
scripts can be can help a lot about on
the mark on the marketing side just
because of the excitement I understand
that that the companies that come to
join the JCP you know they're there they
have their own interest is why they
joining and and of course we all it's
also understandable that you know
they're not necessarily interested in in
marketing the gcp itself right you know
their problem more interested in
marketing their homes that whatever
they're doing with the JCP technology
not the JCP itself what's totally
understandable but for java user groups
i think that that's it you know just
this marketing effort is really
important because you know when you when
you promote the JCP you are promoting no
community participation you are you are
getting your your developers excited
about about the future of java so there
is a lot of synergy right there now in
terms of of leadership and this is this
is a little bit more more complicated i
think because you know i don't think of
course it's one thing that you know the
first promotes you know to promote
participation everything but i think
that the JCP has to have a very
distributed a variant of various
interests different interest has to be
represented and i think that each person
that comes to participate it's good that
they have their own interest and so the
more distributor we can get this the
batter right and i think i understand
is that yeah yeah give me some whole
thing of a ship's we often find most of
all individuals engaged by looking at
the stuff to do right so I think we are
at the 800 and I don't think we already
have felt the need for a leadership
right now because they've heard people
are right now going to a specific jsr if
they're doing a tapa jsr so the spec
lead or the Alliance from the company is
kind of providing the leadership
opportunity over there that ok I can
hurt you I can guide you I generally
believe in you know let it grow first
let it simmer there and organically let
it go and if see if we get to the 4000
point which is a very good problem to
solve and if there is a need to have a
hierarchy at that point of time so
instead of you know defining a box now
everything everybody got a good fit in
the box i would say let it overflow
first and then see if we really need a
box or the lid on top of that and i
would rather let it grow to 45 k and who
knows maybe we become the most organic
most thriving organization which is
grown organically down from the
grassroots let's give my perspective yes
i just wanted to add that we actually
spent some time last week at the UC
meeting talking about you know how do we
market ourselves you know particularly
to the corporate customer or the
potential corporate members here and
basically trying to put together what's
the business case for them why should
they be joining and clearly that message
is going to be useful throughout but you
know there you know there's kind of the
grassroots you know let's reach through
the individual developer and then maybe
the company will realize that you know
that hey I've got five or six people why
don't I just join as a company and you
know simplify things but you know that's
perhaps easy to do in some cases in a
massive company that still may be
difficult there so we still need to be
able to reach out at different levels
and and so that's really you know I'm
Patrick is done some individually as a
head of the PMO or the head of the JCP
but where I think collectively we're
looking at what are the messages that we
want to convey to potential members as
well so and from my perspective as a
sort of boss of a small consulting
company I think the marketing bait will
be to the to me the JCP was seen as a
vendor
implementations of java ee and java SE
and to change that with you know with
what we're doing these java user groups
and things i think if you mark it to
this to the mid and small consult
consultancy companies that it's actually
about java and java specifications and
defining they're not defining
implementations of them then they can
provide a level of leadership and a
level of gathering of their employees
and to help you know almost whip them
into you know contributing you know i
can force people to contribute and get
involved and and you know i have
employees and a lot of them would love
to come get involved but they don't have
the time outside of work potentially and
i can give them the bed time a bit of
time but also i can encourage them when
they don't have the confidence to do so
which is what many of our you know
employees were like we brought them in
and said you know you're joining this
group you need to be an expert so we're
going to just throw you out into that
expert group right so it's like a
benefit of your employee as an employer
it's a benefit that you are a JCP member
and you can offer these opportunities
from yeah we took a guy who was good at
messaging and I was on the JMS expert
group and we put him on there instead
and he would never have done that as an
individual so you know that's one of
challenge that we have in Oh Patrick
talked about like 4,000 members in to
JCP and that's that's very what it's
fine just keep carry on okay well in
just make it brief because I won't know
there's one more question because we
have five minutes left rights because I
think that's think that's very important
and and the main the main question that
we need to reach 4,000 people right what
is the benefit that those guys will get
because we all wrote that we run Java
Sea groups and we know that it's not
easy no you have user groups there are
like you know ten years old and haven't
reached 4,000 people yet right on and
and they have a very clear benefit when
you join you can you know you come to
talks you learn in specific things
everything and you don't even have to
contribute anything to the user groups
actually so but on the JCPS now is
because the main benefit that people get
is not because when you join it there's
you know you're not changing java or
just because you join you know the
benefit of changing Java that's what we
keep talking about no oh you can join
because you get you're going to change
Java the benefit that you have when you
to change avah actually happens when you
eat contribute right when you actually
participate and so and the bank the main
the main thing that we probably need to
find out is exactly how what kind of
benefits those people we can show them
that there we got and you just mentioned
something that I think it's fabulous
right because you know companies are
actually the way for us to get this
benefit because you know when once a
company sees the benefit of being part
of the JCP and they give the time for
the employees to participate I think
that can change like usually how much we
can we can get you know how many people
can get on the JCP because off of course
you know for me to contribute by myself
like as an individual it's one thing but
if my boss comes and say okay you know
we just joined JCP and now we're going
to have like you know you have an hour a
week to help out of contribute man
that's you immediately you get someone
that will do something yes I think that
echoes use point although I can be part
is very hard to imagine you having a
boss though right you are the boss any
final question from the audience or
comment yes
and you just
we said that the jsr 364 our goal is to
finalize the jsr by the end of 2014 and
then we would implement it in 2015 yes
Heather repeat the question because of
being recorded I haven't heard a
question yet I was restating what he
just said like the question when can you
participate as an affiliate member is
that your question so we will implement
the jsr in 2015 assuming that we do
complete it on schedule in 2014 so that
would mean that you would be able to
join as an affiliate member potentially
in 2015 the early part of 2015 is our
goal but you'll have to follow the
project on java.net jsr 364 and you can
get some updates there to find out and
then I'll taking me what your question
to you a bit of background I have been
working for one year after graduating
planned for a program similar to google
Summer of course so you can get people
started before they actually start with
them
yeah we have a do we have a program
similar to google Summer of Code and
Arun want us to answer so yes and no
google Summer of God gives a lot of
money also so we don't have money part
involved but we do have something called
as adopted jsr and there are different
levels where you can get involved
depending upon your time and your
commitment so for example let's say your
interest is persistence or your interest
is lambdas or you interest rates devices
look at the list of currently active jsr
specifically java SE 9 and java e8 or
under active development look at your
area of interest see you know where do
you want to contribute and the
contribution really to me is not just
code contribution when I look at a
contribution i'm really looking at bug
no email a tweet a presentation a
conference everything is a contribution
anything that you are doing to help
spread the word is a contribution so
really go at any level now it could
start from the akhira what I learned
about Jace or 360 for today from that
tweet all the way up until little kind
of becoming the spec lead and driving
the implementation there are several
individuals who are at least back leads
so the sky is our limit really yeah let
me add net a little bit well you have to
have follow-up questions because I just
that's yeah that's the part is gonna I
was going to talk about so he he
complete his question talking about not
about just the money but about you know
the mentorship that google Summer of
Code happens so that's the kind of thing
that we are trying to do with dr. Jeff's
are kind of Mentor people but mentor
people to come and participate that's
that that's why I use of top is an
example because we help him out in
learning so you know so job easy groups
are trying to do X Ollie dad but 11
interesting what do you think thing that
about google summer of code is that you
actually have open source projects that
are that they are not Google right that
apply to be mentors to other people so
maybe we could think of something
similar you know I think the doctor SARS
or something like that but that
be extended for companies that could be
good mentor projects that they are
interested in but one into the only
thing that we discuss a little bit of
JCP but but that hasn't happened yet is
you know because because students at
University they can be a huge resource
in you know invalidate the
specifications in in testing a
specification in different scenarios and
there's all kinds of great things that
students that are still there still
learning on the university can be
extremely extremely valuable and do a
very very useful work that can then
return for them as learning and as
experience and we have not gone to
universities to actually try to tap on
this and I think that's that's what
definitely next step we should put that
on our list in addition to a campaign in
the corporate world we need a coke
campaign in the academic world okay well
I want to thank all of our panelists for
participating and all of the attendees
for coming to listen and learn and share
with us so that we can reach the goal of
broadening the JCP participation so if
you do have more questions I'll I can
stay for a little bit afterwards but
we'll go ahead and close the session now
and let our panelists go who probably
have a busy day ahead of them so thank
you so can I just use this just say that
I'm going to leave right here and I have
a talk right now about continuous
deployment so if you are all welcome to
come thank you okay thank you everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
