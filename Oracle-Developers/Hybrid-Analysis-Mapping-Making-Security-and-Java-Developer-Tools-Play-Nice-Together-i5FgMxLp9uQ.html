to talk about a technique into
technology we've developed to help with
security testing called hybrid analysis
mapping that looks to combine the things
that you do in dynamic application
security testing with the things that
you do during static application
security testing and we'll talk more
about those there about those in a lot
more detail and we'll talk about this in
the context of how organizations set up
a program to build the you know to
repeatedly build more secure software
and we'll look at things that the
security testing folks do things that
developers do and look at ways that the
tools and the process is that each
individual group has set up can better
interact with one another because that's
a big challenge that I've seen in
working with organizations as they try
to deal with software security and we'll
look at a number of examples based on
some open source technologies an
applicator application called thread fix
that that I've helped develop that is
essentially a central mandatory a
centralized management help for that and
we'll also look at some some other tools
there's a tool called owasp zapper zed
attack proxy I think Simon Bennett who
is the guy who the lead maintainer of
zap is actually giving a talk here at
javaone a little bit later I definitely
recommend going to see that you know
we'll look at it at the surface level
and look at some interactions that we've
built on top of it his talk on edge is
going to is going to do a much deeper
dive into into that we'll look at a
plug-in that we've built for for the
Eclipse IDE and and again we'll talk
about some of these different
interactions that we've seen you know
help security testing folks make the
most out of the knowledge of developers
have but then also better help
developers to consume all of the
information that the security testing
people are putting together just a quick
show hands how many folks here are
developers like your day to day job is
writing code excellent anybody here your
day to day job is security testing okay
good good great this will be fun um
because usually when I talk about this
stuff I talk about it 22 software
security fold
and I yell at them about how they often
interact with developers and so if this
for this talk we can kind of flip that
around and look at it the other way and
a big message that i have for security
people is you guys are doing a horrible
job of approaching developers in a way
that is actually helpful to you know to
mutually accomplishing your goals of for
developers shipping software and for for
the security folks making sure that the
software that's shipped is has
acceptable security properties just a
little background dan Cornell that's a
picture of me by my marketing people
don't know I'm here today so I didn't
have to wear a coat so that's nice my
background I'm the founder and CTO of
denim group coming called down group
based on a Texas do work all over the
place and I'm a software developer by
background I've started in the mid mid
to late 90s doing a lot of early server
side java stuff deployed probably far
too much code on apache jaser of 0 point
9 alpha the stayed in production for far
far too long after that spent the early
2000s doing a lot of work in the early
net asp.net and C sharp but really would
have spent probably the last nine years
of my career doing is working with both
security teams and development teams
looking at how do developers have an
impact on the security of the
organization in which they're working
all right and kind of the traditional
view of security again if you go back
ten years that still persisted to know
to this day is we've got the security
team and they're managing antivirus and
the firewalls and all that stuff we've
got the developers over here doing this
stuff and then you know like right
before you go I've the you know security
team needs to poke holes in the firewall
in ports 80 and 443 and you know the
developers deploy their code and you're
done so really what I've looked at is
the fact that you know developers since
you're writing code that is attached to
you know that's it has holes drilled
through the firewall all of a sudden
developers are responsible for creating
software that enforces the you know
appropriate security policies or has
appropriate security properties and so
again my work comes from the perspective
of someone with a development background
who's working in security which is a
little bit different
think that a lot of people in the
industry that come from more of a
network penetration testing background
and now they're looking at web and
mobile applications and I help run the
wasp San Antonio chapter who here is
familiar with a wasp okay good about
half maybe a two-thirds of hands
excellent good owasp is the open web
application security project and is a
fantastic resource for for anyone who's
interested in looking at making
application security visible looking for
resources on how to write secure code
how to test applications for security
another talk that I definitely recommend
there's a guy named Jim Monaco roaming
around this conference and he's giving a
talk I forget which day but he's one of
the global board members of owasp a
fantastic educator on secure coding if
you have an opportunity to make it to
his talk I definitely recommend doing
that as well again him both him and
Simon are doing really really cool stuff
and are a great resource then I'm happy
that minutes it's cool that that they
made it out here to to talk on again I
hope run the San Antonio chapter 40 us
as well as other random stuff from time
to time well denim oops background is
essentially like my background we do a
lot of software development you know
typically where there's a security you
know some sort of security performance
survivability requirements and then we
also go in and look at software that
other people built and you know do
security code reviews application
penetration tests Network penetration
tests and things like that and so the
advantage or you know kind of the
perspective that gives us is we've got
one foot in the development camp and one
foot in the security camp and so when
you know security comes to development
and says well you need to do these four
hundred things before we're gonna let
you really software yeah are you know
you know the head of our application
development practices like no we're not
we're not going to do those things
here's the things that we will actually
do that we think are going to be the
most impactful and yo similarly that
helps folks on the security side of the
business taken much more measured in
realistic view on yon on how things
actually work a much more pragmatic and
practical view of
what are the things that we need to be
doing in order to secure software and
writing secure software is hard you know
even even looking at that for an
individual application writing secure
software is hard and especially if you
look at organizations that are
developing you know tens hundreds or
thousands of applications when you start
to look at this problem from the
portfolio perspective it gets really
truly frightening um and so one of the
challenges that application security
spans multiple disciplines alright
obviously you have the information
security folks that are going way in you
know typically they have a strong
understanding of risk you know they've
got some understanding of the compliance
you know regimes that your your
applications that your organization is
subject to you know most larger
organizations now are starting to have
at least an individual or hopefully a
team responsible for application and
software security you know but so those
folks in a lot of cases are going to be
weighing in on risk and they're going to
have a lot of stuff that they want you
to do the challenge is that if you look
at the installed base if you will of
security professionals that are in the
industry right now there's not a lot of
knowledge of secure of secure coding all
right y'all familiar with the ISSA it's
a kind of a security trade organization
you all go speak it is sa meetings and
say well how many folks out there are
developers and like everybody raises
their hand say okay well how many of
y'all have written code in a language
more modern than COBOL or Fortran and
all the hands go down right because
these folks were all doing development
back in like this you know when I was
your age we had punch cards and we
didn't have it's like okay oh it's great
that you have that skill where you you
you've done some development but you
know if you're trying to interact with
teams that are doing you know Java
spring development right or doing PHP
development you know that's a whole set
of skill sets a lot has changed between
the kobold days and the in the days of
kind of modern you know modern web
frameworks and modern web development
and so that creates a lot of challenges
I think for folks in security
and I think you know and this is not
universal but I also think that like
I've not been super happy of the
attitude with the attitudes that I see
from a lot of people in security I don't
know anybody's ever had interactions
like that negative interactions no oh I
was giving a talk at bsides Austin a
while back and about mobile security or
something like that in this guy in the
back of the room who's a curmudgeon I
think is a he'd probably self admit to
that but he said well if the developers
just stopped writing such crappy code
like boy oh boy my job would be a lot
easier and I was like well I bet you
were a big hit you know roaming around
your office how is the one productive or
one semi productive meeting you had with
the development team before you said
that and it really shut them all down so
information security has a lot you know
they've obviously got a lot to offer but
in a lot of cases they don't necessarily
have the skill sets or they're certainly
not going to be the folks that fix the
problem all right I don't know of a lot
of organizations where the security
we're thus is 0 is going to be like Oh
they've got some cross-site scripting is
cool I'm gonna you know I'll check the
code out of get you know fire up
IntelliJ you know add some encoding k
run the unit test run the acceptance
that's cool we're going to check that
code in and done right like that's not
number one that's not their job they
probably don't have access and they
don't have the skill set and so you know
again information security has a lot to
offer but at the end of the day they
have to get development to do a lot of
his work for them you know same thing
with the audit and compliance groups you
know internal audit IT audit anybody
here subject to pci and your
organization's actually the internet how
about sarbanes-oxley in the big the big
for full employment act of which
whatever whatever year that was
excellent you know and so they are going
to they're going to be forced away in
again if you're dealing with health care
data if you're dealing you know if
you're if you're in the financial
services the banking sector you know if
you're dealing with public company
financials you know there's certain real
compliance requirements you have the
same thing with risk management you need
to roll all this up but what a lot of
organizations forget about is that it's
actually the software developers that
are the ones that you know at the end of
the day they're the ones that have the
ability to impact this because the
software developers are the ones that
are actually writing code know and there
you know they're the software developers
are the ones that are going to have to
change their behavior or take on
different or new tasks in order to
actually get this stuff fixed and so you
know again that's something that's
unfortunately I think ignored a lot of
times when security folks get all spun
up about the problem of application
security the application security is
also a comparatively new discipline I
mean I think is this the first year that
Java one had a security track maybe last
year there was one you know and it's not
that people haven't been talking about
it there haven't been some security
talks but again if you look at the
disciplines of physical security guns
guards gates that's old and not figured
out but as certainly well-covered
territory information security the whole
kind of new application security is
really new by comparison you know this
is something that organizations are
really just starting to you know it's
it's the market leaders the financial
guys for the most part that are you know
there are a couple years in to
implementing programs a lot of folks are
really just getting started new
discipline means immature metrics nobody
is quite sure how to measure it you know
and in the new discipline also means
there's new tools and what we've seen in
the application world is basically every
failed paradigm failed is probably the
wrong way to characterize it every shaky
paradigm or every paradigm that's
probably didn't provide as much value as
you wanted from the network and
infrastructure security world has been
translated to the application world and
so we have you know Network scanners
like Nessus right and so when I would go
problems with applications cool let's
make application scanners all right that
are gonna you know that are going to
have a lot of the same problems even
though they're working a little bit
different way you know we've got
firewalls for the network cool let's
make firewalls for applications and you
will put those in between you know put
those in between users and our
application they'll learn about the
application and then you know figure out
magic ways to block malicious traffic
you know again that's a somewhat shaky
paradigm you know but we've also seen
changes made to development tools say
well we've got code scanning tools that
we use two and four to detect potential
quality issues you know can we also add
to this analysis in order to identify
potential security risks associated with
that
and so again new discipline new tools
and it's a it's a real challenge you
know we also see and for you all on the
development side this probably doesn't
hit you as hard right because you're
working on an application or a handful
of applications you've got features
functions and timelines things that you
need to do but if you look at the
problem if you flip this around and look
at it from the security analyst or the
security management teams point of view
there's a giant problem there's a whole
lot of code you know millions and
millions of lines of code that been
written without a lot of attention being
paid to security and without an
understanding or an acceptance like yeah
we're going to attach this to the
internet one day right and so there's a
whole lot of code out there you know
most organizations again you're bigger
organizations tend to have a huge
quantity of applications and there's a
real lack of people with strong and
knowledge of application security right
as you know for each new person that
comes into the field just by the power
of math the average competence in the
field goes down and it's going to take a
long time for us to get on the other
side of that power curve and what we see
is from data coming out from like the
digital folks with the besom what
they're finding is that even in leading
organizations right the people at the at
the far end of the spectrum even leading
organizations have a one to one hundred
ratio between between application
security folks and the developers
they're responsible for and so that puts
them on the other side of a horrible
power curve where there's a hundred of
y'all developers you know blastin away
writing code and there's one person
running around like like the guy at the
you know the following the elephants
with the shovel you know after after the
circus right there's there so there's a
lot of code being written and not a lot
of people that are responsible for that
are responsible for keeping track of
that which creates a huge huge challenge
which requires a lot of automation and
really what I think is it means that a
number of security tasks and security
knowledge is going to have to get moved
or shifted to development teams just to
have any hope of addressing this issue
right this isn't something where you
have you no one magic person this Jason
after 100 folks I'm not saying that
every developer needs to become a
security expert I used to think that and
I was wrong but I do think that for
developers there needs to be a base
level of knowledge and we also need to
look at some of the things that have
been really successful you've practices
for developers especially a lot of stuff
that came out of agile and looking at
some of the stuff coming now from DevOps
I think that there's some interesting
hooks where there are opportunities to
move some security testing a lot closer
to the developers and so that some of
the stuff that will talk about so what
we find out here is we've got this huge
multidisciplinary problem and an area
where you know we can't properly
characterized it and where the folks
responsible for security are horribly
outnumbered so what can you do about it
and we'll talk a little bit about
gathering data starting to get them you
know for the security folks to take a
much more quantitative view of this of
this issue so that you can better
prioritize and start to make it better
risk decisions because again like just
like I said the interactions there are
security folks hey we want you to do all
this once you do all this stuff and the
development team says cool well you know
get this hotshot VP off my back who
promised all these features to an
important customer all right security
all right security test all day long you
know it's a the security folks I think
need to do a better job of
characterizing the risk you know an
interesting thing that we see is most
application security teams have a real
problem talking in a quantitative way
you know and so it leads them to have
these like little kid conversations
right cross site scripting is scary I'm
sure all right I mean I you know I live
in San Antonio we do a lot of work in
Houston you go to oilfield services firm
until him cross-site scripting is scary
they're going to say now I had eight
people kidnapped in the Congo last week
that's scary right I think one of our
guys got eaten in Papua New Guinea last
year that scares me cross-site scripting
in yo and if when I juxtaposed those
risks against one another that's not
that's not terribly scary you know or
similarly you go to an airline
you're like hey airline cross-site
scripting and scary and they're like you
know what every time a barrel oil price
moves my dollar I lose like 20 million
bucks a day and that's scary cross-site
scripting is not scary and so I think
that security folks need to do a much
better job of collecting data about
their programs and starting to look at
data available from industry so that you
can start to put this properly in
perspective you know similarly I think
organizations need to look at what
they're investing in their network and
infrastructure and what they're spending
on things like antivirus and firewalls
and then they need to look at that
juxtaposed with how much they spend on
software development for custom software
and software procurement and how much
they're spending on that yeah I would
argue that the spend most organizations
have on AV &amp;amp; firewalls is out of whack
if you look at the value of the assets
when compared to the amount of money
that goes into developing software
software developers tend to be not cheap
you know I know I employ a bunch of them
and they're I think reasonably you're
very well paid which is which is great
because they do great things and so I
think organizations need to look at the
value they're extracting from software
and start to shift the investment that
they make to better support the
development teams in security because
again we're seeing that applications RAF
are a real target now for a lot of a lot
of different data breaches any questions
so far we've got this is a good size
group if you have a question along the
way please just raise your hand and ask
I'm happy too happy to answer anything
anyway no nothing fantastic just real
quick what a look at the the concept of
application vulnerability management
because this is something this is a a
workflow or a process that I think most
organizations are really good at they're
typically better at infrastructure
vulnerability management we're going to
run a scanner it's going to say hey this
service should be turned on or the
service needs to be patched or you have
a configuration for ssh or something
that needs to be changed all right great
you know the those changes are like
playing with LEGOs right like hey we've
got a port turned on it needs to be
turned off we need to apply on Microsoft
patch we need to do XYZ
you know fairly straightforward discreet
stuff but if you find a problem in an
application well that means you have to
change code all right and the way that
you're going to change the code is
probably going to be different if you're
doing an application using you know Java
you know standard servlets and jsps
versus if you are building an
application using spring or the struts
framework you know there's going to be
different things that you might need to
do and that's just looking at fixing
like technical type vulnerabilities no
sequel injection cross-site scripting
stuff where it's you know typically a
pretty straightforward code level change
you know to say nothing of if you
identify authorization type
vulnerabilities or other or other things
that deal with the business rules
surrounding the system well all of a
sudden you've got a lot of discretion
about what you may need to do or what
you could potentially do in order to fix
this in order to address the
vulnerability and so what a lot of folks
haven't figured out is that you know
fixing application level vulnerabilities
is a software maintenance activity all
right you have to go in change the code
and then like make sure that you didn't
break the application and push that into
production now and by the way you have
to get the application the change the
application pushed into production
before you can actually declare victory
and feel like you've reduce your risk
and so one of the challenges that we've
seen a lot of organizations is they
haven't really got their minds wrapped
around the fact that finding application
level vulnerabilities is usually pretty
easy fixing vulnerabilities is a lot
more challenging for for a number of
reasons and so what we see our
application vulnerabilities tend to hang
out there for a long time you know
there's some great data from company
called whitehat security company called
bear code they release they do software
as a service testing of applications and
so they've anonymized and kind of
summarize the results they've seen from
working over there customer bases really
really interesting stuff to see just how
much the exposure window is for
applications you know these
vulnerabilities tend to stick around out
there for a long time or applications
tend to have vulnerabilities or be
exposed to at least some vulnerability
for really long periods of time we
actually do a bunch of remediation work
and so
piled a list of like how much time does
it actually take to fix different types
of vulnerabilities and these slides and
stuff we'll all be available online you
know but it's interesting for us to see
going through and fixing different types
of vulnerabilities this was like the
keyboard time required to fix these
different classes of vulnerabilities you
know and so you know stored cross-site
scripting a little bit faster to fix and
reflected cross-site scripting up to
that was interesting but what i thought
was more interesting looking across all
this data is where time gets spent as i
said fixing software vulnerabilities is
a software maintenance project right and
so you have to set up your development
environment right so for applications
that are under active development that
might not be a problem right or if
you've got a nice vagrant script or
something that'll blow together an
application environment for you
fantastic you know if this is an
application that's not under active
development it's something that's been
end of life but you've suddenly got to
go in and make changes you know it may
take a significant amount of time in
order to fix that and actually and you
know across the portfolio of projects we
looked at this in one case it was
thirty-one percent of the remediation
time was spent getting a development
environment setup where we could deploy
new code it was a like a jungle search
expedition trying to get that fixed then
you look at the time that the actual
valuable time right what time do we
spend fixing vulnerabilities and that
range from in the best case fifty-nine
percent all the way down in one case to
fifteen percent of the time right you
know the yo I I don't know if you guys
ever tried this on projects but you know
if you if you need to if you need to
look like compress the budget of the
project you just like take out all the
design and the testing and just write
code all right saves time you get rid of
like two whole phases all right you know
this so that's the perspective a lot of
people have is okay we need to fix this
stuff but as we see even in the best
case we're not even spending two-thirds
of the time fixing that stuff once
you've made the changes to the code
you've got to make sure that you didn't
break what the code is doing before and
for anybody who's ever done software
maintenance the last person to touch the
code right is responsible for any fruit
for the next bug no matter if it's
related to it you touched or not that's
one of the unfortunate
is about it what we found in most cases
is about a quarter of the time was spent
in the average case by a quarter the
time was spent confirming that the fixes
worked that they were effective and
doing QA and then finally her then and
then also you've got to push the code
into production and again if you're if
you can slip stream something into a
standard release then that's great if
you can't then you may need to do now to
cycle release again easier for some
applications and others and the final
thing is just this overhead the friction
that is associated with any large
enterprise the software project where
you have a meeting to determine like
what stuff are we going to fix are we
going to fix it now we're going to fix
it later which which team is going to
pay for this and again that's something
where again a little over the court of
the project and so it's it's been very
interesting for me to see the you know
what has allowed a certain organization
to be successful in other organizations
to be less successful as they try to
deal with amounting volume of
application level of vulnerabilities so
now we'll start to talk about some of
the tools and the interactions that
we've seen that can really be helpful
and that we've seen to be the
differentiators between again software
security programs that are more
successful versus software security
programs that are less successful and a
lot of these examples are going to be
centered around an application called
thread fix and so open source
application level vulnerability
management system that lets you load in
the results of the various different
testing activities to normalize all
those and then that reach out to
developers and other stakeholders in the
tools that they're already using in
order to help drive those
vulnerabilities through resolution and
the advantage of basically you're piping
all of these activities through a single
application through a single choke point
is that you can start to gather data
about your assurance program and I've
been a cross vendor and cross activity
way and and we'll talk about some things
that that the additional value that you
get from that from a reporting
standpoint there's that and basically
what we've done is we've you know we've
created created connections to most of
the major commercial and open source
testing
tools out there both on those static
application security testing side or SAS
as the gardener people are fond of
calling it or the dynamic application
security testing or dashed side of
things and so basically what thread fix
lets you do is load all the data from
these different scanning tools and then
to reach out to different web app
firewalls but kind of more important for
our purposes today is to reach out to
tools that developers are using such as
the defect tracking or application
lifecycle management systems you know as
well as the Ides and kind of the
overarching theme there is if you want
developers to help you with software
security like take all the friction out
of the process that you possibly can
right you you want to remove all the
excuses because you know developers is
in my experience having having been a
developer and having the opportunity to
work with development teams you know
it's not like the curmudgeon guy said
right the developers don't like writing
in secure code or doesn't show a hands
for the developers anyway like writing
and secure code like that's it's fun fun
for you know right you know developers
don't want to write in secure code much
as they don't want to write code that
performs poorly er that has bugs the
challenge is that the application
security folks only care about security
right that's that's their entire world
by the nature of their title and that's
what their responsibilities are and when
we see development teams we see that
they care about security but they also
care about new features that got
promised to an important customer that
have to be done right and developers
care about security but they also care
about security in the context of fixing
non-security related bugs that are
providing a degraded experience for
customers and they care about security
but they also care about application
performance and if the application is
crashing then you know it's maybe less
important worrying about different
security things and so you know a big
theme going forward will be how do we
take all the results of these security
testing tools and how do we put them in
the hands of the developers in a way
that's going to be the most consumable
for the development teams right how do
we take all the friction possible out of
this process so that the you know when
the security folks come and they ask for
some things to get fixed that's as
smaller than ask as possible both from
from from a pain and suffering as well
as from a level of effort standpoint um
that's similar stuff just with logos and
whatnot and so what we do in threads
anybody here have experience working
with any of the dynamic testing tools
like an appt scan or a zap or anything
like that anyone handful of folks
anybody have any experience working with
some of the static testing tools with a
fortifier checkmark server error code
excellent okay good and so we'll look at
dynamic testing who will look at a wasp
zap here in a minute but what we did
when we first first set out with thread
fix like a challenge that we saw they
got repeated over and over again in
organizations even even with you know
kind of moderately sophisticated
application security programs you know
is like horrible interactions where
security would run a scan you know based
on pci or some other you know some other
reason they would go to the development
team with a 300 page PDF with a color
graph on the front page and they would
say you guys have all sorts of problems
in your application you're going to need
to fix this stuff right anybody ever
been on the receiving end of a
conversation like that right like here's
the giant steaming turd with a color
graph in the front yeah this is your
problem now right which which gives the
development team a lot of excuse to push
back and say like I'm gonna go talk to
my BP and we'll see if that is my
problem alright what we saw even more
those organizations got their programs
off the ground is they would start to
bring in multiple vendors with multiple
testing tools so then instead of having
one 300 page PDF or the color graph they
would show up with 230 page pdfs with
color graphs all right and say well
there's probably some overlap here but
i'm not exactly sure what it is yeah but
i'm going to fix this stuff i put some
sticky notes yeah i put sticky notes on
the pages i thought were really
important right yeah at this point every
development team we've ever seen you
know goes to their vp or their director
and says okay these guys are like is
this a like a hidden-camera show like
these guys are actively wasting my time
can you get these guys off my back and
so it gets pushed back to the
application security folks you know
they get excel start like trying to line
things up and get a single view and and
the interactions as a whole just end up
being very negative right because it's
essentially the application security
people saying you know hey I have no
understanding the tools you're using I
don't know how you manage your workload
right I don't know how you pick what
features anybody's going to work on in a
given day so I'm going to do what's easy
for me which is to hand you a giant
print out an app report or maybe well
you know if you're in a real green
organization maybe they'll just email it
all right but so I'm going to do what's
easy for me is you know to get a load of
stuff and dump it over to you and make
it your problem to figure out how you're
going to solve it right and so again
what we see is we don't there's not a
lot of you don't see a lot of progress
made in situations like that and so the
first thing that we did with thread fix
is we created an engine that lets you
load in the results of these different
testing tools and to normalize that data
so you can provide a single unified view
of the vulnerabilities that have been
identified for an application across the
different testing that you might be
doing you know and that includes manual
stuff and so if you're doing dynamic
scans you know with one or more scanners
loaded those in maybe you're doing some
manual penetration testing all those get
loaded into the same a single unified
list because what that does is it takes
the responsibility for merging that data
together you know that's no longer
something that has to be done by a human
either on the development team where
they don't have time or on the app
security team where they don't have time
instead you can load all this into one
single place and get a single and get a
single view to do that we use mitres
common weakness enumeration allows
anybody here familiar with mitres to cwe
scintillating reading it's a people ask
me why we used cwe is our taxonomy for
the different types of vulnerabilities
and I said it's like the democracy of
you know taxonomy is it's the worst
possible available one except for all
the other ones that have been created
but in any case what we're trying to do
is we're trying to use industry
standards here to load and normalize
this data so inside of thread tricks we
can create a consolidated list of all
the applications and vulnerabilities
which is helpful for the application
security people because it lets them
manage all the stuff in a data-centric
way as opposed to having a bunch of
printed out printed out things you know
printed out reports and whatnot once
you've got all this centralized you can
prioritize the risk decisions based on
the data and so again this is mostly in
the world of the application security
folks but then what it lets you do is it
let you translate these vulnerabilities
to developers in the tools that they're
already using and that's been the
critical thing that we've seen with
programs that start to make headway and
ones that don't is that understanding of
how development teams work to actually
put all of this vulnerability data which
is stuff that security people care about
how do you translate that into a format
and more importantly put it into the
tools that the development teams are
already using and the advantage there is
if you are used to managing your sprints
in JIRA you can manage your security
tasks inside of JIRA as well all right
and that way is the development team you
can use you know whatever system you
have for determining okay what are we
working on this how do we assign these
things what are we working on you know
how do we know you know if we're hitting
our if we're velocity-wise ahead ever
behind where we need to be all right
it's crazy to go to developers and say
hey developers you know for ninety five
percent of your workload you've got a
whole you know life cycle you know scrum
planning system where all this stuff but
for security which is like the magic
different thing instead in that case I
want you to like use this PDF or I want
you to log in to this system over here
as opposed to the system that you're
already using and so again that's not
that we're going to spend spend spend
some time looking at those different
interactions but that's been I'd say the
single most important thing that we've
seen for for organizations that are
starting to make progress dealing with
this backlog of vulnerabilities so the
first thing we look at is like how do we
create a consolidated view of
applications and vulnerabilities and so
this is an interesting question I would
have for y'all since most of you all
come from the development camp like how
many applications are in development in
your organization 10
100 I don't know a couple thousand right
the scary thing is and I could
understand from the development side of
things you may have a no you know an
understanding your kind of a vague idea
but again if you're responsible for
developing an application or handful of
applications you know there's not a real
reason for you to know that the scary
thing is if you go and ask the folks
responsible for application security
you'll often get the similar answer or
as we call it in the week all around our
office the two shoulder salute or it's
like ask somebody a question they're
like I don't know you know how many
applications you have I don't know and
so that's a really challenging problem
just because you have organizations that
you know that are developing stuff maybe
a lot of stuff goes through centralized
IT but then what you see is you've got
one group wants to build a mobile
application they go to the IT department
and say I want to build a mobile app
nice they cool we can start gathering
requirements for that in about two years
right that's not a real satisfying
answer to most lives of business and so
they go find offshore folks that instead
say we will you know what will sorry
gather requirements in two minutes you
know just give us a credit card we're
off to the races and so a challenge for
a lot of organizations is how do you
create a consolidated view of the
applications and vulnerabilities and you
know just to kind of run through this
quickly most most folks there's hey
here's the software that we know about
because it's a you know a well-known web
application a critical legacy system
there's a lot of data flows through it
you know it's subject to pci or some
other audit and you know maybe it was
subject to an incident in the past all
right so there's certain you know if you
look from the top down from a governance
standpoint there's usually an
understanding of like hey i know we've
got these five or six critical apps or
these you know 50 critical apps that are
doing different things but then you
start to figure out well here's all
these other like line-of-business
applications that we've got developed
over time here's some event specific
applications you know we forgot it was
there you got procured through
non-standard channels all right you know
then you look at all this offer that you
bought from somebody and customized
customized and deployed alright then you
look at stuff like mobile in the cloud
and again hopefully this provides free
all an understanding of the challenges
at folks are up against right the people
that are responsible for protecting you
know this attack surface if you don't
know about attack surface you're
probably not going to do a very good job
of guarding of protecting it and so the
process of creating this application
portfolio so they can be managed is one
that is really challenging a lot of
organizations now and so you see this
progression where hey we know we have to
worry about web applications you know
then we're going to figure out we've got
to figure like look at client server
applications then we've got to look at
desktop that we've got to look at cloud
then we've got to look at mobile you
know and over time you learn about all
the web applications and so on and so
forth and so like a challenge for all
these security people is you know
they've got this very dynamic you know
ever ever changing set of applications
that they're responsible for you know
and then they've got to look and figure
out okay well I've got this huge
portfolio of applications that I've
identified right some of these matter
more than others right you know certain
certain applications may have you know
they've sit on top of very valuable
customer data you know which is
something that is a you know hopefully
increasingly people recognize this
increasingly as increasingly important
you know certain you know applications
deal with transactions that are really
valuable you know the cost of downtime
for certain applications and so you
can't treat all of these applications
the same you're going to have to
allocate different levels of resources
of you know for assurance for different
types of applications you know and the
challenge that you run into in a lot of
cases is you've got compliance
requirements that you know suck all the
oxygen out of the room right you know
all of your you know too if you're going
to do all the stuff that you need to do
for PCI that just shot your entire
budget as opposed to being able to work
more closely with the development teams
to actually help them address risk I
don't know if folks have seen that in
your organization's again that's
something where that pain is certainly
felt more by the by the by the security
folks typically than the development
folks development folks feel other types
of pain such as crazy deadlines to
implement lots of stuff with not enough
resources there's plenty of pain to go
around but for security folks there you
know that's the stuff that they're often
a lot of times faced with so for folks
on the development side if you guys ever
participate
in some security testing or head folks
come in and do testing for applications
that you've worked with some fools know
and it's interesting for me seeing like
just what you know what does it mean to
do security testing right and we see a
wide range of sophistication between
different types of customers you know
that are looking for tests so on and
like the least sophisticated customer
majors come in and say somebody told me
I need a pen test so I need to depend
test my new network or application but
it's an important question to figure out
you know what do you mean by an
application test and again like the kind
of tradition traditional testing dynamic
analysis which is testing a system
that's actually running right and so for
web applications what that typically
means is much as Google would go and
spider an application to find out here's
all the pages in the application here's
all the forms that can be submitted
right you know in the context of most
applications where you've got to login
here's how I login and detective I've
got a session but you know the dynamic
analysis is from an automated standpoint
is going to figure out what are all the
URLs that I can submit here and what are
all the parameters that I can pass in
and then it's going to go through and
fuzz those all right it's going to say
well i'm going to send in database
control characters and i'm going to look
to see if i get a JDBC error message
back i'm going to send in HTML control
characters i'm going to see if those
HTML control characters come back to me
unencrypted or unencumbered static
analysis which says give me the binary
give me the source code i'm going to
build a model based on that and i'm
going to do different types of analysis
i'm going to do data flow analysis to
look at where data comes in and wear it
you know where it goes out I'm going to
do control flow analysis I'm going to
look for use of banned functions and so
on and so forth you know also you need
to understand that these security
testing technologies the automated
technologies have limitations there's
certain classes of vulnerabilities for
example ones that are associated with
data flow or these you know nice request
and response patterns that the that the
automated tools are really good at
finding there's other classes of
vulnerabilities that the tools in a lot
of cases are powerless to find and that
goes
back to what we talked about before
business logic problems authorization
problems right you know if I'm building
an application for amazon right and i
have a function that says give me a
customer order if i'm building the you
know an application for a customer
service representative as long as i'm
logged in as the csr i should be able to
put in any order and get that you know
and see that order right because i'm a
customer service representative i need
to look at everybody's orders but if i'm
building that same functionality for dub
dub dub at amazon.com for the general
public to use well i need to have a
check in there if i request order number
seven and i made order number seven then
you should probably show me order number
seven if i request order number eight
but someone else made order number eight
okay well then we need to have an
authorization check to say you know what
the logged in user didn't make that
order I'm not going to show it to them
alright so those those situations are
from a code standpoint are the same
thing I need to build a function where I
send in a database ID and get an order
rendered to my screen in one case the
CSR application you don't necessarily
need that authorization check because of
the rule of the system rules of the
system say well if this guy's a csr show
them anybody's orders versus if this is
a public-facing application I do need to
have that check and so again
technology-wise you know the code
written could look identical in both
cases the context matters in the case of
the public facing application oh wait
we're missing an authorization check
because who's logged in that should have
different access than in this other
application that's the type of stuff
that these automated scanners are never
going to be able to find so in addition
to that you can look at you know how
much information you have about the
testing whether you're looking at
supporting libraries and so on and so
forth and so you know just saying well
we're going to do some security testing
that's a there's a pretty big range of
things that that can possibly mean and
so again you know for the security folks
they have to make a determination you
know what stuff do we have to do for PCI
all right what discretion do we have
what's left over you know do I look at
all of our applications in a very
shallow way do I look
certain applications in a very deep way
or is it some combination of those and
so one of the things here we'll talk
about is automation right the automation
is key for any team that wants to get on
top of this and I'd argue that there's a
lot of really cool stuff that you can
start to hook into your continuous
integration environment that can help
the security people out quite a bit as
anybody here use Jenkins bamboo
continuous integration type stuff
excellent all the cool kids with the dev
ops and the whatnots know and so you
know what we've been able to do with our
development is to start to push that
security testing a lot earlier in the
process right if you remember the graphs
that we saw earlier right if you catch
the you know if you're catching
vulnerabilities on a nightly build right
because you know you introduce a new
cross-site scripting vulnerability or
something you know if you're catching
that the day after the evening that it
was introduced you know that's probably
going to be a lot easier for the
developer to go in and fix right because
there they were working in the code
yesterday they just need to go and apply
some encoding or something like that and
so there's you know there's a lot of
value in doing that we we were jointly
developing an application with a with a
customer of ours they brought a new
developer on board that developer sat
down at the keyboard first day at work
and managed to introduce you know 20
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
they built a new page or something like
that and fortunately we had a nightly
code scan through were being run by a
static analysis tool that alerted us and
so that let us go I mean number one like
Bravo you know just the fact that you
could write 20 vulnerabilities in a day
is impressive you know that that person
was able to do that but in you know
because we had that nightly build that
also included static analysis tests and
we could flag that those vulnerabilities
were just introduced and that let us go
and counsel that new person and explain
to them how you do HTML and coding in a
contextual basis and so on and so forth
we were able to catch that a lot earlier
we were able to get those fixed and
provide a teaching moment for that
developer rather than if we'd waited and
let them work for a week or two you know
who knows what additional stuff that
they would have found it would've been
even worse if we had done that until you
know
the week before a major release or
something like that we're all of a
sudden we've got a mound of
vulnerabilities that we need to go in
and we start to you know we have to
start making trade-offs and so I'm a
really big fan of incorporating certain
types of security testing into the
continuous integration process because
you're going to move the identification
of those vulnerabilities a lot closer to
the introduction of those
vulnerabilities you know reducing the
you'll reducing your fixed time in a lot
of cases because the developers still
have some context you know and in
addition you know providing that
feedback loop that really close feedback
loop okay and so just show some examples
here thread fix works and then we'll
start to look at these different tool
interactions and so thread fix again
when you login everything has to have a
dashboard so we have a dashboard there's
our dashboard and what it provides a
little bit of vulnerability trending so
you can see across the portfolio are we
seeing more vulnerabilities are swinging
fewer vulnerabilities and then also you
know kind of a pic list of here are the
vulnerabilities with the most in the
motor here are the applications with the
most and the most serious
vulnerabilities and again as it as a
developer you don't probably really care
much at from the portfolio level view
but for the you know for the application
security folks this does matter because
it helps them identify hotspots where
they can you know where they're going to
direct their efforts where most folks
are going to spend time is down here and
what we let you do is we let you divide
up the world into teams and applications
and so you know and again this is
something that may be done by line of
business it may be done geographically
we've seen folks do this and saying well
here's our you know here's our dev
center and pranay here's our dev center
and Mumbai here's our dev center in
Atlanta again other folks do it line of
business this is our ecommerce this is
our internal IT you know regardless what
it lets you do is to lay out here you
know here are the different teams we
have building software and here are the
applications that each of these folks at
each of these groups are responsible for
and then you can drill in
and see a list of the currently opened
vulnerabilities and so what we've done
here is we've loaded in four different
scans from different testing or actually
we've done some manual testing but we've
also uploaded results from AppScan from
IBM commercial scanner as well as w3 AF
and Iraq die both open-source scanners
they may have experiences out of those a
couple of folks excellent freely
available and what I like about the
freely available stuff is it's free but
that's also in a lot of cases you know
easier to get an initial you'll kind of
go ahead to start to incorporate some of
those types of things into into the
build process so that you can you know
start to demonstrate hey you know we've
you know we deployed this a freely
available tool we saw these results
let's talk about possibly justifying
some additional some additional stuff
and so what thread fix does as you load
in subsequent scans is it runs a diff
between the most recent scan in the
previous scan so it identifies when new
vulnerabilities show up when old
vulnerabilities go away and if
previously existing vulnerabilities have
resurfaced all right and so it gives you
that gives you that tracking so that you
can see over time when things are
showing up when they're going away and
as we'll see that lets you start to pull
some really interesting statistics from
this you know in addition and anybody
who's ever used these tools you have
knows they're not perfect number one
obviously they have false negatives
situations where they don't find
vulnerabilities and that goes back to
you know the general problem where they
aren't able to identify certain types of
vulnerabilities you know but a lot of
them also have false positives right
where they're going to think that
they're going to run some sort of
traffic and say I think this is a blind
sequel injection vulnerability but it's
not and so one of the things you can do
inside the thread fixes go through and
say let's go and look at this OS command
injection and you know what it was found
by let's go this command injection god
this was found by AppScan I'm going to
mark this yeah I went and audited this
and I'm going to mark that as a false
positive because I don't think it's
actually a problem and that decision of
marking something is a false positive is
durable over time right so if you if you
upload a
scan that still has that false positive
in it no thread fix will acknowledge
that that was uploaded but that but that
vulnerability you won't have to re audit
that and so again once you get your kind
of an initial set of scans loaded in all
that data gets normalized and then you
hopefully only have to manage changes to
that and so what we've seen you know the
interaction pattern that we see here is
typically you have your software
security person and they own the thread
fix install this is where they spend a
lot of their time and then what they'll
do is they'll go and find a team lead on
an application team to be the security
liaison a security contact and that
person may also get a login to thread
fix but typically we don't see the
entire development teams getting access
to it again because they already have
their own systems with JIRA with HP
quality center with them young all these
various you know change management
systems and what thread fix is doing
here is it's taking all this data and
normalize again so here we see that this
cross-site scripting vulnerability was
identified by apps can Iraq 9 w 3f right
and so instead of having to deal with
that vulnerability three times right and
so I've got it in this PDF 08 I think
it's the same as this one over here and
I think it's the same with this one over
here the advantage of this normalization
process is you just load in the results
and thread fix gives you that single
unified list right so that you don't
have to go around and screw with line
and those stuff up you know those things
up the other nice thing about having all
this data in a central place is you can
start to slice and dice the data in a
technology independent and activity
independent manner right so again you
may be finding things via manual testing
you may be doing static testing you may
be doing dynamic testing and this lets
me go in and say you know what only show
me the vulnerabilities that were
identified by two or more scanners right
because maybe I consider those to be
less likely to be false positives or
more likely for a customer I'm sorry for
a for an attacker to be able to find
those right or you may go in and say you
know show me everything are you show me
only the cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities
and so on and so forth and so what that
lets the security analysts do along with
the team lead is to start to negotiate
about you know hey here's the stuff that
we found let's start to talk about how
we need to package this data up so this
is going to be most consumable by your
team all right and typically that is
best done in conjunction with the
security liaison or the team lead
working with the application security
analyst and we'll talk we'll show you
how the data flow works you know it you
know from here on but the nice thing is
now we have a place where all the
results of all the security testing
we've been doing has been loaded in and
we can start to discuss how that stuff
is going to be how that stuff is going
to be addressed because really i don't
care if i find a cross-site scripting
vulnerability from a manual pen test or
from a fortified static scan or from a
white hat dynamics can like those three
again I'm gonna have to assess the risk
associated with each one of the severity
but like I don't care what technology
found the vulnerability we're going to
have to address it right it's going to
have to be remediated or addressed or
we're going to have to accept that we're
not going to fix it and so having that
single view for the security analyst and
in giving them a screen that they can
use your share on a webex or something
with the security care with a with the
security liaison right now we can start
to look at here's all the security stuff
that we've got to worry about let's
start the negotiation process to see
what we're you know what we're going to
address and what we're going to live
with any questions about that so far
excellent and so with thread fix one of
the again one of the goals here is to
get as much automation as we can and so
we try to make it really easy to load
data in here you know from the different
tools that are in use so I'm you know
you can obviously upload files manually
we've got like a cool html5 like you can
drag the file under the browser and it
uploads know some one of our engineers
did that one day it was real proud of
himself it's whatever so you can
manually upload files but that's that
gets old but we also expose a REST API
that you can use to call in and do most
of the things that you would do through
you through the user interface and we
provide a command-line interface that
wraps that rest api and so if you can
start to move different types of testing
into your continuous integration process
or into some sort of automation you can
basically put a one line at the end of
the script that says thread fix client
grab the results of this testing send it
to the thread fix server for application
number 72 all right and so all that data
is just going to get to start be loaded
in to thread fix in an automated fashion
so the security folks don't have to go
out and chase you down to do tests and
said those tests have an autumn happen
automatically you know right after your
salon am run or whatever you know
whatever you're using happens that data
just gets loaded in we also had some
folks in the community created a Jenkins
plugin so if you're if you're
orchestrating some sort of security
testing via Jenkins at the end of your
Jenkins run you can basically say grab
these various files no grab files
according to these pattern and send them
up to this thread fixed server right and
so the goal here is to allow for
automation of everything you know from
everything possible so that the security
analysts can spend their time doing
manual testing which they're not going
to get from from automation but also
acting as consultants working with the
developers to help with remediation
planning to help with remediation
strategy oh hey here's some encoding
libraries you may want to consider using
here's the way that we're fixing these
different authorization problems right
like we want to make the I can instead
of
having the security folks be like
scanner monkeys where it's like run the
scanner will chase down the results from
the scanner chase down the results you
know we want to see them use for the
stuff that only they can do which is
going to be your manual testing and
again acting as a consultant acting is a
resource for you all in your development
teams to say here's what we can do to
actually get this stuff solved as
opposed always be in the false with the
you know with with the bad news okay so
we talked a little bit about this so
what does thread fix do with results it
does a diff against the previous scan
which is a which is handy so you can
start to see trending and things like
that you know we remember findings
remark marked as false positives and we
also do normalization and so to
normalize the dynamic scanners against
one another is pretty easy I mean
there's a straightforward thing
similarly to to map the static scanners
and normalize those against one of those
is pretty straightforward the challenge
is to take a code scan result that says
you know here's where tainted data comes
into the application here's where it
like flows through the application
here's where it goes to the sensitive
sync function therefore i believe i've
got a sequel injection vulnerability
here the challenge is to match up that
data associated with the code with i
sent this request with the database
control character and I had this
response with a jdbc error message right
and i think these you know to be able to
say that those two things are the same
or the same thing fortunately we were
able to work with US Department of
Homeland Security Science and Technology
Directorate to build what we call hybrid
analysis mapping and so we'll go through
some examples of that you're leading
into that but basically what that lets
us do is it lets us map the static
scanning results to dynamic scanning
results and so for security analyst this
is really handy because they don't have
to do it in Excel anymore but I also
think is really valuable for developers
because then you can show the developer
here's the request that went into the
application here's each line of code
that got touched as the taint of data
flows through and here's the response
that went out at the end so to be able
to provide that context to the developer
i think is
again I talked before about how do you
take the friction out of this process I
think that's an important way of being
able to do that to show here's the
behavior we observed with the request
and the response right but here's also
the code that was touched associated
with that and so I believe that it's
actually a problem because I see the
request and response i see the behavior
of the system but then i can go in and
pinpoint the particular lines of code
that i need to track through in order to
figure out where things need to be
changed and i think that allows for a
much more positive interaction between
the security folks in the dev folks
again i showed some examples previous of
this you know where you've got these are
dynamic results mapped to dynamic result
and so the way that now so the way that
this works we built this is under a
there's a lot of acronyms the DHS
Department of Homeland Security or DHS
Science and Technology Directorate S&amp;amp;T
via their small business innovation
research or SBIR program we did a phase
one work with them to identify if we
thought this was feasible and that we're
now in the middle of a phase two
contract with them to build out the
technology more and so our initial goal
here was just what I talked about before
how do I take a static scan results
showing the lines of code that a
vulnerability flows through and how do I
emerged that with a dynamic result that
shows me a request and response that
were sent into a system the good news
the reason that I'm here to talk to you
today is because we were successful in
doing that and the extra good news is we
were able to use that technology to do
some stuff that I think is really cool
and that has has been a help to a number
of a number of dev teams yeah and so are
just like our basic goal for the first
you know for the first phase was can we
take an HP fortify at see a result and
mesh that together with an appt scan
standard and again anybody here
experience with fortify a couple folks
all right and buddy here experience the
apps can
handful of folks excellent and so that
was just and the reason that we did that
was that we saw a lot of customers that
had you know that had those two
technologies in place and just like the
way that things worked out is the HP
bought fortify IBM bought watch fire who
made apps can IBM and HP for whatever
reason don't feel like they need to
collaborate strongly in this area weird
and which is which is certainly well
within their rights but again we saw a
lot of challenges with our customers
where they had those technologies in
place and we're dealing with this
problem so that's why we what's why we
picked those and so again for dynamic
application security testing the testing
tool act like a acts like Google's
spider would right let me find every
page in the application let me find
every form that can be submitted or
every page that seems to take some
parameters all right we're going to need
to teach it to login so that it can find
the you'll find out what's behind the
login we were working with an insurance
company a couple years ago they were
very proud of themselves that they had a
500 page web application that had zero
vulnerabilities they had done no
security testing up into that point no
secure coding initiative but they found
zero vulnerabilities Bravo what we found
was they didn't teach the scanning tool
to log in so they scan the homepage in
the login page and they miss the 498
pages behind that right which needs to
say once we showed them well here's how
you teach you to login here's how you
teach the tool to do session detection
let's just say we found more than zero
vulnerabilities and you know but so
that's a that's a you know that's
something to understand as you try to
adopt this dynamic application security
testing you need to make sure that the
scans you're getting are good scans
right the year you're actually getting
sufficient coverage of the application
so that you can exercise all these
different potential paths and as we'll
show some of the some of the stuff that
we did with the hybrid analysis mapping
lets us do basically an attack surface
calculation that you can feed these
dynamic scanners so that you pre-seed
your spider with all of the URLs and all
the parameters of the
location in theory should respond to so
that's dynamic security testing right
I've got a running application i'm going
to send in a request get a response back
you know do some pattern matching
against those and make a determination
if I think there's a problem in static
application security testing we're
looking at the application at rest we're
looking either at the binary or at the
source code and so here what we see Oh
walk over here so here we see is we have
an application where we're pulling in
the user name parameter via request that
get parameter all right hopefully
everybody here will agree that that can
contain whatever a bad guy wants it to
all right I can I can trap the request
and a proxy and i can send whatever it
is i want so that is tainted input right
so this get parameter call returns a
string that gets included her you know
gets set the unit to the string username
right so this function is a source
function for tainted data this variable
is now tainted and so we append this
fixed string to this variable string
that is a that is tainted so therefore
now the sequel variable is also tainted
then we come down here you know make a
statement call our jdbc create statement
and then we call the execute function
which is a sinc function and we feed it
that tainted data and so in this case
what we're able to see or what this data
flow analysis allows us to see or allows
the scanning the code scanning tool to
see is a flow of tainted data through
different variables and then into a into
a sensitive function and so what kind of
a vulnerability do we see that we have
here sequel injection right so we get in
tainted data we feed that to attain its
sequel function and so that is a kind of
a textbook example of how static
analysis identifies sequel injection
vulnerabilities again very different
things because here we see we here we
see the code float or the flow of the
data through the code you know versus
before we're seeing a request and
response pattern very different types of
analysis you know being done and so are
phase one sub goals for the hybrid
analysis mapping was to standardize and
vulnerability types all of these tools
have something different that they call
various vulnerabilities the was I
thinking of the 425 folks have their
seven pernicious kingdoms of like
software security flaws same I am I use
the word pernicious frequently in their
everyday life that's even that's even
more hard to explain I did a bunch of
training for for some folks offshore
non-native speakers I'm like hey guys I
don't even really know what the word
pernicious means so we're going to i
change this slide so it doesn't say
permit furnishes because I suspect
nobody understands that word so they've
got their seven pernicious kingdoms
whatever you know everybody has
something that they call you know just a
little bit different and so you know
again we needed to go and normalize this
data so that we knew when the static
analysis tools talking about something
that the dynamic analysis tool was
talking about the same thing then we
needed to match the static in the
dynamic locations and so what like and
so the challenge here is when I had a
request in a response against a running
system we need to know what code that
hits right and in certain situations
like in kind of a basic servlet set up
with JSP pages the structure of the
layout of the JSP pages may bear a very
strong resemblance to what the you know
site map of the application looks like
right or it may or may not but if you're
using a framework like spring where
you've got different controllers and
those controllers are passing things off
well the layout of the code files
probably varies little or no resemblance
to the two to the attack surface the
application is going to expose right and
so the URL slash login might map to calm
down whatever doubt whatever about
whatever dot log in control right so
that was the the first problem or the
second problem we need to solve the
first was when there when this is
talking about sequel injection I need to
know that this is also talking about
sequel injection the next problem was
when I see this request come in I need
to know the entry point I need to know
the code where this you know where this
obtained of data enters the application
and then finally we needed to know
specifically what the entry point was so
that we could match up hey
you pass in the parameter username that
started this specific line of code here
where I grabbed that user name parameter
um and again this is a kind of whatever
specific tasks and so what we did is we
built an engine that does very
lightweight source code analysis right
so we can either pull code from a shared
directory from get we're going to add
the ability to pull it from from
subversion and what we do is we go and
detect the framework that is in use and
in the Java world right now we support
java using JSP s as well as java spring
we're going to be adding support for
four struts and we've got support for
asp asp.net MVC as well as asp.net web
forms and contraction we've got to add a
couple of those for four people at
javaone the stuff is probably most
relevant is the stuff that we're doing
with kind of just straight-up jsps as
well as the spring framework just
because we see a lot of people use in
spring anybody here using spring
excellent XML annotations fun all right
what's that we may look at support and
jsf in the future if we've got customers
that are interested in that and similar
with the elective portlet stuff although
that's going to be a little harder
because I think that requires some
runtime knowledge to determine you know
basically the mapping of the URL and
what code got wired to that and so we're
actually uh you know we're actually
trying to find you know it the way that
this stuff is structured we're just
building out additional plower or
languages and frameworks on a on an as
interested basis we've got some things
that we've contracted with DHS
specifically to do and then other than
that we're just working with customers
to find out you know you guys have XYZ
framework and useful cool wool and then
we'll put that our roadmap for support
come and so uh and so you know in our
case we also pull though four or five
pack some additional information and
they're fpr files that we could you know
we could use in certain cases if that
was available the nice thing about the
way that thread fix works is that it's
pretty much technology agnostic web for
most of the stuff that gets uploaded and
so even though our scope for the initial
phase was to match to specific tools
apps can and fortify
the actual capability that we had works
for all the different you know engines
that we support zap burp you know W 3af
web inspect on the dynamic side as well
as like check marks barcode and so on
and so forth on the static side so we we
were able to successfully standardize on
miters cwe but when we looked at some
other kind of more complicated matching
the cwe has this concept of like fault
patterns where we're like certain types
of vulnerabilities were similar you know
we determined that that wasn't you
basically got to do a straight match and
so what we do is we build up this
unified endpoint database based on that
based on our lightweight source code
analysis where we keep track of you know
the source code that is responsible and
each piece of attack surface that that
source code turns into and so we
calculate based on our knowledge of the
framework what the dynamic path is going
to be what the parameter is going to be
you know in a lot of cases which HTTP
method or methods will be you know will
work for it and then we map that back to
the source code and create a database
based on that and so you know so for JSP
we basically start with the JSP folder
you know in in spring we go and parse
out all of the at controller classes
because each of those at controller
classes has one or more methods that get
essentially attached to a URL that's it
gets exposed and so that lets us know
hey you know based on this controller
java you know / rest / new is going to
map to this method and these are the
model elements that get passed in there
as well and so we're also going through
in the JSP space we're looking for calls
to get parameter and other other source
functions in spring we parse through we
look at the request params that and the
path variables and we also run through
all of the entity annotated classes and
create a graph of what the structure of
all those look like and so from that we
can detect potential auto binding issues
where you where in spring you've got you
can do deep binding of
no parameters something dot something
dot something dot something and like go
set farther down into the object tree
and then so this endpoint database lets
us do this type of merging where if I
know that I've got you know so i can say
i have a cross-site scripting
vulnerability that is in log slash log
in for the user name parameter right i
find that for the dynamics can on the
static side I know that I've got a in
combat whatever got whatever got login
controller on line 72 is my entry point
for that user name parameter for the
login function you know if I can check
my database and it says this piece of
attack surface came from that line of
code I can match that together and say
these two vulnerabilities identified by
the dynamic and the static scanner are
actually the same vulnerability and so
that let us do you know that let us do
the merging that we set out to do and I
can show you what that looks like
so you can come in and see that you've
got an appt scan result and a fortify
result for this cross site scripting
vulnerability we've identified or the
system has identified that those are
actually the same vulnerability and so
in the code this was located in / route
/ login JSP on the dynamic path it was
located in budget login JSP you know we
calculate the common URL path you know
we get the parameter from the dynamics
can from the results and then we
determine the parameter based on our
analysis is a source code and so this
lets us make a pass over the dynamic
scan results in the static scan results
and we found here is you know these are
actually two of the same vulnerability
and so I can look at both the yeah I can
look at both the source code lines that
are responsible for this as well as the
you know in certain cases the the
request and response
similarly we can go in here and look at
the same thing in a spring based
application where we're mapping the
controllers out to the URL path there
that that controller code is actually
going to be attached to you know any
questions about that and so that's again
for the security folks I think that's
that's a huge time saver right to be
able to make a pass over this data and
get those merge together so you don't
have to be like sitting down trying to
stitch those things together for the
developers I think that's a win because
it lets you show here's a request here's
how it flows through the code and here's
the response the but the even cooler
thing was we were able to set up some
additional interactions beyond that that
let us let us do some really interesting
things for example you know anybody
who's ever tried to do dynamic scanning
of restful applications what we find is
a lot of the dynamic scanners will over
report certain vulnerabilities so you
end up with a lot of junk data all right
but because of this attack surface model
that we've built we can actually filter
that data and collapse it and I'll show
you an example of that in a minute in
addition this attack surface model that
we've built tells us some additional
things about the application so we may
know about pages that the scanner would
find during a crawl or we may know about
parameters that the scanner wouldn't
find during a crawl and I'll show you
the benefits of that because we can
essentially use this attack surface
model to precede the dynamic scanners so
they get a more thorough scan again
reducing the number of false you know
false negatives that you get you know in
addition even if you're not doing a
full-blown security static analysis with
like a fortify or something like that
because those tools the commercial tools
in that space or candidly kind of
expensive and there's not a lot of great
open source your analog forum there's a
fine bugs in might hear use fine bugs
you know
tool has found some really interesting
stuff does a little bit of like in intra
method data flow but not like the full i
cross method cross class data flow that
you get from a commercial-grade static
analysis tool so there you know we see a
lot of organizations where they haven't
rolled out or at least not across the
entire organization they haven't rolled
out testing tools but one thing we can
do because we have this attack surface
model is if we have a dynamic
vulnerability we can query our database
and say show me the line of source code
where this enters the application and
from that that lets us then map to a
specific starting point line of code
it's not as good as having the full
control flow trace or the full data flow
trace but we can at least show the entry
point and communicate that to the
developers to say hey developer like
you've got a cross-site scripting
vulnerability you need to start looking
on how to remediate it at this specific
line of code in this file which again is
a way for us to take some of the you
know is a way to take some of the
friction out of this process and so if
we go in here and look at this pet
clinic application which is a the
jawbridge kind of spring pet clinic and
I want whoever has similar with that and
what we see here is we've got a number
of situations where AppScan over
reported these vulnerabilities so we see
that we've found a blind sequel
injection at pet clinic owners five pet
clinic owners six and pet clinic owners
seven all right and so as a person who
understands how spring works I look at
that and say all of those
vulnerabilities go through the same line
of code right and it's just you know
this this number there is a path
parameter right and so what our attack
surface model that we've built with the
hybrid analysis mapping because it knows
about those paths parameters and it
knows that each of those is going to map
back to the same source line of code
what that lets us do here is to make a
pass over that and say this is actually
three repeated findings of one
vulnerability you know as opposed to
this being three vulnerabilities that we
need and so this lets you character
as a lot more accurately the type of
problems that you're going to you know
that the development team has to deal
with so again we see here you know we've
got this one we found twice this when we
found three times this one we found two
times so you know nco so our actual
vulnerability count is probably about
half or maybe even less than what the
scanner would have told us with the raw
results and so by cleaning this up we
very quickly get a much clearer picture
of the security state of the application
because we're able to take that attack
surface model and use that to clean up
the vulnerability data that we're
getting from these scanners and what we
also did and this is really just a we
built a command line client just to kind
of give an idea of how this works is
that semi readable to certain people
and so what the command line client does
is it goes and builds that attack
surface model and then essentially just
dumps out the dumps out all the data and
so when we look at this budget store
application we see right you know we've
got about JSP Edmund JSP and both of
those pages take this debug parameter
advance that JSP will take Q or debug
basket JSP will take update product ID a
quantity and debug you know basically it
lets us enumerate here's all the URLs
and all the HTTP verbs that this
application should respond to and all of
the variables that yeah and all the
variables that you should be able to
pass in all right so this is an example
of a simple like servlet and JSP based
application you know but this is the
type of data that we're they were able
to calculate now if we apply that same
approach to a spring based application
and so we'll run this on the thread
fixed source code base so it's just
chewed through just from if to give you
an idea of how fast that runs i want to
say thread fixes fifty thousand eighty
thousand lines of java code or something
like that so it runs it really quick you
know it's running all that what we're
doing is just a real basic you know
stringtokenizer that you attach some
state machines to to pull this stuff out
and so it's the runtime is super quick
when compared to something like anything
doing like a full data flow analysis or
full control flow analysis we're just
trying to like ask some basic questions
find some annotations and you'll look
for specific points of information but
so here we see that you know again this
team ID you can pass in here's the path
parameters that it's identified in
different cases and something else
that's really handy if you look here
this particular post for applications
adding scheduled scan what you see is
you know we're going through all of the
all the model classes and looking at how
those are attached to one another from a
spring standpoint and so we've
identified here there are an awful lot
of parameters that are potentially
subject to auto binding right and so if
I look at this and when I do look at
this I actually looked at it last week
and said that looks like we're not
properly constraining what
parameters can be sent in an auto bound
to these spring objects and so you could
potentially like haul deep into the
spring model right this doesn't look
good so I emailed the lead engineer on
this and I said you know hey this looks
like a problem in the way that our
spring you know and in the way that this
particular URL is not properly
constraining spraying auto binding and
he said okay yeah yeah that that is that
does look a problem it's not exploitable
because of you know these three
mitigating factors but I'm still going
to go and talk to these two other folks
on the development team you know to
refresh them on how this is supposed to
work and I actually looked at this and
email them back I was like actually it
couldn't hurt to refresh them but I'm
the guy that wrote this function so so
so maybe I could use a refresher as well
but uh so that's the value if you look
at like from a pen tester standpoint if
you give pen testers a little bit of
access to source code and some simple
tools like this this can put them in a
position where they can start to quickly
identify some potential problems and
actually for our asp.net MVC support
we've got a lint mode that looks for
common misconfigurations that we're
going to build some of those into our
spring and into our spring stuff as well
where we can look for potential
misconfigurations again based on this
very very lightweight source code
analysis you know we can run really
quickly but with a little bit of
knowledge of the spring framework we can
identify here are some potential
problems and again using this tool
manually what I identify here is okay
well everything else has a path
parameter and one or two things that
your pass again you know this here has a
whole bunch of stuff that's being passed
in which you know you probably don't
want to you probably don't need people
able to walk that fall down you know
walk that far down the model tree and
auto set things and so we need to again
the way that we actually use this I
think we grab the application ID and
then reload the applications the auto
binding doesn't count but we need we
need to clean this up and we were able
to identify that just by running this
command line tool and seeing the stuff
that came out and so that's you know at
least as a security guy I find that to
be useful and interesting what we can
also do from that is take this attack
surface model
and that we've gotten from the
developers from doing a little bit of
analysis of their source code and we can
feed that to different scanners so that
the scanners can identify attack surface
that they might otherwise miss and so
we've written a plug-in for zap which
know so we've written a plug-in 40 oz
app which again certainly recommend
seeing Simon's talk later I'm a boot
imagine he's going to be talking a lot
about zap so we've written a plug-in for
zap that lets you well first of all
connect to a thread fixed server tell it
which application you want data about
and then if you give it the base URL of
the application it can import all of
that on top and so what we see here is
now this application is going to fuzz
you know from here we start our spider
it's going to crawl around and try to
identify all the different pages we've
proceeded that and in addition we've
proceeded all the parameters that in
theory the application will respond to
and so if you look close what you see
here is we've got this admin JSP page
that the that's going to be in scope for
the scanning if you do a crawl of this
budget application just by default
you're not going to find that admin dot
JSP page there's no link to admin JSP
right but that page exists and the web
server will respond to it and so you see
this a lot of times in applications or
you're in bigger applications if you
have like landing pages for a particular
promotion or for some reason you have a
landing page that someone goes to that
then links back into the application but
there's no corresponding links that go
back out and so if you have applications
that have islands of data like this or
they have again admin sections that
maybe aren't properly protected by
authentication requirements preceding
these scanners helps to get you
better coverage of the application
because you're going to know about all
the things they're all the URLs that
you're going to need access and fuzz and
in addition what we also have here is we
see that these parameters have been
seated and these debug parameters
similarly you wouldn't find in a crawl
but the application will respond to them
if they're there I remember I was doing
some work on a cold fusion application a
long time ago and if if you passed in a
parameter called d to any page like
somehow this code had been cut and
pasted into every single page in this
application but if you passed in a
parameter name to D with a number the
behavior the system would be to delete
the order with the value of that
parameter but why was that there I don't
know when but that's what the
application did all right and again it's
like a handy convenience feature you
know great you know but you know not a
good thing and certainly something from
a security testing standpoint you know
that I want this you know I want this
automated scan to identify this but also
as a manual pen tester I'm going to look
at that and say what does this debug
parameter do that's very strange that
that would be there that's something I'm
going to go and you know that's
something I'm gonna go and investigate
to see if I can your cause the
application to do something that's not
supposed to be able to do and so with
this attack surface model that we've
built based on our development artifact
of the code now I can make my security
testing better to identify potential
like you know potentially hidden pages
potential hidden functionality that I'm
going to want to be in the scope of both
the dynamic fuzzing that we're doing as
well as the manual pen testing yeah then
we might be doing as well I mean so here
we would go and we would kick off our
active scan and get our results and what
we can also do and this is just kind of
from a convenient standpoint yeah in the
thread fix plug-in you can actually once
you're finished with the scan you can
export that and send it directly into
thread fix rather than saving the file
and then like dragging and somewhere
else and we've got a similar plugin for
burp suite which is a commercial tool
you know kind of low-end from a price
standpoint at the low end of the market
and we're looking at adding similar
capabilities out to some of the other
commercial tools as well
as well as some of the open-source folks
and again the nice thing is is we build
out additional frameworks you know that
allows for you know your pen testers and
scanners to benefit from benefit from
that type of source code access any
questions about the tech surface eating
all right okay so that's been a lot of
talk but it looks at like how do we load
all of this data in you know how do we
load all of this data into the system
right now how do we get good data better
data and cleaner data so that we're
saving the security analyst time and
we're providing both the security
analyst and the dev team a accurate
picture of what you know of the security
state of these different applications
once that data is in there then you can
start to filter that data according to
different criteria
and so again we can go in and say show
me all the show me all the
vulnerabilities that were found by a
scanner show me show me all the
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities you
can also combine those and save them and
so if you've got a policy that says you
know show me I can cross site scripting
vulnerabilities have to be addressed in
90 days we can go in across the entire
enterprise or for a specific application
and say show me all the cross-site
scripting is that are over 90 days old
all right or show me all the critical
and high vulnerabilities that are over
30 days and so as the development team
is you guys negotiate with the security
folks to say okay we agree that will fix
critical vulnerabilities within X amount
of time or we agree that will fix you
know they will do critical
vulnerabilities and an out of cycle
release but high vulnerabilities we get
30 days to fix those before they need to
be pushed out in production you can
start to save those filters so that
again team leads or team security
liaisons can sit down with the
application security representative
slice and dice the data and see what
they in to see what you've got what you
can also do with that is start to
package these vulnerabilities and ship
them over to defect tracking systems
again this is a critical critical it
seems like a very small step but it's
one that we found to be very much an
indicator of progress and so what we can
do as we go in and set up all the
different defect tracking systems that
we have that you have inside of your
organization right so if you're using
bugzilla or JIRA or HP quality center or
whatever whatever you might be whatever
you might be connecting to you can set
those up and then attach those two
different applications so if we go in
here
look at this data I'm set attached to
this JIRA defect tracker then what we
can do is we can slice and dice this
vulnerability data and create defects in
the defect tracking system and so here
we see like one of the things that we've
noticed you know especially if you run a
scan and find like 100 cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities you probably
don't want to make a hundred bugs the
bug tracking system because the QA
manager will murder you in the parking
lot because it's going to take more time
to administer each bug than it takes to
actually fix the code and so with these
filters though you can go in and say
show me all the cross-site scripting is
I'm going to bundle these and chunks of
20 and ship those over to the developers
right because if you're using the same
encoding functions to fix cross-site
scripting hey just give me 20 things you
have fixit fixit fixit fixit fixit fixit
fixit or maybe you've got a situation
where you say yeah you know what we just
ran a scan we find these three criticals
if we don't fix these within five
business days we've got a service level
agreement notification we've got to do
cool put all those in one bug we're
pushing those over the dev team we've
got to do an out of cycle release all
right poor you may say you know what Joe
wrote the check out code and anytime
anybody but Joe touches the check out
code everything breaks therefore let's
go in and find everything that's in /
check out and ascent we're going to put
that in one bug and assign that to Joe
for him to go and fix and so you know I
don't have a lot of dogma associated
with like how it makes sense to slice
and dice this but the idea is packaged
the vulnerabilities up in such a way and
you know typically in conjunction with
the security analysts talking to the
just you know to team leader the
security liaison and ship those over to
ship those over into the defect tracking
system that the folks you are already
using right and give them information
about you know what type of
vulnerability you know here's a link out
to some additional information of how
you might fix it and so on and so forth
and then what thread fix does is it
keeps track of all the bugs that it's
created and wakes up on a periodic basis
to go and pull the written pull the
status and so we know that this defect
is the defect associated with these two
vulnerabilities is still open but the
defect associated with these down here
has been closed meaning that the
development team assigned
someone they went through whatever
process they go through a changing code
checking stuff in and then and then and
then the bug has been marked as closed
so what this lets me do as the security
representative to say oh well this was
found by a fortify scan I'm going to
rerun my fortify scan of this
vulnerabilities should no longer show up
in my list if they do if they do still
show up in my list that's cause for me
to reach out to the security liaison or
someone on the development team to say
hey you guys worked on this you guys
claim you guys think this is closed I
checked it's still not a false positive
you guys use an HTML encoding library to
try and fix a sequel injection
vulnerability all right let's talk about
how we actually need to fix this right
and so the idea is you know first and
foremost take all this data about
security vulnerabilities put it in a
format that's going to be consumable by
the development team and push it into
the systems that there are two using
obviously with the consent and in can
you know in coordination with the you
know the people responsible for managing
the workload but get this in front of
the developers in the system that
they're already using so that your story
isn't hey all your work is in JIRA
except for security where you've got to
use this other system over here all
right because at the end of the day
these software defects are these these
software vulnerabilities are software
defects they're going to have to be
fixed via the software maintenance
process and so the more you can slip
stream in the practices and the you know
the protocols and everything the
development team already has beat up the
more you can take advantage of those as
a security analyst the less friction
there's going to be involved in the
process and so that's that's a really
really critical thing that we found in
trying to push this you know trying to
try to reduce to take a lot of the
disagreements out of this process
in addition what you can do because of
that hybrid attack it's good because of
the hybrid analysis mapping what we can
also do even if you haven't done a
full-blown statics can you as I
mentioned we can go and connect to
developers in their IDE and so we've
built plug-ins for both IntelliJ and for
eclipse I can't seem to find oh here we
go we're even if you haven't done a full
static scam just based on the dynamics
can we can map that to the line of code
that you need to start looking at in
order to fix these in order to fix the
vulnerability and so again you can
basically connect up to thread fix you
know import the results and then you get
a list at the bottom here of all the
results associated with that application
you know as well as you know as well as
markers on the line of code where you
can go in and you know start addressing
the bug and so the hope here is again
let's use the tools that developers are
already using 90s right as well as the
defect tracking systems let's take that
vulnerability data and make it available
to them in those tools so that the cost
associated with fixing these
vulnerabilities decreases if you've got
a starting point line of code and again
for anybody who's ever used like a your
fortifies ide plugin or any the full
static analysis engine ID plugins like
they've got better data because they
show you each line of code because they
they know of each line of code in our
case in the absence of a static analysis
scan but with the hybrid analysis
mapping model that we built you know we
can at least show you the entry point
line of code which is better than having
no line of code or a PDF file that you
know a PDF file with a bunch of like
sticky notes attached to it and so the
idea here is how do we take the security
scanning that we're doing and push it
out to the different developers in their
tools and make it as
is as easy as possible to get these
things fixed
toxic man
essel and so the other advantage and
again from people coming from the
development standpoint this may or may
not be is valuable but the other
advantage that you have from
centralizing all of this data is that it
lets you start to look in a very in a
program wide basis at what you're doing
and so you can start to benchmark
yourself against I mentioned earlier
those reports by whitehat security and
Vera code you can start to benchmark
yourself against other organizations
right and so you can say hey we're a
financial organization of this size
according to this report you know they
fix ninety percent of their cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities in 50 days
right we're fixing sixty percent of our
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
it's taking us 75 days all right clearly
we need to devote more resources to
remediation because we're falling out of
step with our peers alright or you may
have statistics that say our peers are
doing ninety percent in 50 days we're
doing a hundred percent in 25 days
clearly we deserve a bonus for our
effective use of scarce resources right
like however you want your statistics to
live for you by loading all this through
a common system you get those statistics
calculated for you automatically and
again that is a lot that's that's very
helpful when you want to have a like a a
candid but objective conversation about
here's what our security assurance
program looks like and here's what
industry data tells us you know we need
to make a move in this direction or in
another direction in order to you know
in order to do this and stuff in
addition an advantage for development
teams is is you drill into different
teams or applications you might say you
know what these folks aren't having a
problem with sequel injection maybe
you're sitting on top of hibernate you
know and you do a good job of
parameterizing any queries that where
you need that for hibernate HDL stuff
you know but you see that you've got
cross-site scripting okay why don't we
have a focused training session on
cross-site scripting because that's
because we've identified that that's a
potential problem that we have and not
waste our developers time recovering
sequel injection because they already
figured that out or because their
technology stack makes
not as much of a risk and so again by
having this type of data that lets you
feedback and say where the areas where
these development teams can use help
right you know how can the security
folks most effectively act as a
consultant for those teams as opposed to
an adversary and another handy thing
from this is you know you can look
across the different technologies that
you're using and determine which ones
are the most effective and so you know
when it comes time to justify budget to
say well we're using some open source
tools we're using some commercial tools
we doing some static stuff we're doing
some dynamic stuff you know because
you've got all of this in a central
location you can start to ask questions
like which scanning technologies are
finding the things that I consider to be
the most important right or which
scanning technologies that we're using
have a huge false positive rate which
means they're actually costing me staff
time to go through and clear out these
false positives you know once you've got
this summary data you can start to make
a much more objective view take a much
more objective view of the stack that
you've got in place and that may make
you say you know what we did you know we
deployed zap in the you know along with
the selenium builds and you know that's
finding 75% of the stuff that we're that
our security team is finding at their
end of end of cycle you know with a
commercial scanner and whatever if we
can push if we can get zapped on more of
these continuous integration builds
that's going to save us a whole bunch of
workload later on when we're doing our
final security review of you know before
before a big release that will let you
start to collected this data and look to
see what technologies are techniques
that we deployed that have been
effective let's look at pushing those
out two additional teams what have we
done that's maybe been expensive and not
as effective okay well maybe let's look
at paring back those activities so that
we can focus on things that are new
they're providing higher value
okay excellent oh that's about the end
of my stick the main thread fix website
again thread fixed org you can pull the
thread fix off of github you know github
/ dental group / thread fix a wasp
zapped again is a freely available tool
that that Simon will be here talking
about and I cannot encourage you enough
to go and to go and see him same thing
with manic O's talk and you know again
we've got a google group where people
you know reach out for support and
things like that and especially again
like you know it was important our CFO
disagrees with me from time to time but
it was important for me to have thread
fix be available open source as well as
to integrate and work well with a lot of
the open source tools just as a lot of
programs are starting to try and get off
the ground I think it's I think there's
a lot of value in having an open source
stack available to do basic basic to
implement the basic software security
functions that you need and so you know
we hope the thread fix is valuable for
folks in that regard and you know again
helps put people in a position to talk
and a lot more quantitative manner about
their assurance programs so they can
move past the cross-site scripting of
scary type of a conversation any
questions has been relatively quiet
anyone all right well I'll be around up
here for a while I think I've got a
couple minutes left before the slots
over i'll be up here for a while if
anybody has any questions and wandering
around i'm pretty easy to find okay
there we go yeah i'm just Dan at denim
group com denim like jeans if you want
to shoot me an email or if you're on
Twitter I have to my PR folks make me
say you can follow me on twitter at
daniel cornell but yeah if you have any
questions I'll be around through midday
tomorrow if you want to meet up in
person or again I'm pretty easy to find
online so track me down and hopefully
hopefully this is some things you guys
can look at using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
