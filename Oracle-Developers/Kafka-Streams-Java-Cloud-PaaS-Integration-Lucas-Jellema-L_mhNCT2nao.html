lounge here at Oracle OpenWorld 2017 and
JavaOne 2017 and also for today Oracle
code the 21st Oracle code I'm Bob Robert
with the Oracle developer community and
my guests for what I believe is the
second to last
developer interview this afternoon is my
guest Oracle ace director and code
champion Lucas hello MA Lucas thanks for
stopping by
thank you both thanks for having me so
so I'm looking at the list of sessions
that you've presented here at open world
you've got five sessions here I think
you have more sessions than anyone I've
talked to so far tell me a little bit
about each of those sessions and first
of all I have to be honest only one of
those sessions was actually completely
my own oh and the other one the other
ones I've played a part in made us short
appearance actually there were six
sessions but some of them had me
speaking for only six minutes ah so it
may not be as impressive as otherwise it
looks I take the credit anyway the one I
was doing today at the Oracle code event
that was one about something it's very
close to my heart I'm more an
architecture style based on events the
specific topic was how to create an
active UI that's the user interface that
provides the end-users with the latest
information without having them to use
the f5 key to refresh their browser okay
and this actually requires two steps get
information from the application server
into the browser and for that you can
use server sent events and WebSockets
just two options two relevant options
and the application server of course
also needs to know about the things that
are happening in the back-end systems or
even outside of the organisation that
are relevant and that's where Apache
Kefka comes in okay as the event hub and
it could be running in the cloud the
Oracle event a plot for example
beckoned systems will publish anything
that they do that's happening inside of
them that's relevant to this event hub
and the application servers that are
powering the end-user applications can
take events from the event hub and push
them into the client and I've described
it in the session I've demoed it and
I've explained the code to people in 45
minutes will be a challenge
yeah I think so now I know one of the
sessions that you were involved in was
the soaring in the cloud session now
that's actually a an updated version of
a session that you and several others in
the ACE program presented at I believe
it was the middleware forum in the
spring of 2015 26 to 2016 okay that's
what I thought it's earlier in the day I
talked to Donna lush middle and Sven
Bernhardt and they were participants in
that program but you were kind of the
organizer of that thing talk a little
bit about that session and and that the
what was involved in that we set
ourselves a challenge to set a world
record in terms of integrating time to
get our Oracle files cloud services and
we started as you said in Valencia in
2016 with eight cloud services and
yesterday we had 19 well you could
debate whether it's 18 or 20 but
something like 90 and that was the
challenge so we first of all had to
define the business case what what are
we doing in terms of the functionality
and then we had to find meaningful
applications of each of the cloud
services in terms of design and
architecture and then of course we had
to implement and actually make it work
yeah and the business case is all to do
with Oracle OpenWorld the appreciation
event there's always a big act
performing and we thought well let's do
let's have the community propose an act
and our flow is about seeing the
proposal taking it through validation
and to prove
and then making it available to the
wider public so in terms of the actual
cloud service that are involved that
kicks off with IOT
which will use either voting machines or
Twitter as its input a cable feed and
whenever we meet reach a certain
threshold in terms of the number of
votes for an artist it will then send
the information on words to ICS icn's
it's two pcs a workflow is started human
gets an email has to perform the task
well interacting with document cloud
service Oracle conversations gets back
to ICS when it is approved it goes to
service es it is enriched with a node
application an application container
cloud and the result is stored in a
database cloud then we have API is
sitting on top of the so RCS and the
database cloud that will make the
information available to user interfaces
we have a jet portal running on the
container cloud we have data
visualization cloud we have ADF JCS we
have mobile cloud than a mixed up
location visual Builder cloud service
and we use Oracle self-service
integration to also send it out to
social media we use the hello / cloud to
organize the whole workflow around it
and we have our management cloud to do
the monitoring across the entire flow
that's all that's all for the next time
we have a few servers that we will be
adding and especially in the native
container development using functions
stateless service that that's where we
are heading that's where it was headed
yeah that's what we will take it Vantage
shelf yeah I know
Danna low and Sven mentioned that one of
the key differences is I think in that
original presentation where you you
integrated eight or ten services you had
two hours to do that and in this session
yesterday 45 minutes five minutes all
the 45 minutes did it go well you think
some things we did okay and some things
we we need to improve we focused more on
showing what the actual flow looks like
and how the end-users will interact with
each of the cloud services and we didn't
spend any time on the actual
implementation we didn't show code and
we didn't show how to configure
because we didn't really have the time
for that maybe it wasn't the audience
for that as well
the handover between the various
presenters could have been a bit
smoother I think all and all the
audience got the impression and how many
people were involved this time in
preparing well there were five people on
stage and they had on the preparation we
I think we've had at least 10 people in
our various organization as well as in
the Oracle organization so we helped us
set up the services configure them help
us with the administration of the
services and provide other services now
in the the original presentation again
this was the year or so ago that
resulted in an eight-part article series
that you and Atlantica Diekman was
involved and Mark Simpson dorsum and
read Torsten winterberg can we expect an
article to come out of this particular
experience yesterday well we certainly
have gained a lot of experience that
will allow us to extend and extrapolate
from the previous series it sort of
renders the previous series written but
because so much has changed in Oracle
cloud and also in what we did using your
local clout so I think it's probably a
good idea well let's let's talk about
what's changed in the in in the ensuing
but nearly two years since that original
presentation what has changed in the
Oracle cloud we see a move towards more
cloud native on the one hand less need
to use the on-premise products in their
cloud incarnation if you like like
WebLogic so a suite in the cloud it's
much easier more convenient to make use
for example of ICS to make use of Jets
and visual builder so we see more native
power services on one hand and on the
other we see more generic technologies
being supported on the Oracle cloud like
talk in the container cloud like the
various technology
the application container cloud so we
can also expand into technologies that
are closer to heart of a larger
developer community it's tied less into
with typical Oracle stuff if you like
and more with general technologies
that's part of it we used to have quite
a bit of an issue with making the
services talk to each other and to be
honest we even used a few secret
components some of them not even living
on the Oracle cloud because we couldn't
make the services talk to each other
most of them had been resolved and maybe
even as part of our experience and our
feedback to Oracle that may have been
the case so to do actually what we
showed in Valencia but tricked it a
little at that time now it was almost
real there's still a few tricks up ok up
our sleeves but it's definitely the case
that the experience of integrating
services is much better than it was a
year and a half ago you were one of five
experts that I stuffed into my tiny
hotel room at the West has a friend last
night we had a great fun conversation
that will be presented on an upcoming
Oracle developer community podcast so
video that's unfortunate video a couple
of photographs but no video but keep
your eye on the the Oracle developer
blog for information on when that
podcast will be available but the the
ostensibly the topic for that
conversation was the impact of different
trends and technologies over the last 12
months so it seems like we've discussed
all of them going well yet well it went
everywhere but that's a good thing but
from your perspective your personal
perspective as a developer as an
architect what trend or technology had
the greatest impact on your work over
the last 12 months and you ask the same
question yesterday and yes but now we
just get your perspective
there are so many things going on what
one thing is really clear to me is that
a cloud is now beyond its tipping point
and we're before the cloud was for the
innovators that perhaps the early
adopters with it's definitely not for a
larger organization you think adoption
cloud adoption is just explode where two
to three years ago security was a reason
to not go to the cloud today is the
other way around security is one of the
reasons to go to the club those
organizations realize that don't have
the expertise and will never be able to
keep up with all the all the various
threats and all the tech technological
developments to be able to manage
security and our IT challenges
themselves so now security and other
reasons will propel organizations into
the cloud and that's happening today
that's and that's a realization that
came to me of the last few months it's I
didn't see the same thing last year yeah
I was trying to buy into the cloud story
but I wasn't really there yet and the
same applies to many organizations now
it's happening so that's an important
one yeah all the more why actually I was
going to say out of our personal level
but the cloud also changed a lot for me
on a personal level I've got so much
infrastructure and so much fast services
at my fingertips I have a pretty serious
and powerful laptop but they don't
really need it because I do everything
in a browser right and the command line
window
I'm as as ageing all the time I didn't
used to do that so the cloud also made
me into an administrator of my own
environments but a kind of technology
that I can leverage that I can play with
and not just me any small organization
or larger organization without any lead
time if you decide this afternoon I
would like to play with a big data
cluster you can do so and then the stuff
that I really still do on my laptop made
a large change is containers with the
docker
it's so much easier to spin up in an
environment make use of the figurations
of environments that have been prepared
by others for the demo I was doing this
morning I needed a fairly complex
cathcart cluster with a number of
supporting managing services
one of the A's directors guido schmutz
was was kind enough to make available to
me a vacant file and a docker compose
yellow file and that was all I needed I
could run it and all the two legs
started to zoom and whistle on my
machine and the entire complex
environment came into existence the
configuration s-code yeah infrastructure
platform escort as extremely powerful
and when I do presentations or workshops
or community events containers are a
very easy way to to make the environment
available interest that's important want
to if if we can assume again you you
were involved in five sessions here if
we can assume that there is a connecting
thread between all those sessions what
is the key message or key takeaway that
you would want your audience to remember
from those five sessions if they if they
jot one thing down what do you want that
to be at the risk of being repetitive
the one thing that sighs all my sessions
together would have to be cloud and
there was much more than that
architectural details grand visions the
one thing that really returns in each
session was cloud yeah and the
inevitable route to the to the cloud
that organizations are taking the only
way is up is a title I used for one of
my slides that's both for going from
on-premise to the cloud and for moving
up in the stack organizations in five
years time I'm convinced will not do
infrastructure at all there's no reason
to buy our own computers to miniature or
computers but I also think that it will
do much less platform than they do today
why have a DBA to run your own database
what's so special about your database
and where it's an autonomous database
and managed service I don't know exactly
where it's going but I don't think most
organizations that I have DBAs employees
right now will do so in the near future
and that's also going to be the major
change yeah
and for the first time IT is automating
IT that's a new experience yeah yeah
so bring one to a certain extent indeed
indeed you are a prolific blogger on the
the Imus technology blog gives the
people who are watching the URL for that
blog - very simple technology dolt amos
milton l and you are at on twitter at
Lucas Halima yep okay so follow him he
is a wildly prolific blogger and in
great detail writes great stuff pay
attention to what he's saying
if you want more information for
developers
