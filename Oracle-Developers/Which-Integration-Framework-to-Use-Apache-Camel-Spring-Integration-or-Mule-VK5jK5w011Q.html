choice which integration framework to
choose think it's an interesting topic
and I'm glad so many people are here
before I begin I just want to introduce
myself shortly so my name is KY vena I
work for talent it's a company which
offers open source integration solutions
like ESP BPM data quality and so on
and if you have any feedback for this
session you can contact me via email or
via my blog or Twitter or LinkedIn so
I'm really happy and appreciate every
feedback even if you don't like anything
please tell me that would be really cool
okay let's begin with the session of the
content and first let's look at a three
key messages which I have for this
session I usually always start with key
messages what do I want to teach you in
this session and at the end a recap it I
hope you are greeted with it and the
first key message is that you should not
reinvent the integration wheel don't
write a lot of glue code integration
code by yourself use the frameworks and
tools which are built for that
the second key messages there are some
good frameworks and tools for
integration available as you will see
today also in many live demos though
that you can get a feeling for it and
the third key message is often an ESP so
an enterprise service bus is the better
choice so often it's the better solution
for integration problems instead of an
integration framework I will also talk
about that at the end of this session so
let's look at the agenda first I will
talk very shortly about application
generation and integration in general so
why do we need that and what's the
different alternatives and then I will
explain what our integration frame works
at all before I will compare the
different integration frameworks and
solutions especially a spring
integration mule and Apache camera and
also the toolings on top of that from
Chivas and Talon and so on and at the
end I will talk about when to choose an
ESP instead of an integration framework
and also of course I will tell you which
one is the winner which one shall you
use in the future so let's begin with
the first point application integration
though here I just want to recap shortly
and why are we doing all this why are we
here today and the reason is
the IT infrastructure is growing
everywhere it probably doesn't matter
which company work you have different
applications and interfaces and
technologies to use and do to a
service-oriented architectures you of
many services rest and soap and so on
and so you have many many different open
technologies and products and services
which you have to integrate it doesn't
matter if it's a host if it's very old
mainframe stuff if it's client-server
technology and communication if it is
services from a service-oriented
architecture now we also use cloud
services which are everywhere available
and are used in projects more and more
and we also use big data services and
connections and so on so there's a lot
of stuff and heterogeneity which you
have to combine and integrate because it
all has to work together and so what we
have in many situations is the
point-to-point health so one service or
interface communicate so another one and
you write a lot of glue code and it's
very complex to maintain and that's not
really a good solution but I see this
that many customers and many people do
this and the question is so what's the
solution because you can invent the
wheel all the time you so I have seen
this at many projects but it's not a
good idea so do not reinvent the wheel
all the time do not write all the glue
code all the time
so you can write a lot of code always
when you integrate different
technologies and services and so on so
that's how many people do it but that's
not the right solution so the right
solution is what I will show you today
and some of the wishes which
disintegrators have instead of writing
blue code so you want to do standardized
modeling's or you want to do you some
patterns and then tooling for model
modelling all the stuff and of course
the most important thing you want to
realize it efficiently without all the
glue code and so you want to realize
this integration problems easily and in
the end you also want to do it with
automatic testing no that's also
important feature but often it's very
difficult because when you are talking
about integrations you talk about many
different technologies and so
and so on and interfaces and it's really
not that easy to test with unit tests
and so on if you don't use good
frameworks for it so when we're talking
about integration we always have to talk
about the enterprise integration
patterns let's and in the end this book
by Gregor Hoopoe and Bobby Wolfe it's
about ten years old now but it's still
very important and all of these patterns
are still used today and this did not
change the technology's changed there
come new technologies and new services
but the patterns are still are the same
and probably they will not change in the
next 10 or 20 years so if we take a
deeper look at them because they are
really what you need for the integration
problems and there are many different of
these patterns even if you have never
heard of enterprise integration patterns
before you probably have used some of
them before so for example as the filter
pattern or to translate a pattern or a
content-based Rueter so there are many
different patterns and often people just
implement this stuff by themselves
instead of using the frameworks which
already implement these patterns for you
so you don't have to implement this by
yourself
so you should be aware of these patterns
and because with them you can divide a
huge complex integration problem into
many smaller parts and you can reuse
these patterns in many different
integration problems and projects so
let's just look at one example here so
this is really a model of an integration
problem using these integration patterns
and even if you have never seen these
patterns before you can see that they
are really easy to use and you can
divide a huge problem into many smaller
parts with it so in this case I'm
starting on the left and you're reading
from an end point so from gnome doesn't
matter which technology it is in this
case I'm reading from a file directory
and here I get orders in in CSV file and
then I use the enterprise integration
pattern of a transformer I have to
transform this message and then I have
to split this message so I've a CSV file
with many lines and I have to split it
up because I have to process every of
this lines by themselves and then I use
the content-based route a pattern
this pattern decides depending of the
content of the message where to route it
how should it be processed so here you
use an expression or any other condition
to decide it right probably all of you
have even if you've never heard these
patterns you have implemented this stuff
by yourself and if you use the
integration frameworks which I will show
you today they implement these patterns
for you and also the endpoints so that
you can connect to all of these
different technologies and that really
reduces efforts a lot you don't have to
reinvent the wheel all the time and
that's really awesome for integration
projects so let's now look at the
different alternatives for systems
integration for application integration
what different frameworks and tools can
you use so on the left side you can see
the integration frameworks that's what
we are talking about today at most all
most of the time so the frameworks is
really just some libraries that's why
it's named a framework in this case it's
just some Java libraries which you can
add to your project and use them call
their api's and really that it there are
bigger solutions like an enterprise
service bus or an integration suite
that's really M products which you buy
from vendors and where you have many
additional features on top of it with
tooling and so on I will talk at the end
of the talk I will explain you when you
should use an Enterprise Service bus
instead of an framework but the main
focus of this talk is of different
integration frameworks and so let's
begin with them first
so our next point is integration
framework so it just want to explain you
what is it um what's the similarities of
the different frameworks before I really
come to the different products like
spring integration and camera and how I
can you can compare them so I'm let's
again look at this picture and today we
will look at three integration
frameworks um in the end that's the only
ones which are available but I think
that's okay the has no need for ten or
twenty of these frameworks it's better
if there's only one or two or three with
good community and everybody can use
them so um what I will do I have many
different comparison criteria which I
will use today
I will not go through this list yet now
because you will see one after one now
in the comparison and what I will first
do I will talk about the similarities so
no matter which of these different
integration frameworks you use and they
have similarities and let's talk about
them first because I show you also the
differences and the tooling so the first
point is all of these integration
frameworks of a connectivity though they
why were these frameworks built to
integrate different interfaces services
applications legacy applications systems
and so on so all of them are built for
integrating different technologies so
they offer the connectivity you don't
have to use glue code to connect to
every different API like a file like JMS
like FTP or whatever else right so the
connectivity is included in these
integration frameworks and besides the
connectivity that the second part which
you have to do when you integrate
different endpoints and services is the
patterns which you use in the middle
between and consumer endpoint in the
produce endpoints or between two
endpoints you have to do a lot of usage
of patterns like transformation like
filtering like sorting like content
based routing like dynamic routing and
all of that stuff and that is also
implemented by all of the different
integration frameworks so they really
implement these different patterns by
implement this really means it's just a
method call so it's nothing more you
don't have to write a glue code you just
call a method and it does what you
expect of course you have to configure
it like if you call the filter method
you have to write the expression or
condition also of course but you just
have to add a business logic right you
have just trade the expression by the
rest is implemented by the framework
another similarity that's for all of
these um frameworks is they are really
easy to use and oh that's not really a
complex huge product you really just
download them they open source you have
a one-click installer so in five minutes
they are ready they usually have a
simple example where you can start with
and you have documentation Auto getting
started you have one tool and one
roduct and also one runtime no that's
really different when you compare to
bigger projects from IBM and Oracle and
so on there you have many different
products which you need an own
integration project for use all of the
different solutions from one company and
here you have all in one one installer
one runtime one tool one IDE and that
makes it easier not just for development
of these integration solutions but also
for operations for maintainability so
when you go to your administrator and
you have to run it in production it's
much easier if you have just one runtime
which is low memory footprint and so on
then the big ones what's also a
similarity for all of these patterns
they have a domain-specific language
though what does that mean here here I'm
talking about internal domain-specific
languages so really about a coding their
code you write for the integration for a
for a code that's really a
domain-specific language so it's easy to
read and easy to understand as you will
see in the examples later yeah here it's
internal DSL and if you talk about the
ID tech chure it's this is the ID tech
chure of a paycheck camera but the
others are almost the same so it doesn't
matter which of one you look do you have
three different parts of it I'm here on
the left upper side you see the
domain-specific language I will not go
in any detail here but later and the
second part is the enterprise
integration patterns and the third part
is the connectivity so the names are
always different so for example 'uncle
it's a component
I think it's bring integration it's a
connector or anything else all the names
are different but in the end the
concepts are always the same and the
architecture also very important as I
said in the beginning integration
framework it does really mean just on
libraries so you can add these
frameworks to wherever you want you can
deploy it everywhere in the Java
platform so it doesn't matter if you
want to run them a standalone java
application or if you want it within an
application server like websphere or
GlassFish or web container like Tom kite
or Chetty
you can use it in a spring container in
a noise GI container you can deploy it
any cloud so almost everywhere where you
can use Java you can use these
integration frameworks because it's a
low memory footprint it's just an
frameworks which you have to add to your
project and that's it also all of these
frameworks are Enterprise ready though
these frameworks I'm talking about are
all used by several different customers
in production they offer all of the most
important enterprise features like
transactions and concurrency and error
handling monitoring you can use a very
good unit test frameworks for it the
tooling is available and also commercial
support is available for all of the
frameworks I'm talking about today
so that's really enterprise-ready you
can use them in your projects even in
mission-critical production systems also
similarity as you see there's a lot of
similarity between these frameworks and
that's good news I think because all of
them have many advantages and the next
one is that all of them are open-source
if to mention so a spring integration
and apache camel are on the apache
license so that's a very nice license I
think it's not really restrictive you
can do a lot of stuff with it
EULA is P is under common public
attribution license or short sea pearl
this attack licenses are little bit more
restrictive so if you have to look
really at licenses in your project and
you want to use mule you have to really
check out this license probably with
your legal partner to check out if it
works for you
apache license and can be used almost
all time i think also very important for
open source projects unit often
commercial support especially for
integration frameworks that are used in
mission critical systems usually so i'm
here often you need commercial support
and the good news is that commercial
support is available for all of these
frameworks so for spring integration you
have spring sauce which is now part of
pivot all from you'll asp you have new
lease off the window behind it and for
Pecha camera you can choose between MJ
bars part of redhead and you can choose
between of talent that's a company which
driver four so there's commercial
support for all of them available and
also good news there's tooling available
for all of them I will talk a lot about
this later when I show the live demos so
let's keep it here and as you have seen
here that was a lot of similarities
though good news for all of these
frameworks but nevertheless these
frameworks differ in several different
other characteristics and criteria and
so that's what I'm looking next in a
different chapter so again the list of
the different and criteria and I will go
into detail now when I compare the
different frameworks let's begin with
spring integration it's the first one
spring integration is part of the spring
project though if you have you spring in
any other kind of project spring
integrations really similar that's
really cool so if you already know
spring and use it in your projects you
do not need to learn much to your spring
integration because it has the same
concepts like the XML configuration and
the pins and so on that's almost the
same so if you use spring already spring
integration is probably very easy for
you to learn regarding connectivity um
spring integration has many connectors
in the mean time so all different
connectors are available already like as
you can see here list the important ones
like file like HTTP like FTP like web
service with rest and soap and so on and
so the most important ones which use in
many projects are available for spring
integration and in the meantime you also
it's it's very easy to create own
components this was a problem about one
year ago or so and there was no
documentation how do you create own
connectors with spring integration in
the meantime it's integrated into the
tooling and interrelated commentation so
in the meantime it's also easy for
spring integration to create own
connectors so that to remember year
spring integration has several different
important connectors but compared to the
other alternatives as it has not as many
so I'm camel and mule have many other
connectors also to business applications
like Salesforce and a sapiens
oh that's a huge differentiator here
regarding domain-specific languages when
your spring integration you use XML so I
think that's fine for spring because
spring people also you can use
annotations in the meantime but I think
most people with spring use XML for
configuration and so also for spring
integration you use XML you use XML
since the beginning so I think for you
one year or so ask a line in a groovy
DSL is being built at the moment but
that's not really production ready and
and I think nobody use it yet so at the
moment when you wanna your spring
integration use the XML DSL and here's a
code example of the XML DSL and that's a
little bit of my one of the main
problems of spring integration I think
it's not really a PM excel at ESL to be
honest so it's some XML code um but what
I understand when I use a talk about a
DSL is that it's a good readability and
it's easy to understand and you really
easy understand what is happening in
your integration part you will see later
with new land with camel how this should
look like so then you will understand
what I really a DSL means so this in my
opinion is really just an XML
configuration but it's not really a TSL
the same for the Scala DSL for example
or well I think it's some code but it's
not really and yes L so um think about
this later when you see DDS tells of
Mueller and of camel now let's take a
short look at spring integration in the
tooling so I have just downloaded a
current version of the spring to sweet
so it's new name is spring to sweet is
no longer spring sauce because now it's
part of pivotal but it's the spring tool
suite which you use for all of your
spring projects so when you use spring
already then probably it's as I said
very easy for you to also use spring
integration as you can see here's the
project with the spring integration
context XML so it looks like any other
spring project in the end you use pins
and use XML configuration so I think um
that's easy to understand what I said
before that
no real deus Ln my opinion you just
configure some different end points like
in this case I'm reading from a file
directory and then I use a transformer
the transformer is defined at the end in
a beam and after you use the transformer
you use a wire tap in the scepter
that's another enterprise integration
pattern for logging and then you use the
content-based router here again the
names may differ between spring
integration camel and mule but in the
end they implement these integrate
enterprise integration patterns and it's
in the end it's just a method caller in
this case I'd XML at one line of XML
configuration like the wire tap are like
using a transformation or I'm like using
the content-based Rooter which decides
depending of the content in this case of
the header name or whatever and where it
should send the message so is it a CSV
message is it as XML message or is it
another message so that's how you
develop with all of these integration
frameworks you define your route of
integration so you have incoming
messages from an endpoint then you use
the patterns like transformation like
routing like filtering and then you send
it to another endpoint or more endpoints
depending on the content and under the
hood it implements all of the did a glue
code which you would write by yourself
if you do not write any of these
frameworks so it doesn't matter if you
use CSV or if you use a mess or a file
directory you can just and define it as
endpoint here and the integration
framework that's the transformation and
and type conversion and so under the
hood so that's for all of the frameworks
not just for spring integration and you
can also look at a graphical tooling
here it's the integration graph I think
it's a little bit I'm not intuitive to
use that the problem here is that you
cannot just drag and drop as you expect
and because it has really strange
behavior in my opinion
in the other tools as you will see you
drag and drop where you want it and then
you configure it but in this one is
really not that major I would say also
like you can see here with de
content-based Rooter and we had three
outputs of the content-based route with
XML CSV and and CSV and and this design
is not really am beautiful so I would
say it's not really that major yet this
integration graph compared to its
competitors but nevertheless at least um
there is a GUI builder now in the past
there was none and it's fine so if you
use spring in your projects it's really
okay and then you can use and spring
integration because you can learn it
without many efforts because the
concepts under the hood are the same as
in other spring projects and use pins
and so on and some XML and that's it in
the end so um that's it for for spring
integration
I've also for reference just amassed
some screenshots and again the pros and
cons I think I've talked about this um
the good news is it's like the other
spring project it's integrated into the
spring tool suite it's all open source
what's what's not so good is probably
that it's not that intuitive and major
and that were one at a disadvantage
compared to mule and Toto camel with
tellin easy for example is that there's
no graphical mapper
so with the other tools I can show you
you can do graphical mappings and here
this is just not available and it's
really just a framework so if you just
need the integration framework this is
fine for you if you need other parts
like data quality and combination with
ppm and so on then other products might
have more features for you let's take a
look at Mullen xed so if you have heard
about mullah from EULA soft before you
probably know that actually it is
Mueller ESP so you think what's this guy
talking about and money is P as
comparison here to the integration
frameworks and that's right so Mueller
soft is marketing Mueller s ESP just as
ESP because that's how they earn their
money with it but nevertheless you can
also just use the libraries of Mueller
of this is P tool and it's it's a copy
from a screenshot from the home page and
s spring integration and as camera you
can trust at the libraries to really
project and use it encoding without all
this ESP overhead right so you can use
it as integration framework like the
other two others too and this is why I
use it here in the comparison to
regarding connectivity newly SP has many
more connectors than spring integration
and what's probably the most important
part here is that this or it always has
p2p connectors so you can also connect
to s IP and TIBCO and Salesforce and so
on directly and if you have to do this
of course you can also do it for example
to spring integration with web service
connectors or HTTP rest of is
but if you need to connect to these p2p
systems it's much easier this way
because it again reduces efforts a lot
you have to wrote a write less glue code
then with a rest or soap service now
that's really a benefit of mule I think
though yes I think so
as far as I know you can use them for
free the next point is missing OSGi
support or as I said in the beginning
that you can deploy all of these
frameworks everywhere that's truth in
the end but for formula you cannot use
it in combination with OSGi and that was
a decision made by the strategy people
of mule soft and if you want to use OSGi
then you can use spring integration or
camera but you cannot use mule regarding
domain-specific languages nool only has
XML so like spring integration if you
want to use this framework in the end
you have to use XML for your integration
so it nothing about Java coding or so so
you have to write it in XML declaration
but nevertheless and now you'll see what
really when we are talking about
domain-specific languages here you can
see also XML but I think this XML really
is a domain-specific language even if
you have never seen it before you can
probably easily understand what's
happening here so um it's it's not just
important for these basic examples but
even if you have much complex
integration problems if you look at a
complex problem so if spring integration
in my opinion it's really a lot of
effort to understand all of that and to
maintain it we've structured
domain-specific language it's much
easier so here it's it's you can
structure it with tabs and you can just
read what happened what's happening so
here you have a flow and you have a an
incoming order which is a file and then
use the content-based router in this
case it's name is choice right you of
course have to notice before and then
use the when expression when in this
case the payload is an instance of TVD
order then send it to
this file endpoint and then we are done
with this part and another if condition
when and so on and otherwise just locate
for example so if you later and want to
compare it to spring integration you
will see that this really is a
domain-specific language than my
understanding and that helps you a lot
for developing and for maintenance and
for just reading this integration
problem so let's also look at mule a
little bit this is all I show you today
so just the open source versions right
so I've only downloaded a current
version last week and this also is the
open source version which was downloaded
and as you can see here also in the
tooling all of these tools use Eclipse
so it's very easy for getting started if
your charm a developer I think and here
again you have to write um the
integration logic in XML it's almost the
same example as you have seen on a slide
so I won't go into any details what you
you see here for example and that again
is for oil integration frameworks in
this case I'm reading a messages from
JMS instead of file for example your or
I'm sending messages to chain s and that
doesn't matter in the end so you don't
have to write a glue code or a type
conversion and so on that is done by the
framework for you under the hood and now
if you look at a graphical designer
though um that's in my opinion much more
intuitive than the one of spring
integration and it's also much more
stable because I think newly has it
since the beginnings exits is available
and this one really works yet like you
like you expect
let's search if a P for example is
available it find it no but I as you can
see here and so it seems that all of
them are free I'm not really sure about
ASAP connector but I think most of them
at least are free and then you can just
drag and drop them here and as expected
they are here and the visualization is
like you expect it so you can easily
understand what is happening here what's
also a benefit of Muller is that you
also have a graphical mapper so it uses
the OEM version of Java ETL
etl datamapper and it's integrated in
tooling here and do you can do graphical
mappings like you maybe know it from ETL
tools like taliano informatica or so and
here you can do mappings between
incoming and outgoing messages and for
example here you can map between an XML
message and a CSV messages also right so
um you have to define the structure for
example an XML message has a schema and
a CSV message also in some structure and
then you can do graphical mappings here
so if you do not just want to code and
also use not just XML and you want to do
some graphical design and mapping then
as you can see Muller is much stronger
than spring integration here
begin some screenshots here and
regarding the pros and cons I think I
said most of it well maybe one thing
here um so um you need a subscription if
you want to use all features like
monitoring and so on but here they will
remind open source does not mean for
free so that's what many people thought
in the past I think in the meantime most
people understand it also open source
campaign companies have to earn their
money usually their business model is to
offer a free version which you can use
in production like Mueller and like
spring integration and like camel with
talent or chaebols but these companies
want to sell um commercial support and
advanced features because they have to
earn money somehow right so um that just
as a reminder and also I'm very
important to understand again here that
Mueller um is no unified platform though
it doesn't have other features like BPM
or data quality or so so it's really
just newly ESP so just integration
features and the last framework apache
camel so let's compare this to the other
ones from the connectivity part cameron
has by far the most connectors available
i think in the mean time it's about 140
so i'm here you really can connect to
many many different stuff um by default
or you don't have to write your own
connectors or write any glue code and
it's also unlike the other ones it's
very easy to write your own components
and i probably this is the reason why
there are so many components and
connectors available here and you can
also use business connectors here i have
to say and these business connectors are
only available in the talent ESP so they
are not just part of the camel project
but they are part of talent or you
cannot use them with tables for example
and there are also all available in the
open-source version so talent also has
all connectors available in the
open-source version and you can use them
as much as you want
but this is just in the talent tooling
um it's not available in a camel frame
but if you're just using the coding
stuff regarding domain-specific language
and here's one
my favorites wire like cameras how much
besides the XML language you have other
domain-specific languages mainly people
also use a Java language and I really
like it so it has the same functionality
as takes ml language you can choose by
yourself so I know some people which
prefer XML some prefer Java and some
people also use groovy Scala DSL but
probably about 95% use em chavo xml but
the good thing is that you can choose
and if we look at these dsls an example
with xml it's look almost like a mule
example right so it's again a very good
DSL it's easy to read it's easy to write
easy to understand and it's almost the
same like newland so I think test if you
compare it it's almost the same but it's
I'm good because both are very good to
use but the second one here's an example
of the Java DSL and that's my favorite
because I think it's even more easy to
read and it's also much easier to
develop with it because you can use code
completion in your IDE and all that
stuff you can set breakpoints easier and
so so I prefer the Chava DSL from a
functionality perspective you can use
both the same way it doesn't matter in
the end for 99% of use cases and also
what's very important about camera and
that's was also one of the main criteria
I think why many people use camera
because really the community is the best
one so you if you look at mailing list
of forums of blog posts or articles or
conference sessions or whatever so camel
is as the most of them so most people
use camera and most companies use camera
and that's why it has the largest
community of them all so by no question
spring also is probably a much bigger
community than camel but just the road
spring frame but not if you're talking
about spring integration so I don't know
how many people use spring integration
but I'm the community for that it's
definitely much smaller than for camera
and same formula because Mueller if
either you use mule ESP or you don't
and but other people don't care about it
in the end and I think mule is not used
by so many people so let's look at
apache camel a little
first I show you am just a code in the
IDE oh here if IntelliJ and here's one
example of camel I'm here I show you the
Java DSL so as I said it's my favorite
and it's also again very easy to read
even if you have never used it before or
seen it probably understand what's
happening you read in this case again
from a file directory then you do some
custom processing so you also can always
add em custom code to your integration
route so in this case for example I have
written a transformation pin here it's a
Pocho and it just transforms the content
to uppercase but of course here you can
implement very complex integrations and
transformations and afterwards we use
them in the enterprise integration
patterns again so we unmarshal it so
it's a CSV file we have two unmarshal it
it's just a method call the same is
available for XML and for a defect in
whatever so you can use many different
data formats without any coding because
that's all done under the hood by one
method call you can use the splitter
pattern in this case i tokenize via
comma but here you can again use many
different expression languages you can
use here X part you can use groovy or
JavaScript so I think 20 or 25 different
languages are supported here for using
UX for writing the expressions and
conditions so it's nevertheless very
very powerful then I lock it and then I
used a content-based router also in
camel it's a choice a method call and
this looks like newly only here it's in
Java code and as you see it's really
very easy to read and all this stuff is
implemented under the hood so you just
write this code here and that really
runs you have not to write any file
transformation or anything else I can
also prove it for you the same is for
Sprint integration and for a mule and
you also can test it so I have written a
little test here it's really just a unit
test you just have to extend the camel
test support which again extends a unit
and then you can write your unit tests
and I will not go into detail here
because of I have time
oblems then and but it's such a unit
test with the MOX
and you can send messages to all of
these endpoints again it doesn't matter
if you in this case I use file you can
also use the chain as endpoint or the
FTP endpoint or web service endpoint
it's always the same certain types and
concepts and that's the great thing
about camera or the other framework so
if you want one of these integration
frameworks you can integrate all of
these technologies with the same
concepts and now let's run it here's the
integration test it's just a JUnit test
I can run it and it runs and so you can
see it's very easy with all of these
three integration frameworks to test you
integration logic even if you have many
different technologies and data formats
you can use the same concept and also
for unit testing maybe it's called
integration testing of course and no
matter what you name it but you can do a
lot of automatic testing and very easily
on top of that and there's different
tooling as I said kemmal is used by many
companies and two companies and also you
of a commercial tooling for it and
open-source tooling first I want to show
you the tooling of JBoss chaebols
acquired fuser sauce about six month ago
so in the format was fused source on
home company
it was now acquired by che bore Soto now
this is part of che bus and red head and
it's called fuse a IDE or now che Bo's
fuse I think and the tooling looks
almost the same like the others like
newly saw for example so in this case
here you again you have to use the XML
DSL so fuse does only support XML DSL
and you can write the code here and you
can also use the design perspective in
this case it's really very intuitive and
you can drag-and-drop and you can move
the stuff and you just drag-and-drop new
components and endpoints and patterns
and then you double click on it and you
configure it and that's really it that's
very easy and comfortable to use and
that's really nice tooling on top of it
and if you want to use the tables and
stuff then I also can show you a talent
talent uses the Java DSL and you also
see the Java code here but the more
important thing
canister designer and here you can again
drag and drop your stuff from the right
a difference to touch a boss is that you
have the components directly which you
can drag and drop so you have a cxf
component and an FTP and file and so on
and you just configure them here we are
checkboxes with tables you have to write
um the code in a string so I'm like in a
camel root in code you have to write all
in the parameters here usually so it's
not as comfortable but I think it's okay
and you again also drag and drop the
different patterns like the filter and
the splitter and as you can see here for
example for the expressions you can use
many many different expression languages
for the conditions like Ruby Python PHP
XPath and whatever then I use the
content-based router and the good thing
about the tooling here you can also just
click on run and test it and it compiles
the code and runs it you can also you
will also get visual feedback here so
you see that I have 15 files in this
directory
I just filter one of the files I split
every line of this CSV file and then I
routed to different end points depending
of its content in this case in this
example I just use the file connector
some EEP patterns and then I send it to
a log and a processor but here again
with camel and all the other frameworks
you can also use another technology like
chain as like FTP and all the other
connectors which are available it's
always the same concept and you don't
have to write any extra code and so it's
very easy to integrate many different
technologies with this framework without
writing the glue code and what's also
very nice about talent or let's
regarding camel what chavos does not
have is the graphical mappers so you can
also and do graphical mappings and also
again from XML to any other connector it
doesn't matter if it's CSV or if you
want to map directly to ASAP or
Salesforce or whatever and you also can
integrate Java code here if you want so
and you can also add any libraries here
and call your own transformation
mappings and so on so you can always
choose if you write a mapping by code or
if you do it
quickly and as you can see on the right
and here you have your connectors I'm
like as ap or Salesforce or whatever
there is and you can just drag and drop
it and in the end then it doesn't matter
in this case I've implemented a web
service via drag-and-drop but and here I
integrate a CSV file you can see it here
it's a tiff file input delimited that's
the name 4c is being talent but here I
could also read data from Salesforce or
from s AP or from any other connector
which is available in this tooling so
that's really very easy and you still
always use the same concepts so that's
very easy I think to use once again a
recap about the tooling um if you look
at tables first right here tables as I
said chambers acquired fuses or some
month ago and the problem about tables
at the moment I have three esps
so they have to chip or CSP that's the
old one they have to switch here ESP
that's a new one from tables and they
have two chambers fuse that's the one
from fuse the source so at the moment
I'm no one knows which one to use and
which one will be available in the
future so I think that's a little bit of
problem at the moment but probably in
one year or so this will be clarified
which when to use which one or if
there's only one available
and so I'm regarding a shape of fuse
again that is the one which I showed you
the tooling for with camera and I think
I said most of the pros and cons in the
demo so it's very intuitive and
lightweight and open sourced and so on
and the question here is that really
it's an answer your food future so what
happens when switchyard
is production ready so that's a problem
chambers have to solve in the next month
i think but we will see what this will
happen here again you have to pay for
some additional features but open source
does not mean for free and just dumb
facts regarding switchyard that's a new
ESP or integration framework by JBoss
and that's not really production ready
yet but will be soon
and it probably will replace chamber
cSPD
old ESP so it's a it's also a wrapper
around camel and that I did tooling is
not production ready and so on so I
didn't do a demo here so I'm but it
looks as you can see in the screenshot
very similar to the shape of fuse and
tooling and regarding Talon again just
the most important things here and well
it has a very powerful meta and what's
very important with Talon is you can
also combine all of this tooling with
the other features of talent so you can
combine it with the ETL star 50 data
quality stuff with the business process
management tooling of talent so a talent
that's all in one suite so it's all in
one run time on a container when you run
it and also in the IDE it's just one
tool that's a difference compared to the
proprietary vendors like IBM Oracle and
so on so that might also be a
disadvantage a little bit regarding
talent so um it's really telling it's
just a full ESP so if you want to just
use camel the framework and maybe some
modeling tooling and then talent is not
the right right thing because Thailand
has its own container and then you
really have to use all of the features
and used a full tell NTS B which is
nevertheless all open source and but
it's not just the framework then you are
already in the ESP era so the ESP
product yeah now I have shown you I'm
spring integration mule and camera with
chaebols and talent so I hope you've got
a little bit of feeling about how you
develop with these tools and the most
important thing to understand it these
frameworks help you a lot reducing glue
code and effort and so on because of two
things again because of the connectors
to many different technologies and
because it implements the enterprise
integration patterns for you and so
what's the winner
um first I can say all three are the
winner because all are very good
nevertheless um if you have to choose
which one should you take so so my final
conclusion is that use the spring
integration really if you're in spring
projects so then it's really great
because it's really easy to learn for
you and then it's a it's good and it has
the typical connectors like file chain
mess
so web services and if you do not want
to add another framework like camel to
your spring project then you can use
spring integration if you do not have a
spring project I would never think about
using spring integration because camel
is much stronger regarding many things
like connectors like community DSL and
so on mule ESPM should be used if you
some of its p2p connectors which are not
available in any other tooling like
Intel and tooling I think it's only a
part which are only available in mule
and not in talent and also if you really
are sure that you only need the ESP or
integration framework if you need other
stuff like ppm and so on then you
probably are wrong with newly because
mule is just an ESP and in most use
cases in my opinion you really should
use a patchy camera because it has so
many advantages as I've shown you in the
comparison like the most connectors and
like the largest community the good D is
else and you can also choose between XML
and Java and so on so you can really
choose and that was a comparison now I
want to spend some minutes about talking
when should use an integration framework
instead of on ESP so as I said
integration framework is just encoding
it's a small libraries which you add to
your project and so it offers to you
connectivity routing transformation that
stuff you can do and with just an
integration framework and edit your
project with one ESP it offers you a lot
of additional features you can get a lot
of tooling on top of it so as you have
seen for example of talent the code is
generated you can use the graphical
mapping and so on you can use mif not
shown it but you can use features like
monitoring your services prefectly
monitoring administration in a web
interface and also you can get
commercial support what's very important
because in mission critical systems it's
very risky without commercial support in
my opinion and on top of that there's
the integration suite the integrations
we contains usually the ESP but it again
has additional features like you can
combine it with Business Process
Management
our rules and chin or data quality or
whatever this we'd have or should have
and so at different parts so you should
think at the beginning what do we want
to realize and then to unit just a
framework or do you need a real product
like an ESP or our integration suite one
example of a suite is again the Italian
unified platform I mentioned this
because I work for it of course but
there are others from Oracle and IBM and
so on another open source integration
platform which is really all-in-one
platform is MW so2 and that's probably
the only two open-source platforms which
offer all-in-one platform within one IDE
for development and one runtime
container
so let's as I said many other vendors
usually if they are SP vendor they also
offer an integration suite so you can
use all from one vendor you can of
course also combine different products
so I have shown you today the mule for
integration framework OSP you can use
commune de that's a company probably you
don't know it in the US it's important
in Germany in Europe for ppm and you can
use for example open source of info soil
for data quality and so you can also
combine all of these different products
usually I do not recommend recommend it
because you often have problems with it
and I've seen that a lot in projects at
customers because if you have different
products you have to write the glue code
you have to do the testing and impact
fixing and you don't get all of the
support you need because the one window
says I this is the fault of the other
vendor and the other window says the
same so if you want to combine ppm and
ESP does does make the problems right so
that's not that easy thought this is why
I really recommend that you was thinking
about it at beginning at the beginning
do you need trust integration solutions
then thinking about integration
framework or ESP if you really think
about you need more than that
with ppm and so on then you should use a
suite of one window like Thailand like
WI so 2 or the proprietary ones like
Oracle TIBCO IBM and so on so um I hope
the session and what was good for you
and I hope you learned a lot and let's
recap again the three key messages the
first one do not reinvent the
integration we do
right all this glue code all the time
because there are good frameworks and
products on the market which implement
the end points for you the connectors
and the patterns and often nevertheless
a nice piece the better choice with more
tooling with monitoring with management
with commercial support so before
starting your project you should really
think about and do you need just a
framework for coders or do you need
tools for all people and then use a
product for it so that's it for my talk
we have some minutes for questions now
other than questions
the only peg I'm sorry can you come a
bit for
so the question is how do you rate a WI
so to against camel and so on and and
talent exactly exactly so so I think WI
so two is can it's very similar to
Muller and to talent so I think the good
thing of wso two is that it's a unified
platform you can use all of it in one
container in one IDE like also ppm and
on
I think the tooling is not as good as
mule and talent so am I think it's it's
not as good to model and let the code
generated into the mappings that's not
as powerful and intuitive as talent or
moolah I think probably nip ik because
in my opinion and not because of the
runtime but because of the tooling and
also because it open so it's also using
open frame open source frameworks under
the hood so for example Talyn is using
6f and camel and so on and WI so2 is
using I I think not that good or older
ones like I don't know what they use for
web services like X's or so so yeah
using notatum yeah they are not using
the frame the open source framework
which used by other companies they are
probably only using them so in my
opinion they do not use a good
frameworks and a good tooling so I would
choose talent or mula or instead of WI
so true for Chaston ESP but it's also
good open source solution no questions
oh okay other questions yes it's a it's
a no-strike container it's all STI
support it's based on carafe yeah on
cough
the slides mi will download then when
I'm online again and I will Twitter it
with Java one hashtag and then you can
look at it again and you can also write
send me an email if you want them as PDF
or so it's also no question I'm sorry I
don't understand it how do the
Transformers okay
they did the graphical mappings between
mule and camera and and talent right
that's a question the graphical mappers
I'm sorry
well I'd a question is how do you
compare the Transformers out of the box
without graphical tooling I think tear
you you always have to write some code
if you do map business logic right but
in the end you can unmarshal it end so
and out-of-the-box so you click you say
them edit unmarshal it from XML and then
you can use the message and then you
have just to say via an expression use
expose or whatever you do and that's I
think the same I think that doesn't
differ okay a clustering and is in the
end I'm supported by all and I
especially know it for therefore the
camera solutions like a boss and and
talent oh that's always che containers
under the hood and it's case like her
off so you can scale it it's supported
with other features like usually this is
based on zookeeper under the hood so
it's very scalable and it's a very easy
memory footprint so it's easy to use and
to scale and it's case by PI design
usually so I don't know exactly about
about mule but I think it's also almost
the same for what format EDI
in telling you have and you can map it
out of the box and with graphical mapper
to other mappings whatever you want I
don't know exactly which EDI formats are
supported by eighty fact is supported I
don't know it I think there are hundreds
of EDI fact different standards and if
you want to need more details here you
can send me an email but in the end a
defect ends always supported by talent I
don't know by the other ones I know it's
not supported by spring integration but
or by camel so you need either talent I
think new leg could also support I don't
know ok ok so if one more question yes
any non-commercial or the question is
any monitoring tools for camera yes I'm
sorry
yeah but you can you can also use
graphical monitoring for example um
there's hot io that's I'm also built by
James dragon which is the creator of
camel and it's a very cool and
monitoring web application which you can
use it's available since three months or
so it's hot io and that's really cool
for camel and it's also open source yeah
okay thank you a lot for the last people
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
