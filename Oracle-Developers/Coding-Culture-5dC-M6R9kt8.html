we so what we do day in day out is talk
about web frameworks which web framework
should we use we talk about hey which
database would be used abused a sequel
database no sequel database who knows
that so we have the discussion day in
day out and we talk about code how would
you make code better how we can improve
our code all this stuff that's what we
what we talked a in day out and when we
talk about how make our product better
how to make it nice a nice looking nice
out can we make the user experience
better all this stuff but you know what
that's what we what we talkin day in day
out but so these things products
actually they they come and go they can
be so tomorrow we can have a new product
that we want to work on and the old
product is is absolute we don't have to
dupe we have to develop it anymore so
but what is important actually and what
we should care more about these days is
the culture so products come and go but
it's a culture actually that stays at
the end so I want to start with pointing
out what I say you might think it's
profane yeah we know all this stuff's
been we know all this stuff yeah we have
to do that great but sometimes it's a
good reminder to get reminded of how
other companies doing stuff how they how
do they build their culture how do they
they do stuff so just to say that and
also I must say you can take one thing
of the culture but it says it's not
working it's not a good coding culture
you have to have these things in
combination and I'll you will see in my
talk what I mean with that so like every
speaker they want to start with a talk
it's what is culture like every speaker
what you do is you look it up at vika
pedia I did the same thing so i looked
at wikipedia and and sought okay what is
culture and then it's a corporate
culture that's about how we talk
together how we do stuff together how we
celebrate our wins
how we how we go through Christ this is
all the stuff that builds our our
corporate culture and if you read this
article on wikipedia you may have this
in mind here what is culture now it's a
fluffy thing what is that I don't know
it's a rabbit or something I don't know
it's very fluffy you cannot really see
it touch it do you have something in
mind about culture but you don't know so
I thought I start my talk was an example
of a great culture and culture that we
all want to work in it's fun to work
what's that it's a cool silicon well a
startup yay we so Silicon Valley startup
we have two three peoples come together
with a great idea and they have fun
building real stuff so they can they can
make changes very very fast they they
have an idea in the morning and in the
evening they've done it so it's very
very fun to work work with this work
with these people a great idea and they
were but they work very very hard so
work day-in day-out have fun go out on a
Friday night together have beer together
should boost nerf guns all this all this
cool stuff and then they attract
passionate people people that also want
to do a change they want to see their
their ideas come true and this is
working very well in start-up so they
have this great culture of knowing what
the other one is doing and hopping in
and saying are we can do that better
here and better here improving all the
time so great and then the the product
grows the progress and it's a great big
success all of a sudden they have 50
people and they sell a lot of the things
of this product what comes them well
there comes the big Microsoft or IBM or
whatever and buys this one vises start
up and what's with the culture now let's
say direct into IBM or a big
organization and they lose the culture
think this is stupid this is not about
fostering your culture and this talk but
this talk is about fostering college I
want to tell tell the story how we are a
bastion we scaled from two people 12
years ago to 1,000 people right now so
that we
have this this cool culture now in mind
but we all want to work for let's have a
the opposite example the destructive
culture whoo so let me tell you my story
i've been working in a big organization
we have we've been the the web
development team and then there was this
embedded team and once i found we had to
work together because with our web
software we had to control the embedded
suffer i once i found found back in the
embedded surfacer i raised the back in
the back tracker and it's they said oh
we will not do it we will not fix that
back i said why not why would want to
fix it so they said no no no so I talk
to my manager oh they talked to the
manager of the embedded team that talks
to their people they talk back to my
manager but well you know all this stuff
and we had a meeting two weeks after
talking about the sings and they agreed
yet maybe this is this something for you
it's very important so we will do that
in two weeks and I had the software than
one month later so this is really
disruptive it's not about getting fast
forward this is where a destructive
culture that's just one example so but
why are companies are actually still
doing that huh and here I think it's his
fault does anybody know who that is the
man Frederick Winslow Taylor famous for
his Taylorism beginning of last century
he actually made this assembly line
workers so so he said all we want to
treat actually our our workers like
machines so we had very efficient worker
working at this mu line and yeah we have
to have a bitch predictable outcome at
the end we have to know how much cars we
produce televisions whatever we have to
know that so we had this efficient
workers actually Henry Ford once said I
don't want my workers to think but who
should think then somebody has to put
this assembly line together and and then
this workers so they invented the
managers they were supposed to think
they think of every little piece they
doing and somehow I think we still have
this in our companies where the managers
want to take over but luckily times have
changed nowadays
times have changed because work has
changed we're not working at an assembly
line we are knowledge work we have to
think we need more freedom actually so
we we are we have to use our brains and
think we don't go in the morning at
seven o'clock to work and go home at at
five o'clock in the evening and then
stop thinking about work with thinking
all the time about work also people have
changed people have other expectations
now from work they just don't want to
get money they want to see themselves
see the ideas grow and see themselves
also grow companies well I don't say
they they don't change but this is a
slow change this is a slow change so
companies change slowly so to wrap this
up in the past we were a little bit
working like Fred Flintstone here you
know 5pm yabba-dabba-doo the horn blows
down the dinosaur home to Wilma have
some FFF dinner with the family great
now I think we're a little bit more like
The Incredibles yeah we want to see a
difference well our our phone an email
comes in at 9pm yeah we answer that yeah
of course so we're a little bit more
like The Incredibles right now so my
name is when I'm happy working for
atlassian which have a great has a great
culture I think so when I was at work as
an evangelist for for that company I
come from Germany that's because of my
strange accent just to explain it with
that so atlassian um we're bunch of cool
guys and we don't dress up like this all
the time this was our halloween party
and don't know if you can see that this
is our co-founder scott Farquhar dressed
up like Fred Flintstone has nothing to
do with the slide I've shown before is
actually not from the past so but anyway
so let's start start started here so
culture of innovation it's actually if
you talk about innovation it's like this
in a way toward I I mean if we have a
good product maybe we can survive one
two three four years depending on which
when industry we're in but we have to
put innovation or product so how do how
does companies handle that they say to
the people hey go and innovate well that
doesn't doesn't really
that doesn't really work so they say hey
we give you 400 bucks for an innovative
idea that doesn't really motivate people
to submit a innovative idea to the idea
committee that finds out of which which
was just an innovative innovative idea
no it's not innovative now so that
doesn't really motivate people to do to
do innovation so how do you actually
motivate people to do some innovative
stuff so do innovation here how do we
motivate these guys here to do some
innovation so what's that do mistaken
game ah yeah I'll give them just time so
I I think we should give them time to
try out the innovative ideas so we're
doing that actually atlassian to give
people time to work on their innovative
idea we call that ship it days and
stupid days are every quarter we come
together the whole company not only
developers also finance marketing
everyone has has great ideas and they
come together and they brainstorm and
then we start on a thursday thursday
afternoon 3pm we start the ship at eight
the aim of a super day is to ship
something at the end ship your idea that
you have that you came up with the the
three months before or just just the
week before or maybe you didn't have an
innovative idea so you you go to a
project and help help out there and help
help to make this idea come true and at
the end of the tippity I think this is
the most important thing here you show
your innovative idea to the whole
company you show that to the whole
company and and and then we vote for the
winner actually so a ship a day project
can be looked something like this so we
have a product called HipChat and
somebody wrote wrote this here an
automatically translation for HipChat so
you chat in your language and somebody
else gets the message in it in another
language this was not not not not a lot
of coach but it was a great idea to do
that and actually they ship
at the end and show that idea so what do
you get out of the ship a day well what
you get is a working prototype so
something not very nice code it's a
little bit buggy unstable but you show
it it's it's working but more important
you get happy developers at the end
because actually isn't that the reason
why we came developers we want to create
stuff you want to create create some
some stuff here that's the reason why I
actually became a developer I want to
want to make a difference here so happy
developers at the end because you
created your own idea and you see you
show your own idea to the whole company
and can be very proud of that and some
companies say ok innovation we're doing
these innovation departments they care
about innovation I think this is a
stupid idea because this year is
actually innovation for the masses is
for everyone everyone can try out their
innovative five years because innovation
actually can happen to it to anyone at
any time everybody in the company can
have a good idea not just the people in
the innovation department everyone can
have a good idea and try it out and see
if it's really a good idea and if it
sticks so innovation happen they happen
always to just give them the possibility
to grow their innovative ideas the next
thing I want to talk about is happiness
I mean a ship a day makes people are
Alaskan happy to work there heck for 24
hours have not not not not much sleep
but at the end you smile because you
have have shipped your innovative idea
so that makes you happy but what a
company is doing is also a motor
laughing that's also doing is things
like this a special day I have fun was
coke co-workers family and friends day
and then we have team building events we
go river rafting or climbing or stuff
like that and we have our famous and a
fiscal year party and this day at this
time it was games of code it's a throne
so we had with a lot of fun together so
this is this is what what you do what
you get out of these days well you build
relationships you build relationships
with your peers maybe also with other
people in the company
did you get you get to know them so you
build relationships at ease at these
parties or these events and also very
important you learn about the strengths
and weaknesses of you of your coworkers
so you see okay you learn about their
private lives and you learn the strength
and you can use that actually for a
day-to-day work so what we do as I tell
developers is always sprinting with
printing so we have our two weeks prints
or one week Sprint's or three weeks
prints and then we sprinting and what
would do we do at the end of the sprint
we're doing a retrospective we're
looking back and see okay what went good
what what didn't went good what should
we improve and then on to the next print
go back improve on to the next print on
always always like this I think we're
missing something here and I have my
favorite movie is from the from the 80s
and I've seen that 30 or 40 times in the
80s but I love it it's ferris bueller's
day off and first has a very very very
important sentence here he says license
pretty fast if you don't stop and look
around once in a while you could miss it
hey we're doing great stuff why don't we
stop and look back and see oh yeah we
did some awesome stuff here so let's
let's have a party or celebrate
celebrate the team wins don't forget
that for example have a release party
make it make a big party in the evening
invite everyone and have a have a great
party and and show show what you've done
in the last two three weeks three months
whatever or do a team offsite take the
team out for one day and have fun
together if you don't get support from a
management or something it's also
sometimes just baking a cake inviting
people to eat the cake with you and talk
about your your last release or your
your feature you have shipped this great
this is great for software development
teams because we are shipping sinks
constantly and then we can celebrate
these things so that's great for
software developers but we're not just
software developer satellite
we also service teams and what do
service teams do well then answer
support cases and the answer support
cases and yeah so how about what do they
do so our service team actually they
have written down there their own values
here it's like this make the customer
awesome two years ago they brought them
down these are the values we stand
stateful and they have her had a poster
on the wall but over time these various
became a little bit blurry I mean you
see them every day go into the office
and make the customer awesome yeah so
they became blurry they didn't mean
anything anymore for the people so what
they say I mean they meant of course I
meant something but they didn't realize
them anymore so what they did is
actually they said okay good we stop and
celebrate our cultural rockstars people
that went over and beyond that stood up
for this values and say yeah I went over
and beyond it and we celebrate them and
it's just like taking half an hour off
and writing a rep song for somebody who
who did a great job or write poems or
I'll write a song and sing it in the
team meeting
so it's easy like that just to celebrate
just to recognize this is this is great
you did something awesome here because
actually celebrating this this this
small and big wins makes us happier for
one thing but it helps us also to focus
this is important for us this is the
important thing we should capture here
so how happy are you are you happy yeah
good but how's your team to team happy
do you know that really I mean maybe
they say they're happy but do you really
know are they happy so what our company
is doing to measure this they do the
surveys fill it out and tell me how
happy you are once a year so you cannot
react I mean he can be nine or 10 or 11
months unhappy and you realize it is
just after after 11 months so this is
this sucks and it is totally slow so
what we actually developed in a ship it
day is is an app for an ipad it's we
call it the mood app and there's an iPad
at every exit at elysium and you vote or
you say how happy you are so we measure
that you can just go click on on the
smiley and go so we measure how happy
are it is is everybody and what what
what what should we do when the when the
happiness goes down we should talk to
the people so and we adopting these it's
not to borrowing this was after our end
of fiscal year party and everyone was
feeling like the guy on the right end
side happy but not feeling well so and
this is open source so you can download
that I the slides that will be available
afterwards so you don't have to write
that down you can so but we're not the
only company also Spotify for example
measured the happiness of their
employees say and they found out 91%
were happy pretty good number 91 % Wow
let's move on no they said okay let's
let's see what was the rest nine percent
why are there not happy so they they
actually talked to the unhappy people
found some easy to fix stuff and then at
the end ninety-four percent were happy
well you cannot make everyone happy but
at least you know why they are unhappy
very important here but it's not just
about happy days does anyone know what
that is who is pretty bad hot dis crash
so we actually had that for our hosted
environment it was back in the days of
JIRA studio so long time ago but there
was some serious hottest quest so we
were running juris studio on servers
from him from another company they were
hosting it for us they were doing backup
for us so we said please install the
backup good it came back to us and said
sorry the backups they were on the same
hard disk oh my god
so but seriously our customers lost data
they lost data so what we did is to
share the pain so first first thing what
we did with this crisis we took this
seriously so every juror team stopped
totally jub jub amelie the development
so they stop development and said we
have to help this customer was
installing a new new new JIRA it was
bringing them up with their workflows
and some wrote some some plugins that we
could import the email so you get
notification emails if you know JIRA you
get notification emails and they brought
an important that we can get the data
back from emails some customers have
made their own backup so we try to get
them up to speed again but we didn't do
anything upon it so we could easily say
our legal department well it was their
fault doesn't help doesn't help you
should just concentrate on fixing fixing
things here and there was a team flying
to Norway trying trying to trying to
repair the hottest or get the data from
the hard disk again but it's also
important to inform and update the whole
company we world every two days we had
an update what's going on and which
state are we and I wasn't involved in
that I couldn't help I'm just a poor
evangelist traveling around and speaking
so I couldn't help but I met some
customers and they asked where you add
and I could say ok there's a team
already flying to know where we're
trying everything so informant updating
is very very important I've been working
in companies where they said all we have
a serious crisis and then you didn't
hear anything for three months and then
you said ok everything is good now and
after three months I said oh it's not
good it's even worse and well so
informing and updating is very very
important we we win as a team and we
lose as a team but the thing is here if
we go through this crisis together and
come up again and say are we we solved
it this really makes us makes us
stronger it makes us stronger as a team
so the next thing I want to talk about
is balance your passion
why do we got huh I already said that I
code for because I want to create great
software that makes me happy creating
great software makes me happy so what
are the ingredients actually for for
great software let's ask our Swedish
Chef here huh so what do we need for for
making great software well first I think
I need the best tools that money can buy
okay good I need support from the
management I mean I don't want to get I
have a team of 10 and then they say oh
we need five developers for this other
project or I have to get the deadline
out a little bit of one month and I need
support for management they support me
so of course we need some great culture
that was respect and trust that's what
we won't talk about here in this in this
talk and we need like like the Swedish
Chef passionate cooks or passionate
developers if you know the Swedish Chef
maybe passion is not enough maybe we
should add some talent to it so telling
it and passionate passionate developers
so that's it great software was that
ingredients i can write great software
why do we cope creating things makes us
happy there's one thing missing in this
mix and this is the customer and we tend
to forget that we're doing our software
for the customer so great software makes
a customer heck happy that makes me
again happy if i can make great software
for the customer that lost my soft
friend uses my software that makes me
happy at the end so don't forget the
customer have always a customer mind and
we have great customers at atlassian we
have great customers like like Emma mr s
just started was our software she's
she's new she's using confluence and
she's new and just started with it and
she's still figuring out how how she
does shape things so if we design a new
feature dare say anything funny I didn't
realize all right anyway by German
accent
so Emma and and every time we do a
feature for mr a new feature we think
about how will Emma use that how will
how will she use that will she find out
where the feature is we're showing our
now the menu whatever but also we have
another customer or we have more
customers of course we have another
customer called William and William is a
long term user for surfers he's an
confluence administrator he knows
everything about it and he knows every
shortcut so he's he's a he's a really
really power user of confluence so let
me do a feature we also have to think
about how will William use that feature
how will we he use that feature so not
just make the feature for Emma but also
for William so make make make him happy
but said that is this this person's
doesn't exist they are fake make them up
because we use personas so personas are
just representative they don't exist but
they represent a customer different
customers from from atlassian so we have
this personas for example mr and we put
everything we know about mr on carts and
we stick those on Walt's everywhere that
everyone gets reminded here's mr that's
what she's doing give them a little bit
more background so she she she loves
girls geeks he loves facebook world of
warcraft so we get to know em a little
bit better you know what she's doing
privately and so we can we can really
design things for emma that makes her
happy and at atlassian i said we stick
this everywhere you can't escape from
the personas you can't really escape and
people come up with personas new
personas all the time have fun with that
so but the cool thing here is once we
had a we had a photo session so mrs a
nectar obviously so she she's we have an
actor and we had we had to make new new
pictures of emer there was a developer
so we made this in the office and there
was a developer passing by and said oh
look there's Emmer let's ask her and
show her the new feature how should we
use it he didn't really realize that
emma is a persona it doesn't really
exist so very very passionate so be
passionate about your software be
personal what you do you spent eight
hours a day on it and if you're
passionate and do a great product your
product will look like this shiny Wow
looks great everything is nice your
customer loves your product except maybe
one little thing that you want to get
fixed and he asked you hey can we get
this fixed please and you said yeah sure
let me just open open the code and look
inside and it looks like this you not
good not good so if you do just have
your customer in mind that's also not
good so have engineering values we are
engineers so stay up for your values
here and I just just show one two
examples or three examples of it lesson
engineering well use you you might have
your own values here so for example if
you have this code and I've seen that in
every project I don't know people
putting this code in every project gives
a boolean returns a boolean doesn't make
sense but I've seen that actually in
every project i'm pretty sure it's also
somewhere in zero i'm pretty sure that's
a method like this isn't you so of
course you shouldn't do that don't break
crappy code and this is just a stupid
example but you know what I mean don't
write any crappy coat and also if you if
you get asked to do a shortcut to
shortcut make that fast and you know
this will really harm the sore and I
won't have the time to fix that up say
no say no say okay good it will take one
week it will take one week I don't want
to make it faster because that harms the
soft fur so say no if you feel this will
harm the software
don't write crappy coat there's our 11
of our values so now them another funky
another method if you look at this well
it's okay it's good it's a it's an array
and runs through through the fog gets
the entries for transfer of advanced
found someone in the name so it's okay
but if you use Java rate you can do
better you can use the streams use the
streets so looks looks much nicer much
much more concise people can read that
much faster what this code means so
always look for better solutions I told
you I'm German and we just recently had
the world cup and I have to put that
slide in Germany Brazil sorry Brazil oh
well they should one goal afterwards so
it was 71 at the end anyway so you see
the scoreboard here de skoura that
didn't fix on this didn't fit on the
scoreboard so it's grow about would have
been a solution but it's not a good
solution so always always try to find
better ways here talking about better
ways people some some team members they
they are very passionate they're very
intelligent and they love to discuss
things they love to discuss oh let's try
let's try Gradle instead of Mammon yeah
it's very grateful yeah that's good we
have to do that and argue all the time
and say we can do that better we can not
call them the prima donna and the team
so if you have have one like that try to
turn their passion into products that
that's one value of atlassian we try to
turn our passion into products not just
getting getting doing discussions like
this this is a discussion around around
color code here which color code reviews
is it in design guidelines no it's not
it's an exception yadda yadda yadda if
your discussion feckless that's going on
like this you should turn your passion
into into products that's that's another
atlassian engineering well you and I've
seen that also another in a lot of
projects this one here my web framework
for people writing their own web
framework
you should always always balance your
architecture architectural design was
getting things done you want to get
things done we got paid for it from our
customers not for a great architecture
we were getting paid for getting things
done of course think about your
architecture but try to get things done
also if you if you this will be done
2015 and also if you if you design your
your web server and you design it for
400 concurrent users it will handle for
incongruent views but you let us have 10
users that use your software that's over
designed balance your architecture with
getting things done there it's not
important what I just set here what our
values are it's important for you what
your values are and to write them down
and have them there and say if you have
a endless discussion around around
around code say hey we should we should
get stuff down here we should balance
balance turn our passion into the
products that's it or if you've right
crappy code or see crappy code say hey
we have this value don't write crabby
code so don't do it very important so
but it's about balancing your passion we
are passionate developers but we
shouldn't forget our customers always
about about that all right culture of
being one T so team size natural natural
team size is 1212 its natural team size
that's actually the size of a team when
we're back in the Stone Age handing the
mehmood we were around 12 12 people
doing that so that seems to be a natural
team size next number 150 150 is done
brush number so dumb verse number tells
us how many stable relationships we can
maintain so what is the company's grow
above this 150 number they get anonymous
anonymous workplaces you don't know
anyone anymore well that's not true but
what you get is actually 0 and 150 is
just an approximately number so it can
be 120 200 just just somewhere in that
area but what you get if you go over
denver's number is
we have the silo problem so different
people with different opinions and
density are we working here we have our
opinions we are the cool gang and this
is the other gang we don't like so you
get Silas problems like like this one
here the legal department and the
developer are people so if you have say
to the legal department oh we have found
this great library we have to use that
open source license and the legal
department says no you cannot use and
say odd now we need to use it otherwise
we cannot go on with our project no you
cannot use it so that's that's a typical
thing for for Silas here we should bring
these people together and sometimes it's
it's like you have this discussion
around on an email saying hey legal can
we get these these open source license
can we use that and you have this
anonymous person in mind but sometimes
it's easy like just giving them a
picture say oh this legal person he he
actually looks okay he's smiling
actually he's a nice nice person so
maybe I just walked over and have a nice
conversation with him and maybe
understands me and I understand him a
little bit better so we get to we have
to bring these people together so what
we do atlassian is before the first day
of the first week when we start we have
to ride an introductory blog post so
this is Benjamin's blog post here now he
introduces himself saying hey I'm the
new guy I'm Benjamin and then he rides a
little bit about this private stuff
shares a video of him and then we can we
can say hey welcome welcome to a lesson
and start a conversation here we can all
we see all your playing you playing
soccer so let's let's we have this
soccer team here atlassian so let's
let's play soccer together so coming
together and and and and bringing people
together it's about making people
transparent I mean we should make our
work transparent ever seen transparent
that's what we do at lse with an open
company we share everything we share our
wins we share all fails we share our
decisions and we share our questions
that we have so our wins for example
here we we wrote a blog post our design
team wrote a blog post that they want to
design about great
share this with the company that's
that's good or we doing twenty percent
time at a less and so we can use twenty
percent of our time to work on our own
projects and this blood process about
why it's a broken and and and the
important thing is here how can we fix
that to start a discussion with the rest
of the company how can we fix the twenty
percent time how can we make that
experience better and we have the for
example we have discussion things like
our technical factoring proposals that
we put on here and say oh yeah this our
proposal and people can can discuss that
in the comments and at the end we have
an agreement this is how we do technical
refactoring so and then we share our
questions so if someone has a questions
I want to make make make a point here
why what can we do to stop the culture
of coming sick to work things like that
we're sharing our questions and get them
answered from the from the whole company
and get everyone's opinion in that so we
are very transparent with with
everything and when you're transparent
you should know your transparency
enemies so what are your transparency
enemies here it's the phone who think
that we discuss on the phone nobody else
knows it's just us or between between
the two two of us so email well it's
electronic format so somehow it's it's
transparent but it's not really
transparent because it's buried
somewhere in my inbox and also the
watercooler also transparency enemy if
you make this discussions or decisions
at the watercooler nobody else can see
that so be transparent and what we found
out to be transparent and to cut down
actually our email and we I think we
didn't use phone before that but cut
down our email users was using a Chet
Chet has really kept down my email
around internal email i think around
sixty percent so we have a chat room for
for the team so every team has its own
chat room it's very easy to create a new
chat room create your own chat room if
you just three persons want to come
together discussion create a chat room
invite the people you're there
and every team has a chat room and the
good thing is we can reconnect
afterwards so if you have been in a
meeting the team has been chatting I can
I can reconnect there's a whole history
of Chet I can watch that and see that
afterwards or if I'm if I'm traveling in
another time zone I can see what the
what the team has discussed there so I
can see the whole whole history and we
connect our systems to chat so we get
notifications for when the build server
failed we get notifications when our
production system is down and we can hop
in there in the chat directly and say
hey Thomas can you fix that fast please
so in Thomas Thomas get notified we
mentioned him you get notified to get a
notification and and can jump in and fix
the thing so we have integrations we can
deploy directly from from the chat we
can say who what deploy and it's going
out and check can actually connect the
whole organization the whole
organization we connect the whole
organization with said I can I can just
open a chat with with everyone within
the company everyone is this in there
and I can open it a chat chat there and
we have have chat rooms that are not
just team specific that are also
interest specifically here's our
football so for you in America soccer
chat room so they talk about when they
should meet and then they also share fun
things around the world cup stuff like
that so this is actually this is all all
very very transparent here and
transparency brings people together it
brings the remote people with the office
people together I'm a remote worker and
I love chat just to just to just just
just to keep up what what they're doing
and I love gotta love our our confluence
instance but because we share their
everything and it brings time zones
together so we can have a discussion
around the world in 24 hours everyone
can comment on a blog post and then we
we have a discussion in 24 hours we
don't have to meet in a meeting we can
just comment on this post and it brings
tears here okies down I can comment on a
post from a CFO and he can comment on my
post no problem transparency actually
helps us also to spread our culture to
the to the organization
talking about transparency transparency
when we think about transparency what a
lot of people think it's very
transparent is we have to discuss these
things so what do we do ah let's invite
this guy this guy this guy this guy this
he has an opinion too and here's an
opinion let's have a meeting Oh No very
transparent I mean we're sharing
everything and we're sitting in one room
virgin sperm but we all know we have way
too many meetings so just a few things
where we cut down on meetings is we
inviting less people obvious things yeah
less people in a meeting but some people
just just have a five minutes lot of
their interest or just have to know
stuff that has been discussed so we
invite less people to eat two meetings
and then we brought our meeting notes
down I think like every company is doing
but what we do is actually we have
discussions at the end so it's a living
document so we can at weekend we can
discuss things that have been discussed
in the meeting even though I haven't
been in the meeting so I can i can jump
into the conversation here and do it as
in Cronus Lee so I don't have to be in
the meeting Paul Graham once once once
brought a brilliant blog post about
having having a maker schedule because
when we're doing coding and
concentrating stuff we on our magus
schedule and having a manager schedule
where we answer emails and all this
managers stuff so dividing your your
your your schedule into a miniature and
make us schedule is also a good good
advice here just to say in the morning
I'm on my Maker schedule I don't do any
managing stuff so I don't don't don't go
to meetings what we what we currently
currently experimenting with is informal
meeting schedule so this means actually
we have reserved a time from two to four
on thursday afternoons where we don't
not allow to schedule any meetings but
nobody is actually allowed to do some
very serious work because we can walk
around with an elation and just talk to
each other so this is informal meeting
sometimes you just want to have in one
on one and have a conversation about
things this is the time
to do that and everyone is okay with it
get disturbed there's no disturbing
because nobody's everyone is awaiting
some to talk to someone else so informal
meeting schedule let's scale scale the
culture 12 12 I said is the natural team
size atlassian we are six to eight
people in our program our teams so
sometimes sometimes less actually but
six to eight that that's the size of our
program of course we have a
cross-functional team so we have a
designer QA people in a team and the
next print maybe designer is moving to
another team we don't need him in that
team because we have a developer with
with with good design skills in that
team and we can we can move them to
another team but this developer maybe
have questions so it's no problem to
connect again to the design and maybe he
can work for one day in the other team
too so this is a process here and and
then your product grows and you need
more teams working on the same product
so how do you do that some companies and
I think this seems to be a natural
growing size that you put specialists
and teams so you have the front-end
specialist the performance specialist
and the database specialist we think
this is this is not a good idea to do
that because actually if you have a
feature it runs over over every every
group Ian actually we had coordination
problems so we have to coral coordinate
somehow this teams and this is not this
is not an easy task this is overhead and
people are missing the customer
relations so if you if you work in the
database team we don't have a persona
that says I want an awesome database I
want an awesome database I want a fast
database no persona said that they want
a fast application but not a fast
database so you're missing the some
teams will miss the customer relation
here so we we avoid that putting the
JavaScript developers in the front end
teams the Java Enterprise developers and
the performance teams and the database
people in the database team we actually
have themes so we have a theme team like
easy start start easily was confluence
that's that's their focus so they they
make
saying every feature to make it easier
for people to start with confluence we
have a team that cares about our big
customers our enterprise customers so
they do things like the performance make
that bigger better for bigger instances
and how can we handle 1,000 people 1,000
users in the administration stuff like
that and then we have a team that cares
about the developer so the better
integration between zero and confluence
they care about that so said that is
teams these teams can run autonomous so
they are really autonomous so one team
uses two lakes the other two don't team
don't use a tool at all they are free
for that if if it just if it don't don't
overlap here and then also meetings we
don't have something like everyone is
doing is everyone has to do a stand-up
some some teams do that some people some
teams just meet when necessary so teams
are autonomous but this is an easy thing
isn't it I mean autonomy now everyone
can run but sometimes you actually need
support from another team how do we do
that so you can go to the other team
that maybe owns the mobile space or I
don't know and go to the to the team
manager and ask him hey can we please
get support for your team from your team
the team manager says yeah of course
we're cool cool company we're cool team
you can't have that but you have to wait
two sprints because we have other
priorities boom yeah this is how it goes
so just three words for that just do it
just do it so we can we can we can go in
there code even though there is no their
code but we can go into that code and
just change it we just do it we call
that a democracy so do our democracy is
actually built on autonomous teams and
we trust each other that we don't
things up we trust each other that we do
the right thing so very easy well you
might say now all you're running around
and this is chaotic and
stuff like that and if you're a company
like a lesson with 1000 people and and
400 developers who that that seems like
chaos here okay maybe so we are adding
actually transparency to the mix so we
are also transparent so when we get a
feature we want to develop a feature
that maybe involve some other teams
we're sharing that so this is for
example our page layout we are sharing
we did a new page layout with confluence
and we share that this is our
specification and then we can we share
that with with the rest of the teams and
maybe the enterprise team has to say
something about it maybe not but a lot
of people have to have something to say
about it as it looks like and also
people that have nothing to do with
development can can get their opinion in
so we are a transparent process here and
then you can you can you can change the
code from other people even though
there's nothing like other people's code
I mean but sometimes they they actually
have written the code they own it maybe
not not really but you feel like their
own it how do you how do you make sure
that you don't don't do anything don't
harm the coat or don't do anything
stupid with a coat doing code reviews of
course but who should you invite for the
code reviews should be who do you invite
for the code reviews that's that's
that's a question here who's the best to
tend to do the code reviews with we
actually have written a plugin for that
so we look we use git and this is an
extension for stash I'll git repository
mentor and there isn't something they
feature now called auto-suggest
reviewers it's a plugin and they get
suggested based on what they if they
previously change the file if the
original author of the file so they are
the best people they know the code very
very well they are the best people to
review the code so said that is our our
democracy gives us a light weight
control here and that helps us to scale
scale teams and by keeping the
developments speed that's very important
for us a very important thing if your
scale is if you got if you got new
people how do you make them
how to make sure that that new people
fit into your already existing culture
this is a very very important thing if
we talk about culture here so just 111
very very simple advice be picky be
careful who you take inspect your
candidates very very carefully think of
a lesson you have to run through seven
minimum seven interviews so we are we're
picking our staff very very carefully so
if they are good at programming have a
good experience a passionate and then we
have something we call the beer test I
can say that in Australia maybe that's
that we're doing the beer test I call it
here now the pavement test so the beer
test would be you imagine if you would
go out with this this this person on a
Friday evening and have a beer was with
him or her together now the pavement
test is actually quite the same way so
you walk walk on the pavement and you
see through the Kenny debt and will you
are you happy to see see him or her and
have a chat with him or her or do you
want to want to move sides and and and
go to the other side of the pavement and
avoid talking to him or so this is our
pavement test and if people fail that
the pavement test well that's definitely
a no higher on the other side if they if
they have good programming skills are
passionate have have passed the pavement
test but lacks experience well we can
give them experience come on it's
definitely higher for us we're looking
more like for soft skills but and then
you get hired from atlassian great and
in we have a very very strong culture
with where we're passionate people and
opinionated people sometimes it's if you
start in a new company it's hard you're
staying there at the side the cool guys
are playing how can I get into this this
already strong culture so what we do is
actually we give every new employee
adolescent a body a note Oh atlassian
guys five years atlassian experience
he knows everyone at Alaskan so he can
point you out point you into that
direction if your if you have questions
or bring you bring bring you with him on
a Friday evening when they when the
other people goes out so you get in you
get easier into the into the culture
from atlassian and also what we do is we
drive the beer bike a beer break is a
the bike with beer inside and we do that
on a Friday afternoon here in the San
Francisco office new people have to
write the bike and give handout beer and
chat to people and get to know each
other better get a personal relationship
to the other people so also very very
very it's very efficient for our culture
here so talking about the first day at
work what do you get to the first day of
work well you get a desk and of course
the computer and then maybe you talked
to one guy for three hours and your head
explodes afterwards because everything
is new and then I say now do some
awesome stuff goodbye what I think which
is okay because we're trying things out
then we're trying things out and we
learn from our mistakes can be hard
sometimes I agree can be hard but what
we want to speed that experience a
little bit up so what what every alessia
not new atlassian have to do when they
start is to do a boot camp to run
through boot camp so a boot camp is in
the first runs in the first weeks all
the boot camp classes are organized by
atlassian so you you get lessons so for
example how to think like a designer so
you get get to see how we do stuff
design stuff at alas yen stuff like that
so this is our boot camp and you have
two runs through the boot camp and then
these are our lessons you can pick
lessons if you want or your manager
chooses lessons that are very important
for you but you also you should should
should have lessons about thinking like
a like a marketing guy that you
understand the marketing department so
you get fast faster into the
organization and fasten to the
culture of the organization and this
these lessons runs in the morning and in
the afternoon you go to your to your
normal work to your team so culture wrap
this up here so we have been talking
about these stuff here have the customer
mind talking a little bit about
transparency autonomy and trust balance
your passion be one team great isn't it
but isn't it still fluffy I mean this is
Gina just fluffy think be transparent
trust whoo it's still fluffy but it's
alive and I tell you the culture that we
have now atlassian with 1000 people is
not the same culture when i started at
Alaskan and then we were 300 people or
when Mike and Scott started our last
time is two people it's not the same
culture it's different but it is somehow
in the same we keep the culture in the
same direction this is very important
for us so we we actually found sticky
names for these things so we said this
is important for us and we want to
capture that this is already inside
their lesson culture we want to capture
that so we don't say transparency we say
open company no Oh autonomy and
trust we call that hey be the change you
seek being self you change or play as a
team very sticky or Bell built with hard
and balance and don't put the customer
and these are our values at a less and
every company has values but these are
very sticky values and you can go around
go to the Atlantean boost and ask every
Alessi and there are what are the five
players and they can tell you that from
the top of their hands these are very
very important for us these value and
they belong together we had currently
had a discussion around open company no
 because we were discussing and
ranting on people this is not cool
there's not cool with this doesn't play
together with play as a team so these
values belong together very important
because there is actually gives you
gives your culture more stability your
culture will change sure but it gives
you a culture more stability and remind
people of the values these are hanging
in the ceiling of the in the kitchen
here in the San Francisco office of
atlassian so everyone gets reminded
every day of the ls Ian values every
good good talks stops with one more
thing there's one more thing here it's
not a not another watch that I'm gonna
announce atlassian watch would be cool
jira ticket done anyway um so one more
thing and it actually is steve jobs here
so Steve Jobs once announced ping very
proud and I bet there were a lot of
teams working on making ping awesome
putting it in I too and so it was a
social network for music putting it in
iTunes and West ping now it's gone they
removed it from itunes again because
products come and go and tomorrow there
may be a killer giro app killer dia and
we were out of the market it can't
happen I don't hope so and I don't think
so because this it kicks ass at the
moment so but it can happen so actually
products actually they they come and go
but it's a culture that stays at the end
I think we can build the next great
thing at a lesson because we have a
great culture and we are very passionate
people so we can build the next big
thing with with our with our employees
so products can go cultural stays thank
you very much thanks for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
