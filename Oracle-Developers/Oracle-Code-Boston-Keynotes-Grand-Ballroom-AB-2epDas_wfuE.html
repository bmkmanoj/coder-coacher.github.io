within a team I think Eunice you have to
persevere you can't get enough to
understand the logic of the college of
empathy for their users posting as
patients likes to solve riddles a good
quarter is the mobile game think clearly
and implement their idea into ten years
ago we're cutting for computers but now
everything is a computer a lot of the
redundant indeterministic we do as the
developer will be taken over by these
automated processes things like human
brain interfaces and machine learning
and neural networks potentially a new
language that doesn't even exist yet
she'll believe we have a bright future
despite self-driving cars and artificial
intelligence interacting with our
keyboard last layout I think we're gonna
see a lot more voice interaction with
devices hopefully not computers coding
themselves this would be like how it's
called the singularity right eye code
because I love it for me it's like a
brain puzzle because I'm a builder and I
I ran out of Lego bricks there's a lot
of creative juices that flow when I
write for because a lot make a big

hey good morning everyone and welcome to
Oracle code Boston it's great to be here
with you today it's not actually sunny
now I was here for the the marathon
yesterday where it was bitterly cold but
I'm glad to see the Sun is out in
shining so this is our premier developer
event series welcome to Oracle code
Boston this is the 27th event that we've
been running around the world over the
last 14 months or so
and we're really happy to have you here
today we've got a lot of great content
to cover today spanning machine learning
and AI containers micro services and
chatbots blockchain of course databases
java devops low code platforms we run
the interesting technologies and you'll
hear from a lot of interesting speakers
from Oracle and also outside of Oracle
in the community as well there's also a
great exhibit area that liked it
actually to see some interesting demos
we've got a IOT beer set up out there
we've got a number of hands-on
activities as well so please check out
the demos when you're when you get a
chance if you'd like to follow along
with schedule today I encourage you to
download this app from the App Store or
the Google Play Store and you can follow
along you can search for Oracle code
Boston you can get the schedule right on
your on your phone if you're into social
media please follow us at Oracle devs
and if you have any tweets please use
the hashtag Oracle code so without any
further ado I'd like to introduce our
first speaker today ken cousin is a
noted expert in Java
he's a job a champion he's a developer
champion in Oracle and he's written a
number of books about Java
groovy Grails a number of Java related
topics and he's here to talk to you
about the the past present and future of
Java can a warm round of applause for
Ken
thank you first of all the the app works
I got a notification that I should come
to this keynote so that was good
planning thank you so any rate the the
name of this talk is tales from the jar
side it's a little different than what I
normally do it's not a highly technical
talk or anything like that it's actually
much more personal I'm gonna be talking
more about my own history with Java just
as was mentioned I've written a couple
of books but in case you want to get in
touch with me or anything there's my
email address homepage blog Twitter
handle feel free to contact me however
you like my most recent book is this one
called modern Java recipes from O'Reilly
and I brought a few copies to give away
I also have put together a nice little
random number generator to pick who to
give them to using Jay shell so I needed
an excuse to use Jay shell and I found
one so that's good also if you have a
Safari account if you have the Safari
Books online account I have a whole
bunch of videos out there and teach
training classes and everything ok
that's about all the self marketing I
can stomach let's move on I was a career
changer I didn't do anything in IT for a
long time when I first got in I liked
many IT people I came from another field
I was in engineering actually so this
was a long time ago this was back in the
80s and 90s so I was in mechanical
engineering and mathematics and then
eventually went to aerospace engineering
and wound up getting a PhD and
everything in there so that meant now I
was never the sort of person to take
things apart and put them together so
it's always a running gag in my family
that I was in engineering at all they
the goal was always to do something
computer related so there's gonna be
lots of math and software involved so
eventually the plan was to be a
professor and unfortunately that didn't
work out
or at least I thought at the time
unfortunately I'd know better now
because the academic market pretty much
collapsed if you know any postdocs if
you know any people in the academic
Abbar environment you know this it's
been very very difficult for them but I
my advisor was a an assistant professor
and he didn't get tenure and I saw what
that was like and I thought well I don't
want to do that so I went to an
industrial research lab in Connecticut
actually so I'm not exactly local but
relatively Connecticut of course as you
are well aware is basically half Red Sox
and half Yankees you know half Patriots
half John I am comfortably on the Red
Sox side so that's good it's easy to be
a Red Sox fan here everybody's a Red Sox
fan I'm on the front lines ok I mean
I'll go into a department store and
there's a table it's got half Red Sox
shirts and half Yankee shirts and how do
you knock over half a display it's not
so easy you know any rate so I went to
United Technologies and I was doing
research at the time UTC is the parent
company at the time it was this
collection of companies Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney
aircraft engines course kala copters
that was the aerospace stuff and then
the Otis elevators and carrier Air
conditioners were on the commercial side
and there were NASA contracts and things
like that and my area for a long time
was the Aero acoustics of jet engines
which sounded really cool no pun
intended
actually that was a good one never mind
but that meant lots of math and
unfortunately my programming language at
the time was Fortran the nightmares have
ended but it took a while I used to
think off by one error was my middle
name any rate I actually went online and
I found an old paper I'd worked on or
NASA contractor report and I was tempted
to actually show you a piece of it and
then I looked at it and I can't read it
anymore I have no idea what's in there I
imagine I knew it one time but it's been
so long since any of that happen so at
any rate I tried to transition from
Fortran to Java this is when Java first
came out the mid-90s and I had to make
the object-oriented leap at that point
and Bruce Echols thinking in Java was
really the most
book for me at the time so that was that
was the first edition of that book of
course there's been four editions and
they could really use a fit just makes
me feel old eventually at the research
center I joined an AI group nowadays
that would be really hot and I would get
this huge race and everything would be
very impressive we worked on neural
networks and genetic algorithms at the
time it was kind of an afterthought
neural networks hadn't panned out
genetic algorithms were just another
optimization mechanism so it's not as
cool as it was then but that's what put
me in the IT field and told me that 10
to 15 years of coding and Fortran hadn't
really taught me anything about software
development so I had to go back to
school at that point to go get a degree
in computer science now one of the
things I worked on is I was looking for
excuses to use Java you know I I'd
learned it but I didn't really have a
lot of experience with it and one of the
things that came up at the time was this
idea of doing elevator failure
predictions they the oldest people were
collecting lots and lots of statistics
on the behavior of elevators and there
were people who had a math background in
the research center who had done lots of
statistical algorithms and analyses and
I had this ridiculous idea of putting a
java swing GUI on top of a Fortran
program and it was an adventure just by
the way the files were considered huge
at the time there were six gigs of data
you know if you could imagine something
so massive three lessons from that
project don't do that I assume I'm the
only person here has ever put a Java GUI
on top of a Fortran program now now that
I said that is that true has anybody
ever done that if you have my
condolences you know so don't do that I
mean it J&amp;amp;I turns out to be a thing you
know it did work but it was the seed of
Fortran bridge that was the complicated
one because they you know they they
viewed the order of arrays differently
and it was all the little endian and
big-endian stuff and I can say this it
did work on my machine
eventually I never was able to port it
anywhere but it did work I was able to
put buttons and knobs and sliders and
get everything to work so that was fun
but as I say I realized that spending
all that time it could in a related
field had not really taught me about
software development and in fact in
Fortran they often advocated as good
practices things that we now know would
be really horrible common blocks if
you've ever heard of them in Fortran the
idea is to have shared data that goes
across many many different files
different procedures and everything and
this of course we now know is the exact
opposite of what we should be doing you
know and that was a recommended practice
I also realized that when I worked in a
field that they called computational
fluid dynamics I worked on programs that
had I don't know 50 60 thousand lines of
Fortran and looking back on it I don't
remember ever seeing anything that I
could legitimately call a test case we
save data and we'd look at it and we
made lots of pretty pictures but was
there ever an actual test to say let's
prove this is right and something
automated and something working and of
course that never happened so any rate I
went back to school and I got the
master's in computer science and of
course I didn't have a huge number of
lines of code to point to as experience
so I went and got the original son
certified Java developer certification
taking a test there and of course I have
to give credit to Kathy Sierra you know
that this is before she wrote the head
first Java book with Bert Bates she is
one of the cofounders of that Java ranch
site which is a certification prep site
it's still going still has a pretty good
forum for questions and everything and I
spent a lot of time there and got the
certification now this was the spring of
2000 so the the bubble had burst but we
didn't know it yet I mean Enron wasn't
going to collapse until Oh probably
another six months and things were
already headed down but we didn't know
so suddenly I had options I'd never I
hadn't had options for my career for
many many years and this was really
enjoyable and I decided that instead of
becoming an active developer I would go
teach technical training classes which
was actually the part about being
professor that I had been attracted to
in the first place I had always wanted
to do that sort of thing was my what I
I wanted was to learn new things and
then tell everybody about it you know I
really enjoy that part of it and that
gave me a chance to do to follow that
passion there so at the beginning I
taught lots and lots of intro Java
classes and probably in 2000 2001 I
probably taught an intro Java class a
month you know and learned a lot in the
process of course if you really want to
learn something try teaching it and
dealing with the questions that come
from that it's a really hones in on
exactly where the gaps are in your
knowledge and of course again I was
always looking for an excuse to write
code to support that effort so one of
the things I wrote at the time was an
applet you know it's it's still
bittersweet to me that applets are now
going away but I tried to recreate this
and that's so many hard drive crashes
ago I can't even tell you
but I'd managed to port the idea over to
a swing you I so this is the code and
IntelliJ and I just want to show you
that I basically have a class here that
is gonna extend jpanel and I've got all
this and I'll just run it just to give
you an idea what this looks like
so the idea was is that at when it was
an applet the students would all load a
page that had the applet embedded in it
and it looks something like this and you
can see this would just pick from a
random list of terms because the hard
part in an intro java class was teaching
object-oriented programming and the
terminology was such a burden you know
such a barrier to understanding and each
time somebody heard a clattering class
they would click on it on their machine
and I also did this of course if you
think I actually googled the windows 3.1
to das sound yes you're exactly right
you know I did and I even built in a
little restart and everything and
honestly now when I revisited it when I
rebuilt it just more or less prayer
preparing for this talk I have it in a
github repository now I'll show you a
link to that later if you like and it's
got a Gradle build file and in fact you
can run it from Gradle or you it also
generates an executable jar file so that
if you just want to double click on the
jar file that runs to so you're welcome
to well that or anything that I'm
to show you you're more than welcome to
so that was just an excuse for me to
play around with a lot of these things I
get to there's a picture of it of course
I got to play with swing I got to work
with the Collections API loaded
resources like that wav file you heard
in everything and it was a nice learning
experience it was something that the
students could do in class and of course
I always told them they'd win fabulous
prizes though at the time my fabulous
prizes were wild cherry lifesavers
you know that seemed to be a good
approach so any rate that was one thing
I did back then but the one that I'd
used the most for many years was this
thing I called Jeff ergo II which was
desperately trying to avoid the
copyright infringement or is that
trademark infringement I'm not exactly
sure which but either way it's a
jeopardy game obviously and at the time
the build tool of choice this is the
late 90s early 2000s we were still
pretty much using ant at this point and
basically I'd seen somebody put a game
board in front of the screen and just
had people raise their hands and I
thought well wait a minute Jabba's god
are a my I could build an app so that
the students could click on a button and
have it take control of the game board
and just have our am i operating inside
a classroom and use a database for the
questions and all that stuff and of
course I was operating on Windows at the
time so the database was a using
Microsoft Access so I could go into a
classroom and just set up the good old
dreaded JDBC ODBC connection that way if
you remember all that horror and the one
cut the concession I made - not
embarrassing people as I made it so the
scores were kept by team so it didn't
matter who answered the question as the
scores went up and down based on the
group of people you were in now to give
me an idea what this looked like let's
see this is here it is this is the
Jeopardy game and I'm going to start it
up here and then I'll I actually I can't
believe it I again this was so many hard
drive crashes ago but it turned out I
emailed the jar file to a friend in the
early 90s and when I did that I found
the jar file now this
it's not in my github repository because
it's it's far too embarrassing at this
point I really have to clean it up
before it's ready yet but I get the
categories out of a database it lists a
bunch of categories I'll just select
four was always a nice number and create
the gameboard this way and that's what
the game board looked like and again I
have a bunch of questions here of
various values and then the fun part was
that let's see let me clear this is that
I actually built a jar file again that
had the RMI stubs in it so I could say
let me make that bigger I could say Java
- jar and in the distributions directory
there was my jar file or they could just
double click on it and this way I could
create a player and a team so let me put
I don't know how about Scott tiger for
Oracle I need a name you know and
there's there and see the player would
get a little buzzer there and no reason
I can't make another one let's put in a
second one so this was under documents
Java Shepard going you know and then
I'll say again Java - jar distributions
Jeb dot jar let's put I don't know how
about Bill G at Microsoft that one's
probably gonna get questions wrong you
know any rate so just to give you an
idea I'll put this over with the game
board just you can see them but these
would be distributed around the room and
all that would happen is this I would
pick a question and it would come up and
then somebody would click on the button
and that would take control of the game
board see it would come up with a title
here and then I could say they were
right or wrong and I could show the
question if necessary and you see the
scores would go up and down based on
whatever the result was you can see them
move up and down like that now one thing
unfortunately by running it the way I
ran it I don't know where the Daily
Double is I got to find that real quick
of course there was a Daily Double where
the scores can really change you know so
I'm just gonna arbitrarily check I
always printed it out to the console
them there it is okay so let's let's
like that and you could bet up to your
total score and of course you always
want to bet at all see got this got this
song and everything so of course that's
right and that's basically how the game
ran and it was always fun to do because
as you know it's giving out the code and
talking about how you do the database
access and how you do the RMI stuff and
everything there's a lot of fun there
my most interesting story though that I
think about from that is one time we
were doing an open house for a new
training center that was opening up and
the game basically just operated off of
a table in the database so you could add
a table for anything you know I just
needed a some number of categories and
at least one question for each point
value all the way up so we put in
questions about the company or about in
other words had nothing to do with
technical stuff and we had a room full
of salespeople in there and I learned an
interesting thing about salespeople they
were just banging the heck out of the
the mouse because they didn't care
whether they got questions right or not
they just want to be first it was
amazing because I'd reset the board and
then you hear bang bang it's like look I
haven't even asked the question yet you
know and the scores would be - 500 -
1000 where they didn't care it was just
very dramatic that way but any rate this
one was again a very good learning
experience and and once I clean up the
code I will make it available in my
github repository right now I had to
find a JDBC driver that let me access an
Access database where that's been a
while and various other things the fun
part is though I wrote this program
under Java 1.0 moving into 1.1 it's back
in that day maybe some 1.2 stuff in
there as well but that it's still
running
I mean it's running under Java I'm
currently running under 10 and it ran
just fine
so the whole write once run anywhere the
whole backward compatibility sub still
paid off I couldn't believe it
very impressive ok so there was a
picture of that so of course what
changed in my career hit everybody
pretty much at the same time in the jaw
world I tended to think of it as the
Ruby on Rails meteor that hit the Java
Dinosaur World you know and we all had
to react to that it's like oh my
goodness suddenly they could build a web
app in a very short amount of time that
was very effective and powerful and I
already knew something about servlets
and jsps and things like that
but I tried to learn Ruby on Rails and
at the time I was too heavily invested
in the Java world I didn't have the same
background I wasn't really able to
figure that out so instead a year later
Grails came out now if you don't know
that story basically the people in the
groovy community said how are we going
to bring this the Ruby on Rails
productivity into the Java space so they
decided to use groovy because it was
another language that could do meta
programming it was the language you
could write code that would write code
much like Ruby and therefore at first
they called it groovy on Rails and no
less a person that then DHH himself
David Hannum our Hanson who created Ruby
on Rails said no no no you can't call it
on Rails you know that's that's my
framework and and of course he's right
so they changed the name to Grails and
that's where that all started as a
another aside by the way calling it Ruby
on Rails is a decision that an American
never ever would have made because he
basically was saying Ruby is powerful
and let's do rapid powerful development
and was thinking of the high speed
European trains when he went on rails
can you imagine doing Java on Amtrak I
mean I was supposed to come here on
Amtrak yesterday and the trains broke
down had to go to it was a mess so no
any rate so I got involved in Grails and
then in groovy and of course it was
still built on Java and there was spring
and hibernate and all these other
open-source projects that tied into it
and I was basically the target audience
because I'd already been familiar with
Ruby on Rails and wanted to learn the
rest of this so around 2007 I really
started diving into groovy that was my
first exposure to a non Java language on
the JVM so again as an app just to try
something out I did this one called
groovy baseball now
this is part of my making Java groovy
book and and these are the risks of
course of dealing with an open source
service that may go away I was built
this on top of box core information
that's provided by major-league baseball
on a daily basis they have a website
where you can download this stuff and I
tried to access this about a couple of
months ago and suddenly part of it was
blocked you couldn't get at it and again
nothing I did it's just they decided not
to give part of it away or something I
have no idea what but I was able to
rewrite it to get at it so to give you a
quick idea what this is like that's this
one here if I execute this now actually
I'm going to use a plug-in for Gradle
called Greddy
which basically allows you to deploy a
web app onto jetty or Tomcat or even a
cluster or what have you and this one
uses a an h2 database for the locations
of the stadiums for Major League
Baseball as well as well many other
options here so this will bring up the
data as you see from yesterday's
baseball games or at least the ones that
actually ran and of course we were
rained out yesterday right so but you
can even click on it and see actually
it's not showing the mouse over oh there
it is yeah it shows the score of the
individual games and it's all centered
on the home stadium so the idea here was
to use a Google geo coder to encode all
the latitudes and longitudes for the
baseball stadiums and save them in an h2
database I used h2 because this is part
of a github repository I don't want you
have to set anything up in order to be
able to run this so it's all
self-contained you just download it run
the Gradle build and it will go ahead
and create the database and it will go
get the scores and I can click on a
different date and it should go get the
scores for that as well and replace them
all although there's some lag involved
and I don't want to wait for it but any
rate that's the idea so that was that
was a lot of fun building something like
that I think I sometimes have to click
on it twice for reasons I don't
understand yeah well it's code you know
I did here a clever what a Twitter joke
what did they say a million monkeys on a
million typewriters will eventually type
a Java program and the rest will be Perl
programs yeah anyway I thought it was
funny ok so this is running on Greddy
well which is really running a jetty
server that's managed by Gradle so it's
a greddy plugin for Gradle and as I say
everything still works it's working just
fine I just had to clean up that code
this code is in the github repository of
course and you're welcome to that
whenever you like let me be sure to stop
that though there we go ok so part of
stacks you get XML or JSON data
whichever you prefer for the box score
information just pulling it down yeah
there's a picture of it when I was
writing the making job a groovy book I
wandered into Barnes &amp;amp; Noble remember
when we used to have bookstores you know
you could go around it and I was looking
around and I noticed that there was only
one shelf at the time called computer
whereas unfortunately there were three I
think labeled teen paranormal romance
and I was gonna lament the state of the
world and everything and then I got an
inspiration I thought no actually what
this means is is in order to sell my
book what I needed was some groovy
vampires in the book so I decided to go
consume data from first I looked at IMDB
or what everything but they didn't have
an API so instead I went to Rotten
Tomatoes and it turned out they had a
public API with only get requests that's
all it's supported but I could do
queries on movie titles and topics and
everything and pull down massive amounts
of JSON data and then parse it now that
also gave me a chance to use a no sequel
database so I put all the movie
information inside a Mongo database
because that was the native data
structure you know and beasts on and
everything and I was still heavily in
the groovy community so I used rat-pack
which is a really nice what we would
today call
microservice framework very simple
framework for building a restful web
service and I was going to show you that
and unfortunately what happened was
Fandango apparently acquired Rotten
Tomatoes and now you have to become a
quote partner to get access to the data
anymore and this was silly enough to
begin with so I haven't gone through
that nightmare yet but I've got the code
and everything and again it was fun it
was an opportunity to play with a lot of
these alternative technologies and do
something and I actually I went to my
local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and said hey I'm a
local author can you get a couple copies
of my book and I'll sign him and
everything and they went ok so they saw
they brought a couple in and I signed
him and they just kind of sat there and
sat there and sat there and so
eventually I took one of them and I
figured ok this why not and I put it
over in the teen paranormal romance
section you know figuring hey it's got
vampires in it you know I did actually
do that app in the book and everything
and then I went by about a month later
and it was gone and I thought oh my
goodness did somebody actually buy this
thing and I went by the info desk and of
course somebody just moved it it was
gone who knows you know didn't sell I
don't have very high expectations on
that stuff anymore but it was it got a
story out of it so that was good now
late in the in the 2000s there I wound
up on the the speaker tour the no fluff
just stuff speaker tour we come to the
Boston area a couple times a year one up
in Wakefield one out in Framingham and I
got on that tour and the person who did
Android talks was not gonna be on
anymore and the organizer asked me if
I'd like to pick that up and I was
already interested in Android just
because I was interested in mobile and
Android felt like Java I mean that was
the idea now whether it is Java or not
I'm not getting into that in here I'm
not an attorney you know and I don't
want to get into any of that part but
again it gave me an opportunity to dig
into a new area with Java as the
baseline knowledge section that I could
start from of course nowadays it also
supports Kotlin another chance to get
into it an alternative JVM language and
what I did is I access something called
I see NDB the internet Chuck Norris
database now yeah you may not have heard
of that one that has a public API if I
bring up my Android studio app here then
I can show you that app and what it
basically does is it goes to this
restful web service and downloads JSON
data and inside that then it parses the
joke out of it and then renders it
inside an application so if I let me
start up my emulator real quick here
let's pick the pixel - that sounds like
a good one and then I'll just show you
this working and this again was an
opportunity to learn how to do
asynchronous programming because you
didn't want to lock up the GUI and I
done swing programming before so it's
familiar with the idea you know how do
you get off the event dispatch thread
and all of that and then how to parse
JSON data using a Java API there's some
really nice libraries by the way some
really nice Java libraries that are
available in Android that you can also
use outside like there's one called
retrofit you may have heard of retrofit
is an excellent job of library for doing
accessing and parsing restful web
services you pass get potent post put
and delete requests you convert it to a
Java object etc so let me see if I can
run this guy access that and I'll just
say run and continue anyway and let's
see oh good the figures that I've got an
issue with it oh I think I changed my
apk or whatever all right well I'll it
works and it's actually in the Google
Play Store and I can point that out too
if you're interested but I have a
picture again that's the beauty of this
sort of thing I'll show you the code but
I always have a backup
I used Brian gets of course Brian gets
can spawn threads the complete before
they're started complete before they're
started or can can't test for equality
because he has no equal that sort of
thing so this little app again allows me
to access a restful web sir
and convert the data to a Java class and
then update a GUI with that and it's got
a little play button on it now and a
little plus but that will allow me to
share joke using SMS or whatever if I
find a good one all that kind of stuff
and it was all based on Android which
means eventually was all based on on
Java ultimately one quick story about
that by the way I wrote this app and in
fact well let me actually show you here
if I go to play.google.com and I go
inside the app section so let me let
that load up a section so here's the app
section and I search on well Chuck
Norris I think I'll do it then you
should see the app there actually I
think I need to change it let me try the
icy NDB one yeah there it is and I put
this there and I was giving all these
talks on the no fluff tour and I called
it the Internet Chuck Norris database
app because that's all I was doing it's
consuming data from a public website and
I put it in the Google Play Store just
to demonstrate how to deploy and of
course all the data is in my github
repository and about a week after I
deployed it I got an email from patent
Boggs
LLP that's this name here the attorneys
for mr. Carlos Rey quote Chuck Norris
did you know Chuck Norris his name is
Carlos Ramos I had no idea you know any
rate he was they were upset that I was
infringing on their intellectual
property although they couldn't exactly
how I mean again I was consuming data
from a public website and just rendering
I'm giving the code away I didn't charge
anything for this oh my goodness like
anybody pay anything for this and they
you know I ignored it and a week later
Google just you know disabled my app
they suspended it and I'm like woah and
normally I'm much too much of a coward
to do anything about that but in this
case I got annoyed so over a weekend I
converted it to the Internet Carlos Rey
database as you see here and uploaded
that and I put you see I put the
attorney
it's right in the logo you know
everything I I gave it a five-star
review you know but I did that there's a
couple of decent reviews actually a best
Carlos ray app ever definitely unlike
any other Carlos Rey app you know so
it's been sitting there for a couple of
years now and it you know I have what
tens of users or something like that so
you're welcome to it whenever you like
of course I've made the one mistake you
can't make which is I lost the key you
know you you sign it using the Jar
signer and sorting a key tool and
everything and I again it was a hard
drive crash I lost the key so I can't
update it anymore it would think it was
a new app but it's all in my my github
repository you're welcome to it at any
time so just mentioning that okay
still haven't heard anything from the
attorneys again so I think I'm okay now
at the time I was the only person on the
no fluff tour that was speaking on both
Gradle and Android so the people from
Gradle incorporated approached me about
writing a book for O'Reilly a recipes
book on Gradle for Android specifically
so I wrote that one in 2016 you know so
it's just a couple of years ago and
worked on that I it started a couple
years before that these things always
take way more time than you expected the
plan was just to give it to Gradle and
they would give it away and if by some
freak chance you are in fact interested
in that book I have a link here if you
just go to Gradle dot org slash books
and give them an email address you could
download the PDF for free or whatever
which tells you mostly you don't want me
negotiating your next contract I agreed
to a royalty on a book I knew they were
going to give away so any rate but
that's their if you're interested in it
so then I had this thought it's like wow
I just wrote a recipes book for O'Reilly
how hard could it be to write another
recipe book for O'Reilly because after
all that's when Java eight came out and
even though it been out it really
started to make an impact a couple of
years ago and a lot of people needed to
transition to using streams and lambdas
and method references and even just the
fact that we've got the job at that time
package is awesome now you know and
therefore I thought I'll write a book on
that and that's how the modern Java
recipes book came about incidentally if
you're interested in the economics of
technical book publishing if you were to
buy my book I can buy a cup of coffee
but not at Starbucks
okay that's roughly the amount of money
we're talking about here if you divide
by the number of hours you spend writing
it it probably goes negative in
everything so but at any rate that's
what that gave me a chance to dive back
into Java so after all these years of
being in groovy and and the associated
technologies and Android and and still
keeping touch with Java this was my
chance to get back in for real and dive
in that way and that was a lot of fun so
I got to get into this static and
default methods and interfaces I put
some stuff with completable futures in
there
finally after all these years a chance
to really learn some of the concurrency
stuff that I should have learned from
Brian gets his book years ago you know
it's a chance to dig into that the
optional class etc and what I did at the
time is I created a repository let me
load that up let me switch this to Java
8 recipes I loaded a repository for the
Java 8 part and I made a separate
repository for the job of nine stuff
because the idea was is that the job of
nine well the plan was the book was
gonna be out long before job and I was
released and you know those that how
that worked out so I needed at least a
chapter on Java 9 and I added that and
there's only a couple things I want to
show you in here that are amusing one is
that let me mention that Java dot time
business here is I think I have a
picture over here let me show you the
picture first yeah you see this picture
they say you can tell a developer if I
whispering in their ear the word time
zones and watching a shutter go right
down their spine okay this is the time
zones in Antarctica just to give you an
idea I mean how scary is that and and
yet the funny part doesn't even jump out
at you at first here's the funny part
you see the South Pole here is in a
hashed region this region is known as
the Ross dependency
and it follows the timezone rules for
New Zealand and basically more or less
but what this means is is that the South
Pole you know six months of darkness
followed by six months of daylight is on
daylight savings time believe it or not
and I wanted to prove that now there was
a nice little demo in actually a
separate one let me just show you here
here is my Antarctica time zones program
using streams and lambdas and Java
you know the Java time package so I make
a local date local date time actually
and then the zone ID class has that
great method called get available zone
IDs and when I turn that into a stream
that gives me a stream of strings those
are all region IDs like one of the
things I learned of course many of you
may already be aware there's no such
thing as Eastern Standard Time or
Eastern Daylight Time according to the
ISO 8601 spec instead we are in and I
hate to say it this way America / New
York I'd rather be in America / Boston
right I mean I again I'm in Connecticut
so New York to me is that's an illegal
state exception you know it's dark it's
dirty is fully Yankee fans you
understand you know any rate they get
available zone IDs method returns these
strings representing the region IDs from
all over the world that when I counted
when I did this in Java eight there were
like 600 of them I'm sure there are more
now so I turn them into a stream and I
filter them such that the string
contained the word Antarctica because
all the Antarctic ones had that word in
it and then the map method allowed me to
convert the strings into zone IDs I'm
using the of method on the zone ID class
as a method reference so now I have a
stream of zone IDs and then by applying
at zone on the current local date/time
I'm now putting it in that particular
time zone so there's a stream of zone
date times and the reason I did that is
because then I could get an offset in
total seconds and use the sorted method
with comparing intz this is a static
import in the comparator class that
allows me to sort the time zones by
their number of seconds offset for
GMT so I collected them all and then I
print out the offset the zone and is
daylight savings time or not nice little
method there and when I execute this
what I see make that bigger is yes
indeed oh the South Pole went off of
daylight savings time last time I ran
this they were on daylight savings time
so it's probably right about when we
went on they went off on that sort of
thing but you see how easy it is to do a
program like this once you have the Java
time package available to you so there's
there's lots of little neat demos like
that again I mostly it's well partly at
least it's an illustration of my own
sense of humor so sorry about that but
whatever okay there's that one if you're
interested now of course I have to more
or less finish on cat pictures right I
mean that's why the internet was
invented and there is a restful web
service available from Flickr that is a
Flickr photo search now I say it's sort
of a restful web service because any
rest advocate I know would be appalled
by this you know what those rest
advocates call themselves by the way if
you heard that term they call themselves
Resta for ian's i know that shows way
more sense of humor than those people
normally demonstrate you know I mean
they will argue you into the ground over
what is and is not a restful web service
in fact once I use soap just to avoid
that argument say nobody's gonna tell me
whether or not this is so full you know
but at any rate the reason they wouldn't
like Flickr's web service is because it
actually has the verb in the name it's
photo search as a parameter you know and
of course you're not supposed to have
anything other than the HTTP verbs etc
etc but if I didn't want to you know log
in or anything I did have to go through
the registration at Yahoo so that was
painful but if I didn't want to log in
then I could just do a get request on
the photos search and download the JSON
data and using groovy I could use a
swing builder to build up the swing UI
but I could use Java eight with parallel
streams or nine or ten and in fact
that's what I want to show you here this
is my let's make this fullscreen here
I call it concurrent kiddies but
it's parallel kitties here and groovy
I've got a file with my flicker key in
it and this is I'm going to search the
Flickr photos search using that key get
back JSON data and I just want to see
six photos so this is groovy speak for
downloading the taking these parameters
in this map here and converting it into
a query string see this converts each
key value pair into key equals value and
then joins them with an ampersand and
then this converts it to a URL and then
downloads the JSON data so I write the
JSON data to a file if you know and then
I pretty print it you'll see it and then
the groovy has this class called a jason
slurper if you will that lets you dig
into the json data without having to map
it to classes that's what you'd normally
do in java so you'd have to map it to
classes so i parse it and i dig into the
photo elements and here's where i go
parallel is that i convert to a parallel
stream this is using a groovy method but
it's using the underlying java eight
streams here and what happens is is in
the response you get back you get
parameters like farm and server and ID
and secret and you use those to build up
the actual link to the image because the
top-level jason doesn't have a link to
the image and it just has these pieces
of it so i synthesized the image and do
the download in parallel so i can
download all six pictures at the same
time and then render my little swing
builder with the cat pictures now i'm
gonna run this but i have to warn you i
don't know what i'm gonna get back
okay it's the latest six pictures at
flickr that are tagged with the word
kitties now I did cat once and I got
back tractors and I'm like tracked Oh
caterpillar I get it you know but I've
gotten dogs I've gotten monkeys you know
I'll simply say if I get something
completely inappropriate I will close it
right away all right
but just warning you so let me run this
and you'll see oh by the way that
illegal reflective access that oh hey I
got picked I got cats okay I put that
one in the win column but you see how
fast that was because it downloaded all
the cat pictures in parallel you know I
did this for a job of one conference as
a groovy in Java eight talk
and you see how that worked out and
again all the codes and a github
repository if you're interested in it
you know works just fine
so that's the cat pictures one or
actually more properly it was the
parallel kitties one if you're
interested now the future of course Java
ten has come out and we've got of course
module is a ssin from Java nine and
above we've got the collection factory
methods of course the big hot topic
these days is reactive streams Java nine
has the interfaces in it but not an
implementation I've been playing with
the swing at spring-trap pardon me the
Spring Framework related one reactive
streams are the the project reactor
implementation of the reactive stream
spec etc also we have our local variable
type in for instant everything and of
course there's lots more so to do one
last thing I wanted to give away those
books as I mentioned and let's see
where's my picture here let's make this
bigger and this gives me as I mentioned
an excuse to use J shell so when I say J
shell here and I say open
I made a class called person Java and I
can list it and you'll see thank you
and then here's my class I really wanted
to do put the VAR type in there but of
course as you know right I'm assuming
you know local variable is serious you
can only put var on local variables and
those are attributes so I lost my
opportunity to put var in there even
though this is running our job at 10 but
I'm going to generate row column inside
the side it's like I'll make this side
as one and that side is to just
arbitrarily and then the rows start at
the front and go back and I think what
did we say there were 10 rows is that
right twelve rows thank you and there
were 10 seats on each side so 10 columns
here so I just put it in the two string
method so if I just say new person that
gave me on the this side over here and
it got to make you walk so it's way back
in the 11th row and the 10th column you
can measure the columns from either side
whatever you like and if there's an
empty seat there just give to somebody
nearby you know
I want to reserve one book for a woman
in computer science woman or
unrepresented minority but I know we've
got the Women in Technology luncheon
coming up so make sure that we give one
book at least to somebody who's going to
go to the luncheon or something actually
we could just do that right off hand if
you're going to that luncheon you just
raise your hand or somebody and feel
free to pick somebody there thank you
okay so any rate there was one book and
then I've got two more right so okay on
this side five rows back nine seats in
whatever that is it gave me an excuse to
use J shell you know I'm still looking
for a reason to really use that very
much although I imagine I'll use it in
tutorials and stuff last one you're all
set giving her a chance to get her
exercise so the last one again is on
this side second row second person in or
somebody nearby there and there you go
so that's everything I just the
conclusion I have really is that Java
has basically been the soundtrack to my
career change you know it's the the
thing in the background that's been
running the whole time whenever I got
into computer science and even when I
went off into so-called affiliated
technologies alternative jvm languages
groovy Kotlin what-have-you Java has
always been there and everything I've
done in that has it's always been the
friendly home to go back to and when the
functional capabilities came out in Java
8 that gave me an excuse to really dive
back in and now I'm one thing I want to
mention about 10 by the way I don't know
if you're aware I have my Java eight
repository my job at nine repository and
I can run a Gradle build on those the
biggest difference that happened when I
ran the Gradle build on Java 10 other
than the complaint about the illegal
reflective access and groovy which is
just a warning you ignore that is it ran
so fast I had to verify it ran at all I
couldn't believe how much faster the
Gradle build ran under job at ten it ran
a hundred and fifty tests and everything
in under two seconds I mean it's not a
huge repository
sorry certainly not by open source
standards but it was fast to me and
certainly a lot faster than eight was
and things like that so I'm looking
forward to the new changes I'm very
happy to be here
my github repository is a github.com
slash my last name kou Sen and then I
have a whole series of repos there if
you need any further information just
send me an email and I can I can reply
or contact me on Twitter and I'll just
say enjoy the conference thank you very
much for coming
great thank you so much Ken that was
fantastic I really appreciate the talk
I've never learned so much about what
bingo jeopardy the Red Sox Antarctica
time zones and what was the last thing
parallel cats right so thank you so much
with no further ado I'd like to
introduce the next speaker siddharth
aggarwal is the vice president of
product strategy for the oracle cloud
platform I need you to come up and talk
about a number of new developer trends
and cutting-edge developer topics so
thanks welcome sir thanks a lot Rex good
morning yes you know it's cold out there
I thought this is spring but it doesn't
feel like spring I'm coming from
California I flew in last night took me
a little longer to fly in and talking
about flying they sent they seemed to be
sending me to cold places on a regular
basis because a few weeks ago I was
flying into Oslo and you were landing
and the pilot announces it's minus six
degrees and freezing fog has rolled in
now is okay what does that mean it's
like well we're gonna try landing but if
we don't make it this time we have 45
more minutes of fuel to keep trying so I
was like what happens after but
hopefully it's not that cold out here
so so I'm gonna talk a little bit about
feature so I just have to say this don't
make your purchase decisions based on
anything I say but most of the stuff
that we're gonna talk about is there
today so you know it's an exciting time
to be a developer following up on what
Ken had said around Java 10 etc but one
serverless programming is becoming
really popular with
how do you spin up instances on demand
but as you think about these you know
you not have to think about distributed
programming you have to think about
taking events off you have to think
about how to synchronize the data
storage etc chatbots you know now bots
are becoming really really you know the
buzzword out there as the user interface
but as you think about bots you have to
think about natural language processing
you have to think about AI maintaining
the state and context of a conversation
so it's becoming hard for developers
DevOps DevOps has been wonderful it has
improved our productivity significantly
but now what we're finding is that
developers are spending forty to sixty
percent of their time in just doing
DevOps
setting up Jenkins setting up you know
the various parts of a CI CD pipeline
figuring out how to get kubernetes going
etc how do we move towards no ops where
you get the benefits of DevOps but with
less work done by the developer so the
developer can focus more on writing code
blockchain you know everyone's talking
about blockchain not everyone knows what
blockchain is and the key thing is which
use cases in production will actually
result in value for the business
organization that's really important to
figure out before we go start
implementing hyper ledger open source
open source is wonderful lots of
innovation going on in open source when
we think about kubernetes which is used
for orchestration kubernetes releases
every six weeks
hardly upgrade kubernetes hardly set up
kubernetes hardly scale kubernetes
getting at CD in front of kubernetes for
high availability etc you end up
spending a lot of time doing that just
so you can write your programs that can
run in containers that might give you
portability or that might be give you
better functionality so how do we reduce
the work effort there for developers and
then the last one is machine learning
today if I didn't mention AI and machine
learning then my talk would absolutely
be useless so let's talk about machine
learning the key thing for developers is
you know one how do you get the platform
to give you AI built-in and - how can
you embed machine learning into your
applications without necessarily being a
data scientist without needing to
understand machine learning and making
it very domain-specific so
some of the things that we're gonna talk
about is how do you make the life of
developers easy as we go down this path
and you know I'm not going to talk that
much about the oracle cloud platform but
we have a platform where you can develop
your applications written in any
programming languages deploy then run
them scale them based on containers we
have the ability to integrate SAS
applications to SAS application SAS - on
Prem and on Prem - on tremor
applications so as you're writing your
custom applications how do you integrate
those applications other pieces of
packaged applications that are there to
be able to publish your content to be
able to secure the content to be able to
analyze and predict so how in your
applications can you embed functionality
so you can be looking at data analyzing
data and being able to help your users
of your applications be able to predict
and finally security you know security
and manageability
how can you monitor and manage from the
cloud without needing to worry about
installing monitoring and management
tools and aggregating large data
performance data user experience data
without worrying about where that stuff
is stored and securing making sure
there's single sign-on etc so that's the
Oracle cloud platform but before I get
into you know the demos that I wanted to
show which was around server less and
functions and blockchain we did have an
interesting announcement and that's
around growl VM so with that I'd love to
welcome Eric Sedlar who runs engineering
for growl Eric let's talk a little bit
about growl so first you know what is
growl not everyone knows what growl is
language machine and so the vision that
we have for this project which I'm
working on the labs for about seven
years now is that you write your code
once in whatever language you want and
then you can use it in any application
written in any other language and run it
in whatever engine you want to so you
can run it in Java hotspot you can run
it in ode you could run it in my sequel
or the Oracle database or you can just
run and standalone in a container it's
already in production in some Oracle
products like OPA and but the big public
website that we're on is and
Twitter so all the tweets that you're
tweeting and during this conference are
going through gravi em today there are a
lot more things in progress know so what
what about growl makes it special that
makes Twitter use growl what's the
underlying architecture around ground so
the architecture for growl is is one
where we did rather than designing the
language runtime specifically for a
particular language like designing it
for Java or for JavaScript we designed
it kind of one level meta so it's it's
running things that run languages and
it's it's kind of a part of a larger
trend in a history of virtualizing
software and one of the reasons that
we've done that is to have this idea
that the java introduced back to the 90s
of write once run anywhere and what that
actually meant was what I'll call
hardware level virtualization it means
you can run your app on any processor
regardless as ISA and that was what Java
tried to do and then Microsoft came
along with CLR and then there's a next
step in virtualization that you'd see
with the virtual a VirtualBox or VMware
or whatever where you can run your app
on any operating system regardless what
you installed on the hardware and that
was another level of convenience but
today you know if you write your code in
in Java and then you want to put your
Fortran app on it or vice versa like Ken
does you're kind of you know in trouble
we actually would allow Ken to do that
because you can run for Trianon our LLVM
interpreter and then run a ruby
front-end or a JavaScript front-end or
or a java front end on it and so what
crawl does is it watches the the
interpreters which have taken the for
the front ends of all these different
languages we ported them to our API and
then what girl does is it watches what
the API does learns the language
semantics and then generates a compiler
for it and all that stuff can be linked
together with zero cost overhead to to
go between languages and you can make
any memory structure for so foreign
objects can look like the native local
objects to avoid an allocate and copy
and then all that stuff can run in any
of the engines I mentioned there along
the bottom and standalone you can
compile ahead of time which gives you
fast startup and low footprint rather
than running another VM well it sounds
pretty pretty cool pretty awesome but
I'm not sure that we should sell this on
the basis of it can run Fortran for you
and where should people go to see you
know what's going on with growl well so
crawl is actually one of the big
community effort and so it was built in
the open there you can see here and stay
close to the mic please oh yeah yeah so
I love this is going to work the point
here a point here this little dot here
yeah okay great
24,000 commits right and you've got 73
contributors on github so it's actually
a pretty big project at github and we've
had commits from a number of vendors
like a dozen universities and some
individuals as well so it's been done in
the community you can see what we're
doing as we're making commits and you
can try this out running any of the
languages that are supported by the JVM
but also supporting all the note
languages or JavaScript stuff and you
can run these things in the database we
released that last fall or you can run
it in my sequel we'll talk more about
that next week at percona live which is
the big open source database conference
and we just launched a few minutes ago
Barelvi a morgue we have a lot of
documentation and downloads there and
then when you get something running you
can doc you can debug this stuff with
java tools like NetBeans but you could
use JavaScript tools like Chrome and
it'll work on any of the growl of um
languages and you know please join us
you know on github if you want to help
commit or come to the web site and and
see more about it that's wonderful Eric
thank you so much for being here
and this sounds pretty cool you know
this whole thing of write once run
anywhere now it's like write anything in
any language and run anywhere so that's
wonderful thanks a lot Eric and and by
the way Eric the performance on Twitter
what was the improvement in performance
on Twitter yes Eric said 11 percent
faster Twitter on Twitter the
performance is 11 percent faster and
that's why they're using growl VM so if
you want to drive for better performance
and you have scale of workload you know
that's a good alternative so no more
pressing off that circle button for you
okay great so gravia morgue so with that
let's get into you know what we wanted
to share with you about you know server
less functions etc we're gonna work on
this scenario of selling a car and I
happen to be walking in the Oracle
parking lot and took the photo of Larry
Ellison's car he has a particular spot
and actually there is a security guard
that is watching so if you ever parked
there within about 30 seconds someone
will be on you saying that's not your
spot it's a Lexus MFA LFA so it's a
pretty expensive car and so I said hey
why not try and sell that car now don't
tell him I actually sold the car
otherwise I might not have a job after
this keynote here so and someone loved
cartoon so here's the cartoon of the
scenario that we're going to walk
through so if you go through the various
stages of this first I'm going to show
you a bot that's actually going to put
his car for sale on a blockchain I'm
going to show you how a chatbot is built
so the interaction paradigm for the
selling of the car and the buying of the
car is done via BOTS chat bots on
facebook Messenger so I'm going to show
how that is built and then we're gonna
have chat part creating you know Carfax
requires putting the car onto the
blockchain etc using several s functions
based calls so we're going to walk
through matt baldwin is going to come up
and talk through functions and then
finally we're going to look up on the
blockchain as to you know what cars are
available and be able to buy the lexus
mfa so that's the scenario so with and
this is the architecture which is not
cartoonish though it does have some
cartoon elements to it i'll show you in
a second but so you know the customer
that's me is selling my car that's the
Lexus MFA and we used the chat bot
platform from Oracle as part of the
mobile mobile cloud to be able to
interface with the customer and then the
part in the middle oh I can use this guy
here this guy here is an event-based
you know kafka engine that we built and
then finally you have functions based
development so you have surveillance
program
and then this car there's the cartoon
part this car is then put onto the
blockchain network that's the one in the
middle and then from the blockchain
network we were able to purchase the car
also so a different dealership is able
to for a different customer and able
them to buy the car so that's the
experience out there so let me just show
you what the experience looks like here
let me just go to my mobile phone if you
guys can plug this in so here we go can
you guys see my iPhone if the folks can
put up my iPhone here the folks in the
front or the back my iPhone please ah
there we go
okay and yes I have a few emails to read
please do not comment on that people
wonder if I'm doing work or not but
let's go to Facebook messenger here so
this is just me going to Facebook
Messenger and here I friended John's car
dealership and I just say hi to wake up
the the bot here so this is just no
education needed on my part no read the
manual no book needed and here it says
welcome to the art are you interested in
buying or selling I want to sell Larry's
you know Lexus MFA that's great we offer
competitive prices for clients it knows
who I am so can you upload an image so I
go in here I go to my thing looks like
I've taken a lot of photographs of his
license plate not sure why but here we
go
it's asking for a license plate so now
reading optical character recognition on
the license plate can you upload recent
pictures of the car and here's the
actual picture of the car and this is
his actual spot that's right in front of
the 500 building that's his actual car
that's oh I'm a little worried doing
this demo but okay it's already done
some parsing figured out you know some
details I'm gonna look at few more
details out here so it's gone look up
maybe CARFAX report or something got
some information navigation system seven
speakers that looks wonderful
and the mileage so let me see is this
correct it I say yes and the one thing
that it asked me is what's the mileage
on the car Lucas can't get that
necessarily now I gently drive you know
between 150 miles 180 miles and I can
only do that on the 280 close to San
Francisco between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. on
the night so I don't really drive that
much so that's 1,100 miles so far it
says oh so it's looked up Kelly Blue
Book and says Kelly Blue Book value is
the price of a car to be three hundred
and seventy five thousand dollars today
and since it's great condition I'll buy
it for three eighty five that's kind of
a bummer because these cars supposed to
appreciate in value and I thought it was
supposed to be for 25 and I'd be making
some money but oh well you know 385
what's another 15 20 thousand dollars
when you can buy cars like this so I
said is this okay with you yes so there
will continue to process the vehicle and
send you the documents for the transfer
so that's the kind of interface that can
be built and we will need this a bit
more later but let me just put this here
for now so talking about yeah if we can
go back to the slides please you know
there's a pretty significant
transformation that is happening we're
moving forward from the app era you know
everyone was building mobile apps but
now jackpots and messaging are becoming
the key form of interaction with
embedded arv our capabilities in there
so image recognition is built-in as
you're doing jackpots and virtual
personal assistants are going to be
taking over if you think about your
mobile phone what's the most popular app
on your phone I have two kids
my daughters almost 17 I was actually in
Boston just two three weeks ago showing
our colleges out here and I have a son
who's 13 and a half they live by their
phones but they don't have voice mail
set up how many of you have kids yeah
and how many of them have phones pretty
much everyone and how many of them have
voicemail set up no one they don't use
voice mail email they only get to email
if I force them to use email by saying
you have to go look at that there's
something important in school the way
they all communicate
is messaging either Facebook message
Instagram snapchat iMessage etc so the a
paradigm of conversations is moving
towards using AI and you know when you
think about if you wanted to build that
kind of a bot interface what are some of
the challenges that you have one there
lots of channels there there are two
sets of channels one is the input
channel which can be you know Alexa
Google home etc the other is the app
platform pop upon which you working
which is facebook Messenger whatsapp
WeChat so you not have to integrate with
Alexa you have to integrate with
Facebook Messenger and then you have to
have national language processing what
did the person say you have to
understand the intent of what was being
said so you have to use AI techniques in
there and then you have to have security
backend integration so for example you
know I might be needing to go to some
back office applications to get some
information and maybe you know the
policy or insurance capabilities of the
car etc so there's a lot of work that
developers have to do and so how do we
make it simple and this is actually I've
done the demo here of the chat part what
we did was we built a platform to be
able to help developers to build the
chat BOTS easily so first we built the
integrations into Alexa Google home etc
so that we're able to take the voice to
text they give us text and then we've
got a national language processing
engine and that natural language
processing engine goes in and
understands what happened what was the
intent of the conversation and then what
are the entities upon which that we need
to act on for example here an entity
might be the type of car that we're
working on so we built that and then you
saw the interface you know I was able to
load in cars and things like that and if
I were to say show me all the cars
available for safe sale it would use the
Facebook messenger card layout and look
and feel so we've even integrated into
the UI off the messaging platform so you
as a developer don't have to worry about
this and then we've got deep learning
algorithms that are built-in so they
were maintaining the state of the
conversation you know what if the person
say you know did they say
something that indicates that they might
have reached a decision or is the tone
of the conversation heading south in
which case we should transfer that
conversation over to the customer
service rep right so that's all we've
built into the platform so that you can
build with these bots pretty easily and
I'm going to switch to a the UI of how
to build BOTS so let me just go in here
so browser where's the browser Matt
where's the browser yeah here we go okay
let me make sure we logged in here so
this is the mobile cloud from Oracle and
this is the BOK piece of that so here
for example you can see from mobile
cloud you can build mobile apps native
mobile apps with mobile backend as
services like push notifications you
know storing securely on local drives
etc you have the ability to build
visually developed apps but without
writing a single line of code you could
write a mobile app that can run natively
run as mobile web etc you can build BOTS
that's what we're going to spend time on
you can do analytics you can get insight
into how the application is being used
whichever application it is whether it
be a BART whether it be a native mobile
app etc so let's go to the bot here and
I'm going to go to the car dealer by bot
so these are parts that are built and
here you can see there's notion of
intent and as a developer what you're
doing is you're asking the business user
what are some of the intents that you
have so here the intents that maybe
people put in was buy a car I'm looking
for a car I want to buy a car now
there's no way that you can put in all
the intents and so we that is where
we're using machine learning so here for
example we've got different models for
machine learning that are built in here
that can be used to train this bar so
let's play around with this part a
little bit and here I want to see you
know I want to test the intent like by
Lexus okay now here you see there is no
notion of Lexus but when I say by Lexus
here and I say send this is
in the build environment so I'm testing
what this looks like it actually comes
back and tells me here's the confidence
with which intent was the person trying
to execute on so by car is the intent
with 30 percent and if for example I
want this by Lexus to be added in here I
can add that as an example which then
results in retraining the bar such that
the confidence level is going up and if
you had a number of conversations that
you know you had already recorded your
customer conversations you could
actually stream those customer
conversations in and we'd be able to
learn from the bar and if we went here
and if we said you know this shows you
what the response would be to an end
user if they were interacting with a
with this bar if I said buy a car now
it's actually executing the code that
shows you what the response would be
right and here this is the interface
that is showing you if you were doing on
Facebook it'll look different so you
have the notion of intense that we
figured out based on just some hints
that you've given and then we keep on
learning on an ongoing basis and then we
have the notion of entities so entities
are you know address currency date etc
these are system entities that we've
created so that from the conversation we
can pull out things like address or
currency you know if you're doing a bank
account transfer and you say pay mom 50
bucks and you'd ask you know before
what's my balance in checking we no
longer ask you which account you want to
transfer form from and we're able to
pull out $50 as currency out here but
you can add your own custom you know
entities also so in this case you know
I've got dealer as a custom entity and
here I could add for example name so
based on which dealer you know you might
have different dealers that you're
working on okay
and then what we've done is we've
created these bundle packs resource
bundles so we already have multilingual
national language processing in there
but if you have a better way to process
you have a resource bundle that you want
to use you can integrate that resource
bundle in here and we've also got here
the ability to have custom
so in this case if you wanted optical
character recognition and you wanted to
integrate optical character recognition
in here through a web hook you can
actually call a particular you know OCR
package that you have and then here you
can see the channels that are available
to you so for example here is the
Facebook channel and we're already
enabling secure single sign-on
three-legged OAuth etc for you so making
it really easy and then we're also
giving you the ability to use web looks
to add other channels so the goal of
this was to show you that as a developer
it becomes very easy to be able to
actually build these BOTS and we're
giving you a visual drag-and-drop
paradigm of hardened layout what the
conversation might look like based on
what kind of decisions made by the
engine what you might want to happen
right like buying the car or putting the
car in the blockchain so here's the you
know overview of our platform one we're
giving you you know cross channel
integration across both slack facebook
Messenger whatsapp Syria et cetera plus
on the voice input side with Google home
Alexa dialogue flow execution so you
have a declarative builder which I
showed you you know you're building the
bot declaratively as opposed to writing
a whole bunch of code and it has a state
machine built in so for example if I was
looking for a new laptop to purchase as
an employee and I saw the three laptops
and then I said you know yeah I'm done
with this you know view it is it knows
to ask me well have you made a decision
because it's maintaining the state of
the conversation and then it has the
conversational AI engine in which is
using machine learning to be able to
learn on an ongoing basis and really
importantly it also has integration to
back-end so we make it very easy for you
to be able to integrate with back-end
SAS applications back office on Prem
applications with making very simple API
calls and we do the integration with the
backend so with that I'd love to bring
Matt on to talk about server less
functions thank you where the servers
fit in into this whole paradigm here
well it's actually kind of nice little
girl next slide kind of fit we're fit in
where it fits into Siddhartha is that
where we have this this Kafka event
engine that actually is kicking off
events and then we have these service
functions acting as almost like micro
services or nano services talking to the
blockchain architecture and so that we
can talk to it and spin up something
really quickly and then tear it back
down real quickly so it gives us
scalability as we add more dealers and
more participants and organizations to
the to the solution okay so so let's
kind of kick off into what is service
and so what is service is yes let's
let's let's lay down flat is that there
are servers there okay everyone there's
servers there then lots of servers
actually but what's what's important
about servers service is that you don't
have to manage the the cruft underneath
you're just writing code you're building
things and the server list components
are all being managed for you and so
that is important for a variety of
different reasons and what we're going
to talk about today is about functions
as a service and really functions where
is a component it's really the kind of
runtime the the the the infrastructure
that we'll be talking about underneath
so why server list why do we have it and
so first of all is just very simple it's
cheaper because if you're looking at a
traditional application a traditional
application say is stand up a a jetty
server a tomcat server you you when you
stand that up you then run that for a
period of time and you're constantly
running it and there's a cost associated
to that what we can do from an economics
perspective is that we can say let's
just run that function for a moment and
then move on and then tear it down bring
it up and tear town we out for example
we we can also make it hot so it can be
up for a little bit and then torn down
for it torn down after a period of time
the next point is agility agility is key
with rebuilding new applications how we
want to reduce the over the amount of
code that we're actually developing and
we want to be able to
not introduce errors into the code that
were that we're building and then
reliability is that we're not managing
the service we can offload that
management of that service to the cloud
provider and so that gives us
reliability the patching we don't have
to deal with
operating system updates or patches or
any of any of any of those things and
then finally innovation if I can write
code and kind of think at the speed of
light where I can I can innovate faster
and I can compose applications in a much
more efficient manner and deliver
overall value to the business much
quicker so announcing it was announced
in Oracle OpenWorld 2017 is the FN
project do and what the FN project I
know is an open source project it's tied
to the CNC F the cloud native compute
foundation and what it is it is an open
source project that delivers functions
as a service where you can deploy these
and this capability on-premise and then
we will be offering a functions as a
service capability as a managed service
as well but the key thing here is that
you can get started today building
functions that are portable and with the
underlying technology mean being
containers and it it's just it's just a
really exciting project because when we
look at we have 5050 committers now 50
plus and Oracle non Oracle committed to
the project so it's a very active and
dynamic project and there's also 2,500
commits actually 2,500 plus commits that
have actually that have actually been
committed to the projects as well this
is very exciting
great investment it's and really kind of
gets you going and thinking about how to
build functions and with multiple
languages as well so let's look at what
is a function so functions so the
function project takes the basic concept
from 30 years or 40 years ago when when
we're building UNIX streams in and out
very simple so you put something in the
black box that function and then
thing comes out and so you and then and
then we have you know basic output to
standard out and then login to air the
function server and the function service
handles everything else like the API
gateway piping things about storing
calls logs it takes care of all that
cruft underneath so it's a very simple
very elegant solution in terms of how to
kind of and how you're going to build
your you know your that that nano
service under underneath the micro
service and then when we start looking
at the the CLI the CLI is very
straightforward FN and it creates an app
it builds a scaffolding for an app and
this time in this case F Annette run one
time go FN run FN test FN deploy FN call
and then and then we basically build
routes everything when it's deployed is
a rest service so all you have to do is
be able to say ok F and deploy and then
that that route comes forward but really
kind of enough of that let's kind of
walk into some of the code effectively
this is really portable across multiple
environments you can run it on your
laptop you can run it in our public
cloud you can run it in a third party
cloud and you not just locked in to
running everything in one cloud right
correct absolutely correct and let's do
run time typing is good by the way this
is pair programming I'm one pair you
guys are the other pair so you can
always help me if you want and one time
go and we'll call it hello so what we
did there is we built a big basic
scaffold of a function so we'll CD to it
and what you see are three three
artifacts really three key artifacts the
service itself the actual function self
funko func tile and intestine Aysen so
let's take a quick look at these
and let's look at that funk got those
make this little bigger I mean nothing
really special but what it is doing is
using basic standard in standard out so
you can see right here saying we're
looking for the person named and guess
what it's a hello world kind of Kentucky
bility and then the funk funk Tom will
actually defines what language it's
going to be where the entry point is and
then the test we also build a basic
testing testing for a black box testing
on the on the environment as well so
let's go back to here so the basic
simplest thing we can do is function run
and what it's doing here is building
it's basically building a container and
then it uses that container and says
hello world awesome but now let's see
what what's actually so for those are
doing for Bo's here's what it's actually
doing under the under the covers so in
other words it's doing all the things in
terms of building in terms of using and
leveraging on container but you don't
see any of it so for those of you are
interested in doing something like this
right using like I'm using a MacBook you
can do a brew install FN and you'll and
you'll get the the function development
kit and so it's part of grew so you can
use that so now let's let's try
something because we said what is it
standard in standard out kind of thing
so let's do echo and that's calling this
let's write some Jason and we'll call it
that and we'll call it Boston strong
yeah and then we will pipe it to run now
with all luck it should then it's gonna
build the image here and say F N and
then F and run oops what did I do
I must have an error here
there
there there we go those are snare come
on I need your help a little bit here
guys give me a hand here so okay so so
so that's actually building that but
then what we want to actually do
something more with this this is running
inside inside of my develop environment
see it's very elegant very
straightforward we just manipulate the
code the go code we can run function
start and function run and and build
right just like that and we can even do
a function test for example like that
and we'll do a function test and it's
doing that it's rolling the test cases
and then we can then say okay so let's
let's actually deploy this demo okay
just make sure I got this right app demo
there okay so what's doing here is
that's actually building a new container
and what it's doing is then publishing
it to a service so we can say function
apps list
there so now we have demo demo deployed
Oh code deployed and then what we can
then say is we can say routes list demo
and see that's the end point because now
we have a radical endpoint that we can
use and so now we can say curl right and
we can say curl and we'll say HTTP my
mouse is somewhere here and and we can
see that and so we can also so that's
actually deployed on a server could be
deployed as function as a service its
server as well some function as a
service and it can be deployed and we
can do we can pipe things in in and out
of it just like we did like like we did
before so that's the basic concept of
what function is from a CLI perspective
so let's go back to the presentation
because when we were looking at more
complex things we want to but we want to
be able to put them to provide some
level of orchestration for for for those
functions so in particularly for low
excuse me for for longer running type of
functions and want to do additional
parallelism so what we've done is and
from the we've leveraged the completable
api from from the java from java 8 and
to allow us to build these parallel
functions and so that you can build some
very complete very complex
orchestrations so for example your boss
comes up to you says sell car is kind of
the micro service but it actually has a
variety of things underneath it such as
i want to have a CARFAX report i need a
criminal lookup i have an FBI lookup I
have all these different little things
that make up cell car and then I'm going
to write that to the blockchain and once
that's all complete so I'm going to take
the completable the completable futures
api and we can pull all that together
into an orchestration so that
orchestration then looks like ok here's
the current flow it's a little bit long
a little bit dense but the the point is
that you can build this in terms of
getting cars and then those get cars are
going to process the car so I'm going to
get some particular
data and that particular data then is
going to drive down into you know get
the car fax get the criminal lookup and
then finally come to the end and do a
print line to the end so so so flow is
is the capability taking many functions
and then kind of orchestrate them into a
series of events so let's kind of walk
into okay and so I have a quick Ally I
saw code flow and what's that what's
that doing is actually during an
execution and so you can see the
execution of these API is actually in
these functions actually going and so we
can then drill down and see how fast and
what they're doing all the way to the
end and as they complete so what this
does is it gives us so everything from
code get cars what it does it gives us
kind of a trace route all the way
through the through the execution code
then the next step is saying that's
that's the positive step but then then
there's also the it helps us in terms of
debugging so just to kind of finish up
here coming as a service based on
upstream FM we're gonna be delivering
functions as a service ii they'll
obviously be integrated with oracle
security solutions from end to end
protection and then as you can see all
these functions have an API driven
associates them and we're gonna be
integrating tightly with our API
platform so that you can build mock
services and then as you build your
functions out complete them so
Siddhartha yeah here you go and the next
one is gonna have to be really fast that
was wonderful
that's their stage Matt stay on stage
yes so you know the difference is here
with AWS lambda for example is that you
know you can run it anywhere not just on
the cloud platform until you can write
the programming language you can write
the containers in any language the
function flow chains everything together
and then lastly or should I forgot what
I was gonna say but
okay we're going to block to you now so
unblocked chain just real quick in this
architecture we're now going to talk
about that function placing that car
onto the blockchain network so let's
just talk and then you know that the
person on the other end actually blind
buying the blockchain so what is
blockchain you know it's a system for
managing distributed Ledger's in a
peer-to-peer network which means that
not everyone is fully trusted but you
have many players who want to be able to
do a transaction and today the
reconciliation of those transactions is
all done via emails or Excel
spreadsheets being exchanged for example
your manufacturer who then ships the
good via a shipper the shipper then
delivers the group goods through customs
and over to the end you know person
receiving the goods there has to be
validation across the board and today
that takes a lot of time so now if
multiple parties can actually transact
on a blockchain you have transparency
the minute the transaction is done
because you know the transaction is
immutable which means it cannot be
changed and that you know there are at
least two or three people who've
endorsed the transaction which means the
transaction actually happened so if you
look at some of the you know key use
cases that we've seen this is where I
was talking about everyone's thinking
about use cases we have financial
services based use cases and we have
supply chain based use cases I just
talked about the supply chain with the
shipper we have public sector based use
cases and health care based use cases
and one of the use cases that is
becoming very popular is identity how
can you have shared identity so that for
example the government of Canada is
saying that you know if you set up a
identity with a bank then you don't need
to recreate your identity when you go to
get a new cellphone account with
t-mobile or whoever it might be they can
actually share identity by requesting
off a blockchain if this person has an
identity that's been well authenticated
so let's work for the consumer let's
work for the you know authorizer on the
front end and you know if you think
about the patterns for blockchain you
can enable you know distributed
autonomous marketplaces like the you
know identity case reduce friction so
that's reducing the amount of effort
needed the time needed for
reconciliation
can securely maintain and share the
decentralized records like identities
and very importantly track the
provenance of documents provenance means
where was this produced what were the
goods used that were produced so for
example for my Lexus MFA I want to make
sure that when I'm buying the car not
only do I know yes the car is there but
also that it was always taken to a Lexus
dealership where were the parts
purchased from where the parts original
parts or were they not original parts I
want to know all of that about the car
and that could be put on the blockchain
and if you think about challenges in
terms of when you're thinking of writing
blockchain applications is that one you
have to figure out how to integrate with
supply chain systems you have to
integrate with back-office of
applications you have to integrate with
identity systems so it takes a lot to do
that integration and production resinous
you know blockchain is not easy it takes
a little bit to scale as the chains get
longer performing gets impacted so
hardly make sure that you can have a
high-performance secure permission
blockchain that is running for you and
also technology is changing really
really fast you know you look at
MapReduce for example on the fast data
side that was d technology two three
years ago now it's all spark so how do
you insulate yourself from these
technology changes we're hyper ledger
fabric is just in its version 1.0 and
then operational challenges so one you
want to set up this metal network how do
you bring on members how do you monitor
what's going on
how do you support and lifecycle
management for this entire blockchain so
what we've done at Oracle is we've
delivering blockchain as a service and
Matt's going to demonstrate that which
makes it very easy for you because we're
using hyper ledger and we're giving you
an implementation that is extremely
secure and scalable we in fact took you
know the team that was working on our
you know a tuxedo application with the
distributed transaction management
application and I've been able to
leverage that team to make sure that we
can have a highly scalable distributed
transaction mechanism so now you can
just come and say I want to implement my
use case use a couple API is to be able
to execute transactions on to the
blockchain and that's what Matt's going
to talk about and it's running on our
infrastructure platform which is giving
you a lot of high performance built in
to it so Matt if we can do a quick demo
now fast certainly well yes okay so
first of all what we're gonna do is do a
quick close out of here so and say
because then we got to buy the car we're
actually going to buy the car car and
car back and so we're gonna buy the car
and it's it's relative to to the
blockchain discussion so you saw this
with some sonars since we have different
cars that we could choose from but let's
say if I want to say I want I have a
Lexus I'd prefer to have a Lexus what
we're doing here is that we're searching
across the blockchain saying oh I don't
have one in my dealership but I may have
one in another dealership and so that's
the key thing it's finding this new new
car so we can prove that that's a you
know the right car and then I can say
I'd like to purchase it so we're
committing a transaction on the
blockchain network at this point and so
we can say hey wait a minute it's three
hundred ninety nine thousand somebody
made a markup and what this means is
that's permission permission between two
dealers so that we can we can look at
what the two dealers are actually
talking about and they're only they are
involved in that transaction so I'm
gonna say yes I want to confirm that and
so that's a and so though we'll complete
the transaction we'll do the paperwork
we'll go to the dealership and take care
of that but the other piece of this is
that this is an application for the
blockchain network right and so what we
can also build other applications that
are associated to this both of them are
using what's what's called the rest
proxy so as a developer from a developer
perspective we want to do 6 lik 274 I
think as the is the car we can build
custom applications on the blockchain
you using it using a REST proxy so as a
developer there's three things that
you're going to be doing you're gonna be
developing applications which are
outside of the blockchain and then those
applications will interact with what's
called chain code and chain code is
usually built and go something soon and
Java is that it'll be it'll be built and
that is the contract that builds
consensus on the transaction on the
blockchain so the key thing is so what
you're seeing here this is a custom app
and we can see that the transaction
has occurred and you can see it several
transactions part of the testing we've
been doing and also what are the API
details and this is showing all the
detail of the transaction that's
occurring on the blockchain so this is a
call I said that's a rest call that's
good that was a sample application that
was using the same API called that your
bot was using exactly so we build
multiple applications multiple
applications act accessing the
blockchain and accessing the chain code
so from the network perspective we have
multiple networks here we have one
network than an originator and this we
can then say what does this network look
like and this is how the blockchain we
can visualize the overall blockchain we
can see there's organizations there's a
founding organization then there's
multiple organizations in that
blockchain and then there are peer nodes
and these are the green things and those
peer nodes process basically process
what's what's going to be happening on
the hyper ledger fabric and then finally
and before we kind of go off and and
finish up here is that we have this
concept of nodes and this is what is key
it's important think of what nodes are
in blockchain and particularly the hyper
ledger fabric is that these are subnets
in terms of organization a tux to
organization be an only organization a
can talk to organization will be and so
we can set up these subnets so for
example the difference between Bob and
john's blockchain is that i don't care
about what other parties may not may not
need to know about what price was paid
for the car may not need to know about
the shipping and how that car was
shipped to the other dealership in other
words we can do this in a permission
manner leveraging channels inside of the
hyper ledger fabric so i'll kind of
stand down from here and go back to the
presentation so we can keep us on
schedule and so basically on the
left-hand side the key things from a
developer perspective is you build
really through two key things one is on
the left hand side are the applications
and so you know whether it be a chap out
whether it be a trace application and
then you define the network which is in
the middle how do these how do these
channels work and then you define what
the chain code is going to do and that's
the most important piece that is the
smart contract
that is the piece that actually builds
the consensus that you're going to
install into the blockchain
and on the right-hand side we're adding
value in terms of getting administration
council arrest proxy in these other
capabilities and and really hardening
the overall hyper ledger fabric so
siddharth great thanks a lot sure enough
thank you great demo there so we need to
work hard on the leveraging the api's
and then using or writing the smart
contracts in this case it'd be putting
the car onto the blockchain network so
just to wrap up really quickly about our
application development platform we've
shown you some parts of it but we've got
an entire CI CD pipeline so that you
don't have to set up Jenkins or JIRA etc
if you don't want to but if you have
Jenkins for example continuous
integration you can easily you know
blend it in we've got maven already
built in there in addition the CI CD
pipeline understands containers natively
so when you for example check in code
and we know you're gonna write a
container based application will
automatically build a docker image the
pipeline knows that that docker image
needs to be registered and that it could
be put in a public registry or in a
private registry and then be able to
deploy that as a container onto a
kubernetes based platform we're
providing you kubernetes as a service so
that you don't have to worry about
spinning up kubernetes maintaining
kubernetes scaling kubernetes etcetera
your containers automatically get
deployed on the kubernetes or if you
want you can say i'm just gonna bring my
code and i'm writing the code in PHP
Ruby Go Java it doesn't matter we
actually manage the runtime for you
where we're running it on containers but
you're not aware that it's running on
containers so either you can be
container native or you can just bring
code and we can run it on containers for
you and then we talked about the mobile
cloud capabilities the chat pod
functionality plus all the mobile
backend as a service capabilities and
the integration to the back-end
applications the API first development
you should check out a period I so that
is a place where you can go and write
documentation and that creates an API
that API is actually running on a mock
server so that without writing the
implementation of the
API you can actually go to someone who's
going to use your API get them to use it
collaborate and what the actual contract
should be once you have that contract
agreed to then you can go and implement
the API and then we're giving you
lifecycle management for the API so that
you know from you know build to tasks to
run etc you got insight into the
performance of the api's you've got an
api gateway that gives you security it's
a validation rate authentication rating
throttling etc and that API gateway can
run anywhere so it can run in your
on-premise application environment it
can run in the Oracle public cloud or it
can run on a third-party cloud it's an
entire API management platform with a
portal to exposed to developers who are
going to consume your API so obviously
if you're writing in Java and wanna use
web logic we're delivering WebLogic
delivered as a service and then finally
for those folks who want to do rapid
prototyping and be able to build
applications where they're not writing
code but they want to work with the line
of business users show them what the
application could look like we're
actually giving you a visual development
environment where we drag and drop you
can build out the application very
easily and then it can generate the code
for you from that you know visual
developed environment and you can extend
the code from there and this is what all
our you know platform looks like we
talked a lot about the front-end tooling
the API design and the visual
development capabilities the backend
services with functions jack-bots and
then I didn't talk a lot about the
performance management capabilities so
from the cloud we were able to monitor
and manage your applications where you
don't have to where we've created one
consolidated data platform for log data
performance data user experience data
config data and we're applying machine
to this data because you got tons of
data and we got tons of compute capacity
in the cloud where you no longer have to
tell us what thresholds to set we learn
the thresholds over time we learn the
server topology over time so now you
don't have to monitor and manage your
on-premise monitoring management
infrastructure and you don't have to
spend time setting thresholds etc you as
developers can get real-time feedback
into what's going on with the
application and then the event have
cloud service you know Kafka
new scalable craft after clusters you
being able to leverage the eventing but
you don't have to worry about the
infrastructure and the scaling when
message storms are coming in identity
being able to do single sign-on from
your application to other applications
and then integration being being able to
very easily integrate your applications
with back-office applications we've
given giving you adaptors to various SAS
applications and on-premise applications
and finally data stores you don't have
to just use the Oracle database we're
giving you my sequel deliver that
service we're giving you Cassandra no
sequel delivered as a service and if you
want you could even run MongoDB on our
iOS and all of this is running on a very
performant highly scalable secure
Aya's platform lots of traction for the
Oracle cloud the analysts are rating us
at the very top in terms of Magic
Quadrant and the Forester waves lots of
apps in the cloud marketplace and then
for developers you know go to developer
Oracle comm and that's the place where
we're putting all our content for
developers you can see blogs you can see
the content on containers api's DevOps
tooling etc so thank you you know and
we'd love to get your feedback we'll be
around if there are any questions we can
take those right
great thank you siddharth ellis a
fantastic keynote thanks to Matt and
Eric as well I just have a couple of
public service announcements and then
we'll release you for the coffee break
so let's see here does this not maybe
they've gone too far so first of all
just outside here there's a demo loud
you see a lot of great demos for 3d
printing for IOT beer making and whatnot
one of the more interesting things out
there is a zip lab this is a place where
you can get actually hands-on with our
with our product running a bit of a
competition and if you if you get a
bunch of these zip labs done quickly you
will win this fantastic prize it is a
modular drone this looks like it has six
props so get out there and get hands-on
with our product another thing that I'd
like to mention is during lunch we have
a an event to promote diversity and
inclusion women in technology featuring
some of the speakers that we have here
today and this is open to all all people
men women both so please come and join
us for that and lunch and meet some of
our our women technologists I want to
give a shout out to our sponsors
I believe viscosity and crafter are out
there in the lounge as well so please
say hello and take a look at at what
they have to have to show you 10
mentioned job at 10 so Java 10 was
announced I think about a month ago at
code Chicago and so you can get it here
get your hands on the latest version of
Java 10 I think a number of you may also
be into MySQL a very popular database
this is what's new in the latest version
MySQL 8 it features some interesting no
SQL as well as relational capability and
as with every version some significant
performance improvements have been added
in this latest version so take a look at
a number of you are probably here for
education right and one place where you
can get it is Oracle University they
offer a number of great courses on a
number of technologies and to take a
look at what they have I think there's a
special offer here if you go to that URL
the developer portal I'll skip this cuz
Siddharth already mentioned it this is a
quick snapshot of the rest of today so
we are a little behind but you still
have about 15 minutes left of a coffee
break and then after that we have got a
very strong line-up of sessions as well
as hands-on labs there should be I
believe for parallel sessions this is
it's gonna happen in this room and three
other rooms you can choose at any point
in time one of these four sessions or
the hands-on labs and it goes until the
end of today and if you don't already
have it the specifics are on the app on
your on your device and last but not
least I want to encourage you to check
out what we have to offer Siddharth
showed you about 30 services that we
have for developers in Oracle cloud as a
special thanks for your coming here
today we want to offer you $500 a free
credit this is actually more than our
normal offer we normally offer about
$300 so this is a little bit of a boost
so it's a it's a limited exclusive also
non-transferable offer so that URL that
you see here is only good for those of
you here today you have to sign up using
the same email address that you used to
sign up for Oracle code and
unfortunately you can't transfer it to
your colleague but this is sort of a
thank you for for being here today so
check it out and with that I'd like to
wish you a great Oracle code event thank
you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
