and Yan welcome like you hello so let's
take one quick walk through of the
Oracle container cloud service
what what's it for why did we why did we
put this out well
container cloud basically allows you to
run docker containers in our public
cloud environment so we set up the cloud
infrastructure running allowing you to
run docker that you drop your images
that you built yourself and then run
them in a very managed and very easy way
without having to worry about assigning
resources assigning hosts IP addresses
and stuff like that so you can also
integrate it very easily in a continuous
integration continuous development
environment so the whole chain actually
works very nicely and that's basically
what we did in our lab just just now we
we had a very simple exercise to start
off with using the basic functions of
finished features of docker and then
gradually we build it up to deploy an
image deploy a node and at one go DB
application and as a last step in the
exercise I'm not sure everybody got that
far we used the worker tooling that we
are in the process of acquiring to
basically build an image in an automated
way deploy to docker hub and then in our
cloud service automatically pick up that
new version and you see the application
switch over from the old version to the
new version so that's really neat to see
it's easy to use yes absolutely it's all
browser-based it's all very accessible
but at the same time you can very easily
go underneath the covers in the exercise
we did that we use the SSH to go into
the actual virtual machine and play
around with that okay so you can do a
lot of stuff on the lower level too so
a very easy way to deploy these images
and to basically not worry about
infrastructure on what on which those
components are running now we hear a lot
of people throw around the term sandbox
you know what is that what does that
mean to you is a sandbox just like a you
know set real estate in the clouds where
that has all the proper security tools
and whatnot err or is that kind of just
like a an old term probably well days
yeah well I think we see docker came
initially especially in the developer
environment system development
environments because it allows you to
very easily lightweight images that you
can take up and move over from one
environment to the other so that was
really small contained environments
where developers can play around them
and they can't hurt anything exactly so
it's a contained environment we're in
you can do whatever you want to do as a
developer I don't the next step in that
I think that's where we kamar
where we bring really value to the table
is bringing the same environment to the
production environment so you can deploy
your docker containers not only to play
with them in a development environment
also deploy them in a real-life
production environment so in when we do
these you know sand boxes we have the
same level of security as say as the
deployment environment would have well
it's a docker environment so you have
the we added a number of things to beef
up security on that level and make sure
that we are in the framework of the
Oracle security Oracle public cloud
security framework and obviously well if
you use a container cloud you are still
managing the application that is running
inside that container so the security
that you set up on that level is your
own responsibility that is of course not
Oracle's responsibility so it and it's
really a sliding scale of responsibility
who takes responsibility for which part
of the stack container clouds you are
responsible for building the
applications inside the container
infrastructure on which it runs
that's Oracle if you move over to more
like Java clouds or our sauce
applications you move up the stack and
the level of responsibility of Oracle
increases and responsibilities of the
individual that the customer decreases
because he's only responsible for small
or a fraction of that stack that he's
running basically and it's responsible
for the the data that he's inputting
into the cloud exactly and for whatever
he opens up in terms of ports and
security protocols that he allows or
does not allow it all so it all depends
on the level at which he's personally
managing those things so you know do you
like working in darker it's a nice
environment yes yes lovely III was
always very I like to play around with
virtual images VM and whether they are
quite heavy big files
yeah and difficult to manage now with
docker that's the opposite you have the
it's much smaller files and the layered
model allows you to add small changes on
top of these containers and that is
really the modularity it's not just that
the image itself is smaller it's also
this layered model that allows you to
make it very easily manageable you have
a base image you layer some stuff on it
you have a change you lay that change on
top of it and that makes that the thing
you have to change in your production
environment it's only that little change
and not the whole stack nice very
interesting what do you see now this
next part of course is just your opinion
and what you would wish for this is not
on the Oracle roadmap nor would you be
you know responsible for delivering it
but what do you think must be the next
cool thing for a stood out on our cloud
or functionality that we should be
thinking about how shall I say this the
there's a level of automation that we
allow for example in application
container cloud it's very automated
right it's a level one step above the
container cloud and what I see that we
are in the process of making it more
gradual so they can do more behind the
scenes in these applications to make
them more manageable so you have the
base entry level where everything is out
of the box it's a standard thing you go
in click click click it runs right and
then underneath the covers you can as a
real IT person you can go in and
customize whatever you want to do
yourself I think that's really where we
still have to still make a lot of
progress when that's a more easy would
that be cool gonna get to work on that
or what who do we talk to you Radek
management that's helped me
unfortunately oh that's great well I
it's been really a really nice speaking
with you and I'm glad that we had a
chance to catch up a little bit and I'm
glad that you're hands-on lab went so
well thank you yeah you know sometimes
you never really know it can go either
way
congratulations okay thank you and I'll
catch you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
