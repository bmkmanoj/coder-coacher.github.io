Atlanta I'm Barbara Bart with the Oracle
technology Network bringing you another
dev live interview it's a gray and rainy
day here in Atlanta but we're going to
get past all that and I'm going to talk
with jiwoo yes my guess your Z was all
right what do you do for Oracle I am an
object in the Oracle spatial and
grafting which is part of Oracle
database organization okay tell me a
little bit about the spatial and graph
team what sort of work do they do
basically this team generates an option
for Oracle database okay and in this
option which is sits on top of Oracle
and the price occasion you can manage
spatial data you can manage graph data
in addition in the recent I think three
years now we offer on spatial and graph
on Big Data Platform
so traditionally spatial and graph runs
Oracle database by relational platform
and things I think three years ago we
start to deliver so-called Big Data
space on the graph okay in my job
primarily is on the graph side I have
been working on on two different gravity
models one is so-called RDF semantic web
the second one is probably graph so both
graph data models have a similar
expressivity but they sort of apply to
different application domains your
session the title of your session excuse
my to read this off on my laptop is
apply graph and deep learning to
recommendation and network intrusion
detection there's a mouthful part of the
abstract under your session includes the
following it says building a production
quality recommendation engine or
intrusion detection capabilities is
non-trivial what makes it non-trivial
this is a great question so there are
two parts in my talk so let's try to
break it into recommender system and
also medical bean - ginger tapping on
recommender system everyone is familiar
with it by Netflix Amazon right every
time you log in you say hey you may be
also interested in as and wise a rate
those kind of things what makes it hard
to build a high-quality system is on in
different situations you may have
different data right in one system you
may have clicked by a person click on or
something but you may not have rating
another system you may have click plus
rating okay a person has made a purchase
and also made a comment I like it I
don't like it right in some other
systems you don't have this click
information you only have description
about the product about the user
preference okay so how do we make sense
out of all those different situations
what we are proposing is to use graph
technologies graph database right to try
to tackle all those different situations
for example if you only have descriptive
text right what we can do is we use
solar cloud which is one of the well
integrated system in our graph database
offering so in that you can look at the
text descriptive portion right
we rely on cosine similarity to find
matches so you can give you a list of
recommendations based on the vector
space the angle of two descriptions is
actually if you have just click say you
should click on a movie for that I have
a demo ending here in my session and
then we have this graph analytics code
person eyes pretty rank
it's like a page rank but with a twist
okay with PPR we can find the similar
items and also similar users based on
that we do recommendation if you have
both clicks okay the links between user
and items and also rating right say five
star four star one star etcetera
then we have a building algorithm called
collaborative filtering is based on
matrix factorization we break it off to
find latent features and use that we can
give you ratings on the items you have
not clicked on before so is essentially
a mix of different algorithms and you
can use out of the box okay and you can
also do an ensemble right because
sometimes it's hard to see which one
performs the best in practice right and
also it changes okay depending on the
data and situations right so you can mix
up those different algorithms and try to
pick one that works the best depending
on the on the time and also on the
situations will you be presenting this
session or content like this at events
in the future coming up yeah definitely
so this afternoon I have a session on
this I'm going to show a demo on
recommender system and also we have done
quite a few sessions on body
o W and B wah physics in college ins I
just covered one portion recommender
system absolutely there's a second part
sorry but head that's the second part is
about the network intrusion detection
okay so for that basically what we are
doing is to integrate the graph
technology graph database raise the
neural net a deep learning um we partner
with a small company called Scott mind
they are the producers of so called deep
learning for j TL for j so what we are
doing there is by given a set of network
traffic data right there's a lot of
features inside okay we build a new net
model right to predict whether one
particular network traffic is malicious
or not right so we do the model we fill
the trafficking right and then this
model is able to tell us whether this
one is malicious or not yes and no is it
you know booming answer so given that we
build a graph model out of that okay
because if you think about it the
network
traffic is it's like from one node to
another right from one IP address to
another there's a link okay so now we
can tag each link with a flag say this
is malicious or not right so all of
sudden we have a very nice attack graph
so on top of this attacker graph we can
run for example PageRank
to find you know what are the IP edges
and has been attacked the most okay so
which is pretty cool and then you can
look around visualization is different
sizing to see hey how severe is this IP
being attacked okay open world is three
months away will you're not presenting
there as well
very likely now having doing over W
sessions for many many years you know I
have been with Arco for 17 years
oh yeah ok well if you'd like more
information on these sessions diseased
session or any of the other sessions up
to this point in the 20-city Oracle code
Roadshow please visit developer
oracle.com slash code you'll find
information about all the sessions that
have been presented so far and
information on the upcoming cities in
the tour I think we move from here to
South America and then to Asia Pacific
region so thanks for watching I'm Bob
Herbert for the Oracle technology
Network stay tuned for more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
