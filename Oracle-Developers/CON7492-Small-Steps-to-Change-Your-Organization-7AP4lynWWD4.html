came out to listen to me talk so my
talks called small steps to change your
organization my name is sterling green
I'm a principal engineer at grade a link
we make the great old oaken source build
tool him in software engineering for
about 10 years and call myself a
accidental automator so I really hope
that has a story i'll be telling today
is something you'll find useful and
maybe get some tidbits out of it so this
is one of my favorite quotes um I wrote
this about my old manager at my old job
like to have quotes written by his
employees on his whiteboard and this is
one I wrote maybe like five years ago on
his whiteboard and I quite realize how
important both pieces of this the
statement is right change organization
so change the way your organization
works or change organization and that
leave and find a better organization so
this is Martin Fowler so we look at
change in large organizations change is
really really hard it's really hard and
all and everywhere everywhere but even
in large organizations is even worse
it's like the first law of changes an
organization at rest remains at rest and
I'll tacked it on by an outside force
someone has to force an organization to
really change anything about change has
many different dimensions has many
different parts you know culture process
automation to tooling that you're using
kind of all reinforce one another and
kind of one that's not doing really well
will be backfilled by another so it's
very interesting as my job now at a
Gradle
I'm get to be kind of dropped into
different organization as a consultant
to help automate things using Gradle
it's usually what we're doing but I get
to see a lot of skeletons and a lot of
organizations so I've seen I've seen
I've seen all the horrors but it's
really cool to see new ones so it's a
thing about culture a poor process or a
lack of automation can sort of be
compensated by a heroic culture right
you have people who will stay there all
day all week you know I I used to work
with guys I used to work like this we're
working seven days a week that's no big
deal I think we're eight days a week
yeah we can figure that out but really a
healthy culture a culture that's got
open feedback and and it's very
reflective and non reactionary can
actually cultivate a lot of good process
and healthy automation it can be
actually these these are the things that
are really important for us to automate
culture is one of the things that you
can't you can't sit at the top of the
organization say our culture shall be
this it really has to be acquired by all
the different people who make up the
organization so the processes so a lack
of a good culture right so a culture
that doesn't really care about you know
my job is to go home at five o'clock or
I don't have the tooling that really
makes the build happen automatically
what you see is it's a paper driven
development right it's like here is a
stack of papers that we're going to
follow and it's gonna we're going to
follow all these steps each time because
that's that's how I do my job you see
this with agile methods favoring
interactions between people as opposed
to a process and then you see waterfall
saying we really really like process we
really really like it when you send me
amen the process is that you to copy it
into a email and then make some changes
to it and stuff like that so it's really
really kind of funny stuff um and so
good processes I think I really should
be self-evident you should be wondering
why are we doing this it doesn't make
any sense that we would ever be doing
this and it should also be necessary
processes like if it doesn't get done
the process doesn't get followed then
there should be some bad bad side effect
of that right it shouldn't just be like
oh it didn't happen this time and that's
okay no we'll do it we'll get it next
time then it comes to automation when
you have really poor processes it's not
really clear how things get done when
you have culture where people aren't
really taking it vantage of things you
can take automation and only go so far
right you can only automate so much
until it becomes a people problem and
the people really need to step up and do
more things so improving automation is
usually the easiest thing to do you can
usually find that one thing that you can
automate and and make some progress but
it's not going to prevent a bad culture
from you know doing something worse or
the other thing to realize is that just
because you've automated one thing does
it mean that you're done it could be you
need to automate a lot of other things
that's one thing organizations sometimes
really have a hard time large
organizations have a hard time knowing
or understanding is that you told me
that we needed to automate the build so
we've automated the bill now you're
telling me maybe I'd make the tests like
like why why is that different like why
we have why do we have to eat automating
things isn't it a done thing so what my
one takeaway is is that you should rely
on automation like there's no silver
bullet you can't I couldn't say I can't
say with a straight face that oh yeah if
you guys are using ants if you're using
Gradle that perfect all this stuff
automation is just a tool it really has
to be kind of all steps like automation
process culture all together so kind of
what was the motivation for me putting
the other this talk and and why is this
so important is a few years ago I went
to a conference and this is when i was
still
working at a really large corporation
and and was in this we called build hell
in terms of the environment and the
culture and that sort of thing and so I
guess in this conference and and part of
the agreement maybe this is a lot like
the people who are here the agreement
for going to that conference meant that
I had to come back with and make a
report and talk about all the things I
saw at that conference and they sent me
an example here is a I think was a
Jenkins user conference that a different
group of people that went to earlier in
the year for my company and they had
summaries forever you know slide for
every thought they'd gone to and it was
all very interesting and then it was
kind of a take away a summary of you
know what is actionable from what we
learned at this conference and all the
people in this report said yeah we can't
use any of the stuff because you know we
don't use we don't have automated tests
we don't have an integration if
condition integration you know all that
stuff's too hard there's nothing useful
for us here to learn and it was just
like how could that be like how this is
like software area there's the stories
you've seen look at Wall Street Journal
and stuff people hardwell software
eating the world and delivering working
software delivering that value is is
better for all of us and that's or
brought me to making this talk and also
moving to Gradle because we have this
slogan of built happiness so build
happiness for the developers build
happiness for the organization all that
was like really resonated with me so
what's my story I so I before I was at
Gradle I was working at another company
uh I just give you a kind of idea of
what my environment was like so you can
maybe relate and sympathize with me a
little bit we had technically version
control we technically had builds that
technically worked um if you ran them on
the right day from the right directory
and twice because it didn't work the
first time through every time and
basically my organization was said
my organization had done some internal
R&amp;amp;D we had this really cool product that
we wanted to sell to our customer we
wanted to get lots of money to take the
rd and turn it into a real product and
the software we were already building
and it was written in matlab and and the
rest of our software was mostly Java and
we come up with this number like this is
gonna be the number to take the matlab
rewrite everything into I think of a C
and then insert it into our product it
was going to be many months many
millions of dollars and the customers
like no I'm not really interested in
that so we settled for ok we'll do like
a pilot it'll be a prototype will leave
as matlab we'll figure out some way of
getting this matlab code into our
product and you know interfacing with
russ or a java system so just kind of
conveniently a few years before this
this opportunity showed up for the rd
thing i've been involved in a hardware
evaluation right so we had the stack of
hardware that came in and we were saying
oh this is going to be fit for purpose
for what we're going to be using for and
it was one lonely server that was too
small that wasn't useful that got stuck
into a rack and kind of forgotten about
and i had stumbled upon it and i had
stuck my name on it because i knew
nobody was going to use it it was never
going to be used for anything they're
just going to kind of rust in this in
this rack so fast forward to a couple
years later we have this rd product and
the we're trying to figure out okay how
are we going to work the build how are
we going to put things where we're gonna
check things in and this is like june or
Ernest May May June jerk I'm and all the
other product project managers say you
know my my software you know we're about
to do a delivery in October can you wait
till then to check anything in because I
don't want you messing with my build
because I have built on Tuesdays and
Thursdays and most of time the Tuesday
bill doesn't work
so it actually takes all day Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday to get my first
build out and so I need those days
actually do the build and so we were
trying to find a slot in this calendar
where we would start doing our builds
and it was looking like we could do a
build every other week on a Friday and
we could not check anything until
October an old projects must be done by
August all right so it's like you know
is it anything like you're like trying
to negotiating what it means to be done
with your program manager when they're
like well it's done if you say it's done
and it's not checked in that's okay
checking in at this like that's like the
least important part of software
development I guess I you know Oh
where'd it go deleted it sorry I am so
um same way so i said oh i remember i
have i have the server that is all mine
I'm buddies with a sysadmin I go talk to
her so I need I need a hostname I need
might be a dress and a hard drive
because we're gonna make something
happen and she says oh well what what we
want to call it you know come up with a
name and at the time we were I think we
were hot into naming everything after
Greek gods I said anything but a Greek
god i don't i don't care and she said
well we'll name it sterling I was like
okay now we can't you can't be that
either I don't want I don't want my name
on it when when 10 years from now
everybody's cursing because the sterling
server is too slow so she's okay you
know we'll call it will call it obi-wan
because your only hope so so we get we
got obi-wan got hard drive put in it
I've got the root password for it it's
all my server and I get to pick a team
of people who are going to help me build
this this R&amp;amp;D project and get it
inserted into our regular system and so
I got to pick basically the best people
i said these are the people who are
aligned with me these are people who
believe that we want to make it better
we want we want our our environment to
be better we want our culture to be
better
and we're going to we're going to
demonstrate it we're going to do it this
time and so at the time we we took our
server we put Jenkins on it we were
using so I didn't tell you the full
story of my version control system so it
has who has heard of or is forced to use
dimensions or PC ms or PVCs or if you
actually work at one of those companies
that makes that I'm sorry but it's it's
basically if you've never used it it's
basically our CSS CCS on some sort of
illegal drug I'm not sure so so I come
to find out is that basically the
dimensions has on paper maybe this
sounds really cool it has all of these
process things built into it like where
I want to make a change that means I
want to lock the file I want to have my
manager approve I'm going to be making
changes that file and I'm going to make
the changes of the file and someone's
going to prove that the change the
romaine and all that so um we said okay
that sucks we're not we're not going to
be using that for our new tool our new
project so we pick it it was a hot thing
then again so we had Jenkins we had yet
one thing that I won't real too much
because maybe we'll figure out where I
worked so we did a something called
Fagin code reviews or code inspections
and this basically came out of the guess
late 70s early 80s and the process is
basically is how it was when I first
started you'd make your changes you
would print them all out on pieces of
paper you would go through and highlight
all the lines of code that you change
and have photocopies made of that and
then you go to people's desks who are
going to review your code and pass it
all out and set the calendar
a calendar invite for a week later where
you'd all convene in a room with your
robes on and we would discuss the
defects that had been found in the code
over time everyone kind of realized that
was way too heavy weights and so code
reviews had turned into showing up at a
meeting looking at the code for a few
seconds and the person saying I've
already checked it all in so if there's
any changes sorry too late so we said
okay we got to find something better you
know if we were looking at crucible
we're looking at Review Board we're
looking all these everything so we end
up picking Garrett because it helped
solve a couple problems we had with
having a host for our git repositories
and also having code review that was
really really good for us so this is
sort of what a build looked like when we
were doing it for the old project the
large project people were checking
things and then a week or two later a
build would happen and then a week or
two later that build would then get
deployed on to actual hardware and
manual test would be run so you can
imagine this all sorts of weird things
grew up around this in terms of
procedures and and process and culture
that came with this so one thing we had
was word of our unit test run this is
one of the things I I I got funny looks
for when I was at the conference and
people were still talking about unit
tasks and functional tasks and that sort
of thing and asked a question like well
how do you how do you run your software
and a unit test so that it doesn't just
exit as soon as you need to look up a
environment variable or something like
that because at the time my software i
worked on that's what it did if you were
running it in any directory other than
this one particular directory it would
say I'm in the wrong directory and it
would it would exit so this was like
global state like if you touched any
class and anywhere in the system
reach out and find that and run and run
the exit so so yeah so this is this is
what sort of looked like for the old
system and this is sort of what we came
up with for our new system we had
jenkins in there for running commit
bills we had Garrett in the center there
Chicago triggering commit builds
whenever we promote some or we check
something in and we were using great all
the time for doing the builds and then
once things were approved we would go
through a kind of a build promotion
cycle and that consisted of a different
person who was more of a integration
type person checking in a build file
that would pull all the pieces of our
system together and build like an
installer for it and it would go through
the same kind of cycle it would go
through a check in which would cause
integration tests to run and then it
would get approved by an integrator and
then pushed out to actually doing the
deploy and test on our on our real
system so anyway so this is what we came
up with and we worked on the news the
kind of rd project for for about I don't
know two months or so and we got we were
done and our managers think i was
looking at looking at the metrics that
he looks at who's like looking at
defects and he shows me this chart and
it has like really really really tall a
you know chart or graph on it and it's
like really really like small bump
almost like it was a hero it was like it
was like I think something's wrong with
my report because you're the number of
defects you found or you've had in your
product was order of magnitude better
than it was in any other projects we've
ever done he's like what you know what
why would that be I said we didn't do
anything we've ever done before right we
we basically took the opposite of
everything we did and we did it
differently and so this is like July or
August of that year
you know R&amp;amp;D projects really going
really really well the problems that
we're having are really problems related
to things that weren't following this
process so we didn't have much control
over what the matlab guy did so changes
he would make which is kind of like
screw singing up but but people who were
following this process was actually
doing really well and so now I had this
this kind of like secret server I had
this uh this kind of my own way of doing
things right and I was building a
building out this mind chair of of other
people who want to do things like this
and so I actually went through and made
a tool to convert dimensions
repositories to get repositories and I
spent like a month doing the conversion
then doing the cleanup to delete the
gigabytes of checked in binaries and
other crazy stuff had shown up in the
system and pruning things so that when
it came November that year like the
first or second week of november i sent
an email Monday to all the developers
saying friday afternoon no more
dimensions check-ins Monday morning
we're all using git we have Jenkins with
code review it was kind of like this one
heave the moves organization but along
the way all these kind of small steps
had to be taken here's here's a
prototype here's here's like this is
what we're going to do and those small
steps of finding those people who are
going to help it make it actually happen
so some of the first steps that we took
and in some of this was even like
intentionally that we thought we were
going to change the world we were going
to change our company we sort of
thinking about all the things that we
thought were really bad about what we
were doing we're thinking the pain
points that were going through and then
we found we found things that kind of
addressed that we also found other
people in our company who were who were
like-minded like us who could help
spread the message to other teams who
could help defend us when something bad
would happen I mean the
my favorite for my favorite memories of
a meeting we had with all of our have an
upper management for like all these
different programs and we're describing
I was describing this picture and he had
kinda like a cycle of all changes going
through a review cycle and to be fair
the guys thinking about faking code
inspections and taking a week and and
all the robes we'd have to order for
that but um everybody look like a slight
little jokes in there right um I just
thought that once I'm pretty proud of it
um so to be fair to him he thought that
he was thinking of that so we've shown
that picture and he says you know you
mean to tell me that every change that
ever gets made to my program or in my
system is gonna go through a review and
I said yes he's like well I don't want
that because III I said oh you want us
to check in broken code I we can do that
I mean that's what we've been doing for
a while we can keep doing that and you
never really talked to me or looked at
me the rest of time I was there so um
yeah so another really important kind of
learning we had for these first steps is
that um a lot of times there's like
really kind of like obviously stupid
things it seems like things are being
done or Perry painful things are being
done and it's really important to
understand understand why those kind of
stupid things are being done sometimes
you actually learn something say oh
there's a reason that we're doing this
thing that looks obviously stupid but
the other kind of better thing is that
when there's somebody who's like
inflicting pain who's who saying this is
the way we must be doing it a lot of
times they don't know why they're doing
it that's just that's the process right
so if you know is that you can say we're
doing this because x y and z and x y and
z is no longer a problem all right or
was never a problem you can basically
kind of work around them you can you can
leave their fears you know sometimes you
can actually get them on your side
trying to remember the exact story we
had is is there were some people who
were very very against what we were
trying to do and try and try and push an
organization and it took a couple times
of problems that they were having day to
day like pointing out saying we refer
into that we knew about that we have we
have the places now we have the hook so
we can put an automation we can put in a
better process or whatever it would be
to make them better so another thing you
need to kind of prepare yourself for is
that you're going to be in it for the
long haul if you're if you're the guy
pushing the change if you're the one who
really believes in the change you're
gonna you're going to have to kind of
overcome the negativity and overcome the
you know people trying to it's really
easy just to kind of not necessarily be
against things but just kind of not help
all right go your run to a lot of people
who are what going to be like that who
won't help not because they're bad or
anything just don't know they could help
and you also want to make sure that
change that you're proposing the changes
that you're you're describing feel
evolutionary they make people see this
evolutionary path as opposed to a stop
the world everything's everything's
everything is a changing one lesson I
had is that i sent the email out monday
and so we're switching everything
everything at the entire world is
changing in a week and you know to the
credit the program managers were like
not not happy exactly right there they
were they were a little scared and what
the only thing that really saved it i
don't think it really made it made it
okay was that I had this story I just
sort of like here are all the steps that
we took here's how we got to where we're
going here's what we're here's where
we're going I know drew it on the
whiteboard here's where we're going this
is what's going to be great about that
so if you think about automation if you
like were to start I have no automation
I know
it sucks wherever automation I have
sucks what do I do so what you want to
look at is going to look at the other
kind of pieces of the puzzle right you
have process and culture you want to
look at is there an existing process
that we're already doing that could
really benefit by having automation so
one example I have a little job is that
we had manual acceptance tests that we
would follow and they were very very
rigid they were very very you know do
this do this do this do this this
particular one actually had you operate
the system go in look at the database
say this row will be this number and
then remember that number it'll be in
microseconds now go to this other file
and look at this line at this number and
that number will be in seconds and those
two numbers should be the same once you
convert them into days or something like
that I mean that's this is what the
procedure was for right and so we spent
some time saying okay we're gonna we're
gonna take that process we're going to
automate it and we were using fitness
which is a kind of a wiki table driven
you know thing right so we wrote those
tables saying because what end up what
the old test was trying to show was that
the system had requirements for
retaining data for so many days and
those configuration files described how
long that data was posed to be caps and
the database table said how long the day
was going to be camped right and so
being able to interrogate the system and
do all that stuff we built an automation
tool you would this is procedure would
take two people a couple days to go
through because it had was hundreds of
things he had to check and while we were
building the automation we realized that
a quarter of the numbers were actually
wrong or actually had been wrong for
many years but because a human was in
the loop you know some of it was typos
you know how many seconds are there in a
day you know is it 86 for
something or is a 484 6 yeah it was a
mix some places were one of some places
the other so it found problems right and
so that really helped for people who
were kind of skeptical of what we were
doing say look I found a bunch of
problems that we have in the meeting
requirements but it was so close nobody
really noticed I don't think you look at
is look at the people who are getting
things done look at what they're what
they're spending all their time on
making because a lot of people they're
really passionate about the company
they're really passion about whatever
your building and they're willing to do
that extra heroic effort right so if you
can look at see what they're doing and
what kind of things they do each day to
make the world work and you can automate
those things you're going to relieve
them some of the things that they're
going to have to do and they're gonna be
able to gather other heroic things right
so it's it's a kind of a multiplier
another thing is is maybe maybe the
problems that you're having with your
with your builds or whether your
automation or whatever you have now
maybe it's just too hard to fix like
maybe the first step isn't fixing
anything maybe the first step is
actually monitoring things so when we
had our rogue Jenkins server you know we
there was a where our builds actually
happened you know there would be some
guys home directory that's where he ran
the bills so I knew where the output was
i wrote a Jenkins job to go look at that
output and tell me was to build good or
bad right and doing that over the time
that we had our R&amp;amp;D project i could tell
i go to my manager I could say thirty
percent of all of our builds are broken
because people are broken or checking in
broken code or broken in general right i
don't i don't know why sometimes they
like we found that all builds would fail
if you started on my 8am because the
backup hadn't finished yet and it would
delete files and stuff like that so so
sometimes just monitoring is a good
first step um and the other thing is if
there's a really big problem and you
want to try to solve it and it's just
too hard to solve all at once you want
to look at is there a piece of it I can
solve even if that means that I still
have to keep a person in the loop
um having a mostly automated thing with
a person on top of it is better than a
person all the way through because
people are Fela b'lore alleble and they
may not get it right anyways so another
thing is when you have you want to
improve your process you want you want
to say okay let's let's look at what
kind of failures were having already
with our existing process all right and
we want to try to figure out is our way
we can replace pieces of that process
with automation or you want to try to
you know if trying to come up with a
bulletproof kind of process is too hard
right you know is think of ok we're
going to replace this really hard
section with automation or you're going
to say hey this it doesn't ever make any
sense that this process was just sucks
like this procedure we're going to
follow we never actually follow that
procedure because it's a hundred pages
and we only really need to do maybe
every third page or something it's like
a choose-your-own-adventure procedure
and so maybe in that case you just say
ok you know we're going to throw out the
procedure we're going we're not we don't
follow it anyways let's not pretend
let's just get rid of it and just
rediscover it because there's must be
some process that we are following if
we're being successful there's some
processes we are following and we just
need to figure out what that is and
document it again all right so then
culture so cultures like one of those
really hard like the hardest thing to
really change cuz it takes time it takes
people it's actually relationships
between people it takes trusts so if you
feel like you have a poor culture um
people I don't think are inherently like
bad developers or good developers
they're really it depends on what kind
of feedback they're getting so if if
they don't have any feedback then there
may be just in the default state of I'll
keep doing what I'm doing because
nobody's complaining so if you can put
an automation you've been in a process
that says here is the feedback from what
you did
right we saw a really really good things
from just having commit builds so if
someone has a review and it's changed as
they push it the commit bill comes back
and says you know doesn't compile unit
tests don't work or whatever it is
that's really great but also when people
come back and do reviews I I was a
little I was lookin cerned the first
time we started using the code review
because with our team because it had
been so long since a real review had
been done as the code inspections that
sort of become a formality but not a
requirements and and and it was it was
that wasn't quite clear you know people
worked with were kind of like my friends
and everything but I wasn't sure how
they were going to react to being told
and I don't think you're doing the right
thing in this they had this this this
kind of sucks so I you need to do
something different but I was really
really surprised and I maybe this is a
sign of the organizational
organizational culture or health or
whatever was that and Garrett if you
guys have ever used care or never use
Garrett um basically every review gets
votes from reviewers so they can say
plus one I really like it or or plus two
and then it gets merged and ask for
things so it also has negative reviews
so you say minus one I think you need to
make some changes or minus two this
thing is broken don't merge it right and
so when we first switched over we had
more people using Gary and more people
doing reviews people would come to me
and tell me I got my first minus one
today you know somebody looked at my
code and they told me that they wanted
me to change something that's awesome
right I've never had never had that
feeling of someone giving them feedback
and so another thing you want to look at
is for automation for process you want
to make it so it's easy to do the right
thing and this goes back kind of the
feedback thing is if someone does the
wrong thing that it's it's it's not
there it's not if they're bad or
something but the feedback stairs just
so they know what what they can do
better and then the other thing is why
is you're going through this you want to
try to look for those champions look for
the other
people who are going to kind of feel the
same way about you st. same way about
improving the organization of either
improving the culture or process or what
all these different pieces but you want
to find other people who are kind of
like that or try to grow them try to
find someone who's on the cusp of of
seeing the light and bring them on so
after a couple years of pushing changes
in my old company I I got the itch to
actually leave and go somewhere else and
when I did I felt it was really really
hard for me to look at this look at what
I'd helped you know kind of bring about
I felt responsible for all the bad
things that hadn't quite been figured
out yet and I felt like I felt guilty of
that I was going to be leaving all my
buddies and a lurch or something but
what it took was I was in a meeting and
it was like the exact same kind of
meeting we've been having four years
where I was the only voice going you
know we must automate something right
I'm not I'm saying automate all the
things just automate something right and
it was like one of the last few weeks I
was I was at the company you know
admitting I it's like the perfect time
for me to say you know automate all the
things please and someone else stands up
and says it right and then someone else
says yes that's what we should be doing
and and you had kind of like this wall
of people who are like we believe and
what we're doing now I we feel like we
go in the process we feel like we we are
doing the right thing now you know we
know we're going we're going to make it
so I guess I'll open it up for you guys
have any questions about you know about
the story to more if you have some
particular kind of dilemmas of the way
where you are about you know I've been
trying to make change and I just doesn't
seem to make any traction I can try to
maybe give some advice I don't know all
the answers but I can try to help on the
other on the other hand if if Gradle
questions I can also try to answer those
but maybe
those to the end or come by our booth
but other than I thank you guys for
coming out and listening to me I hope
you found it not just completely
rambling and silly so thank you any
questions like I guess bad bad i mean i
mean in that um malicious right I'll
intention yeah so there's people who
maybe should be doing something else but
you actually that was interesting thing
is that because I was not I didn't care
about um getting the best like the best
people that management thought were best
people i was looking for likeness in
terms of where we like like not
necessarily we were going to do exactly
the same thing because we disagreed on
what exactly we're going to do i think
we've had a maven guy and he just didn't
win but that of the people that were
available i had opportunity to grab and
then people who weren't available i had
a way of kind of you know using up some
my capital that i had built up as a
reputation as a developer at my company
i could say you know I really need this
person I really need that help for this
person the people I picked were not
we're not considered at the time of
being like the rock stars they were just
another average person but they had
ideas and they were frustrated and maybe
that was probably how I found them is
that they were frustrated and we can you
could
you could you could feel that energy
when you would talk about like I was
trying to check out checking in files
you check them in one at a time and they
had to be full path like like why ok but
so yeah so yeah and fear fear is a
really good a good thing fear was always
one of those things that came up and
like every meeting and it was just like
I'm afraid that you know we have
something that's working right now and
you're going to change it and it's going
to break something and we're not going
to find out until six months later and
something bad is going to happen and a
lot of that came from there was a lack
of automation of lack of feedback from
the existing system it was kind of like
the bill the test everything was like
you threw your code into the black box
and in a built came out the other end
and how it got to that state wasn't
really clear and so the one thing we
always tried to talk we always try to
steer away from fear of the change and
fear of the unknown of what we have
right now because there was a lot of
people who were complacent and said I
understand exactly what happens now and
then when you would question them on and
you said where it goes back to knowing
the pain knowing the why things are the
way they are more than the people were
actually doing the job so that when they
said I'm afraid because you know this is
going to happen you could say do you
know exactly how you know have you seen
how the sausage is made right we've seen
it right we we want you know you know
we're the vegans now all right we want
we want to bring it in you know bring
you to us right so yes sir yep
yep yep yep yeah yeah so um uh I won't
were real too much but about basically
you know the stuff we were working on
was was government-related everything
and so there was a little bit of that of
people saying we have to it that way
because our contract says it has to be
that way right and that had become like
a tribal knowledge excuse for things so
I think if you're if you're working at
Visa MasterCard and saying that please
don't just throw out your rules and be a
cowboy but if basically what we were
able to do is when we would come up with
come up the face of something it would
have to that deep dive we have to do
that deep understanding of why is it the
way it is and then if we gotten a reason
like that what's like that because it
has to be that way because someone else
told us it has to be that way we
actually did the homework it's trying to
find out is that really the case and in
the cases where it really was that case
then we went back to our second tactic
of all we actually following those
processes and that's where you could get
you know that's where you could also get
leverage right you're either leverages
you're saying you have to do this
because of some reason because of some
contract or whatever and it doesn't
actually say that so we can just not do
it unless it's a good idea and then the
other side is it's in our contract that
says we're supposed to be doing it but
we went and looked and we're not
actually doing it and what we're
proposing will make us so we know that
we're not doing it right and that's how
we win or out or about looking at it all
right sir blue shirt
okay um I just look like for like a
developer type position you be a man you
be a lead developer oh you be the lead
developer um OSS yeah see um so i would
i guess i would ask us a good question
how would you how would you find out
someone who's passionate so um i always
like oh I was like the question of like
what was like the hardest it is maybe a
little bit of a cop-out I always liked
the the behavioral type question of like
what was the hardest problem you had to
deal with not a technical problem but
maybe like a relationship type problem
or a interpersonal type problem and the
workspace it work place like where you
have either a really crappy environment
and how did you did you just suffer
through that or did you how did you make
it how did you make your life a little
bit better you would you would think
that a good person would try to always
make things better so that might be what
I would look at um what's another good
one um ask them if they if they really
like dimensions if they say yes that is
a litmus test you go okay you know so to
be fair I found out later that we had
been using it so long it basically we
were stuck on a really old version and
because we didn't actually choose
dimensions it choose it shows us but the
we didn't need any of that approval
stuff right we didn't need to go through
all these different we weren't using it
for issue tracking we weren't using it
for any of the kind of alm stuff they
added so we had scripts and the scripts
were source of a lot of the trick
trouble with dimensions but the fact
that it didn't like our version and have
built in merging didn't have we couldn't
you couldn't see commit messages when
you checked in files you can only check
unfollow time just crazy stuff like that
and made really like when we went we
went from dimensions to get like
people's minds be more sore they would
like you would go there office and they
were just be rubbing their head and I'm
trying to check in a file right and
you'd have to like the first few weeks
is like you have to like talk to them in
VA like a be like a therapist for them
or something so any other questions all
right how we do in the back there
yeah it kind of goes back to if it's one
of the things that's been building and
it's going to erupt at some point you
know all you can do is is raizle a flag
of going something Bad's about to happen
I think if there's basically if it's if
your resistance to the point where you
can't make any changes then you have to
fall back to can we monitor things so
that when the flood happens we know it
we have as early warning as possible for
resolving it and then the to try to get
people to come around just to kind of
see see the issue sometimes you have to
you have to see you have to get on there
so I just see why they don't see that
issue because a lot of times what
happens is their job just doesn't
intersect with the problem that you're
having and you kinda have to find a way
of relating the problem that you're
about to have or ever maybe everyone's
about to have with a problem that they
have already and kind of connected that
way and so that's that's really hard to
do if you're like talking about two
different completely different jobs
right but ya say monitoring early
warning make sure it's visible
communicated and then try to try to
become buddies with the people that are
going to help be that the you know the
help make change some other questions
yes we're here okay
uh yeah so something custom and it's
it's squirreled away in a home directory
somewhere in iron mountain or something
so basically what you can do is there is
so this is how is how I found how how to
do it was the dimensions install or
whatever had like a directory and it had
documentation I had a PDF and I oppa PDF
I had like every command that she could
run dimensions and I'm sort of looking
at them and some of them are terrifying
like delete OS right why is that the
command like what does it do you know
like I'll just run it and see and it
just doesn't work so I think there's a
command it's like it's been a while to
in a few years so I think it was
something like download or something
like that and basically what you can do
is you can get snapshots of all the
files for particular dates and what I
did is I wrote a script that would check
out all the files for a particular month
like the first of the month or last
month whichever way I did it and then it
would turn that into a tarball with a
commit message file that had like but
like there was some sort of dimensions
metadata stuff that I dumped into it as
the commitment the commit message and
then once I had the eight years of tar
balls then you can run get fast import
and that will take tar balls and turn
them actually in to commit messages so
there's some massaging there you had to
do to get it to work but that's what I
did and that was one of the cool things
about people who were used two
dimensions in that you could never tell
why a file to change or like what
wouldn't change who changed it what why
it changed it's really hard to tell was
the way we had to set up and so when I
was able to go to a file and I could say
hey you remember you know last year we
had that problem and and you know
someone's have fixed it had changed his
file I can do get blame and it would
there it would show that the changes
have been made around that time it
showed the diff or show lines I had
change and everything I was like really
cool when I could I could have all that
history and show off like this is what
we've been missing we've had this
information but it was just so hard to
get to I was really cool alright some
more questions yes sir yep yep who's
disconnected of course yes yep
it's the M word that you'll maybe hey is
metrics that's what they that's what
they go off of his metrics so the kind
of the nice thing that we had was very
up it was very nice that the metrics
that they were already capturing showed
that what we were doing was a lot better
but the problem we found like a year
after we had started making changes is
that they wanted more metrics they
wanted to see how much better are we and
like a lot of other places and that's
where some of the tools helped and that
we could we could start we could start
measuring things they started wanting to
go down things like we want like
developer productivity by slock and
stuff like that and I never really liked
doing that and never really supported
doing that but um so so basically you
have just manager who's two levels up
and he says these shall be the the
commandments you follow right and the
thing that goes back to what was he
measuring and if you're lucky he's
measuring something that your process
will either be exactly the same or your
process will be better right the
difficulty is that sometimes the things
that he's measuring don't make any sense
right and we had that for the coke
actually for the code reviews that we
did for the code inspections everyone
was fine with us doing the Garrett code
reviews but some people said oh we those
there should be converted back into code
inspections so that they can be imported
into some sort of crazy metric thing
that would tell them how many developers
they were going to need in six years or
whatever crazy thing it was and that was
based on the number of minutes spent in
a review the number of minutes spent
preparing for the review the number of
defects found all those kind of crazy
stuff so so that's one thing I I never
thought the numbers they were collecting
were very useful but I
found a way to get close enough to what
they were looking for and over the year
i think we had started and they were
really demanding the metrics we took all
the all the reviews we had done and got
the metrics gave them to the gave the
file to that mike did all the work to to
get it in a way they can import it and
when they did that they said never mind
we don't we don't want these reports
because what would happen what happened
over time is that on average a normal
project would have fewer than 100
reviews and a period in like a project
and we were having 200 a month or
something like that and so when we we
took the data imported it and gave it to
them it like screwed up all of their
metrics right there was like the VP's
chart like shows like all the projects
having the reviews everything and in
just one this one project having a spike
that was ten a hundred times bigger than
everyone else's and they basically said
we don't want your data anymore as your
date is not useful so what I would say
is that there are numbers there's unless
he's completely you know you know
irrational he thinks he's making
decisions based on metrics he's met you
think he's making rational decisions so
if you can find out what those metrics
are um I don't say you don't you don't
want to gain them but you want to
understand what they are and and say
what can we do so that are what we want
to change is going to make those metrics
look better right and that's that's how
you have to like you have to get on his
level like these are the numbers you're
looking at we know that they're kind of
stupid we know they're not really
connected to things like that's I think
that's the second that's the second
tactic but it's a lot more dangerous of
of saying you know all those metrics
that you're collecting they don't
actually mean anything they don't they
don't that the stick the thumbs in your
years they won't listen to you that
point but yes it's like you kind of want
to know what their metrics are how how
is your house your improvement going to
infect those metrics and then I think
any sane person would say hey we're
going to make it better they would say
okay
it just comes then comes down to a
budget time schedule all that stuff but
how much you can do about that right all
right this is another question I think I
go back in yep yep
hmm
mmm
right right but like what is he doing
right um so it depends on how fanatical
he is about waterfall I guess um a lot
of people i don't particularly subscribe
to the opinion but some people feel
comfortable of describing the agile
process as mini mini tiny waterfalls so
it depends on how how rigid he is in
terms of mm-hmm yeah he won he wants to
he wants to have six months down the
line what features are we gonna have or
whatever right right
yeah um yeah we had simply last year or
so I was I was a job we had a similar
kind of struggle going on of our process
was very very waterfall and not that we
were trying to do agile but there were
people who were saying they were trying
to their fun trying to figure out some
way of saying that because we released
once a year that we were we were agile
because we could go a lot slower because
historically releases had been ten years
so they were saying comparatively we're
a July um so yeah I in your particular
locate particular situation it's hard to
tell being on what the structure is in
terms of our your are you peers or is he
technically supposed to be telling you
what to do or or whatever I would say
that you want to UM you want to be
friendly if he's going to be able to be
a destructive force right if he can
derail the agile steps that you're
taking or impede those but you have to
yeah you have to make it clear it may be
just another metric singer you have to
make it clear these these are the
reasons why we picked agile write
whether there's it's not we didn't do a
job because a gel is good we did agile
because it does what we need it to do
for our organization and that might be
where he's coming from as well with
waterfall waterfall is what we do
because it tells me that in six months
we're going to have a feature or
something like that yeah it's really
hard um I don't think there's any silver
bullet for that I'm sorry yeah I feel
for you oh I'll keep you in my prayers
yeah you had a question over here
you
how
right right um so I had a similar thing
going on we are billed was a ant
makefile shell script hybrid I'll say
and going through and trying to
understand exactly like really do a deep
dive on what that build was doing and
what was the output of that build
uncovered a lot of weird things in terms
of people had checked in binary so he
had been running against some library
that had been compiled in someone's desk
top three years ago it's like how how
did I get there also we had things where
we had jars that were apparently
critical for the system to even function
and we had no idea where they came from
they were just like three class files in
a jar that would checked in and had to
be included and so part of that could be
it so you're sort your your question is
more of a how do i migrated from just
chaos right so just not knowing what's
going on there to something that's I
have control over and it's the same
story for how you meet an elephant it's
one bite at a time what you want to do
is try to as much as possible keep
outputs the same so if the software is
business critical then you need to have
some way of knowing that when you change
something in the chaos that the output
is going to be the same output as before
so it's sometimes really hard to tell
where you can start but there's like
little things you can do in terms of the
movie that comparison part is that
replace to start or is really specific
to what you probably have but basically
it's it's you want to have a way of
knowing that when you've changed
something you it's not breaking because
you change something but maybe
breaking because the process has always
been broken that's always a good place
else ammunition of saying you know this
is a business critical thing and every
six times it's broken right and we
didn't even change anything right and
you hit exposed mm-hmm you get
ammunition you get you get basically
latitude to stop the pain do something
about it and then that's that's where it
becomes really important for you to be
restraint restrain yourself to say all
this stuff is just crap I want to
replace it and rip it out you have to
really really be careful about that
because yes yes yes it's very important
because it can be very easy to you know
just basically blow you know all the
goodwill all the work you've done and
basically plunge everyone back into dark
ages right again right so yeah yeah okay
there's any other questions good all
right i hope you enjoyed everything um
hopefully i wasn't too boring so all
right thank you
huh sure i haven't uploaded them yet but
I will all of them so the understood
where they show up but yeah if i do that
um or you also can send me an email um
my emails or something yeah he also sent
me an email at sterling at Gradle com I
can also send you that
I had a lot prettier picture for the the
new process i had like little pictures
of the tools and stuff but I've lost
that chart somewhere and I just didn't
feel like remaking it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
