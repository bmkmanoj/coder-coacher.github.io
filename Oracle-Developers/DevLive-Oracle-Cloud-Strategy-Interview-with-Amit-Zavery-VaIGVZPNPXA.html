Israel just outside tel-aviv
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest today
Amit savory who is the senior VP for
cloud platform as well as integration
products so I meet welcome assure thank
you so you had a great keynote from
house yes you covered a lot of area in
in terms of developing modern
applications everything from API micro
services chat BOTS so we just passed
them and just Fisher talked a little bit
about each each area yeah a hundred
percent I think the way to look at this
is that there is a new way of developing
applications right the way of building
application has changed as you need a
platform which can deliver a lot of the
newer requirements and deal with all the
new needs custom developers have today
around the polyglot kind of clock
platform so that you can have different
programming languages and read the
covers you need ability to do micro
services so you're not building
monolithic application but cutting it
down into lot more micro services as
well as providing an API so it's kind of
mindset and then providing ability to
build that application delivered through
new interfaces through messengering
services and mobile so that's really
what I wanted to cover is say hey the
developer paradigm has changed and how
you deliver to that has change and how
how does the platform really kind of
deliver those needs and make it easy for
developers to get that the requirements
met okay it's a very broad area and I
know like in previous interviews you've
covered about how kind of Oracle kind of
started off with the software in
software as a service and moved to
platform as a service and then now
through infrastructure so we've got
pretty much the full stack we've been
getting some traction I guess in terms
of dev test maybe in some cases in
production but from an overall strategy
standpoint and we've made article has
made some acquisitions
you want to just kind of talk a little
bit about where we were you say I think
the Oracle started and we've been in the
cloud space for many many years ten plus
years right I think we started with
rewriting our applications as a cloud
applications at 10 plus years
so we've been doing that and making sure
from the top down the applications are
cloud-based then we what we did was take
a lot of the things we were doing on the
platform side and redo that for the
cloud make it cloud native and make sure
that again it's much broader set of
functionality which used to be required
for the next McLeod native workers is
provided in a platform and then we have
the infrastructure to support that and
infrastructure the service to kind of
either build any kind of custom
workloads or Oracle workloads on today
all right so that's really how we were
thinking about it our goal is to really
make sure all of the things are
integrated works together uses make uses
all the latest technologies in the in as
part of our stack and gives anybody a
choice in terms of how you deploy it you
can deploy it in Oracle public cloud or
you can deploy it on your own data
center of choice so that you know log
into one environment or the other and
your flexibility of deployments all
right so that's how we've been looking
at and we've been doing a for
acquisitions region acquisitions on the
sash side on the application side we're
in acquisition on the platform side
companies like apiary for example which
is one of the largest provider of
tooling for doing design and governance
of api's they have close to two hundred
twenty thousand developers use it on a
regular basis to build design API right
we just recently bought a company called
worker which is really going up to the
space of doing orchestration and
automation of docker images and be able
to build on top of that very easily as
well no no I think in your presentation
that was covered that we can actually
offer everything from Oracle database to
everything as dr. images yes some
presenters we basically to realize the
customers and developers want to have
their preference for docker as the
container service and we will make it
easy for anybody to take any of our
software and run it as docker images and
available on docker store easy to find
we provide a lot of uh code on github
for example as well so we try to make
sure that every place the developer is
they have ability to find Oracle
products and Oracle code information and
they can start working from there right
okay while I was waiting for your
keynote to start I was sitting next to a
developer and he asked me an interesting
question which I would like to pose to
you so he said to me yeah I know what
article but I you know primarily in
Israel there's a lot of startups much
more smaller companies and large
companies and he said you know for most
of us most of in their space they use
AWS not to knock AWS but how how do we
are we particle position with compared
to the desert no I think it's fair
question I think AWS definitely has the
mind shed on the infrastructure side it
was the business they RN is really so
far around outsourcing your hardware and
infrastructure and make it easy to
procure and make it agile in terms of
how you add more and more capacity as
you need or reduce capacity if you don't
want to pay for it which is a great
thing
the way we've been approaching the cloud
business is beyond just infrastructure
right so we started as I said with
applications which is a broad set of
capabilities required for running your
business once you have that you want to
be able to extend those applications to
make it very specific to your business
needs or you want to do something
differently around those applications
this is where the platform comes into
play
all right so platform as a service for
us is one is a generic platform for
building and delivering applications the
second thing is to extend those
applications and secure them integrate
them those kind of requirements they're
coming in and to run this platform in
your infrastructure so you can run that
into user infrastructure for running
Oracle platform Oracle SAS or any custom
workloads you might have but we of
course make sure that you can work in it
done anything on that as well as Oracle
workloads the best efficiently on that
as well right so that's how we
approaching the cloud needs versus
Amazon we see them as definitely one of
the core providers of iis which is where
most of today's cloud deployment at
least on the infrastructure side is
happening right but once you start
seeing going beyond that this is the
power of our integrated stack comes in
where you have the SAS has and is all
working together very highly
differentiated enterprise workload
running very high performance scalable
systems and understanding of a lot of
the non-traditional workloads like or
which people might not have done a lot
of work around right so we've done a lot
of optimizations around that we mean
things much easier to use very modern
and the other things we differentiate
against at AWS is really around this
idea of that it can run anywhere all
right so you can take our saw
cloud offerings take the same stack and
say you know what I don't want to run it
on public cloud around behind my
firewall which is pretty typical in
countries like Israel with these
regulations government agencies
financial services and many other
countries we see a lot of this
regulatory requirement where you cannot
move the data production data into the
public public cloud and we provide the
full stack available behind the firewall
which AWS doesn't provide all right so
if you start getting into those needs it
becomes very tricky with AWS where
you're very locked in and you have no
other choice either rewrite it if you
want to move somewhere else or get stuck
on that matches each one our public
cloud as well as cloud as customer
witches are offering behind the firewall
in the same way we upgrade with maintain
we patch full service same pricing as
public cloud but the customers have a
choice which is a great I mean we talked
to many of our customers are very
excited about this things we have been
selling it over the last year or so and
the uptick is have been amazing
yeah other wante that delicata impresses
me about the whole oracle product
portfolio is how much choice we give
customers I mean you talked about before
about polyglot as in the same thing
whether people want the public cloud of
private clouds at the height the height
the hybrid offerings so no not out there
these choice is important and I think we
have to make it clear to come in we've
been doing a lot of discussions about
how we provide the value architectural e
how do you make it simple for moving the
workloads how the hybrid architecture
works so customers don't have to deal ad
with any other stuff you want to talk
briefly because obviously this this so
much in the product portfolio is if a
developer wants to check out some of the
Oracle cloud offerings and a wave of got
a special deal going on you wanna talk
just a little bit about that in terms of
trying out there's our lookup so we do
need to provide trial services and we do
provide some credits for developers to
try out that so today for example an
Oracle code for people who are visiting
this event and we will give you five
hundred dollars worth of credits to go
and sign on and use any of our services
there's no restriction any of the
services available to them alright and
that's the best way to see what we have
to offer right I mean the breadth as I
said earlier is very very good
it's much broader in terms of our
functionality than any other wonder I
mean we can challenge anyone in that
space into the breadth and capabilities
we have and the enemies very well
integrated and easy to use in model
right all right okay so you mentioned
also in the keynote this is your first
time in Israel as it is mine
is it okay it is anything that kind of
really struck out for you or just in
terms of
I've been definitely surprised about how
the infrastructure well developed the
country has been I'm definitely meeting
a lot of the startups over here they've
been all the feed all the information I
have seen so far very impressive work
being done here and the whole capability
and excitement around the
next-generation products and the
technologies has been very eye-opening
for me
oh it's been very very exciting all
right I know I meet you got a busy
schedule but we really appreciate your
time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
