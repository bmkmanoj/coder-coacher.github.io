guess there are evening sessions for the
diehards but for against the normal
attendees this is loaded last session of
the day here so tempted to make it a bit
enjoyable and see if we can talk about
not necessarily the technical details of
you know how to develop IOT using Java
but more important how do you bring that
to market quick how do you keep yourself
from you know futzing around in a
Raspberry Pi for six months and losing
sight of the fact that you're actually
trying to create the next nest and walk
away with that three billion dollars in
Ian and we believe that the solution we
have and I'm going to talk about is
something that we can help you with my
name is Matt sammelsohn I work for a
company called acceder at least we still
call that today we were recently
acquired by a company that are big in
the cad atul space ptc it's a
boston-based company and so next time
you hear about us would probably have a
different name and I'll talk a little
about that at the end it's interesting
to hear the we talk about the language
of the internet'll things is that the
whenever I come to these conferences I
grew up in Sweden and that's a country
with about nine million speaking a
relatively relevant language but first
thing I heard yesterday when I had a cup
of coffee was a bunch of sweep sitting
in the corner and this morning as I came
down in the elevator there was a Swedish
guy and chatted with him and there were
25 suites living in that hotel so I
guess he as far as having strange
languages in Java that's the nature of
the beast but the well this is obviously
coming together and it is coming
together in a very interesting evolution
that we can also it shows us a company
to focus on and that is Java 8 our
thinking was that when it comes to IOT
that
is an evolving business and we should
therefore focus on what it is that is
being released and so we've had the
opportunities to work directly with
Oracle on some of the activities and
I'll talk a little about that key is
that Java 8 is critical both for devices
and for applications it is becoming the
language of Internet of Things exceed as
a company company I work for we've been
around for a while probably the largest
cloud iot cloud in the world we got a
couple of million devices or you know
the company is in the remote services
space but the customers we have or truly
a blue-chip the biggest companies in the
world or using our technology for their
products as you can see we're very big
in the medical device manufacturers with
big in telecom we begin software and
industrial manufacturers and so why is
that important well when you go and
going to create that next nest you want
to you know put your belts with a
company that can actually deliver your
scaling because any idiot can build
something that works on telephones but
if you want to work it on on 10 million
or a hundred million you're going to
need some resources that go beyond that
startup or maybe even the division that
you're working in right now what would
we do connect the devices we've been
working with that and we're working a
lot with you know I T devices and IOT
applications the last couple of years
but what's important with our platform
is that it is not IOT applications only
it also handles you know those critical
aspects of device management how do you
bring you know million devices online
and how do you upgrade them you know
it can get to the point how do you
service them if you need to do that if
you did a bad product and more important
how do you handle all the data that is
coming in from those devices in a
meaningful way and make it available to
what you really going to sell you're
going to sell IOT applications so I'm up
kind of a engineer from the start but I
am a business and marketing guy and one
of the things always important to
remember is the old Philip Kotler you
know one of the main chemical
influential professors in marketing who
created the whole notion of the
discussion he was a professor at
Northwestern back in the 60s and they
were talking about the cosmetics
industry and the class you know they
were said you know asking so what are
these guys doing in the cosmetics
industry and the class was talking about
chemicals they were talking about
packaging talk about everything and he
finally said no they selling hope and I
think you know when it comes to internal
things what we're really selling here is
hope I think we're selling a common
belief that this is going to happen in
the future but I'm still kind of I've
been around long enough in the telecom
industry to realize that what people
talked about in you know today and what
they talked about him in like cellular
data services you know ten years ago
suddenly changed overnight from as a
mouse to applications running on phones
and all it took was for Apple to release
a phone and it completely changed the
industry overnight I they have to think
that a lot of the examples that people
talk about today and you can see you
know when I go and when I go on the web
and try to find a Java IOT device all I
can come up with is a kind of a remote
meter but these are not going to be
representative of the all the type of
devices and services we're going to see
the good news is we don't know what they
are today because if I didn't know what
they were today I would be investing in
those companies and then I would retire
and have a nice and quiet life the good
news again I don't know that so that
means that I have a challenge and
interesting life
you know career ahead of me here so what
we went ahead so the question is in
order for us to the weird cloud service
provider but in order for us to connect
millions of devices we have to make it
as easy to do that as possible we also
have to kind of make it cheap we don't
charge anything for our software to
develop devices what you do is you pay
well now you use our cloud service and
you pay on a monthly basis yearly basis
per device so we met with Oracle little
over a year ago and they basically said
you know we're in the process here
bringing out Java 8 and we really
interested in working with you as you
know you know cloud opportunities there
so we pretty much had the opportunity to
working hand-in-hand with Oracle as they
have been bringing out the Java ME eight
and the Java lc8 reference architectures
and also initial you know software
downloads in fact we spent a couple of
months in beginning of this year
troubleshooting some of their reference
applications as they were going through
their release cycles so when we decided
you know what to do we basically said
okay so if it's going to be easy to
connect to our platform what we need to
do is we need to create your tool kits
very simple tool kits abstraction layers
api's that makes it very very easy to
connect to our cloud platform so you may
wander there now what is this you know a
MMP protocol what the hell is that all
about I haven't seen that before and we
kind of looked at a lot of the standard
stuff we have been using proprietary
protocols for quite some time we have
developed solutions to connect any
proprietary protocol or standard
protocol to our platform without any
issues but we had long realized that we
needed a good long whole protocol for
embedded devices with very very low
footprint so we went ahead and created a
you know as simple a protocol
that works with our data model as
possible this doesn't mean that it's the
only protocol will support we are
evolving into anything so if you want to
migrate to something else eventually
that's fine but the initial set of
libraries we created was for the using
the amp toolkit the amp protocol and the
good news with that is that it can get
you connected up to our platform in the
cloud on our developer platform Ian you
know half an hour instead of futzing
around with a bunch of you know
different protocols etc we also made
these available for anyone that
registers on on our developer platform
or a developer website as Java toolkits
and as developers reference guides and
then what we have gone ahead and created
is a set or what we call go kits which
are available by going to this simple
URL and the go kids what are they well
what are the good news items with
working with Oracle is that they told us
out of time what the reference
architectures were I think the one
people talk most about here is the
Raspberry Pi they also have the Qualcomm
Gopi platform and the util aight is a
recent selection for the java SE and
you'd like this an Israeli company this
is a low-cost complete computer arm and
it's a free scale based dual core
architecture it's about two hundred
dollars yeah so what we said ok so these
are the first initial three so let's
make it easy for anyone to buy these and
just provide the instructions on what it
takes to you know download the right
java thing i think we can have to change
these instructions because things are
now coming preloaded with java i know
for example i got to go back and get the
instructions for the Raspberry Pi change
something that was released you know a
couple of weeks ago so will will change
that but you can buy these toolkits you
can go to orgo Java 8 and you can get
instructions as to how to connect them
to our cloud platform so what does that
mean well the goal kits step by step it
provides you with a development
environment with some Java sample
applications and we have this developer
environment called toolbox to lexie
delcom which is a complete instance of
our cloud platform and it provides
applications examples we actually went
ahead and created you know one of the
one of the issues always with these like
raspberry PI's and things like that how
do you get some sort date on to it how
do you so you end up you know in a
spaghetti with a bunch of wires and and
prototyping boards and things like that
so we said well you know what that's
that's that's unnecessarily difficult so
why don't we just go ahead and create a
chrome app and nice thing with chrome
apps is that you can basically plug them
into your serial port with a null modem
cable and then connected to the
Raspberry Pi for example on the other
side and we created the data injector
that works with a nice little
demonstration user applications you can
literally once you get this up and
running you can you know go ahead and
change your values for the data items
and you can see how the air conditioner
demo actually works and how all the
changes over there and it's very easy to
expand things from there we wanted to
make sure that things became visible
really quick so that the proof of
concept it becomes real you could
actually do a proof of concept after
this step build you know call your own
IT device and you can go ahead and show
it for whomever you needs to see it
whether it's a venture capital whether
it's your department head or whether
it's you know some executives within the
company that you're working for what you
do will be visible and it would be a
bill tangible something that you can
work on so that's the show and health
part and then basically what we have is
we have a seamless way or bringing that
up migrating that to a full cloudy
instance that you can use for showing
and testing and once you're ready for
that it's ready to be deployable on our
cloud and it can be scaled to any size
that you want so what we really done is
we've solved the problem of going from
an IT device to a complete IOT
deployment and one a couple things we're
doing while we're doing that is of equal
importance and it goes back to the
question of what is IOT what business
are you in so very simple no reference
architectures this is what it looks like
this is what the website looks like
something heading in the wrong direction
here so that's why I'm having problems
so the next thing these are the
instructions we talked about those
that's the stuff where you buy it and
what it is you need to buy this is the
developer tool box and it basically it
tells you you build your own software
and and you download that and you load
it onto the Raspberry Pi and then here's
the demo application which is driven by
this user interface which is you know a
keg and google chrome app and as you
change data you can click on the
different buttons and you will see you
know things change in a you know kind of
a realistic scenario there so referent
POC prototype and then you can go ahead
and finalize some paddy so that's you
know taking you through these steps in a
very very quick way much quicker than
the other approach that you know we've
seen on the market so there so that's
kind of the whole device port the only
question is okay the other problem we
need to solve is the problem of
collectivity so if I'm going to have you
know million of these like an else did
the North America I got to find a good
way that i can connect and one of the
good things with our cloud platform is
that we connect in every conceivable way
and we the other thing that is good news
is that we not kind of a single device
connectivity platform so if you want to
develop a kind of an application that
uses a Raspberry Pi architecture and you
want to combine that with say vehicle
tracking or people tracking you can buy
run of the bill tracker devices and make
them part of your application so you're
not kind of limited to this you know one
device world of the thing that you are
only working if your company needs to
see a bigger thing you know tracking
trucks or tracking people or you know
doing things based on temperatures
outside or whatever conceivable scenario
you're talking about you can implement
that right away from the start and the
secret to that is that we use a common
data model of course all these devices
so they basically talk the same language
now that language is not java it's our
data model but everything we use in
implementing that that is the based on
Java so once you have done that you
connect you actually get to what what is
basically on IOT dashboard and this is
kind of an environment where you will
see whatever your devices are doing and
this is the way to get into the detail
level you can you know check that each
device is functioning it would be based
on colors you can group devices you can
you know you know provision devices
different ways you can download software
to devices and it is a very very
complete platform it was in which you
can build your own it cannot device
management custom interfaces for the
particular business that you you have so
so what this part does its actually
creates a an interface into managing
your business and you know that's very
important when you're going to deploy
something and Cree
new business how are you going to manage
all of these devices how you're going to
know what's going on and that's why you
need our platform our platform is also
where all the data gets some too and it
gets collected and it is made available
to applications and api's and to
streaming interfaces etc it is not a
long term storage solution we will take
data we will hold it for 90 days and the
whole idea is that this is kind of
managing the present and part of the
past if you want history then you will
use some type of data storage capability
and it's easy to develop those
interfaces using the API development
tools that we have so in this particular
case you can click on a particular
device find out what's wrong with it
more important we do have for example a
play we have integration already into
the year say salesforce com so that you
can build the business if you have
current customers that are supported
with salesforce com with some other you
know CRM system you can integrate your
new IT based product offering right into
that and if you go to if you go to you
know stores like home depot today you're
beginning to see you know connected
devices like heaters and
air-conditioning units and things like
that and they sell for a substantial
premium what we kind of offer is the
ability to create those type of
businesses based on and then quickly
implement it into the current way of
running your business in in the company
or whether you're creating a new one you
don't have to do this from scratch the
next thing is creating applications and
one of the great aspects of our current
acquisition was that we were acquired
shortly after a competing company was
acquired and the competing company was
very much focused on you know creating
great-looking applications and mashups
for consumers and for business users etc
while our strengths were basically the
big cloud the volume
connectivity and all the you know
connectivity tools and Java 8 tool kits
etc so what we are offering during the
fall on our developer site it's not
released yet it will be released in
october is the ability then to take the
next step you can now start to use their
mashup tool and you can develop your
direct applications and those can be
everything conceivable you know it is
very high-powered graphical development
environment it can be anything from you
know tracking don't crops it can be
anything from consumer applications and
the good news is that these are created
in an environment and you can make them
available not only on your customer
website but you can also make them
available in the sport of phone
application in this part of your tablets
etc so this kind of solves the third
problem that you have in creating your
IT business you know how do I get
something that is sellable to my my
EMU's er I am personally convinced that
one of the reasons that these early IOT
applications thermostats and other
things are so popular is simply because
they become very good kind of
conversations that the cocktail party or
at the the be at school or work or
something like that they look what I
have you can show it on your phone and
everyone thinks it's absolutely
fantastic and that kind of explains part
of it some of that will become old hat
after a while and then they become you
know what I call important parts of your
life and it is those IMT aspects of our
life that we we showed you don't know
what they are today i have no idea i
needed a applications on my phone ten
years ago because they didn't exist
where they were very poor at that time
so you can go ahead and build to your
you know heart's delight design whatever
way you want and the good news this is
not you know two years later you're
basically able to do this within
you know the first 60 days and talk
about having something that you can
prototype and show from a proof of
concept then of course we get to the
whole part of creating the whole
business and that is you know you
integrate the solution with the you know
the whole management of it the devices
itself and then the consumer
applications going with it so for those
of you who are not familiar with Nast
why were they so successful from as far
as selling the company well they did
something that is difficult to do they
got their stuff into home depot end and
the other places and they managed to
create a business of selling a million
in one year and that you know was
basically they created 100 million
dollar revenue stream very very quickly
and with that type of growth if you're
in Silicon Valley you know what type of
exit opportunity that generates and what
I'm telling you is that there's plenty
you can do this again we are you know
working with many of the companies that
provided the technology for nest we were
not part of most unfortunately but the
if they had used our platform they would
have been able to do it even easier they
would have been able to develop their
own health of value at the business
proposition and then focus on the
difficult part and that is to get these
things manufactured in China get the
quality level up get them into walmart
and home depot and everyone else so this
is all about you know the creating an
m2m dirty business and they create your
own world of connected devices and Java
is a critical part of doing that as you
develop this business you're going to be
using Java in every conceivable part of
it and of course we use Java when we
develop it so what does it take to get
started well pretty we try to make it as
easy as possible so we took exceeded or
common say / go Java and that's you will
get everything you need
get moving and the you know I've already
shown this this is basically getting
started pages for our toolkits and what
we really want you to do is to find out
more is to visit our Tosk the people
technically response will make this
happen is filled and Jeremy and they
sitting right there we like you to go
and talk to them find out everything you
want to know about what it takes to get
going quickly I think they will be able
to tell you you can get started faster
into the IT space using this solution
than anything else we also have you know
you always learn something when you go
to developer conferences and there's one
thing in attending the conference is
another thing in actually being there so
the learning experience we have the this
year is that developers don't have
business cards anymore so our original
idea was okay well we'll we'll have a
bucket you can do business cards and
drawing so we've seen that done in other
places well that doesn't works anyway so
we're scanning your name and then at the
end of the week we are going to we
actually going to give you a ten of
these that you could because people
would say you know why you why are you
having going through nine devices well
it was three per day that was the whole
intelligent thing but come see us in our
booth you can see the actual prototype
with raspberry pi life you can talk to
our developers and basically they will
tell you everything that you need to do
to get going and my final thing is as we
move ahead and the next time we see each
other we're not going to be exceeded but
we are actually going to going to be
called thing works at that time but
that's nothing you should worry about it
will be the same grade technology with
even more fantastic user interfaces
thank you very much appreciate your time
and effort and uh I think I've told you
a secret and that is how you get your IT
business started quick
sure that was yeah so so one of the it's
obviously we implement as a cell
security and you know one of the great
things with using our platform you you
see you know we have a roster of 150 of
the biggest companies in the world so we
have obviously been able to address
their security concerns you know we've
never had any you know security why they
would connect an air conditioner with an
IT system that handles credit cards is
beyond me we certainly don't I wouldn't
mind having credit cards but that's not
something we do I mean we don't do that
as part of our or business that doesn't
mean that it's not something that we
have to work on all the time and but you
know we have a lot of experience in
hosting and we have been doing it for
quite some time yeah yeah absolutely aha
a friendly or unfriendly questions
earlier he what there you could go ahead
yeah
the exhibit hall
very
essentially
I
yet visual
basically big blow
so but we see the technology depends
upon is the security of the operating
system I think this cradle to grave
story that work
ecosystem really lots of reasons about
Java running everywhere yeah kind of
weird everywhere but in a world of IOT
devices from people that have helped 200
customers connect their stuff to the
cloud the people who are using Java have
these guys with their two Chainz mercy
cross compilers just get something to
work
much longer
well thank you everyone and have a
pleasant evening appreciate your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
