Washington DC I'm Bob Newhart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
the first in a series of live interviews
we'll be doing today from this event my
first guest is Dave petal finger David
tell the folks at home what you do and
where you doing hello I'm an independent
consultant here in the Washington DC
area my client is a large government
contractor we work in a Java EE
application large-scale application that
once it goes to production will be used
pretty much all over the country tell me
about your session at today's event what
will you be talking about so I'm going
to be talking about the mystifying micro
services for Java EE developers so a lot
of us developers are still working on
traditional monolithic applications and
we're here about this micro services and
we're kind of curious about you know
what can they do and can we use Java EE
to develop in this style and my session
would cover those kinds of things
what edge do Java EE developers have
when it comes to developing micro
services well I can be singing my talk
Java EE can be used to develop micro
services a lot of modern application
servers are embeddable so you embed your
app server with your application I
deploy it as a single module so that
will be your micro service what would
you describe is a typical challenge that
Java EE developers face in working with
micro services I will say that primarily
misconception the Java EE may not be
suitable for micro services development
that is simply not not the case it is
actually very nice and easy to to
develop micro services in the technology
stack what would you attribute that
misperception to it's a mainly the
perception of Java EE application
servers being big resources you know not
really nimble not really small that may
have been the case in the past but that
is not the case anymore
you have any
other events on your calendar will you
be speaking well I plan to submit a
couple of proposals for Java one in
October hopefully I'll get accepted I'll
be speaking in San Francisco in Astoria
when you're not speaking in events what
sort of projects are you currently
involved in well primarily a large-scale
enterprise Java I also do a technical
writing on the side I have published
several books so that's something I do
in my spare time if you will you know
evenings and weekends if you'd like to
attend an Oracle cloud event there are
let me think sixteen more in this series
we'll find more information on this
series of events at developer oracle.com
slash code along with information on how
you can send the desist session proposal
for an upcoming Oracle code event for
the Oracle technology Network I'm Bob
Newhart thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
