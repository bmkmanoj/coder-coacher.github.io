good it's good to be here at Orca world
yeah there's what a great show we're
having it's um you know we've all do all
week long lots of great interviews lots
of activity and new announcements lots
of customer interest and Larry is very
exciting and now I'm spend about the
autonomous database it's great direction
for the Oracle database community great
direction for Oracle great direction for
our cloud so it's give give me your
perspective on the autonomous database
what is the autonomous database so from
my side what you traditionally would
have is you buy an Oracle database or
any database and then you would have to
manage that and so then your job of
managing that database was to be as
efficient as possible and automate as
much as possible so you would develop
scripts and techniques and get
Enterprise Manager and all these things
to make your life easier and now we
reached this point with a generation or
iteration of software where all the
automation it just kind of takes over
and you don't need to have a human
saying yes I think I should back my
database up and yes I think I should do
X Y or Z it can be autonomous it can
make those things and that that that
jump from human directed to to fully
autonomous has just many advantages it
opens up I'm a developer right so from a
developer's perspective it's really
great because there's no the computers
not going to tell me no you can't do
that it's gonna say of course Mike I'd
be happy to give you a database
instantaneously I don't have to wait I
can do it at 10:00 at night I can do it
in Hong Kong I can do it anywhere I want
to so I don't have to to curry favor
with my favorite DBA to have them do
something for me anyway so it but it is
there's a number of dimensions to it I
just think that that they're having this
a true service it's just fully automated
is just gonna be a game changer oh good
well you know a lot of buzz about it a
lot of excitement there is an I was
wondering that maybe the customers would
take it badly or something like that but
I think that there really is very strong
interest in it and a lot of people see
the value instantly maybe the
self-driving cars have that perk
people's interest or they they've
realized that the the world of the
future is going to be have a lot of
autonomy in it and a lot of lot of
things that take
care of themselves right well good so
what else is happening with the I mean
your let's talk a little bit about next
day the Express yes I want to talk about
exit Express not everyone knows what x8
Express is and it's interesting in that
it's runs on Oracle's premier hardware
platform X data so you get Oracle's best
hardware with highest availability but
yet it's our lowest cost database cloud
service and so it kind of has this odd
dichotomy of being both but what it
allows you to do is it gives you access
to we have these newer shapes now that
as of about a week ago before you could
only have up to 50 gigabytes but now we
offer up to a terabyte of storage and
before we had only offer one o CPU and
now we offer up to four so we're
substantially larger and more capable
and we have a low introductory price of
$175 a month so it's a very attractive
price point
another differentiator with x8 Express
people might not know is it is fully
managed so if you're a DBA and you want
to SSH the box this would not be your
service so what what it is is that the
database is just taken care of by Oracle
Oracle backs it up Oracle recovers it
Oracle upgrades it you don't get to
choose when you your upgrades happen
Oracle's chooses that for you right now
we're on our latest database 12:2 when
we go to 18 Oracle will suck the time
and do that so there are some trade-offs
but what's nice about this is it is if
you're running something like Oracle
application Express or some platform
like that it provides a a very very nice
platform there's just no worries this
Oracle has has everything I'm not gonna
call it fully autonomous because I think
to be fully autonomous that needs to
make a few more decisions and I think
Larry said our fully autonomous database
would be next calendar year for our oil
TP style databases decision support
coming in December um but but yeah so so
I want to just kind of cover a couple
more things about X date Express so
Oracle has a number of customers that
might be using let's say Oracle forms
on-premise and they want to modernize
they want to have a web browser
experience they want to to bring their
applications that they built bespoke
custom applications up to the latest in
standards and application Express
provides this kind of seamless
transition where they can use the people
this same skill so people I saw you were
building at an apex application
yesterday and if you are a single guru
you just just gravitate towards
application Express because it really
puts equal front and center and lets you
do everything you want to do in sequel
but visualize the data and updated data
through a web browser and so butBut when
you want to you'll see a two forms
application you're running it on premise
and you want to move that to the cloud
it's kind of like you can kind of kill
two birds in one stone with the
migration so not only modernizing your
infrastructure moving to the cloud
saving money on administration overhead
and burden and and shifting the burden
of the administration to Oracle but
you're also oh you can provide a
seamless or reasonably easy migration to
a much more modern platform that will
you know be perceived as
industry-leading and modern as opposed
to you know Oracle forms is it was
released close to 30 years ago yeah it's
very good for 30 years old software and
yeah so Oracle's latest version of
application Express is on the service so
not only do you get a database but you
got a fully configured mid tier so we
run WebLogic so so we need web logic to
facilitate access to Oracle apex and we
need to be able to run Oracle rest data
services so you can do rest service
publishing so if you wanted you had date
in your database you want to publish as
a rest service for consumption from any
source you could do that
so this platform not only comes with an
or a database but it comes with with the
full ecosystem so it's really a
solutions platform in a box granted his
database centric but it allows for full
access additionally for those that don't
know X data Express also offers full
sequel to access the predecessor service
was what we call the schema service not
offer sequel net access so you couldn't
run sequel developer natively you
couldn't connect a JDBC application you
couldn't run any but now that we support
sequel net any any application pretty
much ever
for databases is gonna work just fine
with the service as well it is a huge
used use nice nice feature and new
shapes new shapes are big that's a real
big big thing for us so you get most of
the features of Enterprise Edition so
you get compression as well so our
largest shape isn't 1 terabyte but if
you compress that and conservatively get
4 X I'd be like a 4 terabyte database
that might not be big enough for you
it's our smallest database but it does
go up to you know a 1.1 terabyte
uncompressed and infi and if you're on
compression you can you can do better so
nice I think that's it's a great it's a
great value it's a great sort of way to
kick the tires of the cloud and see if
you like the self-manage two databases
now it usually has the most recent and
supported version of Oracle database
that's right and so not only the
database software is maintained X
application Express is maintained or
christena services maintained so all of
them it is ladies in grades it might be
a month or two months delay and ticking
things up just to make sure that
everything goes well and we have a full
battery of tests so that's what one of
the nice things that we have is that
with our particular architecture we make
sure that we fully test it and make sure
everything's good and if it and if
anything ever happens you just call
support and we can rectify it instantly
so it's and we're vailable 24/7 so it's
a its difference not for everybody but
but it's it's sort of the a window into
the future of application development
yeah so where do you develop do you have
a workspace on internal development VMS
but it would be interesting to move one
of the things we as developers sometimes
we like to be able to have full control
of the database and such and we need to
test older versions and newer versions
but when we deploy we deploy into the
Oracle cloud so then we seed the control
so as a developer sometimes I like and
with application Express for example you
can develop on your notebook you can
develop on a private server you can
develop anywhere you'd like
Oracle XE our free database develop
there sure and but when you deploy it
and and it has to work 24/7 it's nice to
have a full team
and even if you were willing to support
your own product internally to your
company 2417 you might not have every
skill what if the network went down what
if the web server went down what if the
database went down what if there's an
issues about the application what if
there is an issue with with with
something so Oracle brings expertise
across the board and again can involve
development this is just a whole
holistic solution that we can bring to
market at a very very reasonable price
great well thanks so much that's part
one because mike has another section
that we're going to do right now so sit
tight and we'll do our next section ok
we need to get that working ok ready
all right
all right and we're back with my kids
were again here at Oracle OpenWorld so
what else so wouldn't the Oracle world
without talking about application
Express oh thank goodness I wanted to
talk about that okay and right now we
have our version 5-1 we've we've had a
number of patches on that so 503 is our
latest and greatest is super stable and
and the whole 5x5 has really been a game
changer for us so we introduced this
feature called universal theme which
provides a fully responsive user
interface so you can focus on writing
sequel queries and and deciding what
your application looks like and the
actual CSS and HTML and JavaScript used
to render the pages and modal dialogs
provide responsive and mobile support is
all just kind of taking care of you for
free and so that's been it's really
increased the adoption and and and
breadth of the Oracle apex apex is
always sort of popular but it's kind of
taking it to a new level and so a real
real pleased with that and so with five
five oh and five one we have a really
solid base and we're extending it now
with with apex 5 - it's not yet released
it's gonna release to this this fiscal
year but I wanted to kind of talk about
what what it's gonna have and I think so
some of the interesting that things
we're introducing is the ability to run
sequel statements not only locally
against the database when which apex is
installed in but actually run a run
against a remote database and the way it
works is to be fully transparent so you
might you and I saw yesterday you were
creating applications and you create
applications that I'd like to create a
report on this table or this sequel
statement right now sometimes you might
be lucky enough that that sequel
statement is local on your database but
maybe you want to query data on another
database and and and what you can do is
just say you know what my data isn't
here it's on this other it's on this
other location maybe you have an HR
solution a finance solution and order
management solution and you want to have
a single page that combines information
from all of them and you can just just
do that by selecting which two data
source is and then and or apex will
manage the the rest of all
communications to the remote data
sources and bring all that data back to
you transparently so now apex
to become kind of like a central hub if
you will and so it opens up a whole new
dimension so before I pecs was kind of
limited to being able to develop you can
continue you can continue you can
continue Mike right that's fine can
complete your thought</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
