today I get to talk to you about
enabling a smart and connected world
with Java but with that first believe it
or not all my notes are not showing up
so this is this autumn he just great fun
so we're going to work with me on this
one this is just great it's really about
a connected world well you know what
that's all right so as we think about
the connected world one of the things
that were continuing to look at is how
we're looking at the into in solution
and in fact what we're starting to
understand and how we've characterized
it we've characterized it as the
virtuous cycle of growth we're looking
at what smart devices can do and all the
data that they're driving into the cloud
and did cloud and the data center
enabling even greater experiences for
the smart devices this virtual cycle of
growth is really a cyclone that's really
going to transform today's technology
businesses as well as transform
businesses that want quote unquote
technology businesses in to technology
businesses and what's so powerful about
this around Java is that this little
Java it is it in the end opportunity
which will really make sure that we're
addressing this in the end challenge the
way we say it often is that if it's
smart and connected it will run best on
Intel so as we're going through this
journey and making sure that every
component of this virtuous cycle is
actually enhanced by Java I want to
first take a second to under to look at
what we've done so far and we have a
short video to talk about where we've
been and where we're heading
you
you gotta love more Murphy's Law right
if something can go wrong it will but
the notes are back thank you very much
after 21 years of Java and many more to
come today we're going to talk about
what we're doing to make Java easy
efficient and expansive easy make it
easier for developers to deliver
applications efficient making it faster
and more efficient to run and also
expensive that make sure its future
proof through better connections support
for more technologies and more community
let's start with easy with so many
contributions to OpenJDK we need to be
able to understand what things are being
contributed to the codebase day after
day this will enable java developers to
make informed decisions about the
changes were making to the codebase so
today we're announcing our performance
portal for OpenJDK this is a website
where we'll publish an array of
performance measurements and training
information for each new build when
regressions are detected our engineers
will work with the community to address
it you can find this at languages
performance intel com we really wanted
to make sure that we're treating openjdk
as a first class citizen this is a
service that we provide to other open
source languages such as Python and PHP
and wanted to bring it to the OpenJDK
community as our friend wheedle points
out this is a nice canary in the coal
mine openjdk has a strong community of
developers contributors and we're
interested in helping to strengthen it
even more we continue to add new api's
to open source they give you highly
performant code that you don't have to
roll yourself added ap is for
lexicographical array comparison
simplified matrix multiplication and
modern checksum support are some of the
things that we added and additionally
we've also added more support for
multi-threaded network
applications that open the same port in
multiple threads which is very important
to achieve scalability in workloads like
shuffle and MapReduce growing the
richness of available ap is make it
easier for developers now let's look at
some updates for the IOT developer last
year I announce that we've added Java
for our ilt dev kit the work has
continued since we've added more support
for sensors I LT is all about supporting
lots of sensors we've had a support for
low-energy Bluetooth which is common in
such areas as wearables security as well
as health care and we've extended this
beyond maker platforms to run on
commercial IOT platforms these kits give
developers a clear path to product by
providing additional tools for
scalability manageability performance
and of course scalability speaking of
industrial capable platforms until Jules
a new product that our CEO announced
just last month I even brought one here
to show you it's an ideal platform for
innovative IOT edge compute applications
and products particularly those require
an advanced computer vision this is
designed for applications such as
robotics drones and industrial machine
vision so how do we make this work for
you well happy to say we're bringing
Java the jewel I'm happy to announce
that we're going to add Java support for
the Intel jewel into the Intel IOT dev
kit which will is on schedule to be
released by the end of year but I think
we can go even further to make it easy I
always tell my team it's the solutions
that matter not just the individual
components and last month we released 20
sample solutions in Java that get you up
and running faster with IOT solutions on
Intel Architecture we hope that these
pre-built solutions along with Intel IOT
developers dev kit
enable you to go out and make the future
so let's shift gears just a little bit
and talk about a group that's made all
of our lives simpler with the invention
of the World Wide Web CERN is the
european organization for nuclear
research it's in an institution where
leading scientists and researchers study
the fundamental structure of the
universe by smashing particles together
at nearly the speed of light and
watching what happens with that the
software that operates their massive and
complex machines is written in Java and
runs on intel processors just tell us
more I'd like to invite Benjamin wolf
from CERN to the stage
ok Thank You Ben for joining us Michael
I tell us a little bit more about what
CERN does well CERN is the world's
largest particle physics research
laboratory situated in the centre of
Europe it operates the Large Hadron
Collider the largest particle
accelerator of the world with its nearly
17 miles at circumference it's the
largest machine ever built it's kind of
ironic to research the smallest building
blocks of the universe you need to use
the largest scientific devices siren is
also a truly international organization
it hosts roughly 15,000 collaborators of
over a hundred different nationalities
from all over the world in order to
fulfill its mission CERN relies heavily
on IT and computing therefore many
people who are working at CERN actually
working nighty and so do i so what job
where does java run and turn well
actually java is used in many different
areas at cern the strategic decision to
build on the Java platform in many cases
already dates back until the mid-90s
after the first releases of the JDK as
you already mentioned one of the
prominent example is the accelerator
control system it involves controlling
and monitoring over 100,000 devices
resulting in over two million io n
points that are all running together in
the cern control center you see a part
of this year on this on the picture most
of the higher levels of the control
system and almost all screens you see
here on the picture are actually running
on Java also we have a very high
personal turnover rate at CERN so we
have all these very small people coming
to CERN and it's our job to allow them
to concentrate on research by keeping
the administrative overhead low and for
this we need world-class business
computing so from the ERP system over
the fully electronic documents workflow
engines to the business intelligent data
warehouse all these aspects are powered
by Java Zion is entrusted with the 1
billion dollar budget to be fully spent
on research and these systems help us to
make sure that this is spent efficiently
so you've been running on Java since the
mid-90s so you've gone through many
upgrade paths could you describe how
CERN handles the upgrades well by
building the system on the Java platform
the upgrade process of the software is
pretty much streamlined so this allows
us to stay on top of the latest JDK
releases when speaking about the
accelerator control system we're
speaking about a massive system
involving over 10 million lines of code
split over 1,500 Java art effects used
by over 300 you I applications and we
are in the position to upgrade this
really huge system to the next IDK
release in the in the strict constraints
of a yearly technical shutdown which is
the window of a couple of weeks usually
and this is also the time when we
upgrade the hardware that runs the
control system to later generation of
the Intel platform and we've seen that
by leveraging or benefiting but by
benefiting of the continuous
optimizations in energy consumption and
heat dissipation we can fit more and
more cores and therefore more and more
computing power in the same real estate
we're using the electricity and cooling
and ventilation infrastructure very
interesting you know that's great it's
very important that the software
developer community actually plan for
upgrades especially not just for Java
but also the JVM if they don't upgrade
as you mentioned you're going to leave
performance and efficiency on the table
and also expose yourself to possible
security concerns so you showed us the
path through where we are with with jdk
8 what are you hoping for with jdk 9
well i'm personally looking forward to
see the new modular ization feature in
jdk 9 as we've just seen at cern we are
working with really large software
systems and it can be really difficult
to enforce internal api promote public
api and to manage dependency and
interdependencies i mean many of you
might have heard the term clasp as hell
and i'm sure many of you went through it
with the new modular relations feature I
see the opportunity that this can
improve the situation in the long run
and for new projects that start with jdk
right away or even on the short run very
good hey think you've been for joining
us today
it's better hope they have a great week
in San Francisco thanks you it's been a
pleasure being here I just wanted to add
Sarn is really an open lab so we are
doing research for the public everything
we do all the results and data is
published and sign is also the place to
visit we have permanent exhibitions and
we also offer guided tours so whenever
you're on the area it's a place to see
so please come and see very good thank
you again Michael alright great so let's
talk about efficiency it's about
performance when you need it and
conservation when you don't very often
we think about the cloud we're focused
on pure performance but often it's about
performance for total cost of ownership
for smart connected devices you have a
host different set of design criteria
across-the-board performance power and
thermals all play a role so let's take a
look at one case study or performance is
of particular importance and this is in
precision medicine precision medicine is
an approach to health care where medical
decisions practices and treatments are
tailored to the individual patients
genetics the main challenge here are
time and cost the process of identifying
and prescribing treatment can take
months if someone is diagnosed with
cancer treatment really needs to begin
and start immediately we need to speed
the process so everyone can have access
to the precision treatment this is why
Intel started to collaborative cancer
cloud back in 2013 and signed up for the
audacious goal of enabling doctors to
give accurate diagnosis and precision
medicines to patients all in one day by
2020 now this is a great cause but why
am I talking about it with a bunch of
Java developers the core genetics
analysis is done by Broad Institute gatk
genome and a little analysis toolkit and
runs on the JDK it's an open-source
collaboration between intel Brode
Institute google and cloud era and we're
moving it to the cloud on apache spark
on java skyla this is an important step
towards reaching are all in one day
goal and we've already optimized key
routine such as the compression codec
which is improved by thirty percent and
we have triple the scale of scalability
to ensure that we can better leverage
the power of the cloud and many features
that we've been working on for jdk nine
are designed to accelerate apache spark
and will help us even more or working
along many fronts and with our
collaborators to reach the all in one
day go let me highlight some of the jdk
nine work we doubled the performance by
enabling our new 512 bit AVX extensions
in openjdk fast and performant
implementations of many more encryption
standards making it easier for
developers to deploy secure options and
we've made math operations even smarter
by squeezing three to four times more
performance out of key operations this
is a big deal for the finance science
and medical guys out there the code is
all there so go use it and let's look at
another example of performance in action
twitter is a leader in social media as
major events unfold in the world today
they often unfold first on Twitter
please welcome to describe more
Twitter's vice president of engineering
Nandini Ramani
thank you Michael thank you for joining
us Nandini so twitter is a leader in
excuse so Twitter is as a lot of
challenges could you tell us a little
bit about what those challenges are to
Twitter in engineering right so first of
all I want to say I'm so thrilled to be
back here at the Java one stage it's
been a while for me a couple of years so
happy to see familiar faces so at
Twitter our mission is to give everyone
the power to create and share both ideas
and information instantly as recently as
last week we launched NFL live I don't
know how many of you saw that but the
first game was on last Thursday so what
this entails is not just live streaming
the event but also you need a platform
and the backend that can actually scale
and handle all the engagement that
happens during the course of the game
which means tweets and retweets and
favorites cetera et cetera so to give
you a sampling of what this entails and
well I'd like to walk us through Ellen's
famous selfie from 2014 Oscars just to
show you how this works so let's look at
the animation um if you can replay that
last slide oh sorry okay and here we go
so this basically shows you how the
tweets in 11 seconds it goes up to 3.3
million retweets and in fact it broke
all kinds of records and was 5x what was
our previous high in terms of peak loads
and traffic very good I get the same
kind of traffic when I tweet as well
it's the same back end that's right so
why do Twitter build their platform on
the JVM yeah so to answer that question
I think we have to go a little boys back
in time to the 2010 world cup it's been
a long road getting here because for
those who remember the 2010 world cup
Twitter was unable to handle peak
traffic and the loads the site would
constantly go down and for I don't know
how many of you remember the famous fail
whale but basically would constantly be
twitter is over capacity cannot deal
with the peak traffic and so a few
things have changed since then for us
and to answer your why JVM question the
story in the 2014 World Cup was very
different during the Brazil Germany
world cup game we had 335 over 35
million tweets and we were able to
handle it very elegantly and I think
that happened because of two things one
we switched away from a monolithic
ruby-on-rails stack to a micro services
architecture and two most importantly
we're now building on the JVM we use a
combination of Java and Scala and are in
we're now able to leverage the highly
optimized jit on intel platforms so we
have our version is basically a Twitter
distribution of OpenJDK 8 that runs on
linux and we do this by basically we
take or everything that comes all the
great work everybody is doing in OpenJDK
and in addition we twitter has its own
JVM team and we do a lot as well to
improve performance including work on
optimize GC profiling etc and this is
now resulted in a nice back end for us
where we're able to scale
peak traffic peak loads of 25 X what it
is at stable state which is pretty
remarkable and we also see a 3x decrease
in search Layton sees one thing I want
to call out which is pretty amazing work
that the jvm team is working on is using
machine learning methodologies to tune
the JVM and our initial results are
pretty promising for anyone who's
interested tomorrow romkey from the jbm
team will be speaking at the hilton at
five thirty in the evening and the
conference ID numbers up on the screen
so if you want to go see so Michael so
you heard a lot about what we are doing
and how we are big advocates and
believers in the JVM can you tell us
what we can expect up you know upcoming
releases from Intel and Java definitely
I'm really excited to say that Intel
continues to work to make our platforms
more efficient and over the last 10
years we actually can run Java up to 70
times faster than what we could do 10
years ago these systems are more
responsive more scalable and more secure
than ever before and with the many
contributions to enable future platforms
are already in OpenJDK speaking of what
would you like to see in the future of
OpenJDK so we have one big wish list
which is the biggest item which is low
latency garbage collection which makes a
huge difference for us pause x sub 10
milliseconds would be awesome and we'd
really like it in openjdk fantastic hey
thank you Nandini for joining us and i'm
sure i'll be tweeting about this soon
excellent thank you
so let's talk about making OpenJDK more
expansive how we can connect Java to
more devices and make sure it can
embrace new technologies and how we can
become more involved as a community to
help accelerate advancement we've talked
about some areas with Intel's
collaborate with oracle in the java
community to make it easier to develop
solutions and how we're making those
solutions faster more efficient but as a
community we have to ask ourselves are
we doing enough to extend OpenJDK and
are we doing it fast enough there are
some massive shifts happening and more
looming over the near horizon let's take
a quick look at the illustration of
what's happening with the connection
effect something amazing is about to
happen something that will impact the
lives of more people in more places than
almost anything that has ever come
before
it's called the connection effect the
exponential impact of connecting
billions of people and tens of billions
of things things that as their numbers
grow will generate extraordinary new
levels of data so much data in fact that
putting it to use will drive a
fundamental re-architecting of the
technology infrastructure that supports
modern life in this data centric future
the immense existing value of the data
center will be multiplied on an
exponential scale as compute analysis
and storage resources are built right
into the very fabric of the network
adding new capabilities to the ever
expanding cloud billions of devices at
the edge and everywhere in between
all of which will dramatically enhance
the value of all those new connections
where they matter most our lives that's
the connection effect and it's the
future we are making together
so clearly computing will not be limited
to the usual devices there will be 50
billion devices 200 billion sensors
estimated by 2020 we will see the
compute analytics and stores to continue
to shift throughout the cloud fast
pervasive and ambient connectivity will
be delivered through 5g and as I
mentioned the virtuous cycle of growth
which we talked about is going to
continue to drive the industry and we're
adding accelerant technologies such as
customized FPGAs and persistent memory
for opening up new possibilities for
developers 3d cross point is a
revolutionary technology which one
offers byte addressable storage class
memory imagine what we can do with
systems with terabytes of memory that
stays even after the systems turned off
and integrating fpgas into the platform
that can dynamically be reconfigured to
accelerate the work at hand which opens
up big opportunities in software clearly
a new extended software program model is
required to leverage these coming
technologies so how do we make Java
connect with these technologies it has
to be fast and efficient this is why
we've strongly support supporting
projects like project Panama and a
vector API project Panama's focus on
interoperability between platform level
code this will connect high-performance
reconfigurable fpgas with Java code also
it's important that we have fast
lightweight methods to expose
parallelism of Intel AVX with vector API
one area where these changes are needed
now is in big data analytics machine
learning apache spark has been one of
the hottest open-source projects spark
has been a game-changer for analytics
and to tell us more about the spark
ecosystem I'd like to invite rental shin
to the stage chief architect and
co-founder of data bricks
and with all thank you Reynold you know
so as we're looking at what we're
heading to I would love to get a glimpse
of what you see happening with spark
Java and the future yeah so yes y'all
happen in 2010 when Netflix had this
netflix challenge in which they release
a public data set of all the DVD rentals
yes DVD rentals for researchers they
actually build better machine learning
models to give recommendations on what
movie is a to recommend and the price
for that for building the best model is
actual 1 million dollars and one of the
machine learning research at Berkeley
decided he's gonna participate but at
the time when you tried and this was
really one of the first so the public
data sets for large-scale mission
earning you realize to show incredibly
clunky and very slow so sparber started
then with two primary focus one is
usability basically programmability all
in large cluster machines as well as
performance and Java was pink because it
was actually one of the most reliable
platforms scott spark is everything is
Scala was the JVM was one of the most
reliable platforms you could actually
fine and great probability for adoption
and 2013 so we in order to facilitate
the development of spark we started down
data bricks as a company to takes part
to the cloud and they don also donated
to the apache software foundation fee so
that's sort of the story of Sparky
really paid bit in 2015 was compared to
through the taylor swift of big data and
couple weeks ago as they poked him on go
in big data sure hey I've been amazed by
the number of developers jumpy and the
work with the spark platform and it's
being users solve real problems likes a
collaborative cancer cloud as well as
fraud detection in many other use cases
where do you see big growth areas for a
spark going forward yeah we're actually
seeing a lot of different applications
of spark going from traditional business
intelligence all the way to the new
attire applications such as machine
earning a i as well as so real-time data
analytics but i think the most powerful
one really comes from the combination of
machine learning and real-time data
processing so you can actually make
intelligent decisions in real time
in reaction as data arrived great hey
we've been very pleased with the
collaboration with data bricks and spark
and we continue to see vast improvements
up to 7 x 4 performance so with that do
you have any key messages you'd like to
leave with the developers absolutely so
Intel's actually a very important
partner in developing spark itself in
particular in the area performance and
in this aspect I think the two key
things that the JVM can actually help
improve on one this numeric computation
which is really a lot of what machine
learning workloads about historical e is
in a strong suit for the JVM and works
such as the Panama project as well as
the vectorization project will actually
help a lot there and the second aspect
is in order for sparks to actually
develop its performance push the
performance boundaries even father you'd
be really useful for the JVM to expose
the lower level knobs such as sort of
zero copying access to more events are
aware architectures and features and
this other source of two primary awesome
have very good hey thanks rental for
joining us it's always a pleasure to
speak with you thanks a lot miracle
okay so today I have talked about
working to make it easier for developers
of great experience with Java we talked
about how performance and efficiency
matters whether in the cloud laptop or
running on smart devices we've shown how
Java is extending to support more
devices and technologies future proofing
it but the connected world will only
continue to expand the data explosion is
happening making use of this data is the
opportunity Java's run anywhere approach
is critical to actually really taking
advantage of the data that's coming
through this virtuous cycle of compute
well I invite you to come and be an
active members and participate in the
community the support openjdk and help
us enable a smart and connected world
with Java thank you everyone and have a
great Java one
