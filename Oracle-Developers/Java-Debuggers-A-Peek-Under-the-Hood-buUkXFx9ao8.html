Java sustaining engineering team here at
Oracle I mostly fix JVM bugs usually
j-rock eat bugs up until now I'm also
when I'm not fixing JVM bugs one of the
project maintainer z' for the open JDK a
updates project so sometimes you can
find me arguing with people online on
various public aliases about which what
should or should not go into JDK 8 and
when I'm not working I'm usually still
sitting behind a computer coding and for
extracurricular activities I tend to
like to do talks like this especially if
there's some sort of free food involved
so today we're going to talk about Java
debugging so I'm gonna cover just a
brief overview of what the architecture
the overall architecture is and then
we're gonna dig down into the wire
protocol and the JVM t.i side of the
talk so just to jump in and kind of talk
about the LF the gigantic elephant in
the room when we first found out which
talks did and did not get accepted that
was kind of when I went to you know kind
of start making my slide deck and
everything and I went and I said okay so
what did I promise them that I would
talk about you know so I wanna go see
the the description I submitted so I go
to the course catalog and I look up my
debugger under the hood and I'm very
surprised to see that there's actually
two debugging under the hood talks
scheduled for Java one this year so just
just so I have an idea of who I'm
talking to
how many people actually got to see
Martin's talk yesterday Wow okay wait
wait less than I expected okay so there
are two talks this year and you know
abstence ibly about the exact same issue
and I to my utter horror and dismay
Martin's talk is like really really good
so he set the bar rather high for this
topic so what to do so ideally we don't
want to have too much overlap right
there's you know both people people
should be able to attend both talks and
really not have too much time wasted we
have redundant information so what we
decided to do was his talk was
primarily focused on the JDI side of the
debugging architecture so I was going to
kind of take everything else kind of the
lower end and if these kind of terms
don't seem to make a whole lot of sense
to you right now don't worry that's kind
of what we're gonna cover in these talks
so ideally you should really see both
talks each of these talks by themselves
kind of leaves a whole piece of the
picture uncovered but luckily it's
available on his talk a previous version
of his talk that he did is available on
YouTube and his slide deck is also up so
I have links to a previous version of
his talk that he did at the resource
section of my slide later so I encourage
everybody who wasn't lucky enough to
catch Martin's talk live yesterday to go
check out what he said on on YouTube
because it'll really complement what I'm
going to talk about today very well that
said you don't really need to see his
talk before mine or vice versa to get
everything I wrote I wrote all them I
made all my slides and my content
assuming that a very large portion of
the people watching today will not seen
his talk
so we'll kind of just tackle things in
any order we feel like it and hopefully
get a complete picture at the end so if
you're you know I'm throwing around
these terms like JDI and JVM TI and JD
WP &amp;amp; and I think maybe not a few just a
few people here really aren't familiar
with what those terms are or what they
mean so we're gonna go in and try and
shed some light on that and go into the
details of what the architecture
actually consists of what the different
components are so these are all part of
something that is known as the the Java
platform debugger architecture and it's
something that's been around as far as I
can tell maybe around since a 1.3 there
were there were technologies that were
parts of it that predate that but just
kind of you know doing some google
searching and looking at the wayback
machine archives it seems that we
started maybe calling the the whole
thing that we you know we put all these
pieces together the Jaypee de a
somewhere around 1.3 and so let's dig
into what this actually is so the idea
was that we would have this kind of
comprehensive framework for
writing debuggers and debugger like
tools for the JVM and there were certain
goals that we had to try and accommodate
when we did this one thing of course is
that obviously Java is we think a really
great language to write just about
everything in and that would include
debuggers themselves so we want to make
it easy for people to be able to write
their own debugger or debugging like
tool in the java language we also want
to make sure that the impact that the
debugger has or the active debugging has
on the target JVM or the application
running on that JVM is is absolutely
small as possible you want to avoid the
observer effect of course and we also
want to be able to allow a level of
detail that would not normally be
accessible to to say an external tool
like that so obviously what the kind of
things we want to avoid these heisenbugs
right where there's the the observer
effect whereby by attaching a debugger
and setting a breakpoint or you know
watching certain fields in a particular
object you actually change the behavior
and by running the debugger and the same
on top of the same runtime as as the
application you're trying to debug your
it's gonna be very hard to kind of avoid
that so this is what I kind of referred
to as a strange loop problem you know
where there's a bootstrap issue of you
know how are you cognizant of what's
happening at the lower level when you're
dealing with a higher level of
abstraction meaning it's very hard to
kind of get JVM or native level details
about the the environment that you're
trying to debug or profile when you're
actually running on top of that
environment and so these kind of these
kind of goals lead to somewhat
contradictory design decisions
at least seemingly contradictory at
first so first to enable people to write
debuggers in java we need a Java based
API and that's what JD is the Java
debugger
interface so we need something that
people can write to write again
in Java and then of course we also need
to make sure that we are a low-impact so
we need some way to do this from a
remote process or an external process
that's external to the JVM at the same
time we want to provide all these neat
little you know kind of native level
details like the things being able to
like iterate through the stack and
things like all right I'm sorry iterate
through the the heap and things like
that that normally wouldn't make sense
to do from from the Java level
abstraction so we need something that
actually is in process so you know these
contradictions here we want something
willing Nathan what the best of both
worlds one native we want Java we want
in process we want out of process well
why not both so that's when you know we
all celebrate the hosts a little girl
above us and and jeer because we now
have an architecture that actually gives
us the best of both worlds at the
expense of perhaps a little bit of
complication so here's what the the
architecture looks like and so the idea
over here on your left is you actually
have your application that you're trying
to debug here running on the target JVM
and is hosting an in process JVM TI
agent JVM TI is the the JVM Tools
interface and we'll go into a lot more
detail about what that means in some
later slides but there's this impress
API that allows us to kind of plug
anything into it and get all sorts of
nitty-gritty low-level information but
it also we have an implementation of a
particular agent that speaks what what
is referred to as the Java debugging
wire protocol which is really just kind
of a serialization of debugging commands
and events that are sent back and forth
between the debugging application here
running as a separate process and the
target JVM so this like I said seems to
have existed or you know since at least
1.3 and one of the main keys here is
that this is a modular design that every
single one of these three main
components that makes it up or three
main api's the the JVM ti the wire
protocol and the Java based debug
interface that these are all kind of
interchangeable and you can go and kind
of plug in
and components and technology into this
and get some rather cool results with
that so for example we've actually
changed one of the components of this
around the time frame of Java five where
the old native API the old in process
API for collecting debug information
that predates JVM TI was actually known
as JVM di that was the debugging
interface and so that was available
until Java 5 where we deprecated it and
introduced the JVM TI interface and then
with Java 6 it was completely removed
but because we had this fantastic
modular architecture and you know very
clean separation between all the
different components we were able to
just kind of completely replace the
internal API wholesale with very little
impact to the rest of the ecosystem and
and tools and things that people had
already built against the other api's so
we have this amazingly flexible thing
another thing that we could possibly do
or imagine someone doing is that you
don't even have to be using JDI
so JJ di is over here and the the remote
process or the debugger process and it's
the API that you write ups that you
would have sensibly if you're writing in
Java be writing against to kind of speak
the the wire protocol so to speak so you
can think of JDI as like a translator
between the api calls in java that your
debugger program is making and and the
wire protocol that the JVM t.i agent is
going to expect to receive but this
could not even be Java like anything
could speak this protocol so you could
in theory write your own completely
native application you you know in just
plain c or c++ or or any other language
python or whatever and as long as you
you adhere to this wire protocol you
could interact with and control and
debug a target JVM so this again it's
just an amazingly flexible thing another
thing is that some of these technologies
can stand alone especially JVM TI so
there's a lot of you case use cases for
JVM TI and we'll mention
few of them today where there's not a
remote debugger involved so for example
if you look at the the demos directory
and a JDK you'll see a lot of examples
of JDI JVM Ti plugins that will do
things just if they get like if you try
and send sync wit to get a threat dump
for example they can you know produce a
NH prof dump or there are things like
that so there's all sorts of use cases
for just having the internal in process
agent that doesn't have a need to
dependency whatsoever on you know
outside instrumentation or control so
another really interesting thing is that
there's the new J shell tool that's
coming out with a with JDK 9 how many
people here have a attended that talk I
know that yeah okay so so J xual J shell
is really cool and and I don't know
about you guys but I'm really excited to
be able to use that in my day to day
debugging work and playing around
especially for like learning new api's
and J shell even know it's not a
debugger in any real sense it fits very
nicely into the debugger architecture we
have so the implementation of JJ shell
is that it actually sits on top of JDI
just like a debugging tool would and
that's what it uses to kind of remotely
you know run your code against this
against a separate out of process JVM
that's actually responsible for
executing the the snippets of Java that
you enter into the tool so it's it's an
extremely flexible architecture that
kind of let has no end of to the variety
of things that you can do and expansions
you can you can make so the Java debug
interface and again I'm not going to go
into any real detail here because Martin
did such a fantastic job on his talk so
I highly encourage everybody that didn't
see his talk to check out the YouTube
video and download his slides on that I
link to at the end of this one but
basically it's just it's a pure Java
implementation so you can kind of just
you know how have that right once run
anywhere convenience when you're writing
a debugger tool and it's it's been
around for you know since at least Java
1.3 and it's
extremely stable and battle-tested and
hardened and all that stuff and so it is
is very reliable and easy to use so
we're just going to kind of skip that
part of the API and dig into the other
two major components of the debugger
framework which is the wire protocol and
JVM Ti so the wire protocol is is really
really simple in fact it's amazingly
simple we can kind of cover it in just a
few minutes and one of the things that
makes it so simple is that it doesn't
specify a transport so that you you need
something else on like underneath that
whether that be like you know IP for you
know socket connection or for on Windows
the reference implementation supports in
memory as a transport for you know just
mapping shared memory between the the
target and the debugger processes and
using that to communicate but we
actually have a service provider
interface so you could you could code
your own transport mechanism that would
this would work on top of but it's
really just kind of a dumb simplest
serialization you know at the bit level
of what the different kind of commands
and events that a debugger would need to
to use to communicate with addy buggy
JVM and if you look at the spec you'll
notice and you're familiar of JDI you'll
notice that it's kind of like just a
direct one-to-one mapping of the JDI
Javadoc so if you look at the JDI Java
doc and you'll be like yes so we have
you know these you know virtual machine
class here and then there'll be a whole
bunch of commands in each sub command
mapping to a particular method of the
JDI api so it's really kind of a it's
easy to understand it if you understand
JDI then j dwp you can see what's going
on very easily so again you know from
the the wire protocols standpoint it
doesn't really care who's talking to it
or who it's kind of attached to so to
speak in the sense that the the debugger
it could be written or implemented and
anything as long as it's kind of
speaking the protocol in in some way
that it understands and the target JVM
doesn't actually need to really have be
using JVM TI cuz that's also another
implementation detail that's abstract it
away from the wire protocol level so
obviously you know hotspot
IBM's j9 bees J rocket all supported JVM
TI but you can imagine a Java SE
implementation that might perhaps choose
for whatever reason to not offer that
kind of API to its users the JVM TI ATP
and so it could they could just
implement you know their end of the wire
protocol directly without having to have
the man in the middle of the the JVM ti
agent and they might want to do that
just you know save on the cost of
developing or kind of limit the options
that the user has for whatever reason so
it's a really simple protocol it starts
off from a handshake and the handshake
literally is it just sends these
fourteen bytes in ascii the debugger
comes out and says hey JD WP handshake
and probably not too surprising the the
debug ii JVM responds with the exact
same 14 bytes of ASCII text and once you
have this you you've more or less
established a session so now you have
this this asynchronous connection
virtual connection between these two
entities and they can send commands and
replies to each other so the the
protocol is really really really super
simple and the reason for that was to
make it really easy to implement even if
you were writing your own implementation
from scratch for example like like I
said if you wanted to say make a
debugger in Python or something that
would speak to JVMs that would be aided
by the simplicity of the wire protocol
so the headers whether you're talking
about a reply packet or a command packet
on this one again there's only two types
of packets that the headers just eleven
bytes regardless of the packet type so
all packets have exactly the same header
size and then they may carry a data
payload of some variable size so just to
see what they actually look like so we
have a you can imagine the width here as
being third
two bits so you know we have a four byte
length and then a four byte ID for each
packet one byte four flags one byte for
the command set and command in command
in a command packet and then for reply
we just have those two bytes are
dedicated to an area code and their data
so the only difference between the two
packet types is this kind of middle
section here where in the command ones
we actually tell the the target what we
want them to do and the other one
represents kind of a response to that
you know how what what the result of
that action was so the the length this
is actually the size of the entire
packet including the header in bytes and
because it's a 32-bit number that means
we could have four gigabyte packets
which obviously is kind of almost
ridiculous overkill but the idea was
just to have an extremely flexible
format that would just never limit us no
matter how we wanted to kind of expand
upon it or how people wanted to use it
in the future so you know you can have
packets of really any size and whatever
transport you're going over is really
going to be the limiting factor and in
how large of packets you could send and
then the idea also is a 32 bit number
and these are just to the IDs are just
to tie the the command or you can think
of a command is there like a request and
the reply to each other so each reply by
definition is in response to a
particular command packet that that JVM
has received and so and not all command
packets have replied there's certain
commands that don't require that the
sending of a reply but for any that do
the only requirement is that the ID
numbers have to match but they don't
have to be unique across you know going
for each direction in the channel so
what this means because it's an
asynchronous protocol is you can
actually have you know up to four
billion different packets you know in
flight so to speak or being processed
meaning that that they've been sent by
one side but a reply hasn't been
received so again probably overkill by
its it's just an extremely flexible
protocol that makes sure that no matter
how we try and expand it or add to it in
the future
nothing you know the protocol itself or
the formats not going to get in our way
four flags the only thing the only
flight there's only one flag that exists
as of today and it just distinguishes
between command and reply so it's pretty
simple and dumb and then the command
sets I'll go into in a second so let's
just go in this so just to kind of
reiterate so we have all these different
header fields so the length again 32-bit
value that's huge right and it means
that we could have gigantic packets the
ID field again 32-bit value and it means
that we have the this amazing window of
outstanding requests that haven't been
acknowledged so to speak with a response
packet and we can have up to four
billion over four billion of them you
know two to the thirty to the 32nd power
worth of those and the flags ones and
this is just simply a way to to mark
packets as being either command packets
or reply packets and then the command
fields are obviously where we get to
interesting things this is you know what
these these packets are actually telling
the target JVM to do and as I said
before if this there's pretty much
almost a one-to-one mapping between the
JDI API and the wire protocol so the the
first 64 sets or command sets each sets
of bytes so there's 256 possibilities so
there's 256 possible command sets but
the top part of that address space so to
speak is set aside for for possible
vendor to find extensions
none of which actually exists that I'm
aware of but you know that that's there
if someone wanted to add an extension
and then the the bottom half of that
address space is divided between 64 that
are kind of been going in one direction
from the debugger to the debug e and the
other one is the debug e back to the
debugger so when I say commands it's not
just from the debugger to the to the
buggy when an event happens like say for
example you've hit a breakpoint one
exception has been thrown in the target
JVM the target JVM will use a command
packet to asynchronously notify the
debugger not running on the debugger VM
so yet you have you have kind of a full
duplex address space here so to speak
but each one of these command sets more
or less corresponds directly to a class
in the JDI API and then each one of the
separate commands which is also in a
eight bit field so we have 256 of those
per class so to speak is the individual
methods and the error field is these are
just constants that are coded in as part
of the standard and you can look at them
directly the data is variable size a lot
a lot of command types don't require
anything so for example let's say I was
going and I said I wanted to in my
debugger I'm trying to check out the the
value of a particular field on a
particular instance then I would use I
would send a request to send that and
I'd send the payload so to speak in that
request would be the ID of the
particular field that I'm trying to I'm
trying to inspect and then the response
would be the value of that field that
was being sent back and again if you
look at the this is actually the JDI I'm
sorry num this isn't this is this is the
the wire protocol but you can see the
wire protocol each command set basically
has you know the there's a there's a
corresponding class in the JDI API
called virtual machine and it has
methods that are very similarly named
these methods most of them it's just a
change of camel case to get to get these
so there's a direct one-to-one
correspondence between the command sets
and JDI classes and then the individual
commands and
methods within JDI so you can think of
it as a really cheap lightweight thin
serialization of the JDI api so for
transport like I said we don't actually
define that or require anything in the
wire protocol spec itself and this has
the somewhat unfortunate consequence of
you know we have all this loose coupling
between all the different components but
if your two components don't support the
same transport then you can't make them
talk to each other so in practice the
debugger program whether that's you know
something written in Java
running on top of a JVM or something
completely different it needs to agree
with and and and speak the same language
so to speak to be able to set up a
connection wave and communicate with the
target JVM the current ones that the
reference implementations support are on
Windows only we have a shared memory
transport and then on all of our
supported platforms for Oracle SC we
have the socket transport notably the
the JVM tih and only still doesn't
support ipv6 although the the Java side
of the equation the JDI implementation
does so I just kind of showing you the
the kind of limitations that you can hit
because of the lack of requirement for
transport there but also the other way
of looking at that is that it gives you
a lot of flexibility to you know kind of
roll your own implementations and stuff
so this is probably one of the more
important slides of this entire talk the
wire protocol is inherently insecure
it's not intended for real use in a
production environment I've been kind of
shocked to see certain users or
customers that will you know set up the
the JVM Ti wire protocol agent and have
a running in production you know on the
off chance that something would go wrong
in their production environment and
they'd want to be able to attach with a
Java debugger and try and either work
around some sort of issue or even
resolve it by by just using debugging
commands hey I think that's that's just
a very unlikely scenario to actually
take place and we're
life I don't think that you know I've
never actually heard of anyone
successfully doing that you know usually
people would just want to try and reboot
or something or or handle the issue some
other way but also it's it's a huge
security risk there's no authentication
whatsoever on the wire protocol so if
you say if you set it up and say I want
to listen on the socket that means
anyone can connect it to it without any
authentication and it's absolutely
trivial once you have you know kind of
debugger access to a JVM to completely
on the system the only thing you
actually really need to do to execute
arbitrary shell commands is you need to
be able to set a breakpoint on a
particular method that you are confident
that that target JVM is going to execute
so as long as you know like if you know
that they're running about logic server
then you can just pick some particular
method within WebLogic server or even
within like the the niÃ±o framework that
you know will be called sooner or later
and then set a breakpoint on it and then
once you have that breakpoint it's you
know you and you own the system and you
can run arbitrary code and there's
exploit you know proof of concepts
available online if you google for this
so if you have if you have open to the
world a white you know a debugging wire
protocol socket then you were basically
saying you know please run arbitrary
code on my system and yesterday when I
was putting this slide together I went
to show it on and and just searched and
there were even two instances of ones
that were you know configured to send
the outgoing handshake you know so they
were literally announcing to the world
you know please own me you know run
arbitrary code on me so but in in
practice there's you know I I've seen
this kind of I would say a terrifyingly
high number of times in the field that
people just kind of set this up and and
you know I think it'll be convenient to
have enabled at some point in the future
but don't really think about the
security implications of it okay so
that's the wire protocol like I said
it's very straightforward and simple
it's just kind of a dumb serialization
of the JDI API probably the more
interesting part of this talk is the
tool interface because that's really
what lets us do all sorts of crazy
things
so the the the understand the tool
interface you have to have a little bit
of background of the history involved
and originally there were there were two
very different api's both of which
existed from jdk 1.1 you know from more
or less than the very beginning and a
met with kind of different amounts of
success in terms of usability and
stability there was the JVM debug
interface which I had already mentioned
it's the thing that we were placed in
JVM R and JDK 5 and it was fairly stable
and actually it's the the parts of JVM
ti that come from JVM di are very
similar so it was not a very difficult
migration for people to update their
code to to work with JVM TI if they had
some pre-existing code that they wrote
against JVM di the profile interface was
was unfortunately a dumpster fire it had
all sorts of problems it was fairly
stable and worked well with kind of the
original VM the pre hotspot vm but once
say once it was ported over to the
hotspot codebase it was just never
stable it was very difficult to use with
J and I couldn't really mix you know J
and i usage with it with it without a
whole lot of effort and it was very
invasive into the design of the JVM
itself so basically what it offered you
kind of all these really at least
seemingly convenient functions that you
could call that would give you all sorts
of interesting profiling information
about you know what kind of objects were
on the heap and histograms and things
like that but the problem is that meant
that we had to actually implement that
functionality for every single garbage
collector and so you would have cases
where yes you know you could use the
profiling interface to try and collect
profiling information about your
application but then you'd be limited to
the subset of garbage collectors that
actually happen to support that this
this particular functionality so we had
to actually add it to every single
garbage collector that was implemented
and and jyg compilation also it didn't
play with very nicely in all sorts of
different circumstances especially C 2
it was
not good so if you can't do profiling
running the JVM in a somewhat similar
circumstance or configuration that
you're gonna actually run your code in
production then there's not a whole lot
of value from the profiling data that
you're gonna pull from that so it was it
was unstable it was hard to use it was
never officially supported it was always
labeled as experimental it was just not
a good solution so the replacement here
is obviously JVM ti so around the Java 5
timeframe sun came in and said ok you
know we need to have you know one one
ring to rule them all so to speak and so
while the single API it'll replace both
of these older API is it'll be
officially supported and they kind of
learned from the mistakes that were made
with the profiler interface and did
things very differently so this brings
us to JVM ti so like I said it replaced
the the older two profiling and
debugging interface
and so that naturally gives us a whole
lot of interesting use cases outside of
just debugging and that's kind of one of
the major points of this talk is that
you know we have these really amazing
and cool api's and technologies and you
know so don't think about just debuggers
because there's already a whole lot of
great debuggers that are already out
there and that work really well but
there's a whole bunch of other kinds of
tools that people haven't even thought
up yet that these kind of api's make
make possible so there's all sorts of
different things you can do besides
debuggers with JVM ti it's fully
supported on like the the profile into
interface wise and one of the most
important things is that unlike the
older debug and and the profile
interface the ones that were placed I
mean it offers what I call pay-as-you-go
performance impact meaning that if you
don't use specific functionality with it
you don't have the overhead the
performance overhead cost for that and
I'll go into more details about
specifically what I mean by that in a
few more slides and the other thing to
note about this it's very important is
that it's based off of J and I just get
an idea here how many people here have
feel comfortable like like looking at J
and I code understanding it ok so a fair
know
maybe about a third okay and won't be
required for the coming slides but it
certainly would be handy
so for jjv MTI we write what are known
as agents and and an agent is native
code that runs within the address space
of the JVM itself so just like regular
J&amp;amp;I code you have to know what you're
doing if you if you make a mistake you
will very quickly bring down the entire
JVM what's interesting is that you can
have multiple agents loaded and running
all at the same time and to at least as
much as possible you can they can be
separated and not step on each other's
toes to a large extent they can even you
can even have a JVM TI agent that's
statically linked into the JVM so if you
were like downloading the the open JDK
source code you could use JVM TI to kind
of you know have a hard wired agent of
some kind that did some sort of either
debugging or profiling or whatever you
might want to do into your own specific
build of the JVM and it's it's launched
from the command line with this flag
which I'm sure people have seen before
this this agent Lib thing and so the
idea is that you put the library name in
here and then you can pass an arbitrary
number of arguments to the agent so it's
very flexible you can give it startup
commands and and let it you know just
interpret those however you you want to
program it to interpret them it's kind
of like almost like a separate command
line utility so this is the most common
scenario is where the agent will get
loaded at startup time and I'll go into
why that that's the most common scenario
in a few slides but that's not the only
way that you can do this other ways that
it's perfectly valid to load a JVM T ID
library during during runtime with you
know system load library and so you
don't get exactly access to all of the
functionality that you would get if the
library was loaded from JVM startup but
you still get that gives you an extra
degree of flexibility for being able to
kind of load it on demand so just one
thing is I'm talking about agents here I
want to avoid confusion because this is
a fairly overloaded war
not just in the Java realm but just a
nighty in general there's all sorts of
agents out there so to be really
specific of what I'm talking about when
I'm talking about an agent here I'm not
talking about a Java agent at JDK 5
there were actually two agent API so to
speak that were introduced there was the
java.lang instrument that give it
allowed us to do bytecode
instrumentation where we could you know
replace the implementations of methods
in classes and things like that and do
all this with pure Java implementations
which is really cool and really useful
and and it's it deserves its own talk by
we're not going to cover that today but
and that's loaded from the command line
with the Java agent so what I'm talking
about with JVM Ti is the other option
the the native agent and so the native
agent is based off of the JVM t.i API
that we'll talk about in a few slides
and it's loaded with either agent Lib or
agent path and these both basically have
the same functionality it's just the
only difference is how they look up the
the agent with agent Lib which is kind
of the recommended way the platform kind
of default behavior in finding libraries
is used to convert whatever name you
pass it in to say like on Windows you
know blah blah blah dll or if you're on
a Linux or Solaris it'll be like Lib
blah blah blah ah so so so that kind of
change or lookup it does automatically
for you whereas an agent path you would
actually specifically give it a direct
path or an absolute path right to the
file that you want to load so if you're
on Windows you would say you know C
colon blah blah blah blah blah you know
blah blah blah DLL and tell it exactly
what to load but pretty much the same
thing so this is what we're gonna be
covering and in here just in in terms of
the debugging architecture and the
reference implementation for all this
stuff the JVM TI agent that will most
often be working with for the
pre-existing one is this the the Java
debug wire protocol agent so depending
on the platform it has a different name
right so you know
on on plastics platforms you get the the
standard libbed whatever ISO Windows and
then OS 10 as always does that this
thing's a little bit differently but you
know these are all basically the same
agent depending what platform you are
but but I can't stress this enough this
is just one kind of configuration or one
kind of use case scenario JVM t I had
can lets you do all sorts of other
amazing and cool things in addition to
just being kind of the mouthpiece for
debugger you in the same way that JDI is
kind of a translator between your Java
debugger application and the wire
protocol these agent libraries these JVM
agent libraries are kind of a
translation between the wire protocol
and JVM ti so G probably the most
important thing to really understand or
to be able to code against JVM ti is to
understand J and I because it's based
off of it some people sometimes refer to
it as an extension of the j'ni interface
but or api but it's it's not really
technically an extension there are some
important differences but the nice thing
is that you can mix calls you know but
with them so you can have J and I or I'm
JVM ti agents that use J and I and and
that's pretty much expected there's a
lot of functionality in JVM ti that
seems to be missing until you realize
that no the assumption is that you're
going to be using J and I calls in
addition to the new stuff that JV JVM TI
makes possible but but you know like all
the standard data types that we have in
Jay and I are used in JVM ti we use the
same kind of strange modification of
utf-8 or we don't have null values and
things like that that Jay and I uses so
if you're used to coding in J&amp;amp;I you'll
be very comfortable and you'll be able
to pick up jb m TI very quickly if
you're not used to coding in J and I you
know Jay and I itself is not that
difficult to learn but that that's going
to need to be the first step you take
before you you start taking on JVM ti
agents that said there are some
important differences just to do a brief
review though of what J and I looks like
the you know if I was a summarize j.j
and I in like three slides which is what
I'm about to do here and the most
important thing is that there's an in
there's an environment pointer so to
speak and that's that is different for
each thread and it basically gives you
access to a table of all you know
pointers to all of the the
implementations of the different j'ni
functions
so most of J&amp;amp;I coding really is just
about you get called you know usually
from the from the JVM and you have that
environment pointer and then use that to
access the j'ni functions and that kind
of lets you call back into the JVM and
get things like the values of fields and
make calls into Java and why not
so does that look like at the code level
usually most J&amp;amp;I codes written in C++ or
straight see this is a straight C
example I just want to point out so it's
just you know we have you know kind of
corresponding versions J&amp;amp;I versions of
Java primitive types it's like a Java
primitive double is now a J double in J
and I speak and then but the key here is
that this environment is being passed in
and then we use that to get access to
the Jain IEP I itself so it's fairly
straightforward and if you're
comfortable of C it's not that bizarre
of an API to use you just have to make
sure that to do error checking very well
that seems to gets most people caught up
so that that's that's j9 that that's
kind of what the JJ and I environment is
that you always hopefully have access to
that that pointer that can get you
everything else and similarly JVM ti
also has an environment that it takes
the form of a pointer that you get
handed and that environment as far as
the information it contains so to speak
represents the event callbacks you know
do like like what you want to do when in
a certain event happens you you express
that by registering a callback you
enable or disable particular events that
you were going to be interested in you
know the kind of events that you want to
either instrument or profile in some
sense and we have capabilities that you
can turn on and off
I'll explain what capabilities are in
just a second and also there's um
there's JVM ti specific memory
allocation and de-allocation hooks so
that the libraries can can be kind of
managed by the JVM as they're loaded and
unloaded so one kind of very important
difference between the environments and
this is why I say that's not purely just
an extension of j'ni is that you you
basically have one environment per agent
with JVM Ti so you can have as many
agents as you want there's no limitation
on how many agents can concurrently be
loaded by JVM and running an instrument
encoder doing whatever but each of them
has its own environment and only one
environment unless something's going
horribly wrong
whereas in J&amp;amp;I you actually have a
separate j'ni environment per thread so
that's that's just an important thing
that you know a lot of J&amp;amp;I programmers
get caught up in when they when they
start running JVM ti code now
capabilities this is actually one of the
the core parts of the JVM TI api this is
what sets it apart from from the kind of
older and less efficient things and
basically it's just a bunch of flags
that say what that this agent is allowed
to do so usually what happens is there's
a negotiation between an agent when it's
loaded whether that be during JVM
startup or you know dynamically if the
library was loaded during the runtime
where the JVM you are the agent we
usually just start off and say ok so
what capabilities you do support like do
support capturing exceptions that are
thrown or do you support you know
walking frame stacks and things like
that and so it'll last the JVM what it
supports and the JVM will come back and
say these are the capabilities I support
and depending on what that agent needs
to do the agent might just decide at
that point that well I can't really be
useful on this JVM this JVM doesn't
support the kind of functionality I need
and so it might just bail
I know as very often is the case
actually there's a lot a lot of JVMs
will run with a sudden they can have run
with a subset of all the possible
options that they're capable of using so
they'll say that you know these options
are required
I'll refuse to load to fight I can't get
them but these other capabilities you
know if they're available then that's
nice and I'll use them but otherwise I
can live without them so it gives you
this kind of what I would referred to
early as the you know that pay-as-you-go
thing where as an enabling certain
capabilities you know as the agent you
know the JVM says I can do a B and C and
you say ok well I want you to do B and C
for me I'm interested in those types
events and things then only then you
incur the cost and you only incur the
cost ideally for the particular
capabilities that you enabled so it's a
very powerful mechanism to allow you to
it's not this all-or-nothing approach
like what we used to have with X debug
and and the really old you know the pre
1.4 versions of the of the debug
architecture where basically if you're
saying debug the JVM just ran completely
an interpreted mode and we're really
really slow because it just assumed that
you know it had to make all of the
debugging features and all of the
profiling features available to you
whether you're going to use them or not
but capability says you know you just
you can probe the JVM to ask what it
supports and then you can tell it which
of those you actually plan on using now
it's important to understand here that
there's actually kind of two levels of
cost because just because you you
declare to the JVM that hey you know I
want to use the I'm interested in using
this capability that doesn't necessarily
mean that that you're going to use it or
that you're going to use it against all
of the different kind of target entities
that it could be targeted against so for
example you could say oh I'm I'm
interested in being able to you know
iterate through the heap but I only want
to be you know I only will iterate
through the heap to collect some sort of
you know histogram or something like
that under very rare and strange
circumstances so there is often a cost
of just saying you know just declaring a
capability you know for example there
might be certain optimizations that the
JIT compiler will avoid to make sure
that if you do come back and say ok I
want to now enable this event and
actually you know right now I actually
want to you
that that will be available to you but
very often there's a very different
level of overhead between just saying
just declaring the capability and versus
using it
another thing that's that's very
different from JVM ti versus what we had
with the previous with the previous
api's was that it depends very very
heavily on bytecode insertion or a BCI
is you know people will argue till
they're blue in the face about whether
it's bytecode injection or bytecode
instrumentation or bytecode insertion
and and I don't think many of you and
certainly I don't care which of those is
actually correct but basically it's a
way to stick by codes into methods and
so you know we can take a class file as
we're loading it and modify it before
the JVM actually gets its hands on it
even say before the verifier runs and
change things around or we can take
classes that have already been loaded
and are in use by the JVM and and
dynamically at runtime just arbitrarily
change the class now there's there's
limitations on that of course we can't
change like say the the the layout of
fields and things like that because we
have to be able to guarantee that
objects that are already on the heap are
still valid even if we change the
definition of the class but well we can
change we can actually change the code
in the methods and we can't change
method signatures but we can change the
implementation that they run and this is
very useful for things like say if we're
gonna profile something say I want
vocation counts of how many times a
particular method is called the this API
will allow me to come in and just create
my own you know standalone class that
has some static fields that that
represent you know invocation counts and
then I can use by code injection to
inject an hour access or at the very
beginning you know kind of like right
after the prologue of each of those
methods that I'm interested in profiling
that will increment those counters for
me so it really lets you do anything and
a lot of people look at this thing go
well this is so much harder than say the
original profiling interface was and in
this sense they're right because you
know you have to kind of roll your own
for everything you have to be very
familiar with how to generate correct
bytecode and have it pass verification
and all that other things and so there
is kind of a cognitive overhead that you
as a developer who's using JVM Ti has to
deal with when you're when you're trying
to instrument things with byte code
injection but the other side of that is
that just because whatever you're doing
is is Java bytecode it's automatically
compatible with everything within the
JVM so it doesn't matter what garbage
collector collector you're using it
doesn't matter what JIT compiler you're
using or anything it doesn't in the
license as long as JVM Ti itself is
support it doesn't matter what JVM
you're using by definition you know all
of these technologies are able to run
and understand Java bytecode
so by using by doing rolling your own
implementations for all this stuff and
putting it into the application at
points where that you're interested in
in profiling or debugging or whatever it
lets you kind of speak the lingua franca
of the Java ecosystem and every you know
JVM or runtime implementation
understands that so you no longer have
the case where it like you had with the
old profiling interface where you're
limited to only a subset of particular
Java collectors that we bother to
implement that functionality in because
it doesn't actually depend on other
functionality within the JVM the only
thing it depends on is the JVM support
of JVM TI which says you can you can
stick new byte codes into pretty much
any method and also lets you do I mean
there there's so many other uses use
cases outside of this there's there's
fixing continued debugging you know
where you could actually some IDs would
allow you to actually you know modify
the implementation of the method replace
that without restarting the system and
then just just keep running and continue
debugging
this is kind of the sky's limit so what
does an agent actually look like when it
when it's being used so there's an
initialization phase when it starts off
and that there's two functions that will
get called automatically if it's one
that if you specify it on the command
line on the onload load will get called
or if you attach it dynamically at some
time during the during the runtime then
unattach will get called but both of
these methods are both these functions
basically have the same role that their
job is to kind of initialize and set up
the agent and so when we're being set up
what we want to do is we want to you
know kind of ask the JVM okay so what
capabilities do you support and then JVM
will tell us and then we'll decide if we
want to continue or not if we do want to
continue then we'll ask the JVM for a
specific subset of those capabilities
maybe all of them who knows then will
actually say okay so you know a for
particular events that I'm interested in
you know the way that I'm as an agent
I'm informed of those events is that the
callbacks are called by the JVM and so I
have to actually register my callbacks
during initialization and then I enable
enable particular events and all this
can can change dynamically so later I
could be I could be interested in one
event during the beginning like like
warm-up phase of my application and then
later I could be like I'm no longer
interested in those events I want to
look at a different event or whatever so
all this can be dynamically enabled and
disabled and then just it's kind of
almost like a GUI event dispatch thread
or something you just kind of process
your events as they happen but they'll
they'll happen on the individual thread
where the actual of the event occurred
and then finally when when the JVM shut
down usually in most cases because it's
for most implementations it's difficult
to unload a library once you've loaded
it there's an agent unload where we
could do things like perhaps like
persist data that we've collected to
disk or do anything else that we might
want to some housekeeping chores and
want to do before the JVM dies so a
typical example of what this would
actually look like in practice is most
jvr most JVM ti agents have the the mob
where they want to be active from
startup and the reason is is because
there's a whole lot of things that the
JVM does when it's starting up that it
wants to do differently if certain
capabilities are enabled so if you wait
until the JVM is actually up and running
Java code it's too late to be like ok I
actually wanted this capability or I
wanted this functionality so you want to
be able to get in there and and declare
you know capabilities that that would
otherwise be disabled by the time the
JVM got up and running you also want to
be able to change the environment so for
example some aid agents although I think
this is rather odd but they can go in
and change the the system properties so
they could do anything they can modify
files I mean the JVM literally is not
even running yet you know classes have
been loaded no Java code has been
executed at this point so at the all
node thing it gives you this kind of
primordial state of the JVM so that you
can set things up to make sure that
you're able to capture profile or debug
everything so you've even the most you
know kind of basic classes that are part
of you know what we referred to as like
the system classes there's a couple
dozen classes that are loaded you know
at the very very beginning even before
we start loading you know the standard
classes that show version would load and
and you know if you wanted to somehow
instrument those or interact with with
the class loading you would need to be
in the very beginning so a standard
agent or the most common form of agent I
guess see it kind of this and so on it
sets its callbacks and then it sets just
a few events to enabled and the reason
it does this is because there's actually
a lot of limitations of what you can do
for example you really can't call J&amp;amp;I
most J&amp;amp;I functionality because the JVM
is not running yet so you kind of set up
what you want to do and you know kind of
put everything in place and then you you
know usually they'll register like like
thread death JVM start and VM in it seem
to be the big three but kind of the one
more muster just as VM in it because
that's when the VM comes back and says
I'm actually started and I can run Java
code and you know I'm awake now so then
we returned from onload then we we get
called back from the
the VM hopefully immediately to say that
the VM has actually started and that's
when we can go on and kind of turn
everything else on and really start you
know doing whatever it is that agent
wants to do and again of course when we
actually are unloaded there might be
some kind of cleanup that we want to do
so we can actually look into and see all
of this when it's happening on the VM
there's a really nifty option it's like
one of many I mean hotspot has well over
a thousand different options almost all
of which are undocumented and one of
those undocumented occupant adoptions or
barely documented options is this trace
JVM TI and it'll show you you know
usually what thread that the processing
is running on or even before you know
like when you're being run from the
primordial thread before the JVM is even
really up and started and it can show
you basically everything about the
interaction that the JVM TI agent is
doing it's very simple to use you just
have this on your command line and you
have one or more descriptors which I
will describe so a descriptor basically
has three separate fields there's
actually no spaces between them in
practice the domain says we can kind of
what you're interested in like so you
can say all calls to a particular
function if you name that that
particular JVM TI function in there then
it'll this descriptor will catch all of
those there's kind of strange how you
have func which is all the major
functions and then like every every
function is a function but not all
functions are functions so it's kind of
an Orwellian thing going on there but um
you can basically specify what what
types of events or interactions across
this this API boundary you're interested
and getting debug out in play and then
you can add or remove tracing to that
and the reason why you'd want to be able
to remove tracing is that you might want
to use in a previous descriptor you add
everything and you're like I want
everything except this one little part
that happens very frequently and I'm not
interested in so by by kind of combining
multiple descriptors together and adding
and removing in chunks you can really
narrow it down to exactly what you want
to trace and then
for each individual interaction or event
for lack of a better word you can say
okay so what do I want to actually send
to the standardout about this and so I
can see what the agents passing in what
it's returning all that stuff so I
wouldn't really go as far as to call
this a demo because it's it's really a
pretty straightforward thing but let's
say I just have a a simple I just have
some Java program that does nothing but
calls thread sleep and but it has this
thus enabling so it's basically saying I
want to enable everything and I want the
input
I want the event data I want you know
just every all the data that we can
possibly trace for JVM Ti and I'm here
I'm loading the wire protocol agent so
this is something a lot of people are
interested in because they want to know
okay so if I don't use it like I'm not
like there's no part of this demo that
includes a debugger I'm not actually
going to attach to it but just the fact
that I'm starting the JVM with with the
wire protocol agent there's going to be
a cost to that because certain
capabilities are enabled and so you can
see here the you know off the bat so the
the agent is querying the JVM saying
okay what are you capable of the JVM
responds with some subset of
capabilities and then we go ahead and
add those based off of what it said
we've obviously decided that will
continue and then we wait till the JVM
actually starts up you know we set our
callbacks wait till it starts up and
then we go ahead and enable a whole
bunch of Numan events that were
interested in but this if we see and I'm
just one more minute so if we see when
we actually ask for the capabilities
this is fairly hard for a human to read
but each capability is represented by
single bit in this struct of its here so
to actually make sense of that or it's
you know you can kind of take it apart
by hand but I've done that for you in
this particular case
so we can see what the the debugger
depends on and we can see that the
required ones is there there's quite a
lot of capabilities that we require but
there's also a whole bunch that that are
are optional we may or may not have and
this goes back to the final topic and
we're about 30 seconds out from the end
here but around the time of Java 1.4 Sun
came out and said that we now offer full
speed debugging meaning that you can
enable debugging and and basically I
don't know if I read this I kind of
think that they're saying that there's
no cost and this isn't exactly true the
the idea was that you know with 1.4 or
1.41 depending on which which of the two
JIT compilers you were using that there
would no longer be an overhead to
running a debugger and this is kind of
where I think we saw a whole bunch of
users start just randomly enabling the
the wire protocol the debug wire
protocol in their environments without
thinking about the security implications
or the performance implications so okay
is it really full speed this is because
I really wasn't sure about the
intellectual property implications of
the Spotted or the the winter owl or
whatever the snow owl the snowy owl that
is usually associated with this meme you
know but it's it's kind of doubtful it's
hard to believe that this is you know
really full speed and in fact the reason
they called it full speed was just
because compared to what what it used to
be it's so much faster it's several
orders of magnitude faster because what
used to happen in the bad old days of
you know 1.3 or before everyone 1.3 with
you know hotspot you expect it to jet
compile all of your hot methods but if
you told it that you were gonna use
debug if you're using this like X debug
flag which today is more or less just to
no op it would basically disable all of
your jet compilation and so you'd be
running in a pure interpreted mode and
the JVM did that just because it wanted
to be prepared just in case you set a
breakpoint in some method at some point
so when they say full speed debugging
what they mean by you know after one
point four you know pretty much all of
your methods except a method that you
set a breakpoint in will be
Jek compiled now so relatively speaking
it's almost as fast but again you know
we're still setting up all these
capabilities even if you don't attach
with a debugger you know just by loading
the JVM TI library all these
capabilities are enabled by the agent so
these capabilities do have a cost and we
have seen users hit those for example
very heavy use of reflection and can
sometimes trigger certain edge cases
where there's performance repercussions
to having those capabilities enabled
even if you're not doing debugging so
you know usually there's not a
noticeable impact but you know that
there's no there's no guarantees there's
no such thing as a free lunch so wrap up
final slide I just really wanted to
point out I mean I I'm obviously not
going to be able to talk to you for 50
minutes and have you just immediately go
out and start writing JVM TI code or
writing a client for the the wire
protocol or anything like that but
hopefully now you have a sense of how
the three different components of the
debug architecture now fit together and
what you can do with them so that if you
did want to write a JVM T I wonder if
you're interested you would know you
know where to start so to speak and
where to look for more information but
you know one thing though stress is not
just for debugging there's so many
different things one of the things that
when I was preparing for this talk I was
surprised as when I started telling
people I was going to talk about this so
many people told me stories about JVM ti
clients that there are agents that they
wrote and it seems like it's a lot more
common to write like one-off agents you
know just for a particular strange
troubleshooting scenario that someone
had came across then I ever anticipated
so it's it's much more flexible and
useful than I think people realize and
so there's a lot of power there so just
be aware of it because you might run
across a situation where you want to go
and explore it more and use it these are
the resources especially martin's talk i
highly recommend it he has a lot of
really fantastic demos really enjoyable
and he does an excellent job of
explaining JDI and some of the basics of
debugging and what the different IDs
offer so definitely have a look at all
this stuff and Kelly O'Hara's blog also
is very worth reading there's a whole
of great gbmt I articles thank you very
much I very much appreciate your
patience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
