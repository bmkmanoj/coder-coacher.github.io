a senior product manager for the Java
platform group at Oracle standard
disclaimer most of the stuff I'm going
to be talking about is things that are
already out there so of course there's
no disclaimer for those but I will talk
a little bit about features features
that are going to be coming out in
following releases so on those standard
disclaimer applies these are plants
plants are subject to change tell you a
little bit about myself what I will
cover and what not just the set
expectations then I'll give you a detail
release by release what we have done to
improve the security of the jury and
then I just have a few slides that I
live open with other sessions which you
know I thought may be interesting if
you're looking into security so as I
mentioned I've been with the product
management team for oracle since joining
through the San acquisition before that
I was on the power management team for
son I got an MBA from MIT and a
bachelor's in systems engineering from
University element what I will cover in
this session so i will focus on the
changes in plugin and this is a little
high i think we lowered just a bit or is
it just me standing here that it's
getting a very low is that better okay
well let's give that a try so I'm going
to be talking about changes in plug-in
and Jerry deployment there's two
approaches to secure about to solve
problems about vulnerabilities one would
be to eliminate security vulnerabilities
and keep others from appearing and the
other one is to make it hard to exploit
any potential vulnerabilities so without
trying to pinpoint any vulnerability how
do you avoid any potential ones from
actually getting Paul now we're working
very hard on both fronts and you will
have other sessions about you know a
list of security vulnerabilities fixed
I'm going to cover on the the second
from how I making it harder to exploit
any potential security vulnerabilities
so I will not give you a detailed list
of here all the security vulnerabilities
that have been fixed in each critical
patch update and every security alert if
you are interested in that you can go to
the release notes for each one of those
and there's a link that says oracle java
SE critical patch update advisor which
will detail every one of them with you
know here's the link here's the
vulnerability here's the area covered
here's the ssv score etc etc now to
understand a little bit of the problem
area that we're focusing in not all Java
users are created equal so any solution
that we can think of that is you know
and here it applies for everybody just
won't work there's some users for which
security is paramount I heard some of
you guys talking and saying you know any
application that doesn't keep up-to-date
with security standards should just be
left behind it should just stop working
and Java should be updated as frequently
as possible anytime you have a fixed for
a security vulnerability you should just
fire up another cpu and update you know
several times a week if needed just keep
all vulnerabilities out of it there's
some other users that use Java for
mission-critical applications and they
cannot afford an application stopping
for any reason some of them they run
applets in a known safe environment so
they're willing to take some extra risk
they may have security policies that
require every piece of software and that
includes updates to the GRE to be tested
for weeks or months before they can be
deployed within the enterprise and they
would prefer no update whatsoever but
when they have to update they need
months of warning so that they can plan
and schedule some test cycles and most
of us are somewhere in between right we
are willing to take some risk for
certain applications if there is
something that you know there's a game
that has some vulnerability you'll stop
playing it if you discover some
vulnerability in your mail client until
they fix it you're not going to stop
reading your mail right you may look for
alternatives but if that's the only
thing you have
people will choose to take a little bit
more risk on some applications than
others so I'll just dive right in this
is what you guys came to see details on
a release by release what have we bet
what have we been up to since last year
now when I first thought about this
session I thought this would be a
shorter list it's you know once you try
to compile them you realize it's really
quite a lot so starting with 7up day two
and I'm going a little bit later than a
year before that when you want it to run
an application with an older release of
Java if your applet said I want to run
with six you 21 if you didn't have that
we would actually ask you would you like
to download it we change that and we're
saying you don't have that we're just
going to run it with the current one you
can still go and grab the older version
but you know now it's a manual process
and then you get a different set of
warnings with 7 update for we changed
the way that you could run self-signed
applications so for sale sign before you
could just you know get this little
warning I'm self-signed would you like
to let me run and you could see it run
or cancel now we added a little checkbox
that you have to select first that
basically says I understand the risk and
that will enable the Run button to keep
people from just getting run
mechanically 7 update 5 in June we
change the code so that when we
triggered the outer update from JRE six
to seven you would remove Jerry 6 now of
course nobody saw this and the we did
trigger they are update from Jerry six
to seven which happened in 715 but
that's when we did the code changes I'm
going to interlace with some screenshots
right so this is the new dialog that you
see notice it just asked ok you want to
run with an older version there's no
click here to get that older version
it's more click here to run with the
latest version as I said you can get
that older version from the Java
archives you have to sign in and just so
that nobody gets tricked into
downloading an older version and
then you will get a different set of
dialogues saying you have that older
version would you like to run with that
or run with this one the self sign
applications that little check box at
the bottom that's what's new before that
it was just run and cancel now you have
to select that thing in order to enable
the Run button and also notice the big
red signing about it will be blocked in
a future release now these dialogues
serve a dual purpose on one hand they
warn users about something on the other
hand they let developers know about
what's unsafe and as it clearly states
here the sell-side applications will no
longer be allowed by default in a future
release I'll get to that in a few 7
update 6 we did some minor tweaks to the
full permissions application dialogue
the you know it's very subtle but they
always trust option is now unchecked by
default that's not something that you
want to just let users select without
actually making a choice and we added a
new functionality on the outer update
pings so if you're familiar with the
concept of the security baseline the JRE
knows when it is the latest version it
has all the security patches before 7
update 6 that was just hard coded in the
JRE so until you update it to another
JRE the current Jerry always thought
that it was above the security baseline
and that's obviously wrong right so if
you were to install you know 6 update 10
even though we may release other
versions until you updated it would
always think that it was above the
baseline what we did with 7 update 6 was
at the capability so that every time
that we ping Oracle to see if there's
new updates it would actually update the
security based on information without
having to you know even if you say no I
don't want to update now your system
will know that it was below the baseline
and it will act slightly differently
okay that only worked for windows 32 and
Mac the only platforms for which
we offer our update you will notice that
if you're using windows 64 or Linux you
have to manually update there is no
other update mechanism so you know that
solve a little bit of the problem we got
better in a future release 7 update 10
is that that's when most people started
noticing some of these changes because
that's where we offered in the control
panel the capability of disabling the
plugin so you all remember some news
that recommended you should disable
plugin you can if you need Java just to
run desktop applications you shouldn't
have it accessible from the browser and
it was always follow about well how do i
disable it and it had these complicated
set of instructions you know if you're
using Safari you do this using Firefox
the days use chrome do this use Internet
Explorer there's no way of the same way
we decided it would be simpler and
easier if we just have an entry in the
control panel so that's the equivalent
of going to each one of them and
toggling it off we also introduced the
concept of the security level slider and
the default value at the time was medium
which meant that unsigned applications
would prompt you if you were trying to
run with an expired Jerry an older Jerry
they would still run fine if you're
running in the most current one just run
without any warning or prompting we
added the JRE out-of-date warning so as
I mentioned there are some differences
in mechanism like the fact that you know
if you're running on an expired jury now
you get a prompt but that's a bit subtle
and we don't want to be subtle about
this so now when you run an applet the
first thing we figure out is are you
below or above the security baseline are
you expired and if you are we'll put a
big nice prompt letting you know it's
time to update and now this is not just
for you know Windows or Mac this is for
every platform and we figured well what
happens you know from our prior
experience if we cannot be moral and
you're Jerry even when he tries to ping
its blog there's no connection you know
some administrator turned off that poor
well we hard-coded a JRE expiration date
we figure after these much longer it is
safe to assume that there's a new
version out there and even though I
wasn't able to ping Oracle I'm just
going to start throwing that warning and
saying you should go on update and we
have a couple of tools jnlp and
deployment toolkit that would in the
past allow a developer to specify that
you needed to download an older version
of the JRE we disable that capability
for anything below the security baseline
ok so you can no longer have the g NLP
and deployment toolkit from the user and
made it simple to get an older version
of the GRE as i mentioned you can always
manually get it but now it's a more
involved step so this is a very subtle
change this is the up dialogue that you
get when you're trying to run with
unrestricted access it's just that
little checkbox unchecked by default
slightly nicer the more information
icons it's getting better UI there's
going to be another session about how
this has evolved but we're trying to
make it clearer and cleaner what these
dialogues mean the security level slider
you will notice on the top that little
enabled you have a content in the
browser if you uncheck that thing it's
the same thing as removing plugging in
all the browsers okay and this slider
which started a very high went all the
way too low and had a custom setting
this is what we have 47 you 10 this is
the GRE out of date warning so before
running any applet we check and it's
either of two conditions right have I
pinned Oracle and be notified that i am
below the baseline then I'm below the
baseline or have I reached the
expiration date when either of those is
true every time I run an applet I get
this warning most people never reach the
expiration date because we of course
created it in such a way that it's after
the release of the neck CPU and users
could if you hit update they'll just
drop you into
calm you can get the latest version of
the jury get your computer after day you
say block and of course you'll just stop
the content from running or later and
it'll run now and I'll just prompt you
again next time now if you didn't want
to see that warning again next time you
could check the little box at the bottom
before hidden later and it will not
prompt you again until we release a new
update now this sounds very simple by
the way but it created a lot of angst
with some enterprises those that do not
give full permissions to their users so
as you can imagine remember what I said
different risks those enterprises were
really inconvenience by this well yeah
you can see the airport when I said
inconvenience but you know it's as I
said it's this is a good thing for end
users that have control of their
computers and before weren't aware not
so great for an enterprise control
system where the administrator wanted
these choice and now I'm prompting the
end user to do it so we have a solution
for that as well 7 update 11 that was a
security alert one of the things that we
did was change the default security
level to high that's very subtle but
that means that unsigned applications
now prompt to run in every Jerry even
the current so we've basically turned
Java or to click the plane before this
we sort of stood behind the sandbox and
said if it's running within the sandbox
there's no need to one or ask it just
runs now we're saying no no we should
let the user have a choice on whether or
not to run even sandbox applications 7
update 15 we started out of upgrading
users from jerry 62 jerry seven we had
already announced several years actually
ago that we were going to stop providing
public updates from JRE 6 so it was now
time to move users to the later version
because if not you're just going to be
stuck with an old version that doesn't
get updates you can always buy support
and get older versions of
six with security patches but that's not
what most end-users will do so time to
move them to seven and we announced that
we were d supporting plug in one which
is an old plug-in that was available in
six was around as a fallback mechanism
in seven we're just making it very clear
if you look at the release notes no
longer supporting now this is the prompt
that this is it the new prompt for
unsigned applications and once again
it's just random cancel letting you know
I'm going to run inside location big red
sign these will be blogged in a future
release so of course when we do these
somebody's going to say that we did it
out of the blue without any warning we
started notifying people a while ago you
click the more information button you
get a little explanation the side 7
update 21 these as you can see by the
amount of changes this is the largest
amount of changes that we've that in a
single release so here we go bear with
me changes to mix called warnings
basically javascript is now treated as
mixed code sign an unsigned code
interactive so it gets a similar warning
we heat the always stressed option for
some situations so that little checkbox
that allow you to say I've already
answered this question don't ask me
again when I'm trying to run this applet
it's still available it's just hidden
under the more information button I have
a screenshot I'll show that in a minute
blacklisting of jars and certificate
before this Oracle have the capability
of blacklisting jars and this was
designed so that if somebody called and
said well you know I wrote this jar and
I have discovered a vulnerability in it
I don't want to cancel my certificate
they could let us know and we could just
say okay well black list that particular
jar but of course that doesn't solve for
the problem of okay I want to black list
everything sign with a certificate so
we've included that capability as well
dynamic update of security information
as I mentioned with seven to ten we
added it to the auto update thing which
works for windows and mac with 7 update
21
this thing is now every time you run an
applet it checks and says have I checked
in the last 24 hours we don't want to
check you know if you run the same
applet three times we want to check
three times in one day but every 24
hours we'll go ahead and ping and heat
Oracle and now it will update the
security baseline the least of
blacklisted jars and the list of
blackness that certificates because we
wanted to be able to blacklist a
certificate and get most users
up-to-date not within 24 hours we remove
the law and custom settings from the
security slider you can see a pattern
here we're trying to ease in the
restrictions so those were too simple
and you know people would just lower
them to low and don't get any warnings
and that was not really safe we
introduced a new concept of assigned
sandbox before seven to 21 Oracle's
recommendation was if you want to use a
sandbox application you should not sign
it and if you're going to use for
permissions you should sign it and that
created this situation where most people
equated signing with requesting
permissions since we're moving to a
model where every applet must be signed
we have to introduce this concept of
okay it's signed yet is still within the
sandbox this was introduced in 21 we
created something called the server JRE
which you can think of it as a Jerry
without plugging so if you're creating
an application that it's meant to run on
a server you were faced with two choices
I can grab the JRE which has plug-in and
doesn't have some tools like Java
compile which some applications need or
I can get the JDK which has a lot of
tools that you know are not really
needed for a production environment
they're meant more for development
conceptually the server JRE will be just
the GRE with the tools needed to run for
the server in this first incarnation
it's basically the jdk without plugins
so it has all the tools with jdk 8 i'll
get cleaner and will be less of the
tools that you do not need in production
we were working for a while on an
uninstall applet that will scan your
system for all the gre's and recommend
based on the security level whether you
should keep a Jerry or remove it and
that have been available in Java calm
you would have to go and look for it we
change the insta update flow so that at
the end of the update will drop you on
that applet and try to get more people
to remove all the versions of the JRE
from their systems we provided some
tools for packaging Java applications as
mac OS up files so that you could put
them on the store this is if you will
migration you know if if you're saying
that plugins are getting hard to use
what is the alternative well you can
bundle a GRE with your application and
create something that looks like a
native application not distributed via
the browser but you know like you would
distribute any application including the
mac OS app store so that's the first of
its kind we're going to provide tools i
mean you can use those tools to create
something that looks like an exe for
windows and we're going to improve that
functionality over time as well we
started posting the GRE expiration date
in the release notes as I mention it we
created it with just it's going to be
after the next release turns out that a
lot of people really wanted to know the
exact date then you know ok now it's
posted in the release note we associated
the location to the always stress
certificate it used to be that if you
trusted a certificate and you say I want
to trust this certificate it would trust
all applets signed by that certificate
that's not what most people want I want
to trust the applets signed by that
certificate in a proper location so if
somebody grabs an applet signed by
Oracle and post it on their side maybe I
don't want to trust that and that's when
we started doing that and there were
some life connect changes basically it's
blocked in some cases if you set this
light is very high for example so this
is the one I mentioned about I'm going
to hide the button to remember this
decision you'll notice that show options
at the bar
if you expand that that's where you have
the do not show this again for this
application that's disabled by default
you have to check the I accept the risk
in order to enable the run and that
option okay the security level slider
gotta I was gonna hair haircut but
trimmed at the bottom now the default is
by the way hi and this is the all GRE
and install applet I run this you will
see at the bottom which says secure
versions and install not needed java 7
update 40 I run this with the current
version the machine that i was running
these at java day 21 as well which is
now below the baseline so this thing
prompted me to remove that he'd be and
install selected versions it ran an
installer and a guide weight of that
version for me and this is now part of
the GRE installer flow 7 update 25 we're
getting close to now we enable
certificate revocation by default so for
those of you that follow this in the
past certificate revocation had always
been an option but it was turned off by
default a few years ago son turned it on
for one release and it overwhelmed the
certificate revocation servers and a
bunch of applications started falsely
reporting that i couldn't get to it root
certificate authorities have fixed that
problem and now they can handle this now
this is on by default you could always
just turn it on and now you can always
just turn it off as well if you prefer
we added a couple of new jar manifest
attributes and these are quite important
especially the first one now that we're
asking that everybody sound means
everything it used to be that you would
specify the permissions of the applet in
your HTML tag that's not sign so we open
the door for somebody to grab an applet
that was designed to run as a sandbox
application grab it move it to a
different side right another HTML page
and request for permissions
and you know that's scary because you
may get a hey I want to run something
with full permissions but it's signed by
somebody I trust so you're more likely
to say yes in order to avoid these we've
given the developer the opportunity of
specifying in the manifest which is part
of what sign I've designed this applet
to run as a sandbox application I don't
want anybody elevating permissions on it
so now if you run this thing it will
only run as sandbox as the developer
intended likewise there's a code base
attribute which would let you lock down
your applet so that it can only be
launched if it is hosted on the domain
for which you intended it so we could
lock the applet that checks if you have
the latest version of the jury so that
it can only be run by if hosted in
oracle com if you move that to a
different site and you try to launch it
the Apple tape sorry you know this was
meant to be hosted in oracle com wrong
place something fishy I'm not going to
run it now that will always remain
optional it's encouraged now anybody can
tell me why we have to keep that one
optional
there's one option reusability the cases
some developers do not know where their
applet is going to end up so if you're
an isv and you write an applet and you
sell it to a bunch of people you don't
want to have to create a jar for each
one of the companies that you're going
to sell these to write so that one is
recommended and if you're writing your
own a pet for your own company and you
know the code base we encourage you to
write it but it's not required so the
gentleman's point is hiep he thought
that that was going to be required and
they were doing exactly what I'm saying
we're trying to avoid by making it
optional you do not have to generate a
custom jar fridge for each client you do
have to say permissions but not always
fair enough so I'm just repeating for
the recording so the concern is he says
even though we've made it optional he
believes that they have to do it and
they have to include it for each one of
the customers to improve security and
personally that's more secure that's
what I think it's just not something
that we can force everybody to do so I
applaud you for that decision but you
know I we cannot force that decision on
every is V secure validation of XML
basically we gave you the option of
turning off the include portion which
would bring unsigned XML into your side
XML some help buttons for security
dialogue so that you can get more
information if you don't understand what
I security dialogue is saying and the
deployment toolkit now no longer allows
you to download Jerry 6 as I mentioned
before there's no public version of
Jerry 6 that's up to date therefore no
need to download Jerry 6 we a deployment
toolkit 7 update 40 now this is my
favorite one and this is the current one
deployment ruleset i'll get to that one
in a minute option to disable the GRE
out of date warning remember that
warning that we introduced in seven to
10 you can go to the deployment
properties file and say I don't want to
see it and this is meant of course for
those enterprises that don't want their
end users to run any of these and we
have a new security warning for unsigned
and sell sign you can no longer remember
this decision you see the trend right or
anything that's not secure it's blocked
at the highest level then block at a
lower level and eventually removed and
we have a better performance on
certificate revocation checks in seven
you 25 if you have three applets signed
by the same certificate on the same page
and check three times now we're assuming
that you know the certificate hasn't
been revoked in the last millisecond so
within the same session we cash that
answer and we don't check every time now
the deployment rules it this is the
least of warning shown when you're
running a white listed application for
the apartment won't say nothing
basically what we want to do is give
system at minutes administrators a tool
for removing some of the decisions what
can be run what version is allowed to
run should I trust or not design run
sign applet and take it away from the
end from the from the desktop user to
the system inis trader level now there's
some caveats this tool is not meant for
an ISV to say oh now I can somehow let
my users stay on an old version of the
JRE this is for it's meant for
enterprises that have somebody that can
make these decisions for them can write
it's it's not complex but it's not you
know completely trivial it's not like a
plain text file it's an XML file that
has some rules about I can run this
version I want to block this version
this one signature can run any version
of the jury and then you have to deploy
it all the desktops
remember when I said that I may talk
about some things in the future what I'm
going to say now it's whole future so
don't forget that third slide that I
showed 7 update 45 that's coming in
october i will require the use of the
permission attribute for all
applications on the very high security
setting that's not the default so that's
somebody that had to go and move that
for everybody else I'm going to warn you
because in 1751 and here's the news I'm
going to block self signed and unsigned
for our applets on the default security
level and I'm going to require the use
of the permission attribute for all
applications so in case you missed that
I'm not trying to be subtle here you
have to update every applet written
before 7 update 25 or it will not run
with that by default okay so what am I
asking you to do well by the way this is
the warning that i'm going to put in
seven you 45 so if you're a developer
and you're using you're missing the
permissions attribute and you happen not
to be in this room so you didn't learn
about it is here this is how you will
know about it big yellow box the
application will be blocking a future
release because it's missing the
permission entry in the manifest click
the button you get this one with a big
red big yellow line click on that one
you'll see the documentation about how
to add it so we're trying to get as many
people as possible to this of course I'm
sure somebody will miss it and
unfortunately their app it will not stop
we'll stop working by default we will
provide a mechanism first of all
enterprises can use deployment rules in
and avoid this and continue using cell
signed and unsigned end users will have
a mechanism to go to the control panel
and specify that they want to be
prompted rather than blocked for sale
sign pretty much returning them to where
we are now okay but for most users it's
signed
or blood what are the changes you have
to sign with a trusted certificate all
applets must have the permission
attribute on the manifest and as I said
the permission is mandatory code base is
just strongly encouraged as i mentioned
enterprises can discontinue yet can
continue using it with the deployment
will set and then users will have the
option of switching back through the
control panel more importantly where
would I learn about these things because
you know I will continue to tighten
these for stuff that has already gone
out every release has detailed
information on the release notes those
are posted in OT n there's the link
you'll be able to get these slides and
when we have to update documentation the
release notes will point you to here's
the section of the documentation that we
have updated here's the new requirement
for signing etc for new things that have
not yet been released we've created a
new Java platform group blog on which
will give you as much notice advance
notice as possible of these changes what
I just announced now I think it was on
sep tember ninth that was really sort
through that block so if you keep an eye
on that one anytime we come up with a
here's a new restriction or hear
something new that you must do will
write it will write it in there okay
have a question
I'm going back one slide the question is
what choices do enterprises have well
the the recourse of you know the
preferred choice is to use the
deployment of all set if you're trying
to specify within computers that are an
enterprise resource you create this
deployment rules it and you will be able
to say things like you know these five
applets need these particular Jerry's
everything else you know if you're you
just say it runs only on the secure
version of Java or you can say
everything else is blocked and by the
way here's the message that I want you
to show if I block something it may say
you know if you believe you should have
access to these contact ball but IT
department and he'll add it for you or
evaluate it so that's all in the
deployment will say and to learn more
these are decisions that have already
happened so I'm just going to show them
quickly well you'll get the slides and
so you can probably find the slides
online and I'm going to leave these
sessions these are the future sessions
that are about to happen or will happen
tomorrow I'll leave that during the Q&amp;amp;A
session in case you want to take note of
any of the interesting sessions the ones
in slightly darker bold those are the
ones that i personally know some of the
people involved and i would strongly
recommend that you visit those ok so now
i'll open it up for questions
my efficient from your transmission that
one year that's very interesting talk
about me I really want actually I'm Java
programmer I want to use Java secret
confidence for me first and all my group
and for all of you around that's my past
but today's presentation for me I can
just enough simplifying as well it
actually is kind of just Jie updates or
Jie management and not necessary and
build any confidence for me it is
actually the char I self-care Excel is
more secure than before that's not sure
so what yeah I'm sorry I have to repeat
the whole question so if you you make it
very long it makes it very hard for me
to repeat what you just said so if I let
me paraphrase what you're saying is you
thought that we were going to be talking
more about how to make the Jerry itself
secure correct so I apologize if it was
misleading we try to put the description
of the session and as I pointed out we
are work that's what I said I think I'm
slide three we are working on securing
vulnerabilities okay but that's you know
there's other sessions where you go
through a detail of each one of them in
here what I'm trying to say is what are
we doing to make sure that even if we
don't catch the vulnerability it cannot
be exploited and yet there are other
sessions about what you can do as a
developer to secure it that's for
example Java deployment security
features and best practices which is
going to happen for them for 30 so
okay the Jie this care is secure enough
you can use it and because when I talk
to my manager I stick with a Java sofa
is much better much is secure then you
asked how do you know and then so so all
that presentation you mentally x-ray
didn't actually specify anything you you
guys have met you get a lot of job about
the security I have trust them but so
far from presentation I didn't get
anything for example today last section
is it this place they were born pretty
that you cheer they expect let's do they
exploit okay then okay some special
things actually try and fix and then
actually somebody asked question java
code is so large and ok you fix one a
150 one problem that's fine but how do
we know that the similar things will not
happen again and do you actually skin
our code base and to review on escape
all the frackers will make sure at least
we how cold is in our windows side yeah
I'm not going to even try to replicate
that for that okay so let me just add to
that insecurity it's a mad about risk
management really if you the only way to
be completely secure and not be hacked
and plug that thing don't ever turn it
on that's the only guarantee completely
safe way the best that we can do is then
take steps so yes as I mentioned before
we're working hard to remediate security
vulnerabilities now for obvious reasons
I cannot go into details as to what
we're doing because that would give
anybody the key as to all so what are
the steps that they're missing let me
try and exploit those so I apologize if
you thought you were going to get a
detailed list of here's everything that
Oracle is doing to secure it
unfortunately that cannot be shared okay
so what we can tell you is a what are we
taking what steps are we taking to make
sure that even if there is a
vulnerability you cannot be exploited be
we can show you what we have done and
hope that the track record speaks for
that and I mean this is not I'm not
trying to say oh you will never know if
something is secure we're trying to be
as open as possible without crossing the
boundary of being irresponsible
a lot of like the majority of reason why
at least in my opinion stuff like a java
applet seemed like the java plugin on
the browser the reason why most users
are affected by it is because i believe
as you mentioned previously a lot of
users just blindly click on a runner
they blindly click on always trust so
these so what we're into from this is
while you're you guys are working online
you know like catching up as much as you
can you know trying to deter users from
from doing that you know doing that by
came here I've seen it personally you
know like my like my mom for example so
the concern was about if you just let me
know if I got this right some of the
security steps if they're just a matter
of you know hey let's put another dialog
in front of it people just get used to
that click through whatever you put in
front of them now as simplistic answer
would be well I gave you the choice you
made a choice now you know deal with it
that would not be a good answer and
that's what we're taking extra steps
that's where we're making it
progressively harder to do dangerous
stuff at the same time as i mentioned i
cannot just randomly say well today I'm
going to stop supporting something that
has been working and everything you know
for your particular situation your
Indian enterprise you're completely
secure it's not going to work anymore
sorry that's also not acceptable so we
have to provide you with tools and at a
very high level here's what we want to
do I want to give enterprises tools to
make their own decisions okay they have
professional people that are their job
is to decide how much risk is that
Enterprise willing to take so I don't
want to force my decisions on them I
want to give end users that do not make
any choice the most secure experience so
that default should be only secure
things run and for those that do not
have an enterprise administrator making
calls I want to give you the option
and it should be a slightly convoluted
it should not be simple it should not be
just run it should be go to the control
panel go change some settings get a
warning and after that I will let you
run with a problem that's basically what
we're trying to achieve here so that we
do what's best for the community will it
system administrators do what's
necessary for their business and
knowledgeable people make informed
decisions it's it's a balance okay I
think we have time for one more question
and then we have to vacate the room the
question is regarding the permissions on
the manifest what was the feedback from
major software vendors now some of the
feedback we cannot really share all of
the feedback that we get from remember
when I said it's a case-by-case basis
some people think oh this is exactly
what I needed and it solves exactly that
problem I can show you a couple of
blocks there's a couple of articles
about I believe the tireless if you
learn search it do not sign that jar and
it explains the concern that was
addressed by adding these permission
attributes so some of the persons that
row that may think oh good or bad in
some cases there is no way to come up
with a solution that will be just
perfect right for any of these changes
we have some customer saying you're
breaking a perfectly legitimate use case
and you're making it very complicated to
do and unfortunately that happens every
now and then as I said it's there is no
if there was a clear-cut answer we
wouldn't be talking about that one we
would have brushed that one aside as
okay done now let's talk about the one
that doesn't have a clear-cut answer
working
I'm not sure if I'm sure we've got that
message so hopefully the dialog box
would have problem
putting a big yellow box right so the
point is the point is we we should do a
better job at communicating what the
changes are and the challenge for that
is it is extremely hard to get any one
of these messages across and even the
timing is very important if we say we're
going to do something two years from now
most people will ignore it right it's
like two years you will get you know
right your ID so that's what we're doing
it here in Java one in the blog in the
message in the jury itself yeah we're
trying to reach as many people as
possible and unfortunately I know we
will fail we will not reach everybody
that we want to but you know that won't
stop us from trying though okay and I
don't know i don't think there's anybody
trying to set up but we can just carry
on so the question is does this have an
effect on the client and desktop these
yeah nothing on the server these
warnings and these messages and the code
signing our when going through the
plugin so anything that's deployed via
wet start or as an applet it's affected
everything that is not it's not affect
so you do not need to sign on the server
side of the jars sure the question is
are you sure that that's the only use
that there's been done to your jars so
at some point I'm like if you're
designing a jar I would sign it i would
put this it doesn't hurt it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
