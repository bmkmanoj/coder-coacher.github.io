invented today we have three speakers
but unfortunately right now we have only
two speakers i hopes that they know the
restaurant will come we joined that the
people at the end of decisions no and
we're going to talk about you know there
are new ecosystems from the point of
entry and m2m ohio TS so i'm going to
speak about in and out what is we are
going to achieve from this you know the
new in the ecosystems and then you know
each speakers you know presenter that
are each positioning from viewpoint of
the new of these ecosystems ok let me
speak a little bit about you know the
architecture of then same system poor is
a you are familiar with out about what
is MCM systems so just briefly star no
explain that or what what kind of see
know the our system we are going to
focus on so as you know that in odm
systems are is composed of the device ID
and you can see the several see no
applications device this device is
depend on the applications if you are
you targeting daniel agriculture that's
in other devices are with your character
sensor device depend on application
there are a lot of the sensor or
heterogeneous device ID and the next
player is a networking so and to connect
those know on the device to go to the
dino sectors rusty nods apiece this is
the application domains so in the
application domain you can see that you
know serve several server applications
and also the service see neighbors so we
are going to discuss about what is the
service enables each node the speakers
positioning okay so what is the
challenge in name seems provides the
Europa media with some of the other
challenge but you know let me summarize
what is a challenge in the insane
systems as you know that you know there
are mzm systems is we needed
this a huge amount of the time and
resource and the monies to build at the
new MCM systems and also the notaries
are the insurer investment but also that
we have to spend at you know they are
and the maintenance and operations in on
the effort which also incurs that in
honors in those are the monies so
reduced that in operation costs about
patient expense is another charity and
also that you know under the coping with
this current DC know the connect
situations we have think about you know
the first type fast to time market so
that we cannot spend at the one year we
can spend more than you know the six
months to build a new mzm applications
so fast to market is the key and also
that you know that there are several in
opportunity in the MSA mirrors and so
the there are existing in the same areas
you know that's the bending machine or
the security cameras process and
cooperation we expended more about in
the you know use case but there's
another you know our potentials huge
potentials market in name same systems
to go into the day this new market you
know we have to think about in how to
reduce or how to how to deduce that you
know the monies to to start a new
services in the new market and also the
our entire solutions since that the you
know that as you see that in order in
the first right there are several single
component 202 to make the to build
latino dem same system that from the
device ID to the you know server side
and also the application site so engine
solution is a key so but we have to use
your is a tradition we have to spend a
lot of time to you know do that at the
interpret testings that you know the
intense the solution is a key to know
push down the cause or deployment in
same systems and that's challenging that
you know we have to invite more
application developers you know under
you know from people and application the
papers there are several you know there
are barriers that build at MGM systems
from the server side networking side and
the embedded system side
so the from Buford application bent
there's no application of developers we
have to show that a no simplified view
so we have to hide the details okay so
as you know that they know them same
systems are traditionally built in the
buttock away so under dependent
applications you know from the device to
the applications no even the middle
years or networking's there you know
that specialized in a component so
everything is in the vertical where
everything Indians in the particles
idols but now snow are you know the
there are several effort to provide that
in the horizontal solutions especially
in the middle air side so the MGM
application aebrian platform this you
know the high detail the connectivity
details the hide hide details the device
site and also the connectivities in the
usual is the connectivity is a
responsibility of the mobile network
carriers or mobile network operators but
in other are the new ecosystems this you
know provided in the more you know
simplify the connectivities so this high
the detail of the connectivities from
butte of the applications or from you
point of the buy side but you know the
application or device this should be in
application dependent or applications or
no sabes independent so having this note
the horizontal soldiers we can now solve
the server as a charity which I
explained before so the you know they're
having the horizontal solutions this
reduced complexes so the API simplifies
API standard API protocols this innocent
provides that severals in the investment
of the issue investment and also that
you know the operation cost is also
reduced by by providing business
simplified you know single raised in the
middle rebels and the networking rebels
so by having this you know that you know
horizontal layers
the operation costs or maintenance costs
can be deduced signifying significant
reason and you know our time to market
so on the so the traditionals in the MGM
systems everything's our need to be you
know invent not the you know inventing
on the arm from the scratch but you know
the since no of the by providing that
they not the horizontal solutions we can
be use the not zebras the common
functionality so you don't need to know
developed from the scratch every since
so this cenote are simplified cynodon
the application development times and
the airport then we can achieve that in
no time to market and also that you know
that go into the new market so you know
and this you know the the deployment
costs a deployment effort can be deduced
so you don't need too worried about in
the or the new market it's easy to go
into the new market and you know the
entente know all the interpret tastings
so since that the standard the interface
and the standard protocols can under did
use that the interview testing costs or
you do not need worry about any
interpretivist sosebee spiders can just
you know developed applications and a
deep so intensive testing has already
see not dance and recipes so the
application the from people with
application developers so the horizontal
solutions or don't tell me tears hide
the details on networking conductive
hide the details of the device ID so
application developer just think about
you know the body you added
functionality such as a data analysis or
you know the visualizations so all sides
are the body of the component to the end
users so now so now are going to the
ecosystems so the traditional ecosystems
we have the three no Archer is there for
players you know that device vendors and
application providers and network
operators and in you know customers so
applications dependent applications you
know on the device suppliers application
providers develop that we know there are
the MGM systems in antibiotic away so in
this in this context you know the device
lab prior and application provider close
create a cross group so that's its YZ
know that everything is particles but
having the new you know ecosystems so
you know those you know that are
dedicated you know device and the
applications in the players of course
they need that in those in the players
but you know the we having that any
intermediate functions who provide the
horizontal solutions the the weekends
add more in the device in a uniform way
we can also you know utilize a different
network in a you know in in an efficient
way and from lipid applications you know
that you don't need to know develop the
specialized application depend on the
dyno depend of the mcmc are the systems
so the MSM gateways DC know provide the
uniforms interface to the device in
vendors so the best vendors do not be
worried about in connectivity to the
networks so the gateways hi Daniel
detail of the connectivities and they
are mmm via nor dis provided no
efficient MCM services so huger is amia
north provided in order generic we know
the in networking services but MCM MVNOs
provided the very no efficient you know
the mechanisms to force I know MCM
service providers and also the Cree
providing of the unique you know the
price France known to favor eyes
favorite to the MGM self supporters and
application platform providers this also
provided the you know the single API to
the application developers
and our new ms ember our body other
service providers this you know provider
you know genetic way to know ionizer
theaters or visualize editors so those
who you know are the new prayers
provided a horizontal resolution from
people with the mcmc okay so now my
tongue so the MC of the invented so
invented is is providing the MGM
application in turbulent pratt homes so
as I said you know the application in
emulator protons are sit on top of the
mmm mvno and then provide the API to the
application providers and also provide
the API to the value of the sub spriters
so we provide that you know the
disparate homes named as a service sink
okay so I Riveter I'm Punta but explain
about what who we are so the companies
are invented the location is
headquarters or SATA and we have
surround the center in Tokyo Japan's and
we also have a center in the Beijing's
there so our main focuses MGM and the
IOT application development platforms so
this is the mid where this composed of
the sub amid where and the occurrence of
their videos embedded the device so the
beauty of this you know the servicing is
independent of the device architectures
or independent of the sub is logic 0
based upon this service need no sabe
sync with develop the md ms provides a
are you familiar with MDM but I'm skip
about this MDM because this is not a
main topic of casino sessions so now I'm
going to explain to know what it is
servicing what is the application
developed enablement platforms ok let me
rephrase you know the tradition is mmm
system or IOT systems are in the beauty
in a particle ways every single particle
Cyrus or you know the market is so
fragmented but you know by looking
to the Savior's in the MGM systems we
find that the severest you know the
cumin functionalities among that thing
of those in the different MGM systems so
we accumulated those functionality into
one mid years so not only does have a
midway but also the grant me two years
so we are composed of those you know
common functionality into one package
then you know we also expose API so that
application developers can debute the
app you know the device independent or
service in the service independent and
the device dependent applications such
as analyzing laterz or you know
visualizing editors so the application
developers can focus just focus on that
you know there are those applications
energy monitoring or health care or
smart metering and the device side also
saves you know that we also expose API
our client is independent of the device
so we do not touch anything the machines
you know there are hardware's so a prick
the manufactures or OEM can build the
application by themselves using as our
api's okay so this is a you know another
view of the no service sink so green
path is our you know at a media
component so in the server side you know
we provide the servicing servers and the
device side will provide a client if the
MSM device in such as a sensor or
machines has a direct connection with
the inode and the external networks such
as 3g network a380 or external internet
so they just connected them to the
device to the inulin to the new central
servers but if that you know device does
not have any you know external
connections if they only have they know
that local connections such as you know
the bluetooth Wi-Fi Aussie be in such a
case you are provided in same gated
which interconnects such a rocker
interface to the external interrupt
is so every single that we exclude a p.i
and also they know the undivided this is
our unique we know they are component so
this you know they are under in a batch
arising broker interface even if you use
the Wi-Fi even if use and you know it's
Brutus so you know probably put the
applications you don't need worry about
any Zeno are no current topics so
framework that the knowing the hide
details such a local connections so that
you know that you can develop the new
application in the device side and also
you can develop the application on the
south side and sometimes you want to
service providers want to interconnect
the existing the external system such as
a CRM though ERP or they want to know
combined as a no ser parte de datos from
the in a crowd such as you know map
daters or wizard daters so in that case
we provide the plug-in component which
is you know under connect to those the
web service API in the server side so so
now we provide the just in the software
but in the Sun cooperation sadly no the
presenters speakers provided the
hardware component which already is
embedded hours the currents of tears and
the gateways of tears okay so what is
good in servicing sub sink is a based on
the cloud service so that's from people
service providers you don't they do not
worry about you know the hosting the
service or they not worry about any
scalability we you know carbon we handle
the such a scalability or in Chelsea
basement and also the dissident
reinterpret homes they say the composer
of the server and the crank component so
interpreted testings we we cover that
they seem to be retesting so sub
spreaded do not worry about you know the
interplay testings and the web service
API so there are the application
developers web service application
developers can easily develop the
applications they do not need to worry
about any embedded software of course I
not the big
jabbers you know that every single you
know on the java applications so
sabotage over and the device ID jabbers
you know interconnected by using our sin
allow me two years and are the the
application developer can use API to the
ability you know on the application but
if they do they are they prefers not
using the API so in that case we provide
the mashup builders so in that case you
know they don't need any programming so
they just combine that the existing
widget then then the notes that are
created their UI and we have the
Savior's intelligence in the deer time
intelligence you know on the complex
event processing or Cerberus you know
there are the engines in a in edgy side
as wary the server side so the dots is
important because that no we should not
send any and all the event data's coming
from the sensors or machine to the
server side this course that we know the
networking disgusted or the overall of
the server side so intelligence should
be should decide in on the edge sided go
and also the the sub spider can create
there in a customized script so they can
customize our middles is Ruiz and as I
said you know by the Sabbath know or the
protein component if they want to
interconnect with the degree the
existing encino the enterprise systems
and as I said you know the architecture
is a device independent or service
independent but actually epson systems
they have dis nodes MGM system need to
handle the heterogeneity there are a
bunch of the no different our sensor a
bunch of the different in the machines
to cope with this in a heterogeneous a
we provide that no on tours easy so and
we provide I know they are script
language so that you know service
provider or application developers can
specify that in all what kind of
tribute decide on the device ID or what
kind of capability decide on the device
ID so having the you know dis you know
or specifications we can create a new
database automatically then they know
sensor data storage that send send send
services storage automatically okay and
also we provide a new developers you
know the portals we opened that this in
the portal so that you know the
application developers can build the
application by themselves this is the
open platforms this provided in the
Savior's you note are under development
toolkit the then there are several
another source code different source
code this is open source and so this is
a URI URI pause inaudible bloodsport
arrows so please go into the divs to be
reporters you can download the
developers guidelines or sample source
code easier ease okay let me set up
that's me I'm de Beaufort now in
business development used to be
developer in engineering manager so I
somehow went to the dark side of sales
of its development I wear ties but I
want to talk briefly about what Oracle's
IOT platform is and how it enables what
our partners are able to do so we've
already heard from has an invented about
the infrastructure that they've created
the software i will talk a little bit
about what Oracle's bringing to the
table to make that happen and then we'll
hear from such corporations actually
making devices deploying both of our
software on his device for an epidemic
solution so quickly you know when when
we look at mtm from the Oracle
perspective we quickly recognize that
these are some of the issues that are
needed here and they're similar issues
to what has put up already tactile just
quickly move through these but the fact
that matter is is you need you need
developers that know your platform we
need a platform that scales you need a
platform that can help you capture
it's got to be secure you need to
support multiple devices so you need
something cross-platform you guys of all
people know where we're going here right
this is what Java delivers in spades the
big thing that were I know if this works
I guess not but the big thing that's
needed in the whole mtime Internet of
Things spaces that standards right
that's as doc mentioned earlier
everything's been very vertical it's
been very much drawing a line from a
sensor to the backend collecting data
what we're trying to do is make this
more of a standard platformer standard
offering so you can repeat rinse and
repeat over and over just as much as he
has with his platform and we also
believe that more intelligence from the
backend more business logic more
awareness should be pushed to the edge
that's a big thing at Oracle believes in
and Java is really our tool to make that
happen so this is the way we view our
Internet of Things platform we view it
as largely three chunks of functionality
and activity and I want to talk about
all three but the key here is that you
see this is a circle so for developers
that are getting into this empty em
Internet of Things space you know that
circle is your new model because it's a
cycle you're never ever done with
Internet of Things around time
activities because you collect data you
pull it back and analyze it figure
something out do something about it and
then go get some more and repeat you can
eventually decide that you've set it up
enough for this particular situation but
there's always more additional data you
can integrate or collect or analyze to
understand your operations and combined
operations because that's what Internet
of Things really brings at a table is
the ability to combine disparate sources
of data and disparate functionality
together to achieve some sort of new
service new capability that's more
predictive more beneficial to you and
your customers so quickly looking at the
first piece again acquiring and managing
you know the first step one is you've
got to get some data
from the real world right this is where
software meets physics all right because
we're out there collecting information
about something that's happening it's a
temperature it's a pressure it's a
distance at the location pulling that
back in and managing that data because
there's a lot to think about with this
data right because you're collecting
data is it valuable data is it important
data should it be combined with other
data how long should you keep the data
where are you going to keep it how are
you going to marshal this how are you
going to combine it with other data
sources so there's a whole new evolution
of data life cycle to consider here
beyond what typically is considered an
IT because there's all kinds of new
different data types and data sources so
the key is this is where job on the
platforms and gateways is critical
because Java does a couple things for
you number one it provides that
cross-platform skill buddy which is now
important once again if you're in
devices you're talking about arm PowerPC
mips x86 sh4 you're talking about a lot
of different platforms again whereas an
IT it's kind of either well maybe it's
either spark or or x86 typically and
it's typically Linux or maybe it's
hilarious if using our stuff but in the
embedded spaces makes a big difference
again it is really important because a
lot of these devices are in different
sizes there's real-time operating
systems there's Linux there's different
flavors of Linux so java's premiere
value of write once run anywhere is
suddenly back to the front of being
important again in this space the other
thing is of course that you can leverage
Java skills and even code right as you
saw from our roadmap the mes ee8
products are becoming much more about
actually letting code run from one area
into the other is you guys if you know
much about em en SE today they're kind
of it's all java but it's a little bit
of two different worlds there because
they have different requirements we're
removing those differences and to where
it's really just a continuum and you can
actually start migrating code it's
really important for testing purposes
it's really important to make sure
you have consistent approaches to your
solutions so once you've got your hands
on the data if you kind of figure what
you do with it you've got to integrate
with your business data right you've got
to do something you're trying to do
something here with regard to your
business or regard to your customer so
you've got to somehow understand what
that is and bring it back and say okay
what is my business decision based on
this data what am I going to go from
here so you got to bring this back and
of course security is a whole new
dimension in this space right we worry
about security at the Internet we worry
about security with respect to our
enterprise systems accessing and part
you know data or protecting
confidentiality but when you're talking
about worrying about if someone's going
to hack your car while you're driving on
a highway and turn off the engine that's
a serious problem or if somebody's going
to turn off the power of your house as a
prank right that's a serious problem so
security takes on a whole new dimension
and it's something we're going to be
working on for quite a while to really
nail that down but once you get it you
know this is where we part bringing to
bear all of our existing products in the
back end right so I mean fundamentally
wise Oracle here why do we interest in
the Internet of Things because it
produces data we are if nothing else a
data company we know how to store it
transact it analyze it you know moving
around I mean that's what we do and we
have all of these different applications
that we will integrate into our own end
of things platforms so finally you got
the data in you're comparing against
business logic doing more analysis and
now the key with them dem is do
something about it right you don't just
bring it i mean you can just bring it in
you can run Hadoop you can look at stuff
make nice charts but really the point
from time and Internet of Things it's do
something you got data you're compared
it against what you think you should do
make it make something happen go out and
change the world right change something
in them in the world and here of course
you know like I said it's a cycle it's
never really over but at some point you
just can say uncle but you just continue
to review and revise this information
and again we have lots of analytics and
X oolitic sand lots of different
products and in fact one of the most
interesting things we're doing is with
this or Clemente processor it's anyone
here use the Oracle event processor you
know what it is anybody know what that
is or just real quick Oracle event
processor is a back-end system runs on
the server side it's a stream based
system what it does has a language
called cql so it's kind of like SQL
right but CQ all because you're looking
at data moving past and you're
interested in the aspect of time your
incident data that's moving so as data
is coming flying by you set query
conditions you say well if I see this
this and that other things going on and
if all happens within 10 seconds or 10
minutes then do this so you actually
have this language to describe what to
do about things that go by these events
what we're doing following our model is
we're taking that product that runs in
our big iron at the back end and a
server and we're pushing that down to
the gateway runs on java SE and a small
arm whatever you know that's running a
gigahertz processor you can run the
exact same sequel query cql query on the
back end as a front end within reason
right you can't allocate 10 gigs of
memory for something but we're pushing
that functionality we're pushing that
middleware down to the edge to make
local decisions and also to help decide
what data is valuable and what data is
meaningful all right these are the
important aspects you have with d2d so
it's for us it's a complete platform
right all the Oracle products you know
you know we've created this data center
platform been doing that for years
continue to improve that we heard some
announcements this week and on what
we're really doing is extending that
platform to the edge with Java with Java
making better and more intelligent
gateways which I've embedded suite with
database and app server functionality
the event processing I just talked about
and of course Java all the way in a
device whether it's mesc or even card on
the device side leveraging those skills
leveraging those capabilities
so why does this matter to you in the
audience it depends on your role I mean
if your systems integrator working for
one of those guys the great thing is
that every single em tomorrow
application is different they're all
unique but it turns out that they're all
like eighty percent the same collecting
data from a sensor you're cutting it to
a gateway you're pumping into the
infrastructure doing all the things I
talked about so there's a tremendous
amount of leverage to go from one
scenario to the next if you're making
devices again bringing Java to the table
as our partners have enables more
intelligence on the edge in the device
allows you to make local decisions
allows you to decide and react more
quickly every solution provider you can
leverage that code again back-end code
back in functionality back-end skills to
the edge and that's where all of you
sitting in a room this is your chance to
play right this is your chance to
actually work on a device because it is
Java especially now with our new SC
products and our se8 you heard about
this earlier this week I assume se8
getting down to like 10 megabytes with
se9 probably smaller I mean that runs on
a pretty small device and it's you know
that's your code on your laptop that you
can push down and start and of course
Raspberry Pi you're seeing that
competition so the point is with Java
and with Oracle's platform we're opening
the doors to everybody who is it just an
existing traditional java developer to
come in and play and this is exactly
what we all want to do so you know the
point is internet things is here it's
here right now it's happening so it's a
good time to start figuring this out and
get involved we're working with partners
like invent it and son corporation to
make this easier to do you heard a lot
about the platform from invented how it
takes a lot of the trouble out a lot of
the issues that worrying about device
specific information it's abstracted
away and the point is for you is to say
okay well what can I do what could I
learn about my business or about my
customers in the physical real world
what could i do if i had a little bit
more data a lot of these things are
cheap a little temperature sensor
fifteen cents you know this is not
expensive to put a lot of those around a
building
or a strain gauge or whatever right this
these things are easy to put together
the trick is what do you do with all the
data how do you create the solution
that's still more complex but you can
get in and start engaging in this and
trying to figure out where you can bring
value to your customers into your
business so with that I'm going to turn
over to our next partner
hello I'm a key vital the thinny
operating officer of some cooperation I
have a responsible at its continuity of
I Keith addition business in tank
operation ok next one
today I would like to explain about the
Gateway portion at the initiative and
then David already mentioned about its
ecosystem for IOT and m2m some
cooperation produced a gateway we in
this presentation I would like to three
themes first 1a to Gateway itself the
key function to keep connecting the
mobile network a second one is our use
case and third one is I would like to
explain about a part of a part of
ecosystem for m2m first of all I would
like to explain our company profile

the data so for the police is a very
easy
a convenient product for thinner next
one is m2m louder and a gateway and
adapter is the maintained main thing to
date presentation the amusement if you
know the the pachinko is a very popular
abusement in Japan a gamble amusement
that we provide the circuit board and
software for the pachinko machine maker
ok our our IT solution Department we
provide the this kind of product lineup
3g modem routers and the linux gateway
all products mainly focusing to the 3g
mobile network of course 4g of course we
provide the Wi-Fi and networking but
today I want to focus to about the 3g
mobile networks in 3g mobile wireless
m2m environment a various happenings
often occurred in this environment by RF
condition the network operator cut the
line and power supply or temperature
along temperature have make some trouble
for the equipment and in such cases
cheap you often freeze so we have a long
time expiry long time experience we
develop the automatic stable connection
function automatic stable connection a
stable connection is the set of
a various function which keeps the
mobile mobile mobile device in
connecting networks stay buried by
autonomy asian software at the unmanned
environment yeah our equipment has a
hard way and a very strong hardware and
software watchdog type watchdog timer
function this function keep the keep the
line a connecting line and also even
though the operator line cut a cut line
the agent software keep the connection
and also in 3g modular power supply
sometimes have the trouble in such case
agent software agent software turned off
and turn on by itself this kind of
autonomic function is a CT iasc
automatic stable connection code of
dysfunction we have a very big we have
very successful business in Japan 20 I
love you we have a number one market
share a recorded in Japanese a mobile
mobile mobile app adapter and louder
market almost 65 percentage share we
have I would like to explain about the
use case first of all the our main user
use case is a social infrastructure you
know the lane for monitoring our weather
observation or the lives people
monitoring and the traffic condition
monitoring and the three sovereigns or
the
a water filter filter will fill
filtration filtration plant and a bit
cool parking or such kind of monitoring
market a second large market is energy
recently the solar station is a very
very up are becoming very very popular
so I will provide the Gateway and louder
equipment for the monitoring and the
controlling such a solar panel and
there's their control unit and also we
provide our equipment equipment for hems
and lemons market home energy management
systems and the building energy
management system mems and in Japan
drink vending machine is a very very
popular not only drink vending machine
but also cigarette or something totally
in Japan there are five million bending
machine especially drink vending machine
had 2.5 million inspiration base in but

this data up to the cloud system and
enjoy enjoy the customer customer enjoy
the very easy to buy the smartphone
access to crowd data yeah this is a kind
of physical social networking system in
Japan we have a hard shell of these are
mostly over up share in this market
ok
we'd like to present about the function
not on real gateway itself but also the
other part of IOT and m2m service
ecosystems this is our equipment do stir
blues the GX and rooster RX especially
rooftop GX is a gateway very small and
very big and good cost performance
equipment rooster GX is a gateway but
this gateway has a function of the
router and modem not only louder but
also have a micro server microcomputer
ggp this product the cpu is the arm base
and have a subsea p sub cpu watch the
cpu and the power supply so substitute
provide a function of ASC automatic
stable connection and rooster GX is
dedicated for the m2m market so we have
a very wide range temperature minus 20
to 60 degree serous e degli CC and
humidity wide range and the linux based
platform and also we have a java
embedded client oj ec
usually this kind of microserver and
embedded equipment for server-side user
shabbos i developed software software
developer it is not good at developed
this kind of software software on this
equipment because they usually they have
to write AC program and very low level
control for the sensors but we provide
java Oh je T environment on this proton
Java oj ec oj ec products in bundled so
user is very easy to write down the
software on the server the end client
this kind of this problem and it kind of
product is very rare in this m2m
equipment and also we provide not only
Java environment but also pre install
the service think client nishat on
explain about the servicing at the
ecosystem application mm mm application
Pratt whole rooster GX already installed
the client and agent software of
servicing indeed so the customer is a
very very user is very very easy to make
m2m crowd and cry cry and systems
customer the Pratt home communicate to
the gateways agent software very easy to
get the data from the sensor to end to
send the data to
the application crowd software through a
3g networks very easy to make
application by a tablet or a smartphone
or something like that so this this kind
of gateway is not only gateway
microserver but also the other kind of
the equipment other other part of at the
part of this interim ecosystem our
product ads our products we say a fun
think something is om product of
servicing something has a to menu
service menu for device itself and for
user application device device itself we
provide the family updating firmware
updating function and management
function and various a lot a
notification and the status indication
of course a configuration remote
configuration and for user applications
user user can remotely updates their
application in the client and distribute
and the reed and remote configuration
and remote application control these
service already provided if the customer
by owl rooster GX product we have a
prong that that rooster we have this
function of something on board rooster
GX is a gateway Luther Rx is a louder
but the detail outer has a function of
something so not only louder this
equipment as a ecosystem or m2m proton
the elusive realize you m2m assistant
stably and intelligent at a part of new
ecosystem of IOT and m2m thank you very
much finally I would like to summarize
we provide a ecosystem m2m Pratt home
and Java environment and the Gateway
pre-installed is a client of m2m
ecosystem temper at home these ecosystem
is a very helpful for the MGM software
developer and the software operator the
m2m operator thank you very much yeah we
are only 34 you join that is ecosystems
so please join the disabled system you
feel agreed upon this so we still have
about five minutes if you have any
questions please raise your hand and
speak up come on clear yes this is
certified in Europe not yellow the grain
in union with the in Europe in Europe
we are sorry not yet but we have a plan
to 30 get the certification in US and
the European market of both US and
Europe they're working yeah sort of can
right now for that now we have we just
providing in Japan market but sorry I
will get that certification and robbery
maybe maybe this is a 500 to 700 US
dollars they say there may be a
three-under to yourself
just is a very brand-new machine just
already delivery in this April and this
one is next next month so but we have
already have installation with twenty
two hundred thousand in Japan previous
previous previous gateway and previous
routers this is a very intelligent one
yes so the some cooperation in the
fundamental in the router functions and
adapters in our building the 3g
functionality so did product is a data
wrong long histories they have already
installed several device ready that is
they are the new functional specialist
in the mcmc non-market he said you know
the under this product has already
building that the grand function which
link to the other crowd automatically so
are all data is in a connected raiment
coming from the device to this you know
III is automatically sent to dr. Saba
know the servers no storage or database
so if you want to know the pick up the
data on the storage on the server side
or database and storage you just cause a
p.i.c that the API is provided by is
embedded so that okay explanation
I like what are the television we have
the intelligence on balls in the edge
side and the society so in the
intelligence and edgy side as you know
David mentioned there are several see
note are in the Nauru the blue base you
know the handling functions so you don't
need to write in a code you just you
know the set that specific rules if
something happens do actions so that
that divine intelligence in the surface
in the edge side so you can filters you
know the event so you don't need to go
you do not you send all the others on
the server side and interior on the
server side and you can know under
create the URL bar close so by that we
provided the you know JavaScript engine
so ya and you can create another froze
you know if we want to send out an OD
mode command to the device you just
specify the DC node in the command
within that the your script that divine
intelligence another intelligence is
also the node under us no complex event
processing on the south side that is a
you know the German or a constant
product so this also know that you can
put in that the UK right in the rules so
then you don't need to write any code so
they're a bunch of the new event coming
from the different the device in the
developed cards and at different ways so
then the you can see and handle that we
know such an event but without using
without writing the code ok
on the way the country is in the in this
product is Emily but you know one
setting of the Oracles you know there
are read is that they see a so that's a
c8 will be in the beauty in the design
right ok ok times up thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
