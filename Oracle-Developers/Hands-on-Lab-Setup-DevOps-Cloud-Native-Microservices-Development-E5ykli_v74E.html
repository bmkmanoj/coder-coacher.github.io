trial account student guide contained
within the DevOps cloud native micro
services workshop
I'll begin by going to the online guide
and github from the read me page or from
the drop down menu at the top of the
page you'll be able to navigate to the
student guide within the student guide
you'll see all the necessary steps to
acquire trial account and then finally
install the required open source tools
on your laptop first you want to follow
the steps necessary to acquire a trial
account by going to cloud.oracle.com
slash try it from there you'll be able
to register for an account once you
receive an account Oracle will send you
an email containing all the necessary
information to set the passwords for
your accounts the student guide will
step you through recording all the
information necessary about your
accounts the student guide instructs you
to copy of the needed fields into it an
account info document and then you
record this information as you step
through the student guide most of the
needed information in is in the welcome
email and I've already transferred some
of that information from the email to my
account info document the welcome email
also provides links to help you get your
password set the first account is set up
contains most of the services you'll use
during the workshop the second account
is referred to as a traditional cloud
services account and this account will
contain the developer cloud service that
is also used in the workshop let's first
click on the link to access the Oracle
cloud account this link has
pre-populated my account name and I'm
required to enter my user name which
generally is my email address and then I
enter a temp my temporary password now
I'll enter in my old and new passwords
and then click on submit I'm now taken
to the cloud services dashboard now
let's customize our dashboard I'm going
to add some services to the dashboard
that I'll use as part of the setup let's
add my sequel the application container
cloud service and then finally the
identity cloud service these services
are
are also accessible from the hamburger
menu found at the top of the screen I'm
going to use the hamburger menu to load
the classic compute console so that I
can capture the identity tenant ID this
idea is needed when the developer cloud
service connects to the application
cloud service I'll copy the ID from the
top of the dashboard and then paste it
into my account info document for later
use I'll now return back to the main
dashboard next I want to collect some
information from the application
container cloud service
I'll right-click on the link and open
this console in a new tab window from
here I'm able to grab the data region in
which my instances of application
container cloud service will run this
information is also required when
connecting from developer cloud service
to the application container cloud
service I'll store this information in
my account info document now we need to
set the storage services replication
policy some services like my sequel and
the application container cloud service
require the replication policy in the
storage service to be set a loda storage
services dashboard by using the
hamburger menu if the replication policy
has not been set a dialog will be
displayed I'll take the default
recommendation on the Geo replication
policy and click on the set policy now
let's set the password for the
traditional cloud account in which the
current developer cloud service resides
I'll click on the second URL provided in
the welcome email this e-mail link knows
my domain name but it asked me for my
username and temporary password
note that the temporary password was the
same for both accounts I'm able to set
my new password which I'm going to keep
the same as the password I use for the
identity cloud service account I
previously configured although I also
answer a few other questions and then
submit
I will now record the new password in my
account info document for later use we
are now able to switch between the
traditional and non-traditional accounts
from the dashboard
since understanding the differences in
the accounts is important to the
upcoming labs I'll completely close the
browser window clearing the session
cookies and then I'll read login to both
accounts after restarting the browser
window I'll go to cloud.oracle.com and
I'll click on sign-in I'll leave the
cloud account type set to cloud account
with identity cloud service then I'll
enter the cloud account name I stored in
the account info document and I'll click
on my services I'll enter the username
and password both of which I stored in
the account info document now we'll see
most of our cloud services let's now
open a new tab in all and I'll again go
to cloud.oracle.com this time I'll
select a traditional cloud account type
then I'll select the data center we got
the data center information by going to
the application container cloud service
console based on our example I'll select
us commercial to which which is what I
captured or since the data centers in
the US I can also just select public
cloud services u.s. based on the region
in which your environment was
provisioned you may be required to use
amia or APEC data centers I'm now asked
to enter my identity domain name this
was also in the Welcome letter after
entering the information I'll click on
go next I'll enter in my username and
password we now have a duplicate of the
dashboard loaded but this time it's
associated with the traditional account
I'll go between the two dashboard tabs
and show you the difference in the
dashboard services here are the identity
cloud account back services
and here are the traditional account
services the only reason we're using the
traditional account is the time
recreated this workshop the developer
cloud service was not yet backed by the
identity cloud service but that will
change although I have a tab for each
dashboard which may work best for this
workshop you can actually just change
between the accounts from within a
single dashboard we're now partway
through the student guide I'm now ready
to install the open source tools on my
laptop we've documented book this both
on Windows and for the Mac I'll cover
how it's done on Windows first I'll load
a command window then I'll check on my
version of Java to ensure the version is
greater than 1.8 if it's not I'll need
to follow the instructions in the
student guide to install the Java
development kit version 1.8 next I'll
show how to install a version of Eclipse
that contains the Oracle Enterprise Pack
if you already have Eclipse installed
you can also install this version of
Eclipse that contains the enterprise
pack or you can search online for
instructions on how to add the Oracle
Enterprise pack to an existing version
of Eclipse for this workshop it may be
best to just install this version with
everything you'll need included go to
the Oracle Enterprise Pack link
contained in the student guide after
accepting the license agreement select
the neon version of Eclipse after
Eclipse is downloaded I'll unzip the
installation
I found on my version of Windows if I
renamed the zip file to a shorter name
before unzipping I didn't run into
windows filename length errors once
unzipped I will find and run the Eclipse
executable eclipse wants a workspace
directory and I took the default once
loaded I can select which windows I want
to make visible and configure where the
windows would be displayed
you
we've also provided optional
documentation on how to configure
eclipse and maven when you're behind a
firewall I'll now show how to install
and configure git and brackets following
the link in the online guide I went to
the git download page I'll select my
operating system and save the file after
the file is downloaded I'll locate and
run the installation file I've already
downloaded and installed git and I took
all the defaults during the installation
let's now install brackets I'll first go
to the URL included in a student guide
I'll select the option to download and
I'll save the file I'll locate and run
the installation file I took all the
defaults when installing brackets now
from a location of my choice I'll create
a directory named product catalog UI
from the windows explorer I'll navigate
to that directory right click on it and
select open as a brackets project once
brackets is running I'll select file
extension manager in the extension
manager I'll search for the txt
integration of git and click install on
the brackets on brackets forget after
installation I'll take the defaults and
click on save then I'll click OK to
restart brackets I should now see the
git icon in the right-hand brackets
panel I'm now ready to move on to lab
