to JavaScript nirvana in NetBeans so for
the next hour we're gonna be looking at
the latest features and capabilities of
the NetBeans IDE with regards to
JavaScript so a little about me first I
initially got involved doing training
etc with NetBeans several years ago when
I wrote the NetBeans certification guide
which I believe targeted NetBeans 6.5 so
it's been a long time but that's that's
where I first started to get into
NetBeans so with that so that's
presentation today so how many people
know people that are still coding
JavaScript using like notepad or vim
okay so hope hopefully nobody knows
things have come a long way the last
couple of years with JavaScript IDs and
that means in particular oh so this is a
list of some of the top Java JavaScript
ites out there right now webstorm is
probably the favorite followed along but
along with Visual Studio and sublime and
some people are using Eclipse and komodo
for doing that but NetBeans is really
the dark horse of the JavaScript ID ease
not many most people still associate
JavaScript I don't most most people
still associate in NetBeans with Java EE
and Java development and not necessarily
with JavaScript which is too bad because
NetBeans has come a long way the last
couple of years and adding JavaScript
support in fact I think it is one of the
the best IDE s out there
and unlike webstorm it is free and the
reasons why I think it is one of the
best JavaScript IDs is first of all it's
intuitive I've taught many classes
internal many classes I work on
JavaScript where I've had the class use
NetBeans and it's easy you can get
somebody up and running coding
JavaScript code in about 5 minutes or
less with NetBeans it is fully
integrated and it's a completely
integrated toolset it's got built-in
version control it's got a debugger
that's built in it works it integrates
with the
a Chrome web browser for doing your
development so it ties it it ties
everything together so it's it's not
like some of the other tools which are
not fully integrated on top of that it's
also integrated with mobile development
so as we'll see it's possible to write
develop mobile applications mobile html5
applications with with NetBeans and
actually deploy them to the phone
it is adaptable so it does not try to
have a it does not necessarily have a
stranglehold on your workflow so you can
take an existing html5 project bring it
into NetBeans and that beans will work
with the project structure that you
already have it doesn't necessarily have
a set project structure that it expects
then on top of that it's a full stack so
you can do everything from mobile
development html5 mobile development to
webpage development with it as well as
backends nodejs development and the butt
end you can debug all of those and it
has projects project types set up
out-of-the-box to help you get up and
running with that and then finally is
powerful in terms of the feats of the
integrated features that have happened
in terms of the features being
integrated so that the editor the
JavaScript source code editor it has
full contact support so you can hit
period it'll pop up the list of
potential matches for a method will warn
you about common JavaScript errors that
you may have so all the things that
you've come to expect out of your Java
IDE were warned you about coding
potential coding problems
NetBeans will do that does that as well
with JavaScript ok the feature set for
NetBeans it natively supports html5
projects out of the box there are no
separate plugins that you have to
download in order to use it so you can
go to the NetBeans website right now
download it and you can be off and
running you don't have to just no
there's nothing to there's nothing no
separate plugins that you have to
configure with NetBeans although we'll
see you have to slip your JavaScript
environment a little bit it's got full
support for css3 html5 the 8.2 release
which is now release candidate
supports ekam script six so that's the
next major revision of JavaScript which
includes actual support for classes and
some of the things that we've gotten
used to in Java wind so that it so it's
got full script well so full support
recommend script six it supports
JavaScript libraries so you can put it
knows how to pull in jQuery it knows how
to pull in angular knows how to work
with the angular and the angular
attributes etc as I mentioned it has
full syntax hiding auto-completion cold
folding full-fledged a bugger you can
actually you can debug it both within
the NetBeans embedded debugger within
the IDE and that beans has a plugin that
allows you to connect to chrome and
remotely debug chrome from NetBeans it
has all of the features you've come to
expect from a debugger it's super has
built in JavaScript unit testing support
support for grunt as well as gulp to ant
analogues in the JavaScript world
support sass and less and then finally
Apache Cordova which is a gigantic
feature in and of itself so it allows
you to develop easily develop mobile
applications so although I mentioned
that there are no plugins to install in
order to get up and running with
NetBeans you do have to setup your
JavaScript environment a little bit so -
before you start cranking away projects
inside of NetBeans especially if we're
going to be using Cordova or nodejs
you have to install nodejs nodejs is two
things with NetBeans one it's it's the
runtime for doing backend server side
JavaScript development but it also
includes the NPM package manager
basically the equivalent of maven and
NetBeans uses that to be able to
download and pull in like JavaScript
libraries for you
installing sass requires that you
install Ruby and then install then run
an installer to install sass on top of
that and then the NetBeans chrome
plug-in you go to the the chrome store
search for NetBeans comes up with a
plugin that you can then download
on the next page this is a screenshot of
it so just you add that to your you go
to the chrome story add it to your
browser and then from then on as long as
Chrome is running on the machine nap and
yet NetBeans is able to communicate into
bug your JavaScript applications for you
there's no additional configuration that
you have to do in chrome in order to use
this after you install the plugin tool
configuration depending upon which set
of tools you're going to use you'll go
through the options pane and just tell
NetBeans where you installed nodejs
where you installed Bowers the CSS
preprocessors grunt and gulp etc there's
a lot of variability in terms of how
people set up their machines for that so
that's why that this is a separate step
but once you go through and set up all
of this stuff you're up and running
creating you're up and running it can
easily create JavaScript projects now if
you're coming from another IDE there is
the you do have the ability to set key
bindings so if you are still locked into
Emacs or vim key bindings you can pick
those or if you're coming from the
Eclipse world that that's or a profile
that you can pick so that allows you to
easily move over and try out and that
beans without driving yourself crazy
trying to trying to get the trying to
learn the key bindings which is often an
impediment to to newer developers and
then a nice little feature of NetBeans
is that the the settings that you
configure in this panel you can actually
export and then import so you can share
it with your co-workers or establish
basically a standard for how to set up
the IDE for all the development stuff ok
so project types so the first thing if
you're not if you're if you're new to
NetBeans NetBeans is a little bit
different from both Eclipse and IntelliJ
in that you can have multiple projects
open at the same time in the window it's
kind of analogous to that it's not
really now August to that workspace that
you have in Eclipse so the projects tab
on the left you have the list of
projects that can be anywhere in your
hard drive that you can open up you can
open and close them at will so that's
that's the first thing with NetBeans is
that allows you to have multiple
jumpin and you'll have the files open so
this it supports several different
project types so it's got html5
JavaScript applications so that's if
you're basically developing a website
and you're just developing static
content that you're gonna host on the
server so you'd pick that one no js' is
if you're starting from a blank slate
creating a node.js application you'd
select the second one the third one is
node is in html5 a JavaScript
application with no GS and what that
does is that uses the Express template
to set up an example to set up to pre
populate it with the express framework
with Jade pre-configured for you so that
you can then basically do if you're if
you're hosting static if you're writing
a hybrid application which is both a
node.js application in an upfront an
html5 application you'd pick that one
the JavaScript libraries if you're
developing a standalone JavaScript
library that you're going to check into
version control or share with coworkers
or publish somewhere Oracle jet is a
JavaScript framework I believe there's
other sessions at Java one on this one
so it's I won't spend too much time on
it which it wraps up several different
JavaScript frameworks into a
distribution html5 Jaso application with
existing sources so the next two allow
you to basically pull in an existing
project where you tell NetBeans where
are where are the source code files
where are your JavaScript files where
your artifacts where the configuration
files is basically a free-form project
where you go through the NetBeans takes
you through a wizard where you fill out
where everything is so compelling your
project and then the last two are
Cordova application Cordova application
with existing sources the Apache Cordova
of course being the html5 mobile
framework for deploying on iPhones and
androids so the key question is when you
are when you sit down to use NetBeans
for the first time with JavaScript
what JavaScript technology stack are you
going to be using and then the second
one is are you starting with existing
sources for your project if you're you
looking to learn to fiddle around with
the IDE and get up and running with
JavaScript the simplest one is html5
application up at the top that's a basic
bare-bones one so after you have
selected which which projects type you
want to create on the next question in
the wizard is going to be whether you
want to use a site template or not
so NetBeans provides you with a
pre-populated list to choose from
angularjs seed bootstrap mobile
boilerplate so there's several different
ones this is this is if you're not
familiar with the online templates and
these are basically starting points for
developing websites so they come with a
whole bunch of pre-installed JavaScript
frameworks html5 faut files
pre-populated because there's a lot of
infrastructure if you're developing
these type of applications that you have
to get up and going initially so if
you're not familiar with these this is
actually can go through and pick eat one
of different ones and try them out and
see what it actually generates but it's
a good starting point for learning about
these different frameworks because most
for developers right now if you're
developing a complex html5 application
you're probably not starting with a
blank window you're starting with some
initial content because there's a lot of
stuff that goes on there the next
question that asks after that is which
set of tool tools do you want to use
which determines which files that it
generates so package.json is basically a
pom equivalent for a node so if you
select that one little add it now if you
decide later you you forget to select
one of them or you select all of them
you can always go back and delete them
it does not it's not a just a
destructive change to your project if
you decide later that you want to use
grunt but you forgot to select it
initially just add a grunt file to the
project and you're off and running so
this is just basically getting you up
and just basically getting your initial
project setup so Bower is used manages
front-end components like HTML so the
package.json you'll use for more of this
the server-side nodejs stuff the bower
die JSON you lose use for pulling in
your jquery for developing your mobile
site for example and then grunt and gulp
our Java JavaScript task runner is
basically equivalent to ant and so
you'll pick one of those two depending
upon which one you settle on which which
one you actually prefer and then after
you click create' boom it creates the
project with with the initial set of
files so this one here is actually using
one of the templates I believe it's
using the the first first boilerplate
one so as you can see it generated a
bunch of bunch of put a bunch of code in
there for handling different browser
types pre-populated a bunch of libraries
included angular so it it makes life
much easier to get up and running if you
selected the nodejs
project type you'll end up with the
package JSON and a main dot JS file to
begin writing your server-side code and
if you select it in html5 with a node.js
application then it will actually go
through and run the Express framework
for you pre populate it with some
initial Jade files Jade being a markup
kind of like JSP server-side technology
for marking up the vials that will
pre-populate it includes include
libraries for you and then depending
upon so that's if you're starting from
scratch and creating a project or
creating a project from an existing set
of sources NetBeans also includes some
pre project existing project samples
that you can create and these are a
great way of learning some of the
technologies of learning some of these
new technologies such as angular or
angular 2 you can select one of the
example projects and it will actually
been give you a fully functional
JavaScript application that you can try
out try out the tool with an experiment
with so it's a great way to actually get
up and running so if you're you want to
see an exam example angularjs phone
application there's an example there for
you it's free to for you to try out and
there's also some Oracle jet ones so
those are handy
hindi learning tools and then after you
get after you get the project created
NetBeans / has temp file templates to
help you with your development and these
each one of these templates has an
Associated editor for it so it's not
just creating a file with an extension
that you then have to understand how to
edit its creating a file and it's going
to give you code completion on those
files so for the html5 so it'll give you
your HTML files JavaScript files
cascading stylesheets react.js files
Jade files it knows how to interpret it
knows how to provide code completion for
these munoz for selenium tests if you
select selenium Jasmine Tesla produce a
file for you to get up and running unit
tests etc and there's even one for
banging out JavaScript web services so
moving on to features as I mentioned the
IDE does provide syntax highlighting and
the color codes will give you some tour
a hint as to what is actually going on
with the code so as you can see the
keywords show up in blue as did expect
for most IDs
this comes in kind of important with
JavaScript because it's not always
obvious necessarily when you've
introduced a javascript error because
the language is not statically typed so
sometimes the absence of a color the ID
doesn't know whether you intended that
or whether that it's actually a coding
mistake
so the coloring will tell you whether it
whether it's this whether it will help
you identify bugs within your code it's
got full economists cryptic
support so as you can see here this is
an example of the new echo script six
JavaScript classes code so that so it
fully supports that over on the left
hand side you do get a navigator window
which allows you to look at the
structure of your code quickly find
methods as you come to expect in an IDE
it does have a pretty powerful job built
in JavaScript parser although not
necessarily it's not as
feature-rich essay the one from IntelliJ
but it's pretty close it will highlight
you know common errors that you have
it's configurable so you can tell what
you want to ignore in the case of the
sample that you're looking at right now
I've I didn't neglected to use the
triple equal with JavaScript so it's
flag that as an error message
so this this is nice that it goes
through and flags that it will put
little green a little yellow lines over
on the tray on the right and will
highlight the file as yellow meaning
that there are warnings with there there
are potential problems with a file so
sometimes it's handy just to open up a
JavaScript file with NetBeans to find
out whether that whether there's any
inherent bugs in it so that can kind of
come in handy because we've it or not
the and it also is helpful when you're
trying to troubleshoot that problem with
the the braces because JavaScript is
sensitive to whether the brace is on the
next line or not so it'll actually
detect that code completion it does
provide code completion along with
documentation now the code completion is
not just not not all not just for your
code it also does code completion for
knockout for angular and includes the
documentation so that you can actually
see so that you can we look at the
methods and and use that for help for
aiding in your coding okay and then it
has a full full fully functional
JavaScript debugger as I've mentioned
before which ties into NetBeans so over
on the right here you can see the the
NetBeans window kind of off to the side
sorry the Chrome window off to the side
with a chrome window it'll actually have
a little title bar and it'll tell you
that NetBeans is debugging it and so in
it so you can actually make changes over
in the IDE IDE and you can set
breakpoints or you can set breakpoints
over in the IDE and they'll immediately
I take take effect they'll they'll
trigger as they get executed over in
Chrome web browser
it also supports debugging of the DOM
and CSS so you can actually hover over
elements in the Chrome web browser and
it will bring you back to the actual
code in your HTML files or in your CSS
files making it easy to find out you
know why did that render that way why is
my element over on the right Howard how
are the CSS Styles computed that
resulted in that UI so it will help you
with all of that making life much easier
it also has CS as fully as a fully
functional visual CSS editor so you can
pick your colors you don't have to know
them off the top of your head you don't
have to know the hexadecimals off the
top of your head you don't have to
Google for them it will show you the
it'll allow you to preview the colors
the fonts it does allow you to it does
have a drop-down so you can start typing
and it will suggest potential CSS
atracsys attributes that you're looking
for so this is a great way for editing
CSS files for the one of the more
sophisticated features are the sass and
less support so in this case right here
I'm creating a new less file which I
want to compile every time I hit save
and so over here you can see my this is
my less file right here which gets
compiled less file gets compiled to a
CSS file is basically kind of like a
temp letting for it so this gets
compiled down to CS CSS and this is one
of the very powerful feature that
NetBeans has in terms of palette
although it does not support visual
editing of an html5 HTML file it does
provide you with the palette which which
allows you to drag over elements so if
you don't necessarily remember the HTML
for a particular element you can just
drag it off the palette now one of the
nice things with this palette is you can
actually add to it so you can add your
own HTML snippets to it which you can
then drag back out into other files so
if you're constantly using a common
construct or you can create basically
your own setup shortcuts you can create
your own set of palettes so it's just
not one palette you have many paths
that you can create you can also save
files as templates so that if you're
creating many of the same types of files
as a part of a project you just say you
know create new from this template and
it will bang out a new file for you so
it allows you drag back and forth and
then finally one of the hardest things
with doing JavaScript development
especially if you're not using NetBeans
is the web server aspect of it
NetBeans includes a built-in lightweight
built-in web server which will serve up
your content for you to the Chrome web
browser so Chrome is not reading off the
file system it's actually connecting to
a web server that's running inside of
NetBeans thereby you know allowing you
to actually execute code pull down
resources like you would actually have
it in the end production system or close
to it now one of the nice things is that
NetBeans does aid you with managing
dependencies so there's three different
ways that it can manage JavaScript
dependencies for you one is using the
node package manager Bower and then
content delivery networks so if you're
looking to use jQuery you don't have to
actually go out to the jQuery website
download it copy it over into your
project then download the minified one
you know set up a workflow for basically
dealing with when you go to production
that you want to deploy the minimum of
fied one NetBeans is fully and it's
fully integrated with the JavaScript
tools to reach out pull down the
JavaScript libraries deploy the correct
one when you're moving into like a
production or release phase it's in the
case of right here I'm using Bower which
isn't primarily used for front-end stuff
so I'm going to add jQuery it pops open
a dialog I can do then do Auto
completion it reaches out to a central
index for Bower and it gives me a list
of suggestions based upon what I've
typed and then I can click Add and it
adds it to my project I did not have to
reach out I didn't have to go out I
didn't have to find a jQuery website and
have to download it I could pick which
version that I want and it does this for
all the different libraries so if you're
you know pulling in jQuery UI some some
custom data tables for it
this makes it easy for you to go out
there and pull down stuff and it does it
in a standard way so
not reinventing dependency management
it's using Bower or NPM for doing the
dependency management for you and so
there you can see the I've selected
jQuery has downloaded and put it in the
project for me if I close out and look
at the project window you can see down
below that it reached out to github but
sucked on jQuery and the artifacts are
now there so under bower libraries it
says it has jQuery and you can see
further up there's the jQuery
distribution directory I didn't have to
download I didn't have to setup I didn't
have to manage any of this and this also
means that you can check in a diversion
control somebody can check it out and
download the libraries easily that way
and looking at the Bower JSON file it's
updated it with the dependencies for
jQuery one of the other nice things is
that it using so now I've got jQuery
downloaded I want to use it in my
project file in my HTML files how do I
do that I can just drag it from the
projects window into my HTML file and it
automatically inserts the link for me I
don't have to remember you know this
syntax for the script tag or the link
tag in order to drop in a file it adds
it in there with the correct path form
it correctly typed okay
so moving onwards I think it right now
I'll hop over to NetBeans and just take
it create an example project quickly and
show you the debugging in action and
also some of the CSS features so right
now I'm going to create a new html5
project I'll select HTML 5 J s
application click Next select travel 1
demo I won't select a site template so
I'll have it create it from scratch I'll
start a project from scratch I'm sorry
I'll keep the rest of the settings there
click finish
okay
so this is a project that I've created
if I open up the HTML file I can see
that I've got it's got some example
content some placeholder content in it
already I can right click I can say well
let's add a JavaScript file answer to
the J's wrote a sorts of the site root
type counsel dot log
notice that a flags that I don't have a
semicolon at the end I have the
semicolon hit save back in my index
files index file so I'm going to drag it
over it'll insert a reference for the
JavaScript file for me I can now click
on this file and say I want to run this
file and so it's going to fire up Chrome
for me and you can see right there that
we have the content now that console dot
log where did that go I can go back to
the IDE and I can see it in the IDE so
what it's actually done is is redirected
the Council log or back to the ID so you
can get it here I can click and say okay
what line did what line did that occur
on takes me right to the line
so let's add a CSS file
okay
gives me Auto completions for the for
the CSS let's do a background color and
what color should we pick we'll pick
brown
okay so as you can see over here also
gives me a visual editor for seeing the
property so I can edit it right here
over here on the right at also I can
also add properties and it'll add them
to the file for me so there's several
different ways of editing it go back to
the index.html file I can drag out my
CSS file it's safe as soon as I hit save
it automatically updates the file over
here so let me quickly show you that
right there so watch this hit save it
automatically reloaded it for me I
didn't actually have to do anything so
it's telling Chrome every time I make a
change to the file hit save it updates
it lets go back to that CSS file let's
change this to div
and did you notice that it automatically
took effect over in Chrome so I could
actually see this changes as I as I'm
working now let's just let's let's say
that Brown isn't a good color we want to
do red do red
watch it immediately took effect over in
the in the web browser so it has so
you're not so it's it's informing chrome
that I've made changes to the file I
didn't actually have to go over to
Chrome I didn't have to tell Chrome oh
you know ignore you know flush the
chrome cache if you've ever dealt with
problems where your CSS files are
getting cached
during development or your JavaScript
files are getting cash during
development you don't have to worry
about that with this because it's
telling chrome hey the CSS file is
updated we render the page I can look at
over in the web browser here I can click
under the dome brought the navigate
right here should be able to
and it will automatically hop to where
that code as so as you can see right
here is hopping over so it allows me to
navigate back and forth in the web
browser and to see what act what the
properties what property sorry what
properties are actually being applied
so grunt and gulp gulp and grump our
both task runners as I've mentioned
grunt uses a configuration based
approach gulp uses streams approach from
node so it's two different approaches
for doing basically the equivalent of
ant and JavaScript it's totally up to
you and personal preference which one to
use some common tasks for these because
with JavaScript you really don't have
Java code you compiled to bytecode
JavaScript code you just minify so it
can be used for minification for running
RS lint for compiling sass and less
files to CSS for rearranging your site
so there's a number of different things
that you that you can use both of these
for so simple gulp hello world you
creating a gulp file at hello world - it
was pretty simple and then from the IDE
you can actually map the IDE actions for
example for build to a specific gulp or
grunt task so when you invoke build or
run in the IDE NetBeans is going to
invoke the appropriate tasks in your
grunt or gulp file and run it so which
is nice this right here gives you a
listing so you basically can remap all
of the menus in NetBeans to gulp and
grunt tasks a more complicated grunt
example this one right here I'm running
jslint over a set of j javascript files
in the project and and then wiring that
up to one of the menus within NetBeans
so this is just a more a more complex
example and in NetBeans gives you auto
completion on this
and so so anyway so so this is the going
through the the node package manager I
can go in there and add so those
dependencies that were not in that file
actually have to tell the NetBeans about
those some of those dependencies so I go
into the node package manager like I did
for Bao or search for dependencies it
runs the node equivalent to install and
downloads and installs of installs the
the files
NetBeans also supports the reacted J's
framework gives you auto completion on
it and it also gives you the ability to
map react modules to a local path on
your computer so if it's different based
upon how you deploy the project it
allows you to easily map to set up the
mappings in here in so that the IDE
knows about them so moving on to no js'
nodejs of course is a platform for
building a basically server-side writing
server-side JavaScript applications it
uses the chrome JavaScript runtime
engine to execute so it's it's the v8
engine that compiles JavaScript down to
the native machine code and NetBeans
works with this just like it does with
with a glassfish and Tomcat and web
logic
so there's there's the two project types
that I mentioned for node.js you can
create a node.js application from
scratch or you can create one with the
Express template the Express template
includes the template engine which in
which by default is Jade that's the
equivalent to like JSP Zoar PHP files so
the the node.js support is fully
integrated there's the project wizard as
I've mentioned and it supports project
specific settings for your project
so with that I'll hop over the next demo
so this is an example no js' application
all it's doing is printing out stuff
whenever a file changes so I can click
run and basically what this code is
doing is its monitoring file for changes
and prints out a message on the console
every time the file changes so that's
interesting but let's let's debug it so
I had a break point to it I click that I
want to debug it
now with node projects it'll immediately
breakpoint on the first line giving you
a chance to intercept anything that
happens initially on startup
so I just click run so right now it's
watching this file go back to output
it's the target file right there
and as you can see it's topped out in
the breakpoint I can now look at the
variable as if I had any but this is
debugging a node.js application from
within the IDE Thomas if you've tried
doing this you know anywhere else this
is actually this this can be you know
this is very very helpful with the
nodejs development so I'll let that run
okay so that's an example node.js
application I'll let me create another
one a new project I'm going to create a
no js' html5 application
enable Express now if you weren't doing
this you'd have to go through and
execute a bunch of steps you'd create
your nodejs project you'd run some stuff
some JavaScript command in contagions at
the command line in order to set up your
project
NetBeans is doing that for you to get
you up and running so this is actually
doing quite a bit of work underneath the
hood of course I didn't set it up before
I did so let me find where my press
install generator
ah so this is the stuff that you want to
do before you do a demo which is install
so in many cases when you go to use a
feature that you haven't set up before
NetBeans will tell you what this is
where you need to download it from so I
go there and this actually has to run it
has route when you do the install so I'm
going to install it it's actually
reaching out right now and downloading
and installing expresso Xpress is
downloaded hopefully on Windows that
works where we'll actually find the
executable on the Mac it doesn't
okay so I've installed Express on my
computer Bower right
great
so it creates the initial project and it
tells me right now it's actually going
to reach out and it's going to download
a bunch of things let's see let's do
what's missing so it's missing some mm
node modules
that's required so we can sit down right
now it's actually downloading Jade so I
have not run Jade on the on the newer
NetBeans 8.2 so it's downloading it and
so now I have a fully functional Express
project in NetBeans and you basically
we've just seen as I've just installed
Jade and Express which are two separate
packages from the Java and the
JavaScript ecosystem so I've installed
them and configured the executables on
my machine and that beans has guided me
through you know this is what you need
to run as root in order to install it
etc so now that we have that up and now
that we have it downloaded and the
project created we can try running the
project
and it felt it wrong hold on
okay well I'll move on from that but
this is this is the example project here
at permissions on this laptop setup
wrong so this is an example of Jade
files so it's given me a basic project
layout in order to start with some
example JavaScript files routes between
pages just learning just learning just
trying to learn this stuff as well as
polite trying to deal with the tooling
and learn that learn these various
technologies that make up these things
is quite a bit of work without an IDE
like NetBeans we hop back to the editor
so for unit testing NetBeans has fully a
fully integrated support for unit
testing so it supports karma the
jstestdriver mocha and also selenium so
Jasmine is Java Script unit test frame
so Jasmine is as the Java Script unit
test framework because the the runner
and the executor are actually two
separate so you'll use jasmine and then
execution framework so Jasmine is is
basically the you can kind of think of
as like the annotations that the
framework for Java forum like for Jade
unit and then the actual runner is a
part that actually runs that the the
unit tests and actually it fires off a
separate rub fires up a web browser in
order to run the unit tests so in order
to get that up and running you have to
first install karma which NetBeans will
actually take you through and prompt you
for doing that you go through the
difference the different things so you
add the go through the package manager
you download and select Jasmine core
karma you know if you're going to be
using chrome you select the chrome one
and then the and then the the Jasmine
plug-in for it then you create a karma
configuration file and NetBeans will
prompt you if you try to run a karma
test also you need to do you need to
create a karma file a karma file
specifies basically where your unit
tests are what tests are excluded what
execution framework you're going to use
which in this case is Jasmine
the browsers that you want to run the
unit tests in so you can actually have
you can actually run the unit tests in
Chrome Firefox ie you can run them in
several different web browsers and then
a list of plugins that are going to be
used
with it and then configure you setup the
configuration for karma and the location
of the Carmen executable which NetBeans
will prompt you for and tell you how to
actually install that that's a
third-party application that NetBeans
then uses and then you can click off and
start and run and run the unit tests ok
and that's an example unit test right
there so you can see it has the npm
libraries on the left for Jasmine core
karma karma chrome launcher etc
everything has been downloaded for you
to get you up and running ok so moving
on to mobile and sadly this part of the
presentation I do not I can't actually
tether the iPhone in debug it because
once again this year Apple is released
the newer version of iOS which has
broken my presentation I think for the
third year that had done something like
this so they've actually there's there's
postings online because everybody else
is fighting with this right now it's
actually a problem not but with NetBeans
with Cordova and the fact that Apple
changed how iOS 10 applications are
signed so but I'll run it here I can I
should be able to get some of it up and
running you can actually generate the
project in NetBeans and then go over to
Xcode and run it from Xcode which is
what you have to do right now so Cordova
if you're not familiar which was
originally PhoneGap so it's an html5
framework it was started back in 2009 so
basically what it is is it's a full page
web application so it takes and that the
entire screen is taken up by the the web
browser and use CSS and JavaScript to
implement your application so in fact
many of the applications that you have
on our phone are probably html5
applications like the local news station
applications those are actually just
html5 applications and you get rid gets
rid of the the navigation bars etc so
you don't have access to those but it's
an Apache project it's also still backed
by Adobe so for it there's a platform
SDK which you have to download and
install outside of NetBeans you need
no js' in order to run it chrome is
helpful for debugging it and then you
can use some of these various the
frameworks that have already discussed
for unit testing and working with it
cordova supports numerous platforms so
you can deploy to iOS Android Windows
Phone tenzin blackberry etc from
NetBeans NetBeans supports both iOS and
Android and iOS and Android simulators
ok so prior to going down this prior to
going down these steps especially if you
want to run it on the phone you have to
go out and then pay the $25 to Google
and $100 to Apple in order to run it on
your phone although that I believe
that's changed recently
and then before actually creating the
project in in NetBeans you have to go
out and install Cordova from the command
line so you install that via the no
package manager and then with which
platform which platform plugins that you
want installed along with it and then
once that's done you can go back into
NetBeans and create your Cordova
application you can also start off with
an html5 application so you start off
with just a web application and you
decide to turn that into a mobile
application so it supports that run so
you can always add you can start off
with an html5 application and turn it
into a mobile application later so
that's one of the nice things with it
because developing on the phones can it
can be kind of a high penalty so usually
if I'm developing a mobile application
I'll start first with in html5 template
get it working in the web browser where
you tell chrome that you want to use the
iOS you know basically dimensions or the
Android phone dimensions get it working
and then turn the project over into a
Cordova project and then take advantage
of the features of Cordova after after I
get the baseline application working
because the bucking at the debug
deploying and debugging on a phone takes
time Cordova project and so after you
create a Cordova project the file system
look NetBeans just uses the default
project layout that comes for Cordova so
and all the project types that we've
seen today NetBeans is not really
wiill in terms of the project layouts or
how the code gets setup so is it under
the hood it is an Apache Cordova project
you can go out there you can use the
Apache Cordova commands to execute and
run your project and to do tests you
don't have to you're not locked into
NetBeans NetBeans is just providing a
nice UI for it it makes it easier to
work with so if we look at the project
structure of that NetBeans NetBeans
invokes the Cordova command-line under
the hood for you to create the project
you end up with the project structure
underneath so in the case of right here
you can see where if I've created a
project that uses both iOS and Android
they'll be directory structures for both
of those including the native code that
has to get deployed and the web app sets
go down into the WWE which it hides the
rest of that stuff from you so you don't
have to worry about that so in example
Cordova application this is just a
simple hello world one that it creates
out of the box the JavaScript code if
you've done any iOS development this
probably looks familiar some of the
callbacks that you get so you know the
device is ready event callbacks so
that's the html5 and the JavaScript file
it creates for you and then you have
from the cont the run menu in NetBeans
you can select which which way you want
to run the application so you can run
you can run your mobile application on
and I an actual iOS device in the iOS
simulator you can try running it in the
Chrome web browser if you just want to
run the html5 stuff and not deal with
the phone but as long as that that'll
work as long as you're not using the
native hooks for the phone okay and so
I'll hop over before ending and create a
mobile app quick quickly create a mobile
application
and then I'll try running it
so this this is an easy way if you want
to come up with a better app for
scheduling sessions at JavaOne you can
get most of the way there with us in
fact I think the I'm pretty I'm Park
100% certain that the existing Java one
scheduler app is just an html5 Cordova
application I haven't tried splitting it
out to see what's inside of it but this
is basically how you'd go about
implementing that type of application
and there are UI toolkits that come that
you can go in there and pull down using
the package manager in here the jQuery
UI you can get an iOS look and feel so
that for all practical purposes unless
the user is particularly astute they
won't be able to tell the difference
between your application and the native
application so they'll download the CSS
for you to turn your make your
application look like a real mobile
application so let's say we're trying to
do a new schedule builder for Java 1
start with a hello world yeah sure we'll
take everything
so what it's actually doing behind the
scenes is actually running the cordova
command line to generate the project for
us as you can see right here we move
over there's actually a lot going on
behind the scenes and this is just it's
invoking that the Cordova stuff it's not
reinventing the wheel and generally the
the project types NetBeans of Cordova
upgrades that you're not and that beans
has been fairly good with track in the
Cordova changes so changes with how
NetBeans is interacting with Cordova new
verse you don't have to wait for
NetBeans to support new versions of
Cordova in order to take advantage of it
because it's hooks is just using Cordova
underneath the hood so it's not so as
you can see right here it's we've got
our Java one scheduler we've got our
base page we've got our JavaScript and
we can try running the application
and so you can see it's executing here
because it knows I've my computer right
now is a Mac configured for iOS so it's
actually reaching out right now and
downloading the various pieces for the
for iOS and compiling up and if we go
into into the project properties we can
see that we've got a Cordova tab and
then under the Kotova tab we can select
which plugins we want for our mobile
applications so these are JavaScript
bindings so there's the there's a files
API that allows you to access files on
the device there's a camera that allows
that allows you from JavaScript to
access the camera functionality so these
are basically bindings that give you
access to the native device features of
GPS locations native dialogues being
able to vibrate the phone display
crashing so you can select in here which
which one of the plugins you want
installed by default the more plugins
you have the longer it will take to
actually deploy under the mobile tab
which brings you back to the preferences
you can set up your things so as you can
see right here it says it's detected
that I have Cordova version six point
three point one if I had installed the
Android on this laptop would also be
deployed here and I could actually
deploy and test both platforms from
within NetBeans and one of the nice
things with NetBeans is that with this
JavaScript application you can actually
running even on the tethered device you
can debug it from NetBeans like I showed
you how you could debug stuff from
Chrome you can do that from NetBeans
which is which is extremely powerful
and was an animal saved incredible
amount of time and many of these
features that have gone over today
because I focused it pretty much
exclusively on JavaScript support in the
html5 development with it these many of
these same features are also available
if you're working with like a Java EE
project and NetBeans and you're doing
like a JavaScript front-end so as you
can see right now it's repairing iOS so
it's actually compiling down to a native
application behind the scenes
okay so eventually eventually it'll get
done and I'll run it so with that
NetBeans is one of the unsung JavaScript
IDs out there so be sure to tell all of
your friends that are doing JavaScript
development about NetBeans and that it's
just that as these incredible incredibly
powerful JavaScript functions built-in
JavaScript functionality that not many
developers know about out there so it's
really it's really one of it's the Dark
Horse you talk to people people are
using simple LC at conferences people
using sublime text for editing
javascript whereas we have this
excellent IDE with all of this this
really tight integration with the
JavaScript frameworks it's not just an
editor it's it's tight integration with
node with the node package manager with
bow or with grunt with j/s it allows you
to remap functionality in the IDE to the
JavaScript files so with that thank you
and if there's any questions
yes
yes
yep yeah so you can have yes so you can
have you can have Java EE projects and
JavaScript projects open within the IDE
you could have a Java EE project that
within it has a JavaScript project so
yes so that's that's one of the nice
things is that is one IDE so you can be
doing your you can have your Java EE
back-end right and then you can have a
Java Script mobile application front-end
that you're working on in the IDE yep
yeah so it's very it's very nice than
that that's how I usually like to work
because I'll be developing stuff out in
in the JavaScript side of things I'll
run write the unit test using the
jasmine and the karma and then execute
those against the Glatt the the
GlassFish that i'm running in as a part
of NetBeans on the backend
yeah yeah so
correct yep yep
so it's yep correct so it's just editing
those files it's not creating some
proprietary descriptor file that it's
using for your project so you know that
you're you're in trouble you know you
move your project over into netbeans
then you decide later well no I want to
use my own toolset or there's cases
where you know with Cordova where you
want to use something for Cordova
directly it's like okay well now I'm
locked in to NetBeans no NetBeans has
always taken the approach where it uses
other tools for doing that back-end
stuff so even for the like the Java
projects and NetBeans it'll either use
maven or ant as the build system it's
not using a proprietary build system
that like that what comes with IntelliJ
or Eclipse so it's very it's extremely
flexible and it has got the the freeform
project type so you can pull in a
project that's got an existing grunt
script where somebody created and kind
of a non-standard way or didn't take the
typical approach with it
but to be frank I don't think my I'm on
a small team I'm the only I'm the
back-end developer the others are
front-end I don't think they're gonna
start using that means are you seeing
that yes yeah so that would allow you to
work with those files and not have to
adopt a different tool chain and will
give you all of the features that you've
seen today so it's got it's got a very
powerful set you don't you know you
don't you know I see people off using
like sublime texts and you know manually
editing stuff or running stuff from the
command line it NetBeans is just as a
layer on top of that but that provides a
set of tools that makes it easy it does
a bunch of things for you yes
yeah so you can you I mean in terms of
command line is it's got built-in
support for the grunt and the the
existing you know task runners for
JavaScript you can go in behind the
scenes in and run command line you can
go in there and manually edit the the
package.json file in add dependencies so
if somebody goes off and adds add
NetBeans will say okay you know you've
added a dependency fork because it reads
that file it's not squirreling that data
away in some separate file that you then
have to worry about synchronizing it's
using these files for the projects
okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
