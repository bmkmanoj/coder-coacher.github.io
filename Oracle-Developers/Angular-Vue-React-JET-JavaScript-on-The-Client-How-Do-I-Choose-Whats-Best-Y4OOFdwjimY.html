ready here so I apologize up front from
my voice I've been talking for about a
week and a half straight and when I'm
not talking I've been sitting in 11-hour
airplane rides between here in South
Africa so if I don't fall asleep and
faceplant in my computer we're doing
good
that is your water as it is so my name
is John Brock excuse me if I just sit
and not stand up at the podium because
I'm gonna do a little bit of code and
weird things and I want to have a decent
spot Rick and run my mouth I'm a product
manager for Oracle jet just heads up on
the up front so I'm gonna talk a little
bit about what it takes to do JavaScript
clients in an enterprise space and with
those caveats kind of in discussion
about how we're gonna fit in what we're
gonna look at well we'll talk about a
little bit about how angular plays in
that now maybe react plays view Jay ask
those types of things you will not come
out of this at the end of the session
going angular is the one to go with or
jet is the one to go with or something
like that I'm not going to declare a
winner today we're just going to talk
about what the different options are and
by talking about what these different
scenarios that you have to think about
when you're building out high scale
enterprise type applications you guys
can figure out what's going to work best
for your environment and work best for
your shop so I think everybody you've
probably by the end of the day here
you've seen this safe harbor statement a
zillion times I don't plan on talking
about schedules so it doesn't really
matter it's an enterprise software what
does that actually mean in this day and
age if we look at enterprise in
Wikipedia it basically says that we're
dealing with software that organizations
or large companies deal with and
actually interact with versus the
consumer software where an end-user
might be using it more in an everyday
life as you start to look through this I
remember back when I worked at Sun
Microsystems we just kind of looked at
enterprise software is this really
large-scale you know high availability
those types of things
that's what it really kind of meant to
me but as you go searching through the
internet and trying to find out
definitions for things you often come up
with people that have their own strange
definitions for things this guy was out
on stackoverflow and he basically said
enterprise software is when you make it
complicated enough that you can build a
consulting business around it yeah okay
maybe maybe for some of us that actually
is true but for us we start to deal more
in this day and age about client-server
relationships and how those are starting
to change in this enterprise space and
you know we've always had the backend
and these big data centers that we dealt
with and things like that and the
clients usually were just browsers and
if you were really lucky you had
something like this where you could
actually have like really a lot of
browsers and big big ones I did a tour
through a Google office recently up in
the Seattle area and every desktop
actually had these three monitors set up
similar to this so makes you kind of
want to go work for Google and hopefully
I don't have any Oracle bosses in here
but but nowadays it's not so much just
that browser right now it's devices of
every kind of shape and size and and you
know touch devices and even laptops like
this one that I'm using right now is
already touch enabled I even had a
gentleman contact us from Oracle's
Belgium office and they're doing a
digital experience lab then they got a
new Samsung 44 inch touchscreen and he
was asking if jet you know would be able
to run data visualizations on this touch
screen so people go walk into the lobby
and start touching it and stuff and it
actually worked I told him I'd be glad
to test it for him if he could order
another one and send it over to me but
he wasn't he wasn't falling for that one
so we're gonna take a look at this kind
of this environment of or you really
have to think about where does that
client hook into and what kind of
environment in the backend is that
actually looking at we're going to look
at seven different steps I just list
them up front but we'll cover all of
these there's kind of one in the middle
it's kind of a half step that I've kind
of run into over the last few months and
so I added it in but let's start from
the
so resist the hype you know JavaScript
in this day and age changes constantly
in about every two weeks every month
there's a brand new framework or brand
new library that's gonna save you the
world and when you're dealing with
enterprise software that can take a year
two years to write
you can't go chasing after that greatest
latest you know latest and greatest
thing it doesn't mean you have to stay
on old libraries forever but you have to
be really careful that what you're
actually taking on is stable you know
it's not some guy one guy working on it
out of his garage and you're wondering
if it's got security holes in it or if
it's gonna scale when you need it to and
things like that you want to work with
things that are a little bit more mature
a little bit more proven you also don't
necessarily always want to go to these
new client-server architectures there
are places where on premise or you know
proprietary software type situations
make sense such as air traffic
controllers if they ever start landing
planes on a phone I'm taking the bus I
mean it's just it's ridiculous right but
we actually had somebody come to us in
an air traffic controller situation and
their bosses were just screaming at them
we need to move to the browser the whole
new web thing is the new thing and it's
like look people you actually have your
own IT group in the floor right below
you that maintains this software on a
daily basis there's no way you're gonna
move this to the browser let alone you'd
want to and there are multiple
environments that are this way but it's
you just have to kind of resist that
hype you have to really think about
where you're going but at the same time
there may be ways to extend or you know
look at certain areas that can actually
take advantage of this new client-server
architecture so even in that air traffic
controller environment you may look at
things where maybe you set up a phone
app that does alerts in certain
situations to get the manager and get
his tail back up into the tower if he
needs to be or maybe there's some
reporting systems that you can do there
aren't quite real-time urgent type
situations so you don't always want to
move every
but there may be things that you can
think about out of the box and see if
there's maybe another way to go about it
the second thing that seems to come up
quite a bit is data and this is the
situation of we had server-side
languages JSP you know JSF those types
of things even even things like Ruby on
Rails or whatever you were doing on the
back end and in a lot of those
environments you got used to making
direct database calls and you could pull
down to and to gigabytes or UNITA gigs
to megabytes of data really quickly in
an XML format or even a JSON format and
manipulate it on the server and then
what you sent down to the client was
just the already processed data and what
we find is a lot of people will turn
around and they'll just take those
endpoints those rest call or those data
base calls that they were making before
and they'll turn them into rest
endpoints and then they go into this new
architecture and they can't figure out
why their plot and why their browser
takes so long to load well it's bringing
down two megabytes adjacent across the
wire and then they're trying to
manipulate it on the client even worse
you'll find people that will connect
still to a sope interface bring down XML
and then for some reason they want the
browser to convert XML to JSON which is
just a nightmare
so you have to really start thinking
about is your data too large or is it
too small or is it just right for the
client that you're starting to work at
this architectural change is actually
the starting point for any of these
application changes you really want to
look at the architectural change of
client to server and what the data is
going to do first it's it's even more
important than how you're going to
rewrite the client itself we get the
case where the guys are bringing down
really large data situations that's the
most typical the other side is the micro
services another big buzzword that
people like to chase we had a situation
again where an application they said oh
we're not going to we're not going to
bring down this big thing we're going to
go to microservices they had a rest
endpoint for they were doing a profile
page they had a rest endpoint for the
address they had a rest endpoint for the
name and a rest endpoint for the avatar
another rest endpoint for the location
map or whatever the heck it was and the
next thing you know they're coming up on
our internal forums they're like I have
these five different rest endpoints and
I'm trying to put together a forum how
do I join those all back together so
that I could actually pull something
it's like well in the database it's
called a join you know it's like shape
your data on the server use the database
for what it's really built for and
simply bring down the data that your
client needs so don't go too small don't
go too large you have to think about
that relationship that the clients doing
now this is irrelevant of what you're
going to use on the JavaScript for the
on the client it doesn't really matter
but it's really really important to be
thinking about that in an enterprise
space because a lot of times when you
start to find out where your performance
bottlenecks are they're going to be at
that rest endpoint it's not going to be
at the client and so it's really
important to figure that part out so
when it's a right fit everything
actually works really well and you can
do some really crazy things on the
client to make that right fit work so
let's take a quick look at a demo so in
this case I'm going to use Apex so
anybody you guys use Apex out there so
I've got I'm just I'm gonna kind of
what's that there's no display and where
did it go no connections there
it's me I'm good
there we go so I'm gonna use Apex and
I'm just gonna use their SQL workshop
and the SQL command side apex is a
fantastic utility we really our
application we really like it on the jet
side they happen to use our jet charts
and graphs so we have a good
relationship with them yep
in this particular case I'm using the
SQL workshop and I've got some ords
scripts that I'm using the Oracle rest
data service and for myself let's see
here let's go with yeah so I have a rest
endpoint and it's a little hard to see
this I apologize it's hard to make this
bigger
no there I go make it a little bit
bigger so I have this rest endpoint that
just goes to EMP slash and when I hit
that I'm just doing a select star from
employees so I'm getting all of the
fields in my employee database and
that's all well and good that that's
going to be one thing that I can hit
maybe want to have a big browser but I
also have a mobile endpoint and my
mobile endpoint is hitting let's see if
your m / so I'm gonna if I actually do a
URL then it's m / employees then just
pull in the employee number the employee
name and the hire date so this is
thinking very carefully I'm saying if
I'm in a large screen I give me
everything up from the database I can
handle that I'm going to display a lot
of information but if I'm on a mobile
device maybe I only want to show a few
fields because I have a much smaller
interface that I'm dealing with and
while this is really simple in a very
very simplistic case the applications
that we start to put together show
something like this where when I'm on a
full-size monitor it shows me all the
different fields but if I shrink the
monitor down and refresh the app now I
only get those three fields
so what I'm doing is this thing called
responsive JavaScript and I'm going to
cover responsiveness in the next step
here in a minute but there is code that
we can write and certain JavaScript
frameworks have this capability where I
can go into the JavaScript and I can
basically write into my JavaScript
saying if I'm dealing with a certain
screen size in this case I've got
responsive utilities which I've defined
up above here over the Ru right here in
this little library that I have called
responsive utilities and I've said if
it's a medium screen or smaller then go
to this URL as my rest service if I'm
anything less than that then use my
mobile or medium on up brother anything
less than medium go to that mobile
endpoint so now I'm able to dynamically
adjust the data that I'm actually
pulling in and there's like I say
there's certain different types of
frameworks that have this responsive
utilities and well then we'll talk to
that in a minute
but it actually allows you to be a
little bit more careful and a little bit
more thought-provoking on what data
you're pulling down what is there about
mobile devices that really makes this
type of thing really important maybe the
the bandwidth so 4G 3G you know I was
just in in South Africa and I was
talking to their second largest health
insurance company a little bit Liberty
health and they're doing data entry
pretty much all the time it's just these
big fields of data entry and their
biggest problem was that everybody's
moving to these big fancy new you eyes
and you know pulling data and they're in
charts and everything else but these
guys have got insurance
you know hubs and and offices sitting
off in remote places in Africa where 3G
is is like really good and 3G data on
mobile devices and so they have to be
very careful about what data comes down
across the wire so situations like this
are really really important and so shape
your data for the device that it's
actually going to go to
so let's go back to slides really quick
good
so the next thing is that responsive
design so everybody familiar with the
responsive design you know what that is
okay
so responsive design is just kind of
expected in this day and age you know
two years ago maybe three years ago we
were starting to get into it and
primarily it was all CSS it was
basically if you shrunk your browser
down or you went down to a different
device the CSS would reshape things on
your or it would hide things in your
browser and it would help you kind of
make your application respond to the
device that's responsive design but as
we also find nowadays this JavaScript
responsiveness is also something that's
really important it was kind of the Holy
Grail up until about two years ago when
there were a couple of libraries has
started to come out that allowed us to
deal with that you know CSS originally
was just designed to kind of give you a
look and feel of your document it really
didn't control things based on the on
the devices again we had the big
browsers that's all we really had to do
it was just there for laying things out
but with css3 they broke everything down
into these individual modules there's
over 50 different modules that make up
the css3 specification and one of those
biggest ones was media queries media
queries allowed us to start looking at
the device of the actual width or
viewport width of the devices that we
were displaying in and then adjust our
CSS based on those device sizes so we
could do things where we could actually
hide you know see we have a big screen
and we're showing a bunch of charts on
this side when we get down to a small
space on a tablet you don't have as much
space to show all these things so you
just hide those those images or hide
those charts well that was great and it
allowed it to look really cool but
behind the scenes you were still making
those JavaScript calls you were still
bringing down the data that was filling
out those charts they were just hidden
so that became you know the everybody
started thinking well isn't there a way
that I can dynamically adjust whether
this stuff is happening even on the
business logic side and that's where we
got into responsive JavaScript
and there were things like response
json' that came out it was a really cool
library and pretty easy to implement and
then another framework a JavaScript
framework called foundation from a
company called ZURB which if anybody is
if you haven't heard of this you should
go take a look at it's actually a really
cool JavaScript framework and they have
a feature of it called interchange which
also brought this stuff in an Oracle jet
we brought it we actually brought it in
as well in a version about two years ago
and started doing these capabilities of
doing this stuff well it not only allows
you to adjust the data on the backend
like we did just a minute ago with the
rest endpoints but it also allows you to
dynamically show and hide or load and
unload instead of show and hide so with
CSS you're simply hiding something it's
still in the Dom it's still in Europe in
your download that you're downloading
into the into the device but with
JavaScript we can put conditional
statements around the Dom objects and we
don't even load those at all if they're
not of the viewport size so let's let's
take a look at how we can do this and it
probably just dropped back oh no it
didn't Hey look at that good okay so in
this case I'm looking at let's go ahead
and bring up the app so in this
particular case we've got this little
screen and she's got a couple of images
on it and as I shrink this down whoops
as I shrink this down
is the end of the day
as I start shrinking this down the
images disappear okay
so responsibly just hiding some images
very simplistic example they both hide
they both disappear let's take a look at
what's actually going on in the UI so if
I bring up the browser tools and I tell
it I want to inspect image let me see if
I can increase the size of this a little
bit okay so here I've got image a and
I've got image B image a is simply being
shown in hidden using CSS so if I look
at my a CSS I have this media query that
says the max width is 767 so anything
smaller than 767 pixels just set
display:none on image but in my javis or
in the other section here I've actually
wrapped image B in an if statement so
what I'm doing is I'm saying if this
conditional situation is true then go
ahead and show what's inside of it if
not don't even load it in the Dom don't
even put it into the object model itself
again extremely simplistic but imagine
if you've put this if block around an
entire chart or around an entire table
that's making rest interfaces and so
forth so you're actually you know
shrinking your Dom by quite a bit and
what has to be sent over the wire so
let's take a look at that in this
situation so here's image B it's wrapped
with a conditional here's image a so as
I start to shrink this down
okay they both disappeared imagej is
still in the Dom that image B is
completely gone it's not even then Dom
at all and and so it's kind of cool in
that you can just simply do this
responsive JavaScript where it adds and
removes things right directly out of the
Dom again simplistic but it is something
to think about and as you start to get
larger and larger applications that have
to be able to show up on these different
devices this stuff gets really important
so another thing that came up when we
started talking about design and I've
heard this multiple times now is if
you're of a company that is either
really large like Oracle we have our own
design shops or design teams basically
we have a UX and a UI team that does all
of our HTML or our UX design and so
forth all our CSS for us and so forth
you can go on the opposite side where
maybe you're a smaller start-up and you
don't have that expertise in-house so
you'll actually outsource that to a real
design shop and they'll do some
beautiful HTML they'll do all your
images they do this really cool CSS and
then they hand that back to you is just
straight-up HTML and CSS and now you're
supposed to tag all that buy into your
data on the back end you're supposed to
connect all that up to make the dynamic
pieces of it well this used to be kind
of a problem when we were on the server
side you know I did a lot of with JRuby
stuff and things like that back and when
I was at Sun Microsystems and we would
get these design shops that would bring
us these HTML files and then we'd have
to figure out in the HTML how to change
up things and put it in our tags to the
dynamic side of the tags and what was
going to get loaded and so forth and it
was a little more difficult to kind of
mix all this stuff in with what was
going on on the server well the same
things going on now on the client we
started to have pretty good life where
everything was being done in HTML and
you could just get these things brought
over from these design shops and it was
fairly simple to add some binding layers
in and things like that to make the data
dynamic well everything else stayed the
way it was then came along another very
popular framework and that changed up
what we call it changed it into what we
call JavaScript forward so there's HTML
forward and JavaScript forward HTML
forward means that the framework usually
usually relies on the semantics of HTML
so angular view and jet all of jus HTML
forward you actually develop real HTML
and then you're doing some binding into
a JavaScript JavaScript layer behind the
scenes you're using HTML 4 it's
semantics you're using headers using
sections using footers things of that
nature
react came along and decided it was
JavaScript forward so you're actually
generating HTML out of JavaScript well
when you're using these design shops
that's a problem because now you've got
all this HTML that's really pretty
CSS stays the same that's not much of a
problem but now you've got to take all
that HTML and figure out how to fit that
into a JavaScript generated environment
it's much more difficult to do it's not
impossible you can still do it but it is
something to think about as you start to
chase these frameworks around and which
one you're going to do what is your
environment that you have to fit these
frameworks into so that's something to
just to kind of think about the next one
that we come on is is number four and
that's frameworks versus libraries so
again we start to look at this
environment where we have full-on
frameworks that are prescriptive
frameworks angular is a good example of
that
ember if you've ever used ember it's
probably the most prescriptive framework
that's out there today a great framework
but you use it the way they tell you to
use it there's no fudging around about
messing with it you just follow their
way to do things
angular's is gotten better with the
angular versus angularjs the older
version but they're still pretty much
you learn the angular way of doing
things
same thing with react you learn how to
do things in the react way but it isn't
always that way there's there's if you
don't want if you need something that's
to be a little bit more modular or
something that'd be a little bit more
flexible there's another way of doing
things in this library approach so as
you start to look at the ecosystem
that's out there it's just constantly
changing right there's always something
new coming along now whether you want to
go chase that down or you want to stay
on something that is more of a
prescriptive framework that's a choice
that you just got to have to think about
and where your design shop is and where
your development practices are how often
do you have to release new versions and
things of that nature but even on the
back end from your testing frameworks
and scaffolding and things of that
nature
these also change constantly
so when we at Oracle started to look at
a new JavaScript framework we started
about five years ago when angularjs was
in 1.3 I think some around there 1.3 1.2
and we were trying to find a corporate
standard things were changing very
quickly and we saw what was going on as
far as this moving to this client-server
architecture and we said you know we
need to actually come up with some sort
of a corporate standard or we're gonna
be insane trying to maintain all these
apps it was corporate architecture was
being inundated requests to try out new
frameworks and new libraries on a
regular basis so we were tasked was
coming up with this corporate standard
and we so we went out and we looked we
talked to all the corners of Oracle from
hardware to what we call global business
units to the middleware a group to all
these other groups are on the you know
the platform groups Solaris and Linux
things like that we said what are you
doing in the JavaScript space and we
found some we're using backbones some
we're using jQuery some we're using some
other things and we knew immediately
that we were gonna have to be really
flexible and we were gonna have to build
something that was more of a toolkit
versus this prescriptive prescriptive
framework approach and so we started
looking at individual libraries that met
specific needs like if we needed routing
find the best routing library if we
needed lazy loading so resource
management we would go and find the best
library for that and and we just kind of
looked at all these different approaches
and we broke it down into different ways
of looking at those libraries we said
well okay let's first just start out do
we want a framework do we want an
individual library how do we want to do
things like that then we looked at the
modular systems so we knew that we had
to be able to do lazy loading of
resources anytime you have to have a
large-scale application that very first
landing page has to load instantly you
know sub-second if you can do it sub 2
seconds and usually
so we needed to be able to load other
resources as you loaded pages later on
our build systems you know what was the
latest and greatest at the time we
started looking at things grunt was the
big thing
then gulp came along for about six
months and then brunch came along and
replaced gulp six months later it was a
craziest thing you'd ever seen it was
just like every six months something was
changing and the testing frameworks did
the same thing Jasmine was the biggest
and coolest thing for a long time now of
a sudden that's a good disappearing and
being replaced by some other things so
we just kind of broke them down into
individual areas and looked at those
areas and tried to find the best of
breed in those areas in the end we kind
of came down to what are the pros and
cons of both of these the framework
approach is actually pretty simple to
take that on and get up to speed pretty
quickly there's great resources
educational properties out there you can
come up and learn the angular way of
doing something or learn the view a jsy
of doing something really quickly and
it's actually nice it isn't quite as
flexible as the library approach in that
if there's some new thing that comes
along that really is you know really
cool and it is something that will save
you a lot of time everybody's going to
it pretty quickly you have to wait until
that framework picks it up you can't
really you know jump on top of something
new and just pull out a piece and put in
a new you go with the direction they go
and that's fine if it if that's where
your company wants to go now the library
approach can take a little bit longer to
learn some people say it takes less time
because each of these individual
libraries have a full community around
them they have all their documentation
everything else but really using them
together can take a little bit of time
and if you were to try and do this on
your own it would take even more time
because you have to figure out what
libraries work with each other really
cleanly which ones don't not everything
works really good is some things will
step on top of each other in the Oracle
jet side we settled on a few of these
different libraries that you see here so
we chose knockout for just the binding
layer the two-way data-binding that we
did
jquery was just jquery you know
everybody used jquery out there and so
it was it was kind of a thing we threw
in we actually use it very little very
little inside of ourselves but we have a
lot of developers that like to use it
still we started out with jquery UI
because jquery UI was there were UI
widgets everywhere there's thousands of
them out there and when you're building
a brand new toolkit you know we were
adding UI elements constantly but we
didn't have that big full breadth of
everything that we needed and we knew we
wouldn't for a good couple of years
while we kept building but while we were
doing that we had built everything
around a jquery UI widget capabilities
so that anything we didn't have someone
could just go out to the internet and
grab the jquery UI version of it and
drop it in and it would work with yet
automatically so we kind of based
ourselves off of that early on now five
years later we're finding that the web
component specification has now reached
a stage where web components are
supported across pretty much all of the
major browsers at least at large degree
of them and so with jet 4'o that we
released last august we moved everything
over to web components and that's the
direction we're moving forward
everything that we do going forward just
following the web component
specification the html5 web component
spec now we were lucky enough that we
were actually able to just take our
jQuery UI widgets and wrap them as web
components to start with so our entire
breadth of UI elements everything else
they're all still there you just use
them and then over time we're stripping
out the jQuery UI widget part and just
replacing it was straight up HTML and
JavaScript and so forth but the you but
the API or the the Dom elements that
you're creating stay the same your code
wouldn't change at all we'll just change
it behind the scenes on you require j/s
we chose for all the lazy loading now
the biggest thing that everybody looks
at on these things is they go gosh
knockout and requirejs it wasn't like my
grandfather's libraries right there are
two years old and that it's true you
know i mean this is this this whole
thing that comes back to chasing the
shiny object right so we'll talk a
little bit more about
that in a second about the required JSI
din and go into that a little bit more
but the bottom line is we needed to be
modular we needed to be able to come up
with a toolkit that allowed people to
use as little or as much of this thing
as they needed and that fit our need a
little bit needs a little bit more when
we were building things up no matter
what you use modularity is key when
anytime that you're gonna start building
out large-scale applications you have to
be modular it doesn't matter if your
javascript is modular or your CSS or
your HTML it all has to be modular you
should be using something like SAS which
allows you to break up your CSS and into
pre CSS pre-processing so you can have
smaller chunks of CSS that get built
together into a single file you use HTML
templates and things like that for
loading in different segments of HTML so
your other pieces of your team other
engineers and your team can work on
different sections of your app at the
same time and the same thing goes for
JavaScript es6 modules are a good way to
work there's also AMD which is what
require gets us into and things of that
nature but the modularity and the
ability to break down your app into
smaller pieces that multiple team
members can work on at the same time is
really really important now why am i
showing shipping containers when I talk
about modularity well you know K they're
containers they're small things and it's
kind of cool but when I started doing
the research for this talk I one of the
things I found about this was that just
blew my mind was another concept of
modular code is that you're building
chunks of code that are Reshard that are
used by other people in different ways
and the one thing I found in doing open
source and I've been doing an open
source for probably 15 years now about
going out of the Sundays and it's one of
the things that's really cool is you
build something and you share it up on
github or you share it out somewhere and
somebody will take those libraries and
build software that you had no idea what
they were gonna do you know you just it
wasn't what you originally wrote the
code for but all of a sudden it works
right so in this particular case it
turns out that around the world
there is this huge excess excess of
shipping containers apparently they have
a shelf life and you can only use them
for so long to actually ship things and
they are just sitting rusting in yards
all over the world
well architects have started to take
these shipping containers and they've
started building homes out of them
every one of these homes is actually
shipping containers pulled together the
frames of them put together in different
ways now these are really fancy ones and
I'm sure they're really expensive but
they're also building miniature houses
or small houses for university students
or for low-income areas where you've got
people that are living in poverty living
in you know tin shacks or cardboard
shacks you can drop shipping containers
in that have actually got sturdy walls
and you can put you know facilities
inside them with beds and things like
that and you can put these in for people
to live in so it's kind of cool that
something that I'm sure nobody ever
thought about when they were building
shipping containers that they were going
to use be used for housing but it's so
it is a segue I understand that but it's
kind of cool so I put it in there so
back to modularity some of the biggest
things that are that are out there today
require Jas is the grandfather of them
all it's it's been there for a long time
webpack is the new cool kid on the block
that everybody wants to use and then
ECMO Script or es6 is the standard
that's the actual JavaScript standard
and it has its own modularity built into
it as well
when we and then there's browserify
which kind of sat somewhere between
requirejs and webpack before it was just
kind of shoved to the side what we want
to look at in this is that requirejs had
all these cool capabilities of doing
lazy loading it has two different
functionalities it has the ability to
build modules which are reusable
JavaScript chunks called AMD
asynchronous module definition and you
can lazy load those at runtime it also
has the ability what they call rjs which
is to take all these different
JavaScript libraries and compile them
into a single bundled into a single
javascript file and it kind of shrinks
them down into it and in the days of
HTTP 1 dot X it was the whole concept
was try and get a small file as possible
but download as few files as possible
HTTP to kind of changed that because you
can do asynchronous downloads and so
forth and so you can now download
multiple files but that was the whole
premise of getting things packaged down
into small enough files web that came
along and web pack has this really cool
feature called tree shaking which it
does the same thing that our dot jeaious
does on the require side but it actually
analyzes the code and it says hey
there's a bunch of chunks of code in
here that aren't even being used in your
app I'm gonna get rid of those I'm just
gonna drop them out and so now those
bundles that you're creating can
actually get pretty small and it's a
really great feature it also has a
feature of what they call hot swapping
which allows you to kind of do some
different things at runtime as well the
one thing it doesn't do though is it
cannot do lazy loading at runtime they
can't do a synchronous loading at
runtime you have to package everything
up at Build time and you have that one
library that goes down and gets loaded
and then everything gets pulled out of
that library at runtime this became a
problem for us because we have
internationalization built into jet and
we ship with 28 different languages in
196 different locales and we've got all
those different resource files for all
those different languages
and when you use requirejs require.js
has the ability to reach into those
resource files at runtime and lazy load
them when we had people coming to us and
saying hey I want to use webpack instead
or require j/s we said well great but
you can't do all this
internationalization at runtime and
they're like oh no no no yeah we can and
we're like no you can't and they started
looking into it well it turns out you
can't so they would end up having to
bundle every single resource file that
we had for all of our languages and that
nice tiny bundle that you got with the
tree shaking everything suddenly became
8 megabytes and you completely defeated
the purpose of using this great new cool
thing so you have to kind of watch out
for what you're chasing after and again
this goes all the way back to the
resists the hype it is cool and it's got
some really great features but when you
get into enterprise-grade applications
where you've got things like
internationalization you have to make
sure you can still fit into that now
we're doing some work on the on the jet
side to actually write web pack plugins
that will allow it to do that runtime or
loading and so forth and we hope to see
that later this year so that jet will
run with web pack as well now I kind of
hesitated on ECMO script and the reason
for that is that there were there was a
lot of discussion in the es6 working
group when they were building out the
the ACMA script spec with loading in a
having their own module loading system
it was called system Jas and it was
supposed to be asynchronous and allow
you to load things in an asynchronous
way but they weren't able to actually
make it work by the time they wanted to
kick the spec over the wall and actually
produce es6
so what they produced was a module
loader that's synchronous so we've got a
lot of people that are like oh yeah I
need to use you know es6 modules and I'm
just gonna use their system load or
they're like great you're gonna
serialize your entire application so
instead of asynchronous loading where
you can call up all these different rest
endpoints or call these and resources
and everything's coming down at
different times you now serialized your
app and you're just waiting for
everything to come in one after the
other in an enterprise app that's not
going to work
even in small apps it's not going to
work so again brand-new thing really
cool that watch out for the details so
number six is what we call abstractions
and abstractions are where we kind of
take technologies that sometimes people
are new to or sometimes they've been
around a while but people have been used
to something else and they want
something they want to use something
that allows them to use this new cool
thing they don't want to quite go all
the way to there and in this particular
case there's a bunch of these new
libraries out and some of them like sass
and less our CSS they allow you to work
with CSS and in some really cool ways
they allow you instead of having to deal
with you know thousands of lines of code
and just straight CSS they like to break
it up into individual pieces they add
conditional statements into CSS so you
can do some if statements and things
like that you can do gradient generators
and also they're kind of cool stuff in
CSS and it actually is really nice it
allows us to work with really large
applications we also have things like
CoffeeScript or pure script or
typescript and flow which basically took
the JavaScript language and added a
layer above it to supposedly make it
easier to write JavaScript type scripts
the most popular one and typescript for
those of you aren't from how many of you
actually write JavaScript code ok fair
number of how many write Java okay so
the biggest difference between Java and
JavaScript
they are apples and oranges by the way
they are not the same is Java is
strongly typed a string is a string a
number is a number or an int is an int
so forth JavaScript a 2 in quotes equals
2 you know that that works javascript is
loosely typed at best we will in
JavaScript just kind of interprets
things or for whatever it feels it wants
to be and that freaks out Java
developers they can't stand it usually
if you take a Java developer and you
show them JavaScript they just start
screaming when to in quotes
- and it comes out and says true that
should never happen in the world
so typescript comes in and typescript
starts adding in types and types safety
into the JavaScript language so when you
start to actually write typescript
you're actually saying this is a string
this is an int and so forth and then it
trans piles that down to real JavaScript
in the end and that works really well in
Oracle I've got a situation right now
where there's a very large development
group that's all writing their
applications traditionally in a TF
they're all Java developers and they
decided four months ago that they're all
gonna move to jet so I have 10,000
developers coming from Java over to
JavaScript they don't know JavaScript
yeah yeah and and so we're implementing
typescript really really quickly to save
ourselves much as anything else because
I don't have to deal with these poor
guys and try and figure out what it's
what's going on in the end you're just
trying to abstract above so that the
picture is a little bit clearer no
matter what you're trying to do whether
it's trying to get down to that
JavaScript layer you're adding these
abstractions in just simply to try and
get a better view of what's going on for
that developer you want to make it as
easy as possible for those developers to
get their job done and that's what those
abstraction layers really do so my final
step is to take a look at what
corporations are doing out there with
JavaScript today so you've got Microsoft
which actually is investing really
heavily in typescript typescript is
actually Microsoft's they're also doing
a whole bunch of other things with
angular and things of that nature and a
lot in the JavaScript open source space
they created a new coding editor called
vs code Visual Studio code that's free
and easy to use I was actually vs code I
was stupid I was showing earlier some
really cool stuff IBM IBM was the
original founders of dojo and they still
use it in some of their apps but they've
also now moved over to angular in some
cases and they're doing some other
open-source stuff as well Salesforce has
a thing called lightning which is based
on Aurora which is an open source
library that they created and open
source and in their writing all their
stuff on top of that same thing with s
ap s ap has a UI layer called open UI
and they have a design standard called
Fiore which is very much like Google's
material design or Apple's iOS they have
their own design spec Oracle has one
called Alta and Alta UI is our design
spec ing a financial company called ing
produced this thing called spectacular
of all weird crazy names about three
years ago and it was a UI layer based
over the top of angular and it was
basically angularjs unfortunately I mean
it was really cool when they when they
first did it and we were all kind of
like wow really you guys are doing doing
some pretty cool stuff and we started
watching it to see where it was gonna go
well unfortunately it was one of those
throw over the fence to open-source
they've never touched it since it hasn't
been updated in over two years
but it's out there and it's kind of cool
PayPal PayPal has this open source
project called Kraken now it's all in
the server side and it does some really
cool stuff with authentication it uses
Express and it's extended some stuff for
for doing micro service payments and
things like that and it's really worth
looking at if you're doing some back-end
stuff and then of course Oracle open
sourced Oracle jet which you've probably
seen in in some of your sessions it
probably got called out and that you
they were using jet they did a lot of
the other ones you probably had no idea
so how many of you saw sessions today
that used developer cloud service or
mobile cloud service IOT service
bi visual analyzer if you saw some big
cool VI charts and select that all of
those written in jet visual builder
cloud service was one that was shown
earlier just before this one that's
actually written in jet and it actually
builds jet based apps so it's its own
IDE that we've built and so I'm gonna
show you a little bit about jet and I
don't want to make it a product pitch
that's not what Oracle code is about but
I do want to attack you tell you a
little bit about what we've done
so as we talked about Jets of toolkit so
it's not a prescriptive framework we
actually went the library route we
actually chose the individual libraries
for to meet specific tasks and when we
put all that together we came up with
the libraries that we were talking about
earlier we also added web components and
we started doing things in web component
specifications we use Cordova for all of
our mobile capabilities it's modular so
you can use as little or as much as you
need we produce basic UI interfaces as
you would expect buttons input fields
all that kind of fun stuff but you also
produce some pretty sophisticated data
visualization stuff I had I pretty much
would guarantee that as far as open
source products out there this is the
most advanced data visualization set now
d3 is a visualization library in the
open source world and it's really cool
but you have to go build your data
visualizations using d3 these things are
already put together these also meet all
of the accessibility guidelines that you
will have to meet for 500 500 500 8c3
and anything that you have to meet
within the wick hag the web content
accessibility guidelines so if you're
dealing anything in the public sector
any governments 27 different countries
and regions au Australia u.s. all these
different ones all require you to meet
those accessibility guidelines all of
Jetts UI components meet those
accessibility guidelines out-of-the-box
and these are just a few of some of the
dashboards that different products have
put together oracle management cloud is
also using completely written in jet
oracle commerce clouds written in jet so
quite a few of the different ones this
is management cloud there another one
with management cloud visual analyzer
make sure which one this one is that's
apex there you go sorry that's apex and
so the accessibility that's built in
actually brings a lot to your own
applications we take accessibility so
strong in Oracle that we actually took
the documentation for all
the touch and the gestures and the
keyboard interactions and we split that
out into a separate documentation book
so that if you build an application
using jet you can take that
accessibility book and include it with
your own product documentation and get
closer to meeting those accessibility
guidelines as well
I mentioned 28 languages 196 locales now
and we're mobile ready so every single
component has touch and gesture all
built into it
we provide native themes for iOS Android
and Windows 10 we don't do Windows
Mobile we do Windows 10 and so things
like you know drawers are off off canvas
type situations or pull-to-refresh these
are all built in and and so when you and
we do them in a very intelligent way so
pull-to-refresh is simply a region that
when you pull to refresh it fires a
callback method you to go decide what
you're going to do when you're pulling
to refresh we don't so we just pass back
a callback method and you can go do
whatever you want and it's simply on a
region so you can you can set pull to
refresh on the div or on some other
thing that you want it to do we have us
swipe to reveal again set up with
callback so you just use swipe at one
way or swipe at the other and you decide
what it's going to do we have sticky
headers so in our list views you can
scroll things up and it'll actually
stick the headers on it we have indexers
which are actually separate controls you
can attach an indexer to a hierarchical
data source and we'll index it for you
so you can add those things in and of
course lazy lazy loading so laze load on
scroll so as you scroll up it'll just
load more on scroll and of course all of
these are themed for the native os's so
if you're you're seeing that little
spinner that's showing up if you're on
iOS it would be an iOS spinner if you're
on Android it'll be an Android spinner
and so forth so all those are natively
themed
we've got routing built into it but
we've also got animations and the
ability to determine which way you're
going on your animation so as you're
drilling into things you can actually
set a flag saying I'm going down or I'm
coming up and the animations can reverse
automatically so also on the languages I
didn't point out but the languages we
also support right-to-left languages so
Hebrew Arabic and if you change the der
the dir attribute on on the document we
automatically reverse everything so
you'll notice when you start looking at
the cookbook or you start looking at the
code everything that we do is start and
end we don't do left and right because
everything can reverse start becomes the
right when you're in an RTL language not
left but you said everything you set the
icon is the start icon in your buttons
or in a menu you want the start icon to
be this and the end icon to be that when
you go into RTL will just reverse
everything for you and it's all done
automatically inside the product you
don't have to change anything it's all
open source believe it or not I know
that's a complete oxymoron Oracle an
open source
he doesn't even roll off the tongue very
well does it he does he does he really
does where we open source under what we
call the UPL license which is universal
permissive license and it's it's one
step above MIT it's it's just short of
basically public domain you can do
anything you want with this I had a five
email exchange with a poor customer that
was like is it open source yeah it's
open source you can do anything you want
with it yeah okay that's fine but
where's what else is where's the other
license and I'm like no that license
it's just a paragraph you know and he's
like no but it's Oracle there's got to
be more to this than that license and we
went back and forth five times before he
finally was like okay I'll go look at it
yeah yeah what's the catch right so you
can learn more about Oracle jet by just
going to Oracle jet org that'll take you
to our website
or follow us on twitter at oracle jet
that's where that's our main social feed
that's where we do all of our
announcements and everything else we
have this really cool training course
called a MOOC I had never heard of a
MOOC until I was asked to write one
it's called massive open online course
if you've ever taken a udemy course or
you've taken something that nature those
are MOOCs believe it or not those that
do online training that's supposedly
it's one of these hidden words that they
do but we we produce a three-week free
open course that it's designed for
professional you know people but it's an
introductory course it takes about an
hour a day you get little YouTube videos
that are like the longest video is eight
minutes they're usually around five or
six minutes you watch that video it
introduces a concept there's some
homework that you go do and you take
about an hour a day there's three weeks
of it at the end of each week there's a
quiz pass each of those quizzes at 70%
or higher and you get a certificate yeah
this year the certificates are like real
you can actually they're the type of
certificate you can add to your LinkedIn
profile they under your searches
certifications on LinkedIn there's last
year it was a piece of paper with mine
and geureon signature on it it wasn't as
cool sorry but you can get to that by
just going
oracle.com / go to / jet really easy
oracle calm such go to / jet and it'll
take you to that training and you can
register it just started yesterday you
can it's a self-paced so you can just
take it as long as you want we're gonna
have it open for probably a month plus
so that's it from me any questions about
jet or any other I mean even angular or
react or anything else within this
enterprise space I've pretty much
studied them all I think Jets probably
the best but I'll let you guys decide
but any questions
yes it is we actually provide sass SCSS
themes for SES s source files for our
entire theme including the iOS Android
and Windows themes so we actually have a
thing called theme builder that allows
you to go in and follow instructions and
we've got a in the command-line tooling
for jet you can actually edit the s CSS
and it has a watcher built into it it'll
auto compile it and give you your new
theme so if you again going just to
oracle org and when the site comes up go
to learn and there's the training right
here here's the hands-on lab which is an
open source project on get you could
github you can go and do this hands-on
lab as well and down here is theme
builder and theme builder is is kind of
cool i know we're at the top of the hour
whoever's coming into next they can come
on in
but it gives you instructions on how to
do sass and how did how to work with all
the theme doors is something that so yes
you can very easy all right well thank
you very much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
