cosmic crew cosmic cosmic cart they are
the crew from cosmic cart so target and
cosmic cart entered into a strategic
partnership about a year or so ago
cosmic cart enables retailers like
Target to do commerce anywhere anytime
alex is going to tell us a bit more
about that later and then matt is going
to tell us a bit about the architecture
how they've been scaling up over the
last year for both the technology
perspective as well as from a team
perspective first though I'm going to
talk a little bit about target some
changes some changes within target also
I'll talk a bit about our API in our API
program and then hand it over to Alex so
I'm guessing or I hope that most folks
in the audience here are familiar with
target it's pretty recognized brand one
of the largest retailers within the u.s.
we have more than 1,900 stores in the US
and canada and have been around for
about 50 years were based in beautiful
minneapolis minnesota a little known
fact we're also the lut known is a land
of 10,000 lakes and the hometown of
Prince I'm also guessing that when you
think about target you don't think about
a company that's focused on technology
let alone Java but we have a tremendous
shift happening within target you know
we have been we are a big Enterprise IT
shop and we haven't had a reputation as
a technology company and honestly we
really haven't been this is changing
Donuts changing really fast we are we're
a Java shop open source is becoming part
of our DNA we've built some really
incredibly strong software engineering
teams particularly in our comm and
digital spaces as well as our API team
we're pretty active in our local tech
community we sponsored various events
committee apolis DevOps days the great
us great conf we have a local meetup
that we sponsor as well called the
software Skyway symposium maybe another
little-known fact about minneapolis we
have a lot of skyways so we don't have
to go outside in january let's see we
also just this past weekend hosted a
24-hour hackathon at the University of
Minnesota that is a lot of fun we opened
a handful of our api's there as well for
the students to build apps on so we are
we are a software development company
were incubating cool startups and we're
changing how we're doing technology so
I'm going to talk a bit about our API
program and what we've been doing on
that side to help drive some of this
change across target so I mentioned
targets been around for 50 years and you
can probably imagine in those 50 years
we've added a lot of technology over the
years we have thousands of applications
within our environment that our business
teams use to run our stores POS the back
rooms in the in the stores our
distribution centers our merchandising
systems com site mobile apps right you
get it takes a lot of technology to run
a modern retailing company over the
years is we've added additional
technology additional applications we've
built a lot of complexity into our
environment and as well we have a lot of
debt in the environment a lot of those
applications because of that complexity
are actually on like quarterly release
cycles they're really hard to work with
and that's not cool right like we can't
it's really hard it's really hard to
introduce new change create new
experiences when you're running in those
kinds of those types of change cycles
and retail right commerce in general has
changed dramatically in the past decade
so our expectations as consumers is that
we can have easy shopping experiences
like the ones cosmic carts helping to
enable and so at target we knew we
needed to change our approach to
technology and so what we did so a few
years ago we started aggressively
building out an api platform and api's
restful api is on a mostly java-based
stack to expose targets core
capabilities in cord cord data so you
can imagine api's would be important for
us in the retail space or things like
our products locations price promotions
and of course carts we've been using
these to make our internal development
easier and also to create experiences
with partners like cosmic cart the rate
of adoption of these api is just over
the last year from the same time last
year's up more than three hundred and
fifty percent which is pretty astounding
so a few interesting things about our
stack so api's are just web apps we
decided to build them using Grails some
considerations that we took into account
as we're making this decision was
Minneapolis has a has a lot of really
great grooving grails talent I mentioned
the u.s. great conf is hosted in
Minneapolis the framework made it really
easy for us to write our API is and to
do it with less code also target has a
really large woz footprint so we took
advantage of that initially until we
shifted until we shifted to embedded
Tomcat another important consideration
for us was testing so Spock has been
awesome for us functionally spec test
our AP is and Jay meters allows for kind
of clever scalable ways for us to easily
spin up in the cloud run and teardown
there's a great post out on our target
tech blog by written by aaron stri who I
work closely with and it's about how we
performance test our AP is as we get
ready for peak season so peak season for
us is Thanksgiving kind of thanksgiving
black friday and then through the
holiday season the types of volumes that
we see over that time volumes of our
api's jump up about ten times what they
are during normal course of the year so
we're doing a lot of work actively right
now as well to get ready for that you
can find that tech blog at target github
i oh so i mentioned that we have a lot
of legacy technologies at target we have
actually a lot of our core systems are
still on the mainframe so you can
imagine that means we have a lot of
complex integrations that we need to do
camel turned out to work really well for
us is what we used to do these
integrations took us some practice but
actually but it's been pretty powerful
one thing we really liked about it is
that it's it's code and it's testable
it's not a GUI so I don't know if anyone
hears in an enterprise IT shop but
there's a tendency and enterprise IT
shops to use kind of drag and drop
integration tools so this was a
deviation from how we typically do
integration within target
and a number of teams have started to
adopt this as well so kind of similarly
another way that we drove some change in
terms of different technologies that
we're using within target we use
cassandra is our data platform for our
api's this was the first implementation
of a distributed no sequel data store at
target a lot of the providing systems
right so I mentioned some of our legacy
systems that are so on the mainframe
they're slow they can't scale and
actually we had quite a bit we had some
data as well that wasn't even sitting in
a database so cassandra has worked
really well providing the scale and
distribution that we needed for our
api's we've also found that it's pretty
easy to automate we recently open
sourced a chef cookbook that we use to
automate our deployments and again you
could check that out on our target tech
blog Danny Parker who's on the team
wrote that it's a did a really nice job
writing it up and I know that Chef is in
Ruby and you guys probably don't like
that but it's been working really well
for us with we think is great let's see
so a couple examples for some change
staff and the tech side within the API
team also our team was one of the first
two one of the first to embrace DevOps
culture full stack ownership continuous
integration continuous delivery it's
been really essential to the success of
our team and our ability to move really
quickly and build the kind of scale that
we needed with our api's we've seen this
kind of be broadly adopted across target
one kind of sign of success that I'm
really proud of as we have we host
internal dev ops days we have our third
one coming up on Thursday this week I
think our first one we have maybe a
hundred or so people there which sounds
like a lot but in an organization RIT
shop measures in the thousands of people
and so have it so hundred people at the
first event and this time we're trending
closer to three or four hundred for the
third event so I'm really excited about
that maybe also worth mentioning the
tool chain that we use we use get
Jenkins artifactory i mentioned chef
OpenStack as well and those are
increasingly being adopted across the
enterprise to
all right back to the api's so I
mentioned the tremendous increase in
adoption of these AP is so they've
enabled a number of a number of great
guest experiences so a few that I'd call
out so of course our mobile app is using
the api's capabilities on our comm site
as well including buy online pick up in
store same day delivery rush delivery
that's available in some markets not all
but it's continuing to roll out as well
as we have a new gift registry solution
that's being rolled out across the
stores so replacing the older kiosk
kiosks that are in the stores with iPads
as well as let's see are we have a we
have a number of teams focused on
creating and kind of piloting new
experiences one of them being the rad
team the rapid application development
team actually worked really closely with
the cosmic cart guys you're so ago
they're a couple of experiences they've
created was were this one actually is
really close to my heart and I wish I
would have had it this year back to
school experience where you can select
the school that your kids going to the
grade the teacher and then a target team
member in the store will pick you know
those 50 different items or whatever it
is you have to show up to the you know
day one school with and then you can
just pick them up at the store so a
number of really great internal
experiences that have been created as a
result of the api's also with different
strategic partners we've seen some we've
had some really great successes there as
well so ebay uses api for for inventory
checks basically in the marketplace in
pinterest our api is used to enable rich
pins so you can see on a particular item
how much it cost if it's available
inventory etc also with curl ate earlier
this summer they launched using
correlate a new app and i knew i was
going to forget the name of it i called
like to buy and then also a cosmic card
as well and so alex is going to tell us
a bit well you
going to tell us a lot about cosmic art
and what they're doing thank you my name
is Alex Adelman I'm the CEO of cosmic
court so we started this venture about
three years ago with this idea that when
I see something that I want wherever I
am it was just frustrating to me that I
couldn't buy it and I know that's first
world problems but the actuality is that
that friction in between me wanting to
seeing something and wanting to buy it
was these lost sales for retailers so we
kind of sought out to solve this this
big problem and we ultimately created
cosmic cart the middleware solution
between content and commerce so we have
publishers on one end that are looking
to monetize their media and publishers
you know that could be app applications
digital publishers like Conde Nast
Hearst that have digital magazines that
they're looking to monetize advertising
isn't as effective as people thought it
was when it switched from traditional to
digital and so we thought not only was
this great for retailers because they
could interact with her in consumer at
the peak of their interest and catch
them at that moment of inspiration but
also publishers could monetize their
content so I was came up with this idea
three years ago and started figuring out
ways how do we build this we ended up
going through five CTOs everyone was
kind of scared of this idea didn't think
it was going to work Matt and I were so
we're from North Carolina and since
Heather shared a fun fact about
minneapolis I'll share a fun fact about
North Carolina mort we have more pigs
than people so fun factory ought to take
home it's true so Matt and I were
probably one of the only two people in
North Carolina on google+ and so we
became friends on there I saw an angel
list that he was looking for funding we
were looking for funding and he
ultimately liked our idea better and was
just we started building this thing Matt
started building this thing and I
started going and selling this idea in
one of our first conferences we ended up
signing up 76
fans that were like we want this thing
we if you build it will will join the
platform so we knew that there was a fit
and we kept going so yeah so we you know
going back to actually you know the
original problem you have somebody that
you know wants to they see something
that they want to buy online and they
currently have to go to all these
different sites to make the purchase and
everyone's kind of everyone's done that
before you fill out form after form
after form and it's a terrible
experience to buy that in product so
with that friction it ultimately leads
to a seventy-four percent shopping cart
abandonment rate and in the affiliate
world it only converts once you actually
gone to that page add it into your car
you're still only converting at one
percent so huge problems there we look
to you know what what people were doing
right and how could we solve it we saw
that amazon has the lowest shopping cart
abandonment rate and we started like why
why do they have a lot of shopping cart
abandoned rate at the end of the day
they still have forms they still have
you know the the shopping experience is
not all that different from every other
retailer what we came to find was that
it wasn't they were you know almost
considered the universal shopping cart
they are considered you know the
universal shopping cart and the reason
why they had the lowest shopping cart up
in it rate is not so much the user
experience but more so the fact that you
go back three weeks later you see those
pair of jeans that you added from three
weeks ago and you say oh I still want
those and you add in you buy it so well
we saw that users were only spending
five percent of their time actively
shopping online we thought we started to
explore what what else were they doing
online and if we could almost if amazon
owns this five percent how can we give
retail other retailers the tools to
compete with Amazon and that's the
question everyone is mine if you're in
retail it's everyone against amazon and
so we built cosmic cart to kind of to
help retailers compete against amazon
and do that quickly to reach the
consumer at that moment of inspiration
where they see something want before
they even go to amazon to search it so
what we found was that people were
spending 60
their time combined online shopping on
multi media sites reading content also
sharing that content on social media
sites social networking sites so if we
could build a multi-platform multiple
multi-device platform we like to call it
the evernote of your shop for your
shopping cart and if you see something
on a blog you want you add into your
shopping cart if you you're on your
mobile phone you're in your favorite app
and you see something you like you add
it to your shopping cart all those
moments you're adding things in your
shopping cart and every single time you
add something into your cart you're then
reminded of those items so that same
experience we talked about that makes
amazon so powerful in converting high on
sales so Matt and Matt actually built
it's a ninety percent of this uh himself
and in Java and we started to look for
you we built these core technology and
we started to look for the right
strategic partner that we could work
with and so we were talking with just
about everybody and target came to us at
it almost absolute perfect time they had
several things that that were really
attractive to us is our first major
strategic partner they had the tools to
move fast they had built out all these
api's they were ready for somebody to
test them we were looking to integrate
via api's we identified early on that
there were three ways to build what we
were doing you could one do what we call
a concierge service where somebody
places an order on a site it then goes
to essentially a field of of people that
are literally typing in your credit card
information to buy the items from these
retailers and that that just does not
work it's too expensive it doesn't scale
and we've seen several startups over the
last 10 years fail with that method
advertising as being the universal
shopping cart the second method is
credit card injection a lot of people
trying to do that now they get cease and
desist letters because they ultimately
try to not work with the retailer and so
we we're the only ones that decided we
want to work with retailers retailers
are ready for this technology they want
and they know the the power of
connecting with somebody at that moment
that they want something mobile just
amplified this whole problem even more
because of the limited screen size and
so we thought the timing was right we're
going to go and we're going to build
this we just need to find the right
partner target had all the api's that
that we needed and they wanted to
innovate they wanted to create something
great so we just we within a week we
figured out we wanted to work together
and we were able to get something up and
going in a few weeks and it was just
incredible integration yeah we work
directly with the red team product team
and they they were able to move I guess
like a start-up as big as they are so is
great so Jeff Jones their CMO another
reason why it was a really strong fit
was because their marketing team early
on about three years ago actually
started really talking about content
marketing and looking at retail as not
not just selling products it's also
providing this experience and telling
you know sharing content with the world
even though they're you know building
you at the end of the day a retailer so
they started making all this content and
they still were a retailer and yet
there's this disconnect between these
two entities so cosmic cart fit
perfectly at the very beginning as a
white labeled solution for targets
properties it took us a few minutes to
skin our our technology create a white
label and what it then did for the rapid
development team is they could continue
to rapidly iterate build sites you in
some examples they build a site in three
weeks and if they were to go to target
com mainframe and actually add commerce
on to that site it would probably take a
year to a year and a half we were able
and in some cases they could drop in a
line of code and in five minutes they
could activate a site with full commerce
so you can see how that would both save
them money and then also convert higher
because they're offering a commerce
experience on their content sites
another great example is target style
they took a sin
full tumblr blog again you can set a
tumbler up in five minutes everyone's
done it and they were able to do a
target style blog enable cosmic cart and
add true ecommerce to the their content
experience so now i'm going to hand it
over probably a what you all came to
hear that how we did it talking about
how we built this company in java this
is matt center cosmic cart CTO thank you
yes so like Alex said I'll talk about
how we did a little bit of why we did it
in Java pretty sure everybody here has a
good understanding or strong opinion as
to why job is good for the enterprise so
I probably don't need to talk too much
about what makes Java good I guess what
i'll talk about mostly is what makes
Java good for a startup as in our in our
situation a startup that just has a very
small team that is rammed into this
giant retail store named target so we
had to move quickly on everything and
you know fortunately like Alex said they
had their own essential internal startup
team to work with but so I've got a few
that stop me if I pontificate too much
but I just wanted to go through a few
philosophical points on on startups and
choosing Java trust what you know this
is kind of this goes to this is actually
a double-edged sword I guess is what I'm
trying to say if you know Ruby for
example you might join startup that
starting something with Ruby on Rails
and that's great that's fine but in fact
we had actually started Alex said there
were a number of people that came before
me with the cosmic our team they were
going to start on Ruby on Rails and I
was like okay well that's fine I wasn't
super excited about it but I mean it
really is based on the fact that a new
job I new Java since 1999 I made a
number of production deployment
successfully in Java and I've also
failed miserably at many
anymore so I know what to do and what
not to do with Java as I'm sure many of
you have done as well so yeah I think
some of the criticisms that Java gets
for startups have to do with those
ramped up times of onboarding people on
deploying etc etc but I think in the end
if you can find a good core team that
knows java you're going to do you're
going to make a better platform you're
going to make a better architecture and
leads me to my next slightest that's
what i call a segway and to build it
right the first time obviously you're
not going to do that you're never going
to build it right the first time but you
can try as best you can and something we
ran into along the way which was pretty
interesting and validating for us even
we'd chosen java already at this point
but we talked to a few successful
startups that had started in Ruby on
Rails I'm really I'm not picking on Ruby
I it's fine it just this did just this
happened a number of times they would
start with Ruby on Rails and then end up
switching the job of it in some cases
having to raise an entire round of
funding to rewrite in Java so that they
could scale so it's built it right the
first time I guess our idea was be
prepared for the worst you know expect
the best be prepared for the worst and
try to make a good foundation so that
you know if things do start going south
you can you can adjust and not have
really expensive losses from from
choosing drone technology and like I
said it's not it's not the wrong
technology it's just and you were
picking on Ruby too aren't you oh we're
not we're not read your bashes yeah it's
fine it's fine it also feel free like
and there's so few people in here we can
just if you just want to like ask
questions as I'm going and we can just
have a conversation that's totally fine
with me it's far more comfortable for me
than then talking at you if we can
actually converse so if you have
something you want to say or whatever
just raise your hand we'll talk so that
leads me to spring I'm kind of a spring
fanboy and obviously the concepts of
spring and
the things you can execute with spring
they're not they're not isolated to Java
you can do these things with with other
languages and you can do these things
with other frameworks with in Java as
well and going back to what you know
knowing what you know if you can deploy
something in spring and you're
comfortable in spring then you've got
rapid development um you know that's
what you see with other languages
they're like oh this is for a truly
rapid development language you're not
gonna use something like Java because
there's a lot more typing involved but
in the end it really is just typing so
you know if you know your framework you
can you can build a good foundation
quickly and get your get your
application out there and I want to
transition now it's into kind of how we
did this with spring these are my pretty
diagrams and my designer left me a note
at the top that says I don't do charge
pretty very good but I thought I did
well I did mine in keno he transferred
it to powerpoint I think that's what
messed it up but it was so beautiful
before so we start with a web app we've
got you know traditional web browser and
in our case we've got a shopping cart
widget and like Alex said it's it's
literally one line of code that a
publisher can embed in their site and
then they instantly have e-commerce
they've got access to all of targets
inventory and everything so that was
that was one of our design goals and so
we're talking to a spring MVC web server
and then also at that same tier
obviously we can expose our API using
spring MVC and we're exposing that to
our mobile app or mobile sdk that kind
of thing but by the way is anybody here
you Swift yet I'm just curious it seemed
a done anything with Swift investigate
us a little but what do you think of it
so far yeah so I specifically wanted to
know what your opinion on like the
annotated the way they're doing you can
either use type inference or you can
annotate with your types I mean okay
gotcha it's just one of these I've
always liked about Java myself is the
fact that when you look at your code you
know exactly what your types are it's
like you know string this int that
whatever but anyway I digress so yeah
we've got the API we've exposed with
sprint with spring MVC to mobile apps n
our SDK for mobile and then we sprinkle
this little spring hate EOS or hay dios
or a hot guy last is however you want to
say it for discoverability and then from
there that they obviously have to talk
to something in order to get anything
done so you've got your service layer
and this is where in our world this is
this is where your cart lives so
anywhere you are you've got the brain
back there that is keeping your cart
state and enabling that shop ability
wherever you go and allowing you to
access that same cart across multiple
platforms via web via mobile etc so
within that service layer you're going
to have to talk to something else we're
going to have a data tier and we're
going to enable that with spring data
it's a no sequel or no sequel database
in our relational database I can even
read these into tiny but I think we have
spring integrations next going off to
things like smtp HipChat other kinds of
notifications different things like that
smtp servers they were using camel
another valid alternative a similar
technology for enterprise application
integration that kind of thing also it's
also one of the things I think makes job
a really good choice because a lot of
times Java programmers come with
knowledge of those types of patterns as
integration patterns things like that
that you might not find in other areas
so from from there we've got I can't
read that pretty nice thank you so
spring batch goes along well with our
integration and the data tier then we've
got to spring amqp to talk to rabbitmq
to talk to everything else and then we
can integrate pretty much anything else
you want to integrate in there with
spring integration and then finally we
use rest template to talk two targets
API and this is a part where this is
part where things really tend to gel and
an AP eyes are so
they're so popular right now I tried to
get an API session this morning and it
was it was wait-listed and then totally
closed so I think all of them this week
if if you haven't already pre-registered
form the API sessions they're all just
packed I think that's there's a good
reason for that you know more more
companies are exposing their api's but
get getting this direct channel and this
official company buy-in to come in and
and work with their data I think it's a
huge privilege honestly and to to be
able to use that that contract between
your your client and their server
there's there's something to be said for
that again it's not specifically
restricted to Java but it's just I don't
know I personally I think it's a really
great it makes for a better integration
to be able to do that and then obviously
the other e-commerce platforms that we
connect to as well not just target which
actually gives us that universality
across retailers last piece would be
adding your app in to our API so the one
thing that we want to do where target
has given us access to their api we want
to take that one step out to give you
the ability to put to plug your app into
our api and give you access to all of
our retailers so you you know if you if
you're making a web app or you're a
publisher like i said one script tag and
you've got everything integrated already
in in the land of mobile dropping our
sdk in place and hopefully if all goes
well using a using a framework to
quickly determine stock levels add to
cart use common controller components to
do the check out and do very little
coding and just worry about monetizing
your app in a very quick and efficient
manner
okay all right um well and there's
probably should be a dotted line maybe
from web browser to API as well just
there are more things that are our
destination web widget I guess would
have to do that we're not we're not
doing strictly through a restful api so
your standard like web flow type stuff
asian of service but with all rushes and
everything we get to enhance the ad is
because the fact that we enhance the web
when browser abortion and so the
commitment
so we realize on long-term that you are
reducing equality of our AP is
right and I'm going to repeat what he
said because they wanted me to repeat
every question so they can have it
recorded basically what he was saying
was that the in not having the web
browser always used the API he was
reducing quality or he he felt like they
were reducing quality in their API
because his situation almost dogfooding
it right of yeah you're building the API
weren't using it for everything right
yeah it totally valid and it honestly is
probably something we're going to keep
working toward it's just in the way
startups progressed a lot of times
you're you have a business case that you
have to tackle first and you may not
have in our case we did not have an API
from right from the start we started
with a traditional web server approach
spring-mvc just creating that web widget
mobile came a little later so we needed
the API and we are in the process of
moving a lot of the web server endpoints
to the API and then using the API for
everything but yet I mean and then all
the business logic obviously and I'm
sure in your case as well was back there
that service layers so these are just
service entry points into that that same
business logic but
the website change the technology on the
web facing we're going with no with
separate teams working on that that
require the EPI to deliver it so it's
done not the same thing t building the
service layer in the spring MVC so there
are suppliers of API stood that
guarantees us right so you see you
dedicated a team to specifically
building out those API contracts so that
a separate team yes so you make one team
responsible for exposing the business
logic via AP is and then you have your
front-end team actually calling yeah
it's a great idea looks inside you're
going to say something yeah we use a
virtual inventory so yeah I mean as you
might expect in the in the land of
traditional affiliate you've got giant
product feeds that come from all
different retailers over to generate
affiliate links same kind of idea except
that we're actually amassing a giant
virtual inventory that's a lot more rich
than you could get from something like
an affiliate feed and then you know
being invited into these api's and using
the official channels for it is a really
great way of making sure that you always
got the most up-to-date information from
those things because a lot of old tool
affiliate feeds they may not even be
generated like oh you know every instant
of the day I'm not every instant would
be that would be a quite the chore to be
able to instantaneously export an entire
database from every giant retailer but
yeah I mean we can do it much more
frequently as what I'm saying yes the
service layer is not a jar
the web server yeah it's a set of web
services and I think so in our case
we're using HTTP invoker Springs HTTP
invoker to just treat it as a regular
service call was the web server call the
service layer yeah that was his question
exactly that was this question yeah he
was asking for the recording why we
weren't calling where the web server
wasn't calling the API but yeah that's
yeah that's what he was saying great um
any other questions about this and then
back yet go ahead it was fine yeah it's
great spring data scalability on
directly yeah we tried the ears a
collection yes so what he was asking is
if if supreme data for Mongo is scaling
like we had hoped i can say that we do
use a lot of manga template directly we
do we still have some repository
interfaces for simplicity's sake some
finders things like that but yeah a lot
of times there's there's a strange I
guess disconnect between spring data
Mongo in the spirit of mongo I guess you
could say but yeah the same same story
yeah almost identical story to what
you're saying sure yeah yeah it's fine
that's great yeah relational they were
yet transactions are all in the
relational database yet not even
attempted in Hmong right what's up
correct yeah so yeah ninety percent of
you know all the social interactions the
cart generation everything like that
it's it's all you know yet that's in the
the no sequel side and then once you
want to actually do you know your
commerce obviously we switch over to the
relational side oh yeah
surprised not to see mention of security
on this document so where do you feel
like most of your security
yes I mean as far as like the
authentication authorization we're using
spring security yeah I did admit that
sorry about that but so we use that at
the web tier we use that the service
layer we use it every step of the way
i'm a big proponent of spring security
like i said i'm a bit of a spring fanboy
i look for any library they have that
works i think there's some of the
smartest people on the planet i would
probably follow follow them off a cliff
and into oblivion but um yeah so we're
using spring security for for all of our
security issues and then for the API
obviously things like spring security
OAuth for securing the API and only got
one more thing to add to this is this is
how I simplify things for Alex when we
want to scale I just say okay let's
let's let's scale so it's scaled we
double everything our scaled that's
that's just how easy it is with Java you
just add more stuff to it and everything
continues to talk to each other and yeah
two weeks yeah and then when it when
it's not so easy I tell them two weeks
and then lately it's been three weeks
it's three weeks until any feature is
ready so the last little section I've
got here is about attracting the right
team and we talked a little bit about
finding Java developers which we're
actually actively trying to do right now
but so you know there is a smaller I
think java developer pool out there
again one of the criticisms of Java
because it's hard to find good talent
but you know I actually think that's a
great problem to have if it's harder to
find a really good programmer okay
that's great that just means we have to
compete to to bring you on it also means
everybody's employed which makes me
happy so I was at Dragon Con last month
and so I've still got space cowboy on
the brain has anybody seen firefly
please tell me you've seen firefly yes
okay great oh thank you good so I just
thought I was thinking about my team and
the whole I guess analogy of being a
small team and working with a giant
force like Target and it just there were
a lot of analogies I drew between that
and the Firefly crew so this is the
unofficial Firefly guide forming the
perfect startup team AKA choosing your
big damn heroes
so we'll start with Malcolm Reynolds he
makes executive decisions he's eager to
disrupt the system he finds investment
from others eager to disrupt the system
and he thinks he runs the ship and
that's that would be our CEO and some of
these personality traits actually spend
multiple multiple people on a small team
which makes well especially like thinks
he runs the ship i think everybody
probably thinks that on the team so
these are not necessarily one-to-one
analogies but wash he's the pilot of
firefly if you haven't seen it he steers
the ship he has a big picture view of
both goals and planning he's pragmatic
and rule oriented he's indispensable
asset that is likely taken for granted
until he's gone and that's the CTO
obviously then we've got Shepherd book
whose philosophical and perhaps eclectic
is concerned about proper interactions
has alternate views from pretty much
everyone else it was ultimately just a
hipster and that's our creative director
Pierson who did all these really
wonderful slides he's really good at
what he does and I like to pick on them
about it that that's actually coincident
of those first three slides were the
first three founders so if you want to
start a start-up you need talker drawler
typer so then we've got Zoey she drives
new business she's an enforcer for old
business doesn't take no for an answer
and she's mouths right handling missions
and that's our VP of biz dev and who we
just recently hired on has started
bringing us more than we can handle
which is why we're trying to expand our
team and then we've got Simon he's
highly trained performs miracles with
limited resources he's experienced
working inside the system he aims to
disrupt and he bridges the gap between
insiders and outsiders and that would be
our architect which I guess was a role I
filled for most of the time then now
we've got actually two other developers
working with us and we all kind of share
that responsibility Kaylee she's a
natural-born problem solver she's a ten
axor she'll work until the issues
resolved without a break and she's
probably too trusting to leave along
with the sharks and that's just that's
your engineer that's your that's your
hardcore engineer I think both on our
null are the two developers fit that
personality to it
along with being architects we've got
River who's a secret weapon skills stand
up two armies of people she doesn't talk
much because few understand her and she
pretty much keeps everyone and the
mission alive and that that's our devops
engineer and right now just it's kind of
funny because our devops engineer is the
only language he speaks as doctor doctor
doctor doctor doctor doctor so that's
I'm glad I it's a little above my head
but you know I'll just let him do it and
and turn everything into somehow doctor
thing yes long as it works within two
weeks maybe three and then we've got a
Nara she's experienced with formal
business processes meticulous she holds
the team to a higher standard and lets
you know if you've done something wrong
and that is the QA engineer I think
everybody has to have QA engineer on her
team in order to be quality Jane works
for money moonlights elsewhere or does
he moonlight with us we don't know the
big gun for Special Operations needs of
course the contractor you need in the
most dire situations you always want to
have them on your side but make sure you
pay him enough for real he'll turn on
you take all your secrets away but hope
you enjoyed that that's that's all we've
got as far as a slides go and we've had
a little bit of discussion we can
actually do we have some time if you
want to do a quick demo of your demo
works you can see it works sure yeah
sure so so these questions about PCI
compliance is a huge issue I mean it's
if you're going to do the Commerce you
have to have PCI compliance on the brain
I mean if you don't you just you can't
go anywhere and there's a lot of levels
to that you could educate yourself into
insanity on all the different rules at
everything i can't i can't speak in
specifics because that's part of our
secret sauce but our strategy is to stay
out of that as much as possible and
enable direct payments between the
consumer and the retailer and yeah
that's basically it is try to stay out
of it let somebody else handle it
absolutely yeah and a lot of time I mean
being such a big issue a lot of times
you like you said you have to just throw
a ton of money at it because you've
gotta you know you got to get certified
you got to have you got a store credit
cards in proper way if you're going to
sort credit cards etcetera etcetera so
right we want to be where the were the
middleware without being the man in the
middle is kind of what we want to be I
think we need to switch the display or
at least move this over or something if
you want to see let's go spinning on me
but yeah we try to stay what innovate
with like five things at a time well yes
before four okay now it's about only for
innovations at a time yeah we're we're
not a famous company where yeah did you
trying to switch this oh absolutely we
actually started working together at
that exact time and so it was like top
of mind for everybody to I mean not only
could we be the most convenient way to
shop but we also had to be the safest so
yeah they were great on cool I have all
the examples are here oh you got a
moment okay perfect oh cool all right so
yeah this is actually one of Alex's
slide so this is a bull's-eye views when
it targets of blogs it's live character
yeah this is live so you know before
cosmic car they would just be a blog you
have your image you have your content
you have another image but they've added
the one script tag to the source and so
now we've got the shop ability on these
images so we render the button and you
click it and it blazingly fast flies out
from the right-hand side there we go and
so you can see all the products that are
actually in the image everything that's
starred where it's where it's located in
the image this is actually done with our
manual tagger so they've got a tool that
actually lets them locate the item in
the image and point and click to set it
and then you know if you want to add to
cart so you want this bag because it
looks awesome and it matches Alex's
shoes you can add it to your cart and it
blazingly fast adds to cart and Alex
already has six other items in there
it totally fast okay that was super slow
yeah that's what it is yeah live demo
network issue yeah the question was is
this car have just target items or two
from retailers items and I think right
now you've only got target items in
there Alex but the answer is it would
have multiple vendors in there exactly
yeah so each each products marked with
the the retail that was very important
to retailers we found out by the way as
we started talking to him is well
where's our brain going to be oh it's
going to be right there because we just
decided that that's where needs to go
because of your questions so we've
always looked at Universal shopping cart
like that's what we kind of went to
market about i guess a year and a half
ago we were trying to sell this idea of
this universal shopping cart and we
realized no retailers have they have
some hesitations about playing with each
other so the universal shopping cart is
just kind of a feature that you can
makes it easier for people to check out
on but but really it's not I mean if you
see a target item you add a target item
if you see an item from macys you add
that into your shopping cart and it just
allows you to buy from multiple
retailers just trying to guess your
password was asking me to reenter your
password on don't know if I guess it or
not Matt rocks
anyway well that's thinking oh yeah just
show you how so that's the red label
experience I can switch over to is this
one you've got it on so yes sir here's
another here's a fashion blogger and
she's done the same thing she's enabled
a cosmic card on her site using that one
script line and so she's got a cosmic
Park theme because she didn't have her
own theme that she wanted for her site
so this would be a non red label target
cause it's their white label red label
so this is the default cosmic our theme
it's all the same back in it's just a
different skin some different business
logic here and they are based on whether
or not the vendor is a white label
vendor but yeah from those part of the
entire back end is the same and in what
this allows is any media company any
blog to monetize their content with one
line of code or SDK it's very easy and
then the goal with the mobile is like i
said earlier to do something very
similar where you drop your framework
into place we're building it in swift
that's why i was asking i was really
curious what was hoping so many more
people would have them have you done
something was left oh we have a question
i see what is a login this is usually
check off is on the target is
right so the question was about what
account are you using if you've got
multiple vendors items in your cart
which account use the check out with and
the answer is any of them so we've got
what we would like to see most of the
times for my create a cosmic card
account that gives you universal access
to all your accounts we want you to be
able to connect those accounts you know
just like you would say sign in with
Facebook you sign in with cosmic card an
alternative to that is and this is
actually kind of unique to target is on
the red label site anytime you you come
to a tart I didn't guess your password
right by the way anytime you come to a
target red label cosmic cart shoppable
site then you can use your target com
Prudential so if you already have a
target com account you can sign in with
your target.com credentials and your
cart will sync between cosmic cart and
target com and vice versa so if you shop
on target com and then come to cosmic
card elsewhere it's just an extension of
target com and that same carts going to
be there on both sides correct target
com itself is not using cosmic are
because they've already got the products
there
looks like at six minutes yes sure are
you the ones connecting editor's media
company with deep elders or that's one
of your role
yeah we a lot of times the relationships
so what we've seen a recent trend is
that retailers have deep relationships
with their top 20 publishers their meet
top 20 media companies where that send
them those traffic or where they place
the most ads in and so we come in mainly
we come into the retailer and we say who
do you like to work with who where where
do you want to sell your product where
is your customer because they know
better than we do and what we do is
because we've created such a dynamic
technology the publisher side is easy
like you know retailer sides easy to
because it integrates in you know a few
weeks tops but the publisher side
dropping a line of code has done the
publisher loves it because they keep
they keep their user engaged on the site
they offer them a seamless shopping
experience that they couldn't already do
and we've looked at a few examples in
the past where media companies have
tried to do this themselves and
ultimately failed because it is it takes
such bandwidth to work with all these
different retailers in the same way the
retailer's don't have the bandwidth to
work with all these different publishers
so yes there's one off collaborations
where you know you could have Conde Nast
may be works directly just hypothetical
example but works directly with target
but that does not scale because target
cannot handle every every one of their
top 20 so kind of our you know to answer
your question the business side of
cosmic car will get a retailer on board
attract their publishers or work with
their publishers and then with those
publishers then do is they tell us all
the retailer's I'd like to work with so
we kind of go back and forth and it's
been really great model hard model to
start off and I think we have a lot of
great traction we've already hit that
tipping point where we've gone back to
all the retailer's retailers or signing
up publishers are signing up but it was
very difficult to start with a chicken
or egg scenario for sure
what a compensation is a publisher like
a blogger get so for affiliate
relationships we come in and we just
mimic the exact relation that currently
exists there so we do a CPA model with
we've explored a few different
integrations can't say names yet but
we've explored in advertising where they
take a media buyout let's just say it's
a million dollars and we can charge a
flat fee there there's where because
we're starting you can never get you
know pricing exactly how you want it to
be to begin with so we've gotten pretty
creative and how how we charge a lot of
times it's just we like testing things
out we like exploring new relationships
new and we've just found that we've
created this this core technology is
very dynamic and sometimes CPA model is
not always the best way to charge
sometimes it's a white label you know
licensing fee there's a lot different
ways to that we kind of make money at
this point
anybody else anything else yes so like I
said that we are we're hiring Kaylee's
and we're hiring Simon's let's try to
think of who the architect wasn't a
firefly thing yeah so if you look at
where we're interested in targets are
for hiring as well your target yes come
visit us at our booth we've got some
really cool t-shirts some of the red
ones are in the audience here each day
this week we have different t-shirts
cosmic art doesn't have a booth can't
afford one yet but maybe next year okay
um that's all we got I think we almost
felt we got 58 minutes filled we sure
did okay better we make sure cool thank
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
