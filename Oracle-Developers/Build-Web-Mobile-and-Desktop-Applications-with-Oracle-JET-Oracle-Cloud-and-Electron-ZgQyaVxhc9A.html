everyone for coming I know it's a
lunchtime and this is quite a good show
up this is how to build web mobile and
desktop applications on Oracle jet
Oracle cloud and electron I'm Gerry ward
and this is Eric Espinosa and we're with
viscosity and this is jetpack so just a
brief will do a brief introduction and
I'll give an overview in the value
proposition of this approach to building
applications with a single codebase and
then we'll run through the installation
the tools and the demo that that Eric
will give with some applications that
he's built and then we'll at the end
we'll have a giveaway and the giveaways
a blatant bribe to keep you guys here to
the end and we've got plenty of slot
swag up here so just come on up so at
the end we'll have the book raffle and
so we've updated the our Oracle cloud
book for open world we've added over 100
pages and if you want to get in the
raffle to win this just simply send us
an email to hello
at viscosity and a.com and when
everybody when you enter the raffle I'll
just tell you ahead of time everybody
wins
so we'll send you a Kindle code so you
can download it on Amazon and that's
really important because Oracle is
constantly doing their releases and
updating the cloud the screenshots are
always changing so we're constantly
updating this book this book was really
it started as a hands-on lab that we've
done all over the country extremely
popular started this about two years ago
and now it's just kind of grown into
something that we keep up-to-date in
book form some of the other giveaways
that we have I have some autographed
artwork this is from Mark
I don't know if you ever watched PBS
imagination station but we contracted
him at a comic-con to do these
superheroes and these are our two
favorite development tools at Oracle
Oracle jet and Oracle apex so we've got
some autographed copies up here for you
first-come first-serve a little bit
about me I'm from Austin Texas I'm an
engineer and developer there's Twitter
I've been using apex since 2004 and
JavaScript I'm also a co-founder of
viscosity and co-author of the Oracle
cloud book that were given away I'm a
private pilot and we have later we
actually have a presentation at 5:00
today around developing an application
for the Raspberry Pi that tracks
aircraft so if you feel like what you
see today please come to that so a
little bit about viscosity this year
we'll have given over a hundred
presentations we do you know all over
the country and and and the world we
have one of our partners Charles Kim
we'll be doing a tour in Australia
Australia and New Zealand Eric has
presented through Latin America so it's
just part of our our culture the other
thing we do is we help businesses
innovate at a time when they must
innovate to survive and I think that
time now is more relevant than any other
time we're a very small company were 50
people and we're also a certified small
business and minority-owned business the
other thing about us is we've written
more than a dozen books on data cloud
and Oracle including rich noumic's book
which is the best-selling book in Oracle
press database released 12c performance
tuning
some of our clients I mean they range
from small to medium-sized businesses
all the way up to the fortune 50 they
can be completely commercial companies
and also government agencies so let's
look at the landscape of developing a
multi-platform app if you look at the
pure desktop site some of us used to do
client-server I'm one of them but if you
look at a pure desktop app you've got a
few choices you can build it with
xamarin on the Microsoft side you know
on Mac OS you're writing objective-c or
using some Swift libraries now as they
try and merge their platform on Linux
you're doing C++ there's a QT
multi-platform framework and a lot of
Java derivatives but with the web all
these web apps that we're building today
are JavaScript html5 and css3 okay and
then mobile you can go you know pure
mobile native where you're developing
iOS Swift or you're doing a java variant
on Android or you can do more hybrid
apps which basically utilize the web
browser that comes packaged with these
mobile devices titanium and PhoneGap are
a couple of those Cordova from Apache
but you've got multiple platforms
multiple code bases multiple different
skill sets multiple developers it can be
extremely expensive and painful to go
about it the way that most people do and
then we've also got this this whole idea
of converging architectures right so
this is a Windows two and one PC rumors
are that
Apple's gave out to do the same thing so
now we've got desktop apps that behave
you know as much like tablets as they do
like phones and also with their own
hardware and
structures face readers you know
fingerprint readers pens so we've got
this kind of converged infrastructure
that we've got to deal with going
forward so how does jet help or what is
jet jet is oracles free javascript
extension toolkit so it's a library that
includes javascript CSS and HTML to help
you build web applications mobile
applications and with what technique
we're going to show you today also
desktop applications so you can go
download the toolkit here you can try
the demos and really the architecture of
jet it's it's it's a modern architecture
model view viewmodel
I'm saying that right and it's a common
architecture with a lot of JavaScript
applications out there so you know at
the view model this is these are the
components that are responsible for the
user interface and what's cool about jet
is they give you a bunch of user
interface components which is a little
different from some other frameworks
which just give you you know the
framework and you're left to kind of
build your own stuff so part of that UI
delivery model is jQuery UI an open
source library called hammer which does
gestures and touch controls and sass
which is just a way to package up and
and better customize the look and feel
with CSS at your you view model what we
used to call here is the bindings that
bind those user interface elements to
the data that's handled by knockout
knockout does two-way binding it does it
very lean and fast I think the library
is only about 25k but these are there's
other frameworks out there like angular
and
from Google and react that do the same
thing but basically this is gonna handle
that that binding component and then the
jet component model which is kind of the
common framework that holds this
together and these are all on the client
side so all of these components are
running in the browser and then you can
do whatever you want on this server side
they really don't care you can write
your own web services and rest or
WebSockets
in our case we use the Oracle cloud and
we use a feature called Oracle rest data
services which allows us to very quickly
write web services using only sequel or
PL sequel but absolutely you can use
node anything you need in here and you
can also punch out two other sass
components like part of Oracle sass
model and so what are these components
basically there's a lot of open source
components that are included one of
those is Apache Cordova and that is the
component that allows us to create a
mobile app a native kind of hybrid
native mobile app so if you need to get
an app in an app store Cordova is the
framework which we do which we build
that with and just getting back to some
of the UI components what I really like
about these components these are the
same components that you'll find in
Oracle's ERP cloud over 70% of Oracle's
software as a service offerings use jet
soon to be more so if you're using you
know for business intelligence like data
visualization desktop if you're using
Oracle's customer experience cloud and
you're trying to extend these
applications you build them in jet
they're gonna look and feel just like
Oracle's apps so you're not going to
have this kind of differentiation and
confusion of the user experience and
they give you a lot of really rich
components these are very powerful
charting components before you might
have to go to
other libraries like d3 org or some of
those libraries but what they've given
you are these declarative components
that you can quickly integrate in your
app and the other thing that's kind of
cool
within the next few months from what I
understand they're going to make these
completely html5 component compliance so
you'll be able to just copy and paste
these between you know any platform
whether that's a custom platform that
you're building
whether it's Oracle apex whether it's
Oracle application build or cloud
service which is built for kind of no
code citizen developer type applications
okay and just announced last week are
some new components so we've got new
features on the Gantt chart which we've
been looking forward to we can do more
excel based type grid type things so
we've got merged cells for example with
the OJ tree view we've got some
enhancements there and then of course
with all these social you know there's a
social aspect to a lot of applications
now so they've given us native
declarative avatars and a whole bunch of
features to do personalization and
customization of our absolute color
palettes for example so why build a
desktop app we've got the web we've got
mobile we've got native mobile we've got
hybrid mobile where we're doing you know
web mobile apps and with some native
access so why do we really want to have
a desktop apps and everything on the web
well you know if you want to do local
file editing or access any kind of local
hardware you really need to have a
desktop application other applications
we see are kiosks like dedicated control
system like if you're controlling a
large piece of machinery and you want a
dedicated Windows
you know or Linux platform to do that
anything that's high-volume so you need
local very highly performant localized
components and if you need to get
anything in the App Store whether it's
Google Play or the Microsoft Store or
the Apple Store you're gonna have to
have an installable application
accessing printers and devices doing
automatic print and highly automating
things we have this concept of high
automation too as we automate things
going forward the desktops going to
become more important I just did some
brainstorming you know you can have all
kinds of apps mashups where you're
taking data from other desktop
applications or local local systems with
with the web disconnected data entry
where you're offline you may be on an
oil rig or an oil platform way out in
the middle of the North Atlantic file
editors you know applications that are
always on that start when when the
Machine starts messaging and
collaboration applications audio and
visual video conferencing things that
have you know high bandwidth
requirements so as we integrate this in
there's a place for Oracle jet there's
and and there's also what we have is the
electron framework what that's going to
do it's going to give us two things one
is an open source version of Google
Chrome which is the chromium browser and
it's also going to give us a web server
which is no js' so imagine you had a web
application running somewhere now you've
taken that you've packaged it up and
you're delivering on a web server that's
running on your local machine inside of
the chromium browser and that's really
what electrons giving us there and then
use whatever server-side components you
like in this case we use the Oracle
cloud which is rest data services custom
api's you know other services like
ebusiness suite or any ERP system you
can also plug into those
and so why do we want to develop this
way versus some of the other ways
because native application development
is extremely hard there's a lot of code
it's extremely slow you have to have
specialized skill sets those skill sets
are different for Apple as they are for
Microsoft as they are for Linux I don't
know anybody that knows them all or is
proficient with them all and web
development is easy it's what everybody
coming out of school knows they know how
to develop on the web some other
advantages are you're not paying
thousands of dollars for a desktop
platform licensing costs and you're not
struggling with upgrades every time the
underlying platform you know changes so
this is really good it eliminates a lot
of dependencies and platforms and also
there's a deployment framework that
comes with it you know so if you need to
update your application they make that a
lot easier then and then what's
typically done and is anybody ever use
slack okay most of you so slack is built
on electron and I think slack is just
one of those applications they could
have done it on the web but it just
feels better as a desktop app and I
think a lot of applications just just
belong on the desktop so slack what it
does if you haven't used it it's a group
chat platform so we can do group
chatting and content sharing and you
know so so how do you get electron well
the first thing you're going to need to
do is install nodejs on your local
platform you can go here and once you've
done that you simply clone off of yet
and that gives you a whole framework to
develop electron applications you get a
little file structure index dot HTML
just like you have a web app that's
basically your homepage for the
application and then template main dot
jss that's where your Java Script is
that's kind of your master javascript
file and then you have packaging so if
you've packaged up a bunch of
dependencies that's where you'll define
your
packaging and it's really that simple so
Eric is built some applications to show
you and Eric is our development lead and
Technical Architect so I'm going to mute
this
I'm just gonna get settled here real
quick so sorry what I'm gonna try to do
is what you walk you through the process
of taking this approach into your own
use cases right and I want to show you
guys two apps that we built using this
approach this is just a POC up sample
app that I built which is reading or
it's getting data out of my local
computer and rendering that into a web
application packed into electron reading
my what's my platform you know
essentially what's my computer's version
I'm reading my disk space how much body
I have how much memory I have used and a
graph of the processor activity and all
of this is pure HTML and this
visualizations that you're looking here
are electron components I'm sorry
Oracle J components that's what I meant
this is one use case the other use cases
we built an internal application for
time tracking in viscosity and in this
case we did not use the Oracle jet we
use Oracle apex but I think it's a good
example of how you guys can leverage
different technologies pack them into a
desktop application and give a better
you know user experience to your clients
or internal users in this case and in
our case electron made easy for us to
access api's in the in you know and in
the OS environment one of the api's are
very common today to use our tray icons
and
have them on Windows on Linux and on Mac
of course and the app looks like this
it's an application that we always have
accessible in our status bar and menu
bar and this application it's pure HTML
made in Apex but what we did is you know
we wanted to have that handy all the
time so we built our app in electron I'm
sorry in Apex in packaged into electron
so we have desktop notifications we have
access to Windows inside of the Mac
operating system and we also were able
to pack this application for both Mac OS
and Windows so I'm gonna jump broke
quick into I'm gonna try them now I'm
gonna try to make it as much as I can
simple there are simple steps I guess
for in order to build a simple
application and of course in your use
cases you might want to add some
additional stuff right but I think this
is a good starting point so one of the
things we need is one of the things we
need is a file structure and it's quite
simple our starting point will look like
a package.json file which is the main
faith it's a big declaration file and
when we need a jas file right which is
our main j/s and this is good this is
going to be the starting point for our
election application the third thing we
need it's an additional directory which
in our case we call it the render
process and inside of this render
process we're gonna put everything that
is web related right HTML files CSS
files JavaScript files everything that
is going to be the front end of your
electronic application so from this
parting point I'm gonna show you guys
the code real quick so I'm going to move
into
my co-editor your electron application
we'll need a couple of lines of code
which you can find and you know if we go
to the electron on QuickStart guide
you're gonna see a couple of disco
pretty much and what we need essentially
sorry is we need a import our app and
browser objects from electron this to
I'm gonna explain them later we're not
using specifically for this case and
then I create a function right which is
gonna create a main window in the
operating system and electronic takes
care of the API the underlying API calls
right for Windows how to create a window
visually it's going to be different from
Mac and from Linux so that's those kind
of things electron takes care for you
guys so you have a you know very generic
way of creating your applications and as
Jerry said before you can use a single
you code base for this next thing we
need to do is define a couple of
settings for you know window size or if
you want to maximize your window when
the application runs right this part is
very important right here if you will be
building a pure electric application not
we're all cool jet your code is gonna
come from different files right but in
this case if you guys see I'm
referencing my render folder which I
mentioned before and I'm gonna explain
here in a couple of seconds what's in
there and I'm referencing inside of my
render folder a index file inside of my
web folder from the web
inside all all that it's inside of the
web it's very Oracle jet specific so
we're gonna see that in a minute and
then I do some other stuff like when my
application runs I want to open the
developer tools and I think most of you
are familiar with what the developer two
looks like in your Google Chrome right
so what this is going to do is that
since electron runs on top of or
Duggal v8 engine and the chromium
implementation of that so Jerry said
before you pretty much have a Google
Chrome sort of an engine running for you
guys your web applications in this case
so this is pretty much it this is what
it looks like to build your you know
starting point for an electron
application and next step would be to
set up your Oracle jet app which is
purely front-end right and I invite you
guys to visit the website of Oracle jets
project and you can find a you know
three step guide on how to build a local
jet application right first thing is
download the package using our NPM
package manager which is over here
second step will be to build your
application and Oracle Oracle jet
provides you with templates for
different types of applications so
pretty much you have can layouts and
components inside of the Oracle jet
project so if you just want to you know
build something quick and dirty like a
POC or you have a very simple use case
and you Donita you don't want to write a
bunch of code you can use you know the
templates that they provide you and you
can get up and running like in a few
seconds and then the third step will be
to execute app and in this case since
we're running our Aquajet application
through electron we're not gonna do step
number three right so we're just gonna
do a step number one and step number two
so by running step number one and step
number two we're gonna get our content
inside of a render directory right and
what you're gonna get it initially is
scripts right here you're gonna get the
source code which is where you know you
actually put your code and you built
your in official interfaces and the rest
it's both for you
using the task manager
I don't know if you guys are familiar
with it but it comes with with you know
the dependencies of Oracle jet and what
it does is that you know automates for
you certain tasks in order to create
file structure for your old cajeta
project so this is what it looks like
the rest of the files like themes the
web which is the the file that we're
referencing from our electron inside I
built for you issuing a command so I
don't want to run out of time here
because I want to show you guys how you
can access and what's the beauty of
having electron I think I lost audio
what's the beauty of having electron
running your own code yet up so I'm
gonna run my app from here real quick I
don't think I'm gonna have time to show
you guys how to build our project but
that's it's not so relevant to what I
want to show you guys so I'm gonna
execute my app and my app is gonna run
initially and remember that I said that
I wanted to open my developer tools
right so that's why I have this site
region when we're here which you guys
might be familiar with with it one of
the things is you know when you are in a
web environment you are pretty much in
the sandbox right you don't have access
to the operating system unless you use
one of the html5 API is right in many
cases you don't have access to like
memory information CPU information disk
or hard drive information right so what
electron gives me is an integration
which makes available api's from the
operating system into the web tier the
way does that is you know since you have
your own version of the v8 engine
running for you electron can manipulate
the api's and create integrations for
the web tier one of the things that I
wanna show you guys is I don't know if
you guys are familiar with requirejs
which is say it's a library for
dependency and file dependencies you
have something similar on the note
component which is you know part of note
and essentially lets you little packages
right so what I'm using and I want to
show you guys I'm using the package
called OS which gives you access to the
underlying underlying operating system
now I'm using a third-party library
called Drive list which gives me access
and then also how to read the API is
from the operating system to give me
information about my hard drives so all
of these api's I don't have access from
the web tier right but using electron
and running my front-end through a
lecture and I have access to those so I
want to show you guys real quick I'm
going to from my web environment I'm
gonna read how many network interfaces I
have right and this is gonna look a
little bit weird cuz it's not so clear
as you you will see it going into your
UI but in this case you know it's
returning that I have for network
interfaces right if I want to go and see
how many CPUs I have right I can do it
from the web tier which is going through
electron to my underlying operating
system you know executing calls to the
API of the operating system and then
bring bringing that information back to
the rendering process which is a
front-end right so I can have access to
you know I have eight CPUs and I can see
the information of each CPU I can also
have access like to my hard drive list
right which is something you never will
have access through a web application so
real quick we'll wait for a couple of
seconds and there it is and showing me
that I have one hard drive with two
partitions and the information and I
don't know if you see you guys if it's
two right there you know it's it's it's
going down to the operating system
getting that information right and
that's doing it through a lecture on
bring it over to my render process and
giving me giving me the ability to
create you know code in my front and in
using back-end sort of services I don't
know if that makes sense something that
you typically will have to do through a
restful api right if you have your web
application communicating to a back-end
right to try to get information but in
this case if you if you use cases create
an application that's gonna run in a
desktop environment you have access to
USB ports you have access to the camera
you have access to the you know Wi-Fi to
the Bluetooth so you can think of you
know a lot of use cases where you might
want to create an application simply
enough using an framework like Oracle
jet but you have the powerful tools to
access this underlying hardware
component this is just you know this is
just a couple of the use cases of what
kind of information you can access you
can access comment how much memory I
have available right now of course is
giving me that invites but you can do
calculations super send that information
so you know the reason why I want to
bring this up to you guys is just to
show you how powerful it can be to
package your or to use a web technology
that most of you pretty much are
familiar with pack it into a framework
like electron and you can build you know
amazing use cases um the last thing I
think I forgot to mention that and I
want to run out of time here is my index
file and I'm going to show you guys
where this index file is it's inside of
my render directory which is everything
inside of my render directory it's my
Oracle data application my index file
which is the main file it's the one that
takes care of orchestrating you know
calling all the front and components
right the interesting part here is that
if I load this up into a web app
environment where I don't have access to
to the underlying API server electron
and I'm going to show you guys here in a
second how that looks like this is like
the magic and it might seem simple this
part over here but this is like the
magic of
how you get access to electron so when
this index file is rendered electron you
have access to the require package right
which I'm a man you're gonna get an
error saying that that package does does
not exist right
but it's because electron can inject
that package into your HTML engine so
you can have access to those modules on
the underlying operating system and do
this it's because electrons origins with
its own package manager it's called
requirejs similar to the required
package and node but you know they're
not in different contexts if that makes
sense
so you know I'm just taking care of if
I'm not in my application in electron I
want it to work and if I'm not in my
application on the web environment
I wanted to works well right I don't
want to get error messages on on my job
on the JavaScript right so nice work the
cloud - you know global constants that
will access the underlying operating
system packages OS and drive list so
that's that if you you know if your
application is something that you can
run both on desktop and what and in the
webbing bottom like slack I can think of
slack right the code base is gonna be
the same you don't have to modify
anything right so you pretty much need
to do like in the case of deploying this
to the Oracle cloud application
container I'll just select all of this
files
compress them and I can just throw this
into the application container creating
a set file so I have you know the same
app running on my Oracle application
container cloud service and of course
it's empty right because it doesn't have
access to the information with my
operating system from the cloud but it
is just a way to showcase that the code
base is going to be the same one last
thing before I run out of time is the
electron package manager
I'm gonna package an application and
this is just for you guys to dish your
app right you don't want to give like a
bunch of code to your people right you
want to give in the case of Mac users
you want to get a give a dot a a P P
executable file right in the case of
Windows you might want to create a dot
XE file so packager which is a different
library it's related to electron but
it's a different library that you can
just issue one command-line and is going
to pack everything put it inside of a
binary file and you can just distribute
that real quick so the way it looks like
our command I'm just gonna execute this
is gonna take a couple of seconds since
a couple seconds here and it's building
rights ticking on my codebase is
compiling what it can compile and in the
case of JavaScript code you guys know
that compiling means minify the
JavaScript files right so it's minifying
as much as it can it's packing the
election executables into one app and it
creates a file format users you're gonna
be familiar with it um it works might
I think it's not done supposed to be
done let me issue that again real quick
and unfortunately I can show you ask
aside I want to I want to go through
that process I couldn't show you guys
like packaging this into a Windows app
but you guys can you know from from from
like a Mac OS operating system if you're
if that's your development environment
you can you can create Windows
applications from this environment using
election packager you will need some
special packages install into your
computer or you know in the other cases
that you can just take your code into a
Windows machine install node and then
run the election package over there and
it's gonna create a dot exe file and
you're up and you're good you're good to
go so the end result it's a you know dot
a PP app and in the case of Mac and you
can just run it right so that's how you
would this should be your app see your
end users I think I cover pretty much I
don't know if anyone has any questions
yes reason why we went through we went
with a Pyxis because we already had a
system running on Oracle apex and we
wanted to you know like sometimes a lot
of our people forget to enter the time
so to us it was just quite simple to put
like a tray icon there for them to just
click in there right instead of going to
a web browser put in the URL and login
and go and enter their hours but yeah of
course I mean I and we had a short
amount of time
right so Aquajet for sure cuz you have a
lot of other tools available to you to
create very rich user interfaces so for
sure I mean if I have a little bit more
of time and my system was not built
already I will go with Oracle then
you're going to save time and develop
faster and cheaper and the stuff that
really needs to be native that's to show
you guys ok
and if you want this superheroes hello
at viscosity and a.com I'll give you a
chance to take a picture
you can also hit our website if you like
and then we have like four minutes for
more questions if anyone has any more
questions yes it's because a package
inside of it the electron binaries right
any package the note binaries in it so
that's that's how that's how electron
makes it portable if that makes sense
right
so you can take that just put it on any
operating system and you don't have to
install any dependencies so the reason
why it's a little bit bigger and
typically you will see electron apps
being you know bigger than the base code
that you're using it's because it's
packaging inside of it all those
binaries so you don't have to install
any dependencies on you know the client
if that makes sense so that's that's why
it's not you know I haven't seen like
from the apps that we built I haven't
seen exceeding like 500 Meg's which you
know today is not a lot of you know
fixed disk space compared to other apps
right so yeah all right guys that's all
for us thank you for for coming and I
hope you guys can you know leverage this
