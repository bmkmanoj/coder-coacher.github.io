at Oracle code Sydney
I'm your host Javed Muhammad and I have
as my guest Lee Lewis we're who is the
chief architect at Capgemini Lewis
welcome I am good thank you so we met in
Beijing and there we here in Sydney so
you had a very interesting subject of
API and micro services a match made in
heaven you're in just do a little recap
I know we kind of focused a little bit
more about on the architecture we're
going talk a little bit our technology
but just generally recap where is this
match made in heaven thank you very much
again for for the invitation a
formalization is related to that
actually the keynote today the keynote
today will focus on on cloud also api's
and then a-15 will talk about the apiary
in 1/2 in salina api's in Oracle cloud
developer cloud and applications of
error cloud and so on some construction
upon that I'm given a very strong
practical trionic how organizations are
have to implement different
architectural patterns right along with
different tools right in you know in a
full life cycle in order to deliver API
to market area ok so I think you kind of
touched upon sort them about from apiary
a pre-2000 but you weren't just going to
give us a broader overview so what are
the technologies that people need to
consider to deploy a continuous
integration continuous deployment
pipeline that's a very good question
first of all I think in this new modern
world when you want to create a modern
application even as strong as into the
consumer is important so an API first
approach can help you accomplish your
staff so using a tool such as a industry
cap what is API first so API first is an
approach to design applications that
puts focus person
who meaning that before I go into
building my system on my application
I actually produce it that they
interpret design and make sure that my
consumers of that interface right are
satisfied with what's going to be
delivered and therefore I can engage in
a cycle whereby I produce a mock-up
right or a side we can pride nothing if
you're the consumer and then it's that's
not exactly what you need I can iterate
that design without having to you know
spend time actually building it meaning
that your site will get some of shorter
and you can you know get the results you
want most likely with a faster faster
approach in Supercross and that's what a
pier apiary allows you to do right yari
allows you to it's a it's a niche to for
API first is on the strategy and use
different locations you can use a may be
a group realization which is based on
markdown which is a popular text
notation in the weekly I think of some
of wiki but you also have a flogger
which is a if you may a very popular in
creation for a design API okay so what
about the rest of the pipeline in terms
of getting your code in there to get
getting it built the tested you wanna
carry the scatter waters do that yeah so
norm is talking the context on my name
or or in general yeah you can talking in
your either way but whatever you want
yeah I'll start in the context of my
name chip so what I'm going to show is
how you first go and use apiary audio
design how you can iterate at the time
but then apiary have some really neat
features for example toothiness
integrate your API grouping or your
pluggable that's a very strong concept
right because you basically start your
patch right before you act you have
actually implemented your arabia's so I
start by creating some thread if the
name of the tool it's an open-source
tool actually developed by AP re-correct
I use direct you to set up some tests on
the API interface States on the API
reference and then I go into
implementing the API in this 9m abusing
note
or in reality developers can choose any
orbitals that go like it was for example
extract earlier today in the keynote
okay once I build my my microservice
using no TF in a local database what I
show is how I can package that into our
container and then using the docker
compose which is a kind of simple
lightweight soccer expression technology
attack astaire application I created on
physical profile and then I can deploy
that into any confusing the cloud invent
a time during my laptop intellectual how
to do it in a MIDI what I do net is that
the previous with use integration a
population accurately for using thread I
modify that such as I can then compute
integrate test my micro service that I
feel and make sure the my design my
implementation is actually consistent
and then what I do next is I I going to
use the Oracle API platform service to
implement a policy on top of the micro
service API to make sure that only
developers that would have subscribed
the API and obtain an API key can invoke
that API okay so once you've got all of
that and how does the the continuous
deployment part of that happen
so when you're a thread you can use a
for example using developer cloud if you
use a Houston which is what compute in
the developer cloud and you also have a
git repository so you can you a clear
blueprint synchronizes heat in my case I
using github in a certain CI which is
also part of the PPT apiary provides so
I can create a thread with the school
regression test the API and then a
theocracy I will might confuse
interaction pipe okay you think you've
mentioned to is in Beijing but it's
never hit your you're an all sort of a
couple of books you got some of this in
the progress you want just give this
together so I do a shameless plug for
your book sir yeah I will talk about the
or five years ago now actually
implementing sort governance using
Oracle softly and storica incredible
score 11g that was a long time ago about
two years ago I wrote a book title or
to API management close to
implementation now I'm collaborating
with a Phil Wilson and Ravel and Thunder
engine in the in a new book or
implementing Oracle API Platinum cloud
service which is a service that was a
demonstrated earlier T dream that I'm
going to demonstrate later today and
then as a small project I'm writing a
book called Enterprise API which is more
a technology agnostic move to how to
implement an ApS prodigy in an API
initiative in a large print any
traditional real life experience one of
the Troy I am working on right now
alright well I hope you'll see them the
New York Times bestseller list
okay like so I know Lewis you better
presentation coming up so thank you so
much for dropping by into sharing
lecture thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
