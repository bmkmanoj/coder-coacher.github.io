from Oracle code and Bangalore for the
final session here they're actually
breaking down the developer lounge here
I'm here with chitin Vidal on each it's
unwelcome hi Jim how are you doing today
I'm doing very well I'm tired I've been
here all day talking I can see that as
you have been in sessions I'm sure you
gave one of the early sessions and from
what I understand one of the more
popular ones thank you and probably one
of the more important ones on your she's
learning and dev SEC ops yep that's
correct yeah I know what DevOps is in a
general sense what it was dev SEC ops
right that's that's a good question
almost around 20 2015 the terminology
dousai cops came out prior to that
security was the afterthought and
afterthought right the good news is that
people realized that the hackers are
able to target because the database or
the development environment because of
the gaps in the development or design
level and and the security being the
last thing did not help it's almost like
someone writing on the back of the
t-shirt that I test in production why
was security an afterthought why was it
an add-on I mean I understand what
you're saying that now you know you have
to design these things in from up front
but the ramifications of an afterthought
seems really significant yes that's
correct
so DevOps part the developers mindset
was never been to think about security
there is a separate team out outside we
do the dev ops team does the development
and throw it other other side just the
way kind of challenges we used to face
between dev and ops it's the same
challenge now we have with DevOps and
SEC ops right so this used to be two
different teams and now security is
realizing because businesses doesn't
want to wait nor they want to be in the
headlines of the newspaper after losing
the data and losing
business I say okay okay so what in
terms of developers using this you
nervous that Oracle's offering here yeah
what do they see how do they interact
with it what are some use cases
great question you could talk about some
of these issues absolutely absolutely so
developers need to think about security
from the design of the application
during the development cycle of the
application and there are automated
solutions available to do this activity
what we do in the Oracle management
cloud if we take this information as a
Friedan for the automated testing we
also analyze the logs of the development
activity and other than traditional var
rooms where everybody used to sit with
that is not my problem
we pinpoint using the machine learning
that this is where the problem is so
identification of problem is faster from
monitoring as well as security
perspective so that the gaps are filled
much earlier in the cycle and it can be
feedback to other teams doing the
similar development or any other
development so that the fix can go in
for everybody in the organization okay
you mentioned machine learning here
which is obviously that which is the
title why machine learning yes so
traditionally security was done with
rule-based approach but hackers are
being smart and well-funded either being
the bad guys or state-funded they
started by passing the rules but
machines can be used to become dynamic
in terms of monitoring not just static
so as as you handle your environment or
assets can be cloud or on-premise it
needs to adapt to the changing
environment so machine learning helps
identify the anomaly in a very dynamic
say for example a marketing person doing
the query on the finance database that's
a mnemonic for machine learning which
cannot be done with the static kind of
rules so with machine learning now
you have the ability of solving some of
these problems in the past you might not
have yes that's correct
and that's why the devil Cyclops this is
the right time for the deaf Cyclops okay
I
is that a common term I haven't really
heard that term used very much okay so
is it a more recent term yes
it came out as I said in 2015 become
popular as early as last year okay but I
don't know if there are any real
implementation of DevOps except the
pioneers few companies say 1% of the
companies in the world okay so I'm
interested in the reaction in the room
for your session because I understand it
was pretty full and what were some of
the conversations that you were having
with the engineers great question we had
quite a few conversations around how to
how the Oracle management cloud can be
used for non Oracle environments how
their development level feedback that
they receive for the security can be
feed into the Security Operations Center
and can be visible centrally so those
are the kind of questions that I got and
they were very happy with the answer it
was a full out session as you said it
was a pretty dynamic because I notice
the whole personality of this conference
has been very dynamic yes yes I like you
and have it open from the word go and
people are very very excited I too
stopped towards the end that last two
questions okay well thank you very much
thank you coming by you was a final
interview of the day thank you any one
hand that's a privilege it's been a
great conference here in Bangalore and I
think the next one is in Singapore so
check back in a couple of weeks and
we'll see you then thanks thank you very
much I'll see you that as well thank you
