Atlanta I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network and I'm here with
John Morello John and all the folks at
home what you do
I am the CTO for twistlock we're a
company that mace a security suite for
containers and cloud native apps overall
and what are you doing here at Oracle
code Atlanta so one of the things that
we've really been been interested to see
over the past couple of years is not
only has the enterprise huges of
containers really taken off a lot but
we've also seen a lot more customers
using Oracle cloud during that timeframe
as well and I think especially with the
services that Oracle has an Oracle cloud
now around a container service and
options really in a very unique way for
both bare-metal services and for AI as
we're starting to see a lot of customers
particularly in the enterprise space and
particularly those that have a strong
java background really adopting
containers is the way that they build
and ship and run their applications and
obviously Oracle has got a lot of
customers that are in that financial
services and government healthcare
markets for whom security is really a
critical part of what they do and so
it's natural for them to look for a
security tool like like what we built so
describe the the intersection between
twistlock and Oracle and so basically
what we do is create a almost like you
could say a containerized layer of
security for the applications that you
build and run on top of whatever clouds
you happen to be running on so while we
support Oracle and have done a lot of
work and published a blog post
specifically about doing it on Oracle
cloud fundamentally what we do really
works anywhere so we have customers on
you know pretty much any cloud provider
that you could imagine also customers
had just run on-premises using their own
hardware their own virtual machines and
so forth the real integration that we
have in the scenario that we have is
really trying to take the containers and
the applications that you build in those
containers and applying security
capabilities to them but to leverage the
capabilities of containers themselves to
do that in a smarter and more autonomous
way so if you think back in the past
like if I was building some j2ee app as
a developer and I want to deploy that
onto my infrastructure whatever that
might be if I want to make sure that
application is secured at runtime office
sit down with
my security team and say you know it
listens on this particular port it
writes to this file path you know it
runs these processes etc right if my
security team is really on the ball
they're going to go to a few different
tools and configure a host firewall
configure some anti-malware maybe an IDs
and so forth but fundamentally those
approaches don't really scale very well
when you start talking about containers
and micro services you have you know
hundreds or thousands of these things
that are changing really quickly and so
what we do is we leverage some of the
fundamental characteristics of
containers the fact that they're
immutable that they're very declarative
they're minimalistic in nature to
automatically build what we call a model
for what that container should do at
runtime and that model basically
describes what it should do across four
dimensions process file system system
call a network and it allows us to be
able to do all that sort of manual work
that I just described there purely
through machine learning and software so
as a developer when I build my
application I just simply build my app
using Jenkins or whatever tool that I
might normally be using to us Locke
discovers how that application should
work and then automatically protects it
that way at runtime so if again I've got
a j2ee app that listens on port 443 and
runs you know this particular binary and
writes these file paths without me
having to create any rules twistlock
will be able to detect if there's any
anomalies relative to that model for
example if another process runs or it
runs in a different pour something along
those lines so it's really scaled out
autonomous security from your
perspective what trips people up most in
as they make their first approach to
working with containers I think probably
the biggest barrier for a lot of people
to overcome is the mental barrier of
thinking that continues are simply just
another iteration of virtual machines
and the the tech press and so forth I
think it has made that worse honestly
bye-bye always starts making these
articles about like you know or
containers and destroy VMware and you
know things like that and the truth of
the matter is they're very complementary
technologies I mean almost every
customer that we have uses both of them
together you know they use virtual
machines to to abstract the hardware and
to segment the containers based on
workloads and sensitivity levels and so
forth and they use the containers as a
way to very rapidly take an application
from development into production to
scale it out more efficiently and to
really run the app versus running the
info
I'm sure but it's not sort of an
either-or mentality the problem that
that that that mentality causes though
is when people have that notion that a
container is a VM they want to manage
you like a VM right near the whole
notion of you know cattle and pets and
so forth you know sometimes we encounter
customers that have containers that they
have going in there like customized and
you know basically run as a virtual
machine and while technically you can do
that it's not really giving you all the
value that containers provide I mean the
whole benefit of containers is I can
build something development I can build
in a very composable rapid way and then
I can take that thing that I've built
and run that anywhere I want to and if
that thing that I've deployed you know
needs to be scaled out or needs to be
upgraded I can simply destroy whatever I
had before and replace it with the new
version and if you if you don't make
that mental switch that operational
shift you're not gonna really get that
value out of it so what's on your
calendar next for us the next thing that
we have up-and-coming is our is our next
major release of our product so twist
lock 2.1 we've got some great
functionality there basically providing
a cloud native app firewall by
leveraging what we've learned about the
way that the application works and being
able to actually dynamically create
effectively a laugh but on a laughs
that's really tuned to work in a
microservices architecture that's close
to each one of the apps you have so
that's one big feature we're doing a lot
of work around vulnerability management
to make it easier for you to understand
not just like the raw counts of
vulnerabilities and risks in your
environment but to be able to stack rank
and prioritize those based on the
specific way that you deploy those
containers and those images for example
like we can know if a particular
vulnerability is really important to you
based on whether or not it's affecting
containers that are exposed to the
Internet or containers that don't have a
mandatory security profile and really
give you a much more actionable way to
understand the vulnerabilities in your
environment are you going to be
presenting and other industry events we
will yeah so we spoke at docker con
earlier in the summer the next big
conference will be at is is blackhat
we're also going to be at AWS reinvent
and a variety of other conferences in
the future and certainly looking forward
to doing the presentation here in about
an hour so right then well you can't be
here
or maybe you can if you can get down
here to in to Atlanta in the next hour
so you can you can certainly see John's
presentation otherwise you can watch
videos from Oracle code presentations
from
and among the 20 cities on the tour and
find other information that will be of
interested developers and architects and
so on at developer oracle.com slash code
for the Oracle technology Network I'm
Bob Rubin
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
