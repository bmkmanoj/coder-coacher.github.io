about security and the Internet of
Things
my name is Noelle poor I'm an architect
in the embedded Java group at Oracle and
I've been focusing on the looking at the
Internet of Things for for some time now
and I've been working with the team
that's been developing the reference
architecture and working with a lot of
different product teams across Oracle
and generally having a lot of fun so
this is the mandatory health warning I'm
sure you've seen this slide in every
single presentation I guess I hope
you've seen this nice and every single
presentation and I think I've given talk
for long enough that you've had time to
read it read all those words now so we
can move on so we're talking about the
Internet of Things obviously and so a
lot of different technologies are
feeding into and making possible the
growth of the Internet of Things
so advances in different kinds of
sensors in our capabilities for embedded
processing in communications
you know advances in protocols in
software software itself and so on
advances in storage and processing on
the back end and you know we're you know
so we've created and are creating and
imagining all kinds of things that are
going to grow out of these foundations
he's me so and of course the everyone
uses the word smart about their product
it's a smartphone or it's a smart tablet
or it's a smart meter or whatever and so
the word smart is you know because it's
overused now has really ceased to mean
anything so this is a diagram that from
a report that was was written by beach
and research it was the report was
sponsored by Oracle and really what it
shows is the breadth of what we're
dealing with here the breadth of
application the breadth of different
industries and sectors different kinds
of application and all of the different
kinds of device that a that are involved
in all of those different applications
and segments so this is a huge field and
it's a it's a massive opportunity for an
awful lot of people
so let's look very briefly at what what
an Internet of Things solution is going
to generically look like so just for a
change we've drawn the devices on the
right hand side here so lots of
different kinds of device and there'll
be some of those will be wired sensors a
lot of them will be wireless and they'll
be using different local area body area
you know whatever area networks and
there are a lot of different
technologies and protocols developed
here for different specialist
specialized purposes over the last few
years so you've got all kinds of
different devices gateways smart meters
lots of devices around your home smart
tags for you know patient tags in in
hospitals and so on
and then there'll be some devices that
have a direct connection to the back end
a lot of devices will be connected via a
gateway device that is doing maybe
protocol translation aggregation some
some level of local processing of the
information things like that so then we
have a core yeah a core network that is
how everything over here is connected to
all of your back-end stuff so you're
going to have you know some centralized
applications here there's going to be
applications running out over here as
well and the distributed nature of this
is
I think an important part a piece of of
IOT and then some a lot of these
applications will be applications that
are going to be accessed typically by a
browser of some kind as well so you've
got your traditional you know enterprise
IT thing happening over here as well and
so you need an integration layer that
enables all of this IOT stuff over here
to integrate with your existing back-end
infrastructure and when you can once you
do that then you can create into end
valuated services that really create
value from all of this stuff so very
quickly
smart home use case and we've all seen
lots of concept videos in the last
decade or so but let's just very quickly
go through this so you know you can have
devices that you're wearing that are
networked to something that you're also
wearing you know there's a lot of
activity going on building devices into
into shoes into clothes and so on excuse
me a second while I kill that
- spoon thank you and then there will be
lots of other other devices around the
home that are all connected in in a
variety of different ways
and some of which may have their own
sort of independent IP connections out
to the cloud some of this stuff will we
will again the applications running
locally on a gateway in your in your
home and then obviously you'll have you
know an internet connection you know and
you'll be talking to the power company
the power grid we'll be talking to
devices in your house and so on so again
the the purpose of this is just to say
that we're dealing with very
heterogeneous systems here and there's
lots of integration points that have to
be taken care of so part of the the
research that um that Beecham did was to
ask a series of questions and one of the
things so that we that was asked was you
know what are your top priorities for in
you know the things that you worry about
the most in delivering m2m solutions and
the number one answer by quite a long
way was ensuring end-to-end security and
I hope that have you know that our being
involved in or interested in to a man
IOT that security is something they're
already thinking about and it is a least
a potential barrier to the large-scale
adoption of of Internet of Things
solutions so it's clear that in embedded
solutions in general security is not
always a high priority so forty percent
according to this research 40 percent of
embedded solutions have not proactively
addressed security in what they're doing
and that that's clearly not some not a
number that can continue
as we'll see so there's going to be a
lot of increased demand and already the
industry is seeing you know amazing
year-on-year growth of you know sales of
security components and security
solutions and consultancy and so on then
less let's think about some of the other
background to this well so you've
probably all heard of Bruce Schneier
pretty well known internet security guy
now and so I think he's deemed to be a
you know a guru by not just the
economist but by a lot of other people
so he's been talking about some of the
some of the information that's been
leaked recently about what the NSA does
and you know my guess is that the NSA is
not unique around the world in doing
some of this stuff so there obviously
there's obviously preparation you know
we know that there is a lot of hacking
going on we know that that is not
entirely you know teenagers sitting in
their bedroom having fun but that is
organized it is government-sponsored in
some cases and that it's some you know
the effects of that can be could can be
very very deadly and there's an awful
lot of infrastructure that people tend
not to think about that is not
necessarily all that secure partly
because it simply sits there and people
don't worry about it until it breaks so
your router if you're you know if you
have you know certain devices that have
that no Wi-Fi passwords then those Wi-Fi
passwords are actually being backed up
to the cloud if your if your device is
automatically being backed up so you
know there are some some places where if
you can break into those those backups
you can find out an awful lot determine
an awful lot of Wi-Fi passwords for
probably pretty much any network in the
world if you can
get hold of enough enough of those
backups and so those those kinds of
network infrastructure devices are often
good places to attack because they're
not necessarily kept up-to-date from a
software point of view they tend to be
not thought about until like I said
until they break so they're they're a
frequent you know a good point to to
attack rather than front it directly
attack some of the systems so Trust it's
a word that used in in a number of
different ways but in general I think if
if consumers do not trust the Internet
of Things solutions then that will
hinder mass adoption and whoops sorry
and really we need to maintain develop
have whatever word you want to use a
sense of implicit trust here so you know
I'm sure that many of you don't really
right left you know physical letters
very much these days but when you do
have something to put in the mail I
doubt whether many of you stand in front
of the mailbox agonizing over whether
you should drop that letter in the
mailbox right you don't you you don't
even think about it you just go out
there open the mailbox drop the
lettering close it and you're done so
because you have a level of implicit
trust in that system it's not something
that's a concern and we need to to have
that level of trust of implicit
unconscious trust for the Internet of
Things to be successful on a massive
scale and that requires security at all
levels starting with the hardware and
being able to really control what
software is running really know what
software is running and how much you can
trust the software that's running and
that really starts with do I trust the
software that
loaded the bootloader on the device you
know you've got to start at that really
low level the trust the defrost the
chipset you know there's all kinds of
interesting questions there that are
being worked on in different ways
obviously the network has to be
trustworthy how do you protect the data
and how do you protect applications and
how do you protect them from each other
so there's lots of lots of things that
all have to be paid attention to and
places where a lot of different people
have to work together in order to
accomplish this this level unconscious
trust because no one company can cover
all of these pieces in order to to build
this solution so when we're talking
about security then we we do have to
think a little bit about you know what
is it we're protecting against what
against what sort sort of threats and
typically then we think about you know
three three basic things when we're
talking about security so
confidentiality security sorry
confidentiality integrity and
availability so you know we you know the
recent leaks have told us about a group
called you know tailored access
operations that specifically looks for
ways to compromised devices gateways at
set and things like that and so we have
to be able to protect the device itself
from tampering and that's not you know
not necessarily as physical tampering
remote tampering but if you a lot of
these devices will have pretty important
information on them so if you can
physically tamper with the device extend
it in you know change its functionality
in some way then that will be pretty
dangerous and you know if you can update
the device to do things that shouldn't
you know maybe you can update your smart
meter so it always says zero power used
or the that it identifies itself as
being attached to your neighbor's house
instead of to your house you know
there's all kinds of exploits that um
you know in the physical world and I
think it can be useful to think about
how those might map into the electronic
world for example there was an incident
recently where someone's house was due
to be demolished against their will and
so the night before they went outside
and they switched mailbox numbers with
with a neighbor guess whose house
actually got demolished the next day
when the demolition crew turned up so in
fact two houses got demolished that day
because it obviously didn't take too
long to realize that pretty important
mistake had been made and that they
really had should have been demolishing
the house next door so think about how
that kind of you know exchanging of
identities could could rip B have really
bad effect in the the electronic world
and I think if you can think about all
kinds of other physical exploits and see
how they map into the electronic world
and I think that if you're if you're not
a little scared in some way then maybe
you haven't quite thought about this in
off yet shame there's not a postpone
forever button on there is there okay
next time okay so actually let's go back
for a moment so security of you know you
know being able to deal with tampered or
devices that are trying to spoof other
devices is pretty important you know
other other exploits well there was an
incident a year or two back where the
the IRS the tax authority in the United
States
received hundreds and hundreds of tax
returns all from the same address I
think it was down in Florida and they
they mailed out you know a lot of tax
refund checks alter the same address you
know and it took it took quite a quite a
long time for that to be spotted because
they mailed out the checks before they
actually did any validation of of the
information devices have to be able to
communicate with each other you know
that's why that's why they called smart
devices right because they can
communicate and so all of those
conversations need to be protected so
that you know that the data you know you
know that you can trust the other end of
the conversation you know that what we
are what the other entity is saying has
not been altered or spoofed during
during the conversation so you want to
know that you're actually talking to a
you know a real device kind of reverse
cheering test I guess and you want to
know that you're talking to the right
even the right service on that device so
this is not just about the device many
devices will will be running multiple
services multiple applications so we
need to be able to authenticate and
authorize at that level as well so we
don't want to you know we don't want to
put a lot of effort into preventing
tampering with the hardware if we then
make it you know leave the gate open for
someone to spoof you know come in with
some kind of proxy attack where it
really doesn't matter that the original
hardware couldn't be tampered with and
then availability so you know devices
have to be able to function if you know
if your home security system doesn't
function one night then that might be a
real problem and if the if you can
persuade a device not to send data
that's also a problem if you know if you
can overload a you know a home security
system in some way and so that it can't
actually send out the
that you're the disc you should be doing
then again you've got a problem you know
health health monitoring systems need to
be available so that they can deal with
information in a timely way so so we've
talked about tampering of the device
we've talked about spoofing we've talked
about security of communications there's
going to be data stored on a lot of
these devices too and you know that's
that data can could be pretty important
and pretty private to particularly in
some multi-tenancy situations as we'll
see in a later slide but essentially you
want to know that any data that's being
that's there is only accessible by the
parties the entities that who should
have access to it and then we've got
security of you know availability denial
of service physical availability etc etc
ok so let's look at let's look at some
of the information flow in an Internet
of Things architecture so this is not
you know this is not to be taken
completely literally but by-and-large
then you have data that is going to flow
from the device from the edge of your
network in towards its center and yes
there are always going to be exceptions
to that but that vance that'll be the
the dominant flow and equally important
is that so the data lets you see sense
using the sent by getting information
from sensors then you can see what's
happening in the real world and equally
importantly you need to be able to send
commands out to sensors and actuators so
that you're able to change what's
happening there
so that you can change the valve setting
in that water pipeline or whatever that
whatever it is and so the data flowing
yes it's going to go through various you
know pieces of processing and filtering
and aggregation and correlation on the
way you know this is not just a a
cloud-based system where the data comes
from the device and go straight to the
cloud there are all kinds of use cases
where you need the local processing
capability in order to be able to
locally optimize things we're working
with a company that provides hardware to
utility companies in that's an excellent
case where local processing of data and
avoiding the latency of going back to
the cloud can make the difference
between your Street losing power or the
the next-door street losing power and
the whole side of town losing power so
there are some things where being able
to respond in real time really is very
very important
so the information that's flowing and
that's both the you know the commands
and the and the data it needs to be
needs to flow when it needs to flow
needs to be timely so there's no point
in the police station receiving the
alarm the next morning all right the
information is fairly useless at that
point there is you know it needs to be
confidential so the only the parties who
you think are going to be able to read
it actually get to be able to read it
and then the integrity needs to be
assured as we mentioned so that you know
that what was sent is what what you're
seeing so if you can't trust the data
then the entire paradigm of this will
will simply break down and just to
mention again commands the ability to
actually tell devices to do things and
make stuff happen that's data too so all
the points that we're making here apply
equally to kind of stuff that you'd
think of as data as well as all the
other stuff that has to flow in the
network so what are the you know some of
the top challenges that we need to think
about well you know we've kind of
covered a bunch of them you know
non-repudiation confidential
confidentiality integrity anonymity
you know sometimes sometimes you do want
to be neat to be anonymous and the
ability to link what you're doing back
to an ADA and identity is something that
you don't want and weak trust
relationships are going to going to be
an interesting area as well and then
there's all kinds of issues with the
devices different ways in which you can
try to manipulate or tamper with the
device ranging from you know high
voltage shocks x-ray machines other
other electrical ways of trying to get
into the device or otherwise to do
damage to it
so as we said then Security's an
end-to-end problem in order to be fully
secure then you've got to start at the
device and finish at the data center and
so we need the industry to work together
in order to to make this work and to
create an architecture that will allow
us to create a whole variety of
different solutions that we can be
confident are secure in the you know in
the ways that they need to be next so
let's talk a little bit about what
Oracle is doing in this space well we
obviously think that Java is a good
platform for this and you know job is
already well established in the in the
data center and obviously Oracle has a
bunch of engineered systems that are
particularly good at running Java in
that context we've got a whole you know
vast collection of middleware and
applications that allow you to help you
to build solutions very easily and then
we've got increasingly device Java
running on devices and with the you know
the things that we're doing with SC 8
and me8 then ok what do I do
ok
for hours thank you that's long enough
yeah increasingly then we are you know
creating a java environment where you
know you're not an enterprise Java
programmer or you know an SC programmer
or a device programmer we're creating an
environment where you're a Java
programmer and both your Java skills
will be able to be applied you know all
over the red pieces of this diagram and
we think that's important because there
are you know by most estimates there are
something on the order of a quarter and
quarter of a million three hundred
thousand embedded developers in the
world and that's quite simply not enough
to deal with with providing the
applications that are required for the
Internet of Things to grow in the kind
of way that everyone hopes it will we
think that bringing the Java ecosystem
to bear on this problem is one of the
ways in which we can solve that and so
we're doing things strategically with
Java with the standards with our
implementations working with partners in
order to make it possible to say I am a
Java programmer what would you like me
to do now I'm not pretending I'm not
going to pretend that we can entirely
demystify embedded programming however
we can we can make make it much much
much easier for people who know Java to
be able to approach embedded devices
know how to do it and be productive than
anything that is a you know a current
solution that's out there so some of you
may have seen this in an earlier
presentation earlier in the week we have
been developing a conceptual
architecture for the Internet of Things
and what we're doing here is is not you
know trying to impose some kind of
solution what we're saying is here is a
collection of functional pieces and we
have another another layer of detail
below this that
not gonna have time to go into today but
here is a collection of functional
pieces that we believe are important
components of an IOT platform if you so
I Oh t's not a brand new thing it wasn't
just invented there are actually a lot
of IOT solutions out there but when you
go talk to the folks that are that are
doing that by and large those solutions
are developed one by one by one and
there is no platform for developing IOT
solutions so we believe that the
industry will benefit by having an
architecture that people can converge
around in order to be able to build
reusable components for four different
Internet of Things solutions so we've
got devices and gateways out here so
sorry this this this picture is through
the the traditional way around with the
devices on the left so devices and
gateways out here and with all of these
things run java no obviously we'd like
as many of them as possible to run java
because we we actually believe that
there are key benefits in being out that
java brings in making it much easier to
deploy code and to do that securely and
to change code and update code on these
devices but no not all of these things
will will be running java so what we're
talking about is the Internet of Things
with Java not the Internet of Java
things okay
so over here and you know so you've got
issues to deal with down down here about
protocols device abstraction security a
lot of different communications issues
dealing with devices that are off the
air most of the time and don't you know
and aren't directly contact of all most
of the time so in order to deal with a
bunch of these things that make IOT
different from traditional computing
then we have a device communications
management box here so this provides a
bi-directional path between applications
on the back end and the your edge
devices and gateways
and that that's that's important because
there were going to be multiple
protocols that are used on this
connection here we can't just say the
answers IP because in the real world the
answer not always IP for a variety of
different reasons cost you know existing
existing legacy equipment you have to
inter work with and so on then you know
there's a lot of work been done recently
by Oracle and a bunch of other companies
on identity obviously the whole
bring-your-own-device the rise of the
the cellphone the smartphone people
bringing their own device to attach to
corporate networks that there's been a
lot of innovation in identity and how do
you secure those devices but the
important thing is that this device you
know that your smartphone is your device
and really the only identity that's
important in the role that's important
is your role so we have to have device
identity management so silicon based
identity if you like rather than as
opposed to carbon-based identity and we
have to be able to you need the same
kind of governance infrastructure for
managing that identity and managing all
of the the roles and privileges that
those identities should have and it's
not just devices you know these gateways
will be running multiple applications so
those applications need to be able to to
be controlled and managed in just the
same way as the device so in order to do
that you need a device management
component which is able to understand
the configurations of all these devices
and provide different ways to be able to
manage that configuration then down here
you have data routing and analysis so as
your data you know is generated and
processed in some way over here flows
through here what you what do you do
next well in some cases you may you may
put some event processing in here for
example but you're going to work out
where does the data really need to go
and are you gonna be doing any real-time
analysis on the data at this level where
you've got a chance to aggregate
everything
and yes you're going to be doing some
level of real-time analysis and and
processing over here but that'll you
know we haven't kind of gone into the
architecture of the Gateway itself for
this level and then from here your data
can go into basic this is where you
integrate with your traditional
enterprise infrastructure that's sorry
wrong way so device management talked
about we mentioned that as one of the
boxes well one of the things that is
different about IOT is you know how long
some of these devices are going to be in
service I mean we're kind of used to the
idea that after a couple of years you
know two or three maybe three years
you're gonna replace this thing that's
not going to be the case with a lot of
IOT devices they're going to be in
service for 10 15 20 years so you've got
to be able to manage them remotely
upgrade them you've got to be able to
deal with the fact that you know the
security protocols and crypto that you
started off with 10 years ago don't look
quite as secure and don't take as long
to crack now as they did 10 years ago so
maybe you need to update that you've got
to think about long longevity of devices
when you're building IOT solutions
obviously the management has to be
remote with the number of devices we're
talking about and the fact that a lot of
them will be physically inaccessible you
know man with the USB stick in Pocket is
not the right management model you can't
be good you know need to stop the
production line in order to do a
software upgrade of your sensors
obviously it has to be secured
it's got to be scalable we're talking
about you know tens of billions of
devices you know is the is the
prediction by 2010 sorry 2020 that's a
an absolutely mine you know even at the
low end of the estimates we're talking
about mind-boggling numbers and again
you have to work with so-called sleeping
devices again because of these devices
have to be out in the field a lot of
them they're battery-powered you want
that battery to last for years rather
than week
for months so what that means is a lot
of these devices turn the radio on only
when absolutely necessary and they sit
there essentially dead to the world from
a from a connectivity point of view for
the vast majority of the time so that
you've gotta but you still have to be
able to manage those kinds of devices
and and not change the the model so we
think that identity is some you know an
important piece for managing all of the
different entities within an IOT
solution and you've got a lot of
different things that are going to be
entities here not just the devices and
the gateways they're going to be
multi-tenancy situations where you have
different applications running that you
need to protect each other so you
probably want somewhere grouping those
applications so you know maybe we need
some sort of tenant concept here and
then obviously you've got to be able to
manage and control and manage your
privileges of different applications
what senses is that application allowed
to access what data is that application
allowed to access and so on so you have
to have you know secure processes for
registering devices and developing the
trust relationship with a device or a
gateway you've got to have central
management of the policies the
relationships and the rules that you're
going to apply and this is going to
involve key management on a massive
scale you know if we go really going to
be able to thrust communications that
means we need to be able to verify every
time we talk to a device that it really
is the right device that is talking to
us and that on its that on its own means
key management on a huge scale so I
mentioned multi-tenancy briefly I think
a good example of where this is going to
happen is a home gateway and it's
beginning to happen already in the home
gateway space where you will have you
know a home gateway you'll have
connected devices in the home
and you go out to Sears and buy your
shiny new washing machine and you'll be
able to get a an application on your
home gateway that talks to that washing
machine and life will be wonderful of
course so then you know think about it
maybe you've got an application from
Home Depot Sears you know
UnitedHealthcare your car insurance
company whatever all running on this
same gateway you know I don't want my I
don't want UnitedHealthcare interfering
with my washing machine or my air
conditioning any more than I want my
Sears application you know being able to
get to my medical information right so
you've got to protect you know silo
these things and protect them from each
other
and protect the resources that those
applications consume protect the
operations they're able to perform
protect where they're able to send data
protect what services both locally and
remotely those applications are able to
to access but there are probably times
when you do want some level of sharing
so if I've got you know five different
applications from Home Depot maybe I
don't want to have to enter my Home
Depot credentials five different times
but I'd rather I'd rather do that once
and be able to have those those five
applications share things so you want
them to be separated except for all the
times that you don't so one one other
thing piece of technology that is coming
it's based on existing you know smart
cards trusted element technology we're
gonna start to see trusted execution
environments built into chips access at
some point in the relatively near future
and you can cut quite at a high level
you can kind of think of this as a smart
card built into the actual system on
chip the SOC so it's essentially a place
where you can store secrets and operate
on those secrets so do crypto or sign
things using certificates that are
stored there and
at the hardware level of the chipset
then there is protection so that your
stuff that is running under a rich OS
such as Linux is not able to access the
flash where this stuff is stored or to
otherwise influence the operation of the
of the TE so you can essentially think
of it as secure local storage for trust
information and you could think of it
also as a place where you could securely
store important pieces of code that you
need to know who have not been tampered
with and won't simply want to make it
more difficult to tamper tamper with
them and this is this is a technology
that we believe will be important in in
hard helping hardened devices over time
so we obviously Oracle is is going to be
producing a set of products that
implement our reference architecture you
know we are looking to work with
partners you know went to in order to
make sure that we're after the reference
architecture that we're proposing does
work for at least a sufficient number of
use cases to be useful and so we're
actively seeking you know we're
proactively going out and talking to
people we're actively seeking feedback
on the on the reference architecture
you'll be hearing a lot more about that
from Oracle over the next few months and
we so we have you know in development a
security solution for IOT that is based
on a lot of the things that we've been
through so mutual authentication between
devices and servers or between devices
and devices that are going to talk to
each other you know confidentiality of
data transfer and multi-protocol
networks how do you do that end-to-end
over multi-protocol networks so we
believe we have some solutions are there
device data management managing all of
this data managing where it should be
when how long it should be allowed to be
there managing the auditing you know how
can you ensure that your policies are
actually being enforced
what are the audit requirements for
different for health care and a lot of
other places where you have different
regulatory requirements governance of
all the trust relationships that are
involved in IOT networks and then
provisioning and managing the the
devices and all the applications that
are going to be flowing onto these
different devices so that's that's the
kind of you know product solutions for
IOT that you can expect to see coming
from my from Oracle so to conclude you
know I shouldn't really say this but we
should always think about security every
single stage of what we're doing in
making solutions trusts you know we all
know that it's a truism to say that it's
it's easy to lose someone's trust it's
very hard to regain it that absolutely
applies as far as the Internet of Things
is concerned and if we're really
concerned about mass adoption of a lot
of these things and really taking
advantage of the business opportunities
here trust that level is going to be
really important as I said before I
think that if you're not a little scared
about security and the Internet of
Things and what could possibly go wrong
then maybe you haven't thought about it
enough yet or you have a all you have a
solution that that will make you rich so
everything you know end-to-end should be
secure in order to enable this implicit
trust that we want and so that means
that we have to work together as an
industry we have to partner together in
order to enable that and if we if we
can't do that then we're going to leave
gaping holes that will you know leave
all this all of us with problems so we
all should have an incentive to be able
to work together on this and make this
work we think that identity is one of
the ingredients for securing the
Internet of Things and we believe that
no one company can do everything that is
quiet in this area so we are as I say to
actually looking for to partner and work
with you know work with other companies
in the industry some of whom we
obviously you know compete with as well
but we believe that you know
collaboration is in this area is
required in order to make us all
successful so that's the end of my
presentation happy to take any questions
either now or I'll hang around for a
little bit afterwards so if you have any
questions right now far away yes
well so that the mean that the stand the
standards there are being being driven
by global platform as far as time frames
for you know specific time frames to
that I guess you won't be too surprised
to say that I can't really comment on
that today I'm sorry
mm-hmm
well we we have some ideas about that
but I think you know we we need to work
with you know other companies from you
know chipset vendors device vendors the
network and service providers in order
to be able to come up with with some
kind of workable way of doing this so
that you know so that you can decide how
much you know kind of what level of
trust you you want to you know you what
level of security you need for your
solution and be able to scale the
different pieces of your solution
appropriately and you can decide exactly
how much you want to spend on special
hardware features to enable you to trust
the hardware a bit more or a bit less
depending on exactly you know how much
that's worth to you so we're this is you
know this is a very early-stage thing so
we you know we don't have a specific
initiative in place or anything yet
we're we're just at the stage of kind of
waving a flag and saying this is this is
something we need to work together on
okay well thank you very much for coming
