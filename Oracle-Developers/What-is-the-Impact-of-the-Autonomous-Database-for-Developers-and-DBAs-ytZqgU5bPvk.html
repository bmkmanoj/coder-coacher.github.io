database how are you great to be here
well welcome to dev live here at Oracle
OpenWorld 17 all right well thank you
for having me I'm happy to be here hey
couple things have changed you might
have noticed so first of all we are now
the center here at the Oracle developer
lounge I tell you and it's a lot of
people out here I'll tell you that now I
see you're up on a level that's so
nobody can photobomb us anymore you know
10 bucks for anybody who tries so so it
has been a very exciting show so far but
let's I we have to start with Larry
Ellison's keynote on Sunday sure
the autonomous database sure what do you
think well I think it could shake a lot
of people up I think they could think
wow I'm a DBA is my job gone and the
answer of course is no yeah in fact your
job is pretty safe for a few decades now
I think the job is changing though I
really do right so tell me about like
some of the discreet tasks like for
example we used to change tape yeah not
a lot of people know about Larry Ellison
himself his first tech job was actually
changing tapes at the minute it was in
the middle of the night yet really so so
does anyone really want to do things in
the middle of the night do we want to be
paged in the middle of the night and the
answer is no isn't it nice that that's
automated right so what does the DBA
gonna do well we're gonna move pdbs
maybe online maybe we'll move it to the
cloud I don't know if you saw me you
mentioned the book I have on tuning 12c
r2 but there's another book out there
just came out a week ago on Oracle cloud
because I believe this is where the DBAs
job is moving much more and so moving
things like PD bees online doing things
online is going to be much more
important and leveraging the big data
an IOT that's out there right well
here's the other aspect of the job
that's going to change I mean if we are
going to have major releases of Oracle
database more frequently sure there's
gonna be a lot more patching but you're
not gonna do any of that patching you
get the autonomous database Kym's comes
out for the data warehouse in December
of 2017 I mean it's coming out right
you're not doing any patching patches
everything for you when the database
goes to 18c which it will and it will
come out for 18 C so it's not gonna be
on the year 18 C 4 into 2018-19 C 20
1920 C and 2020 you're on the autonomous
database it patches for you but what you
need to do now is how do I secure the
database how do I ensure there's no
Equifax kind of event at my company so
securing all those pieces and looking at
the entire topology of your enterprise
is gonna be key Wow alright so speaking
of security let's talk a little bit
about obfuscating or data masking or
where that sort of subsection or
encryption right I'm not gonna have to
do that anymore first of all if you go
to the cloud a lot of people don't know
this but Oracle doesn't want your
unencrypted data and it will not accept
your unencrypted data so first of all
anything in the Oracle cloud it's
automatically encrypted it doesn't
accept anything else okay but at the
same time you know instead of doing data
redaction or doing encryption and things
like this where it can do that for you
we are looking at privacy aspects faith
you know a lot of companies you know
privacy issues come in where they get
sued for privacy breaches and things
like that and the fact that your DBA is
not seeing that data or some developers
not seeing that data helps you in to not
have an issue like that oh that's a
relief I didn't know that that was
already in the database though and that
was part of one of those you know built
in well the database has really gone
from you know where it was making it so
I could automate tasks
you know I shouldn't be doing a lot of
things I should be automating them you
leveraging these utilities that have
been out there in the new database right
now they're moving it from automated to
autonomous you know it's like a car you
know you set the cruise control on its
automated you don't have to press the
pedal but the vehicle is an autonomous
yet self-driving car autonomous I kind
of make the database fully autonomous
you could focus on the business more
so no more managing table spaces for me
absolutely okay
what about what else you have on here
let's see there's creating data
warehouse used to create a lot of data
warehouses well instead of creating
those data warehouses they're out there
I mean you got the Twitter firehose
right are you going there to see what
people are talking about your given
product in your company right you have
things like Facebook where people are
talking about a company they're thinking
about buying something maybe are you
leveraging that so once you're on the
cloud now you can interface with things
like IOT interface with things like big
data and by doing that now all of a
sudden you're bringing new customers
right you're making the customers you
have happier you're actually doing
things that make sense for the business
okay so I get and you're more valuable
right you know DBA oh he's here in the
middle of the night I don't know what
he's doing but the system's still
running I'm happy right it's gonna move
to the DBA just interfaced us with IOT
and big data and how we might use
robotics in the warehouse uh-huh making
a difference in the business for growing
revenue streams oh my gosh
even on a level we're getting potable I
got photobombed this morning just to let
you know is that neat but going through
the author so okay I got photobombed by
a bear this morning I was doing a
database interview and a bear comes up
shuffling behind me showing his you know
product name I like just come on into
the university
don't you get in here and I said you
know what about the Bears what do you
think about their season a lion I'm like
maybe Larry can buy the Chicago Bears I
mean he's from Chicago oh my god Larry
by the Chicago Bears yeah there you go
bat out of hell you got an island you
need a team lion Chicago Bears so you
bring up a very interesting point
my job as a database administrator is
evolving Schurman just like you know
with companies for example you know
Federal Express a lot of people say
Federal Express that their product is
actually delivering a package on time
but in reality if you talk to federal
express their true product is managing
time managing time and managing data
right I mean how do you get all these
packages in the right place at the exact
right time and the answer is leveraging
data that's leveraging technology
leveraging Oracle right and so it's a
matter of learning to leverage the
technology instead of managing the
technology yeah you're not running
reports anymore you're building reports
that are predictive analytics about
what's going to happen in prescriptive
analytics prescribing so that you'll
have great numbers right but you're
hitting it right on the head you're not
administering technology you're now in
your company leveraging technology so
the the job as a DBA is going to be
leveraging data leveraging technology to
the advantage of the company all right
so I'm worried you're not you they're
serving beer right over there do we want
you need a beer over here no here's what
I'm worried about
okay it used to be he who had the best
database won are we flattening the the
playing field again I think that
companies that leverage Oracle certainly
are getting some benefits and I and I
could hear as we speak we can hear
pepper in the background pepper a robot
actually was co-presenting with me
yesterday I presented with pepper the
robot and she was interfacing with the
Oracle Virtual Private Assistant that
was over
her over there doing some Taichi or
something but what was that again well
the thing is I mean if we're leveling
the playing field everybody can get the
same powerful database where do we
innovate where do we compete now
well you in every I mean where's the
future pepper robotics how do you
integrate robotics into your company not
get rid of people but use them to
leverage technology Wall Street is
backing companies that will leverage
technology because there's a lot of
companies that won't leverage
technologies and they're doing that to
start to disrupt those other business I
call them disruptors give me a disruptor
where they go into an industry and they
disrupt it well how do they actually do
that they're just leveraging technology
that's already out there you have Oracle
you're like a carpenter with the best
tool that's out there right but if
you're only cutting the wood instead of
building some great design well you're
not taking full advantage of that tool
so does it leverage that does it level
the playing field well not everybody
uses Oracle so not everybody has that
advantage right you know eventually will
they get there well if you're faster
maybe they won't all right then well
thank you for coming on today Richards
great to talk with you always great for
someone to go flying by in the middle
usually get photo bombed by authors but
okay it was signing books earlier to
both and aligned with him and Charles
Kim two-mile-long
oh that's great well thanks again we'll
be talking soon
all right great to see you again all
right have a great day
I put my hand out to shake your hand at
you Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
