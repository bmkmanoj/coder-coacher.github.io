actually setting an excellent example of
what I'm expecting everybody to do in
this session which is not stay in your
seat that's rule number one and you'll
see why at the end of the present the
ends but the the middle of the
presentation rule number two so what do
you what do you do when you're um you
know when you're when you're in a look
at meeting and you want to ask a
question what's the typical protocol so
we're not doing that here so if you have
a question just shout at me my name is
Steve you can hey how you doing what's
your name
Ilan okay excellent Ilan do what Ilan
just did shout at me call my name and
then I'll be happy to answer anything as
we're going along and we have the third
rule too but we'll get that later it'll
be fun
so I'm the Java community manager
working for Oracle my twitter handles
Steve on Java I also help manage the
Java Twitter handles he occasionally see
my stuff on there oh wow that's gonna be
yeah yeah okay we're gonna have fun with
the robot to later you'll you'll be
happy to know that the robot has been
recently tested I upgraded it to a
Raspberry Pi 3 at 2:00 a.m. last night
so this is a this is a real hacking
demonstration of what you can do with
the very latest hardware and the very
latest technologies and hopefully you
guys will have a lot of fun this
presentation so how many of you guys
know what a Raspberry Pi is all right
excellent you can all stay any what does
anyone not know what a Raspberry Pi is
ok so thank you thank you so that was
very probably very embarrassing to raise
your hand after you saw everyone else's
hand won't go up but here's what we're
gonna do we're gonna we're gonna make
one of those hundreds of people who just
raised their hands help explain to you
what a Raspberry Pi is all right so I'm
gonna I'm gonna pick on on Elon because
we're friends now
very good that helped you know the
Raspberry Pi no no that's gonna guy that
the right shirt but you you already knew
it a raspberry pilots your hand went up
yeah so that's that's an accurate
description because this actually is a
Raspberry Pi all right now you'll on
which model Raspberry Pi is this okay so
they give the give away here is you see
that little single single USB dinkle
yeah so we yeah so it's it's Raspberry
Pi model be it it's either there were
two revisions of Raspberry Pi model B
there was one really early one where
they they kind of messed up the GPIO
pins and there was the the cool second
version which has the same GPA layout
that we've all known to come to know and
love so if you're unfortunately have one
of the really early ones your
compatibility is slightly less good
although a lot of the libraries will
compensate for that but everything from
the Raspberry Pi the original Raspberry
Pi be through the relay dis Raspberry Pi
3 are all backwards compatible on the
software stack which for an embedded
platform this is this is basically
unheard of has anyone here done like
other platforms like Beagle bone or
panda board or okay some maybe some
Arduino boards are doing this actually
pretty good in terms of compatibility
but they you know they have different
border visions most of the other
embedded boards are horrible at
compatibility if you write it for one
board you have to rewrite it new
firmware new updates just like start
from scratch when you get a new platform
and starting from scratch on the on the
Raspberry Pi is fairly easy right you
grab the the noobs installer copy it to
an SD card plug it into the Raspberry Pi
and then you're you're up and running in
an afternoon most of the other platforms
I remember when um Gary Collins and I
used to work on the on the Java Java SE
stuff Java SE embedded in the really
early days and you know his whole job
was
just getting new boards and testing them
and you know you'd spend weeks getting a
new embedded board up and running with
all the bugs and the weird firmware
issues and all that stuff so Raspberry
Pi is really modernized doing embedded
board development and it's it's quite a
capable board as well so the original
goal of the Raspberry Pi was as an
educational platform so it's basically a
$35 computer you can use in classrooms
and it as a result it has a full you
know HDMI even has a component video on
the later boards the component video is
mixed in with the audio so it's a three
prong jack it has GPIO pins which lets
you interface with hardware an SD card
the later versions it uses micro SD the
really old versions it uses a full sized
SD card micro USB power the amount of
memory on these is now amazing it
started at 256 and now they're up to a
gigabyte of memory on a small embedded
board so basically anything you can run
on desktop you can run on these small
devices and you're also with the
Raspberry Pi 3 you have a quad core 1.2
gigahertz chip so it's also extremely
capable so it runs your software and it
runs it fast and this is a great example
board for doing Java projects and in
particular job se most of the projects
I'm going to talk about and show you
guys are all gonna be Java SE embedded
and of course you know JDK 9 is Java SE
and that means you can take exactly the
same code you're running on desktop and
then run it on your Raspberry Pi so what
what sort of projects have you guys been
using your raspberry PI's for anybody oh
oh
solar power monitor so that yeah that's
that's a tough bar for the rest of the
folks ok so you don't have to have
something that cool but what have you
done
license plate detector well it actually
like read
nice nice okay very good anyone else
will do one more yeah go for it man in
the in the black and white stripes yeah
like um what sort of sports
okay real-time analytics it's like a
dashboard on a on a big TV or okay
that's really cool and that's that's
actually that's interesting because it
sounds like it's probably not your day
job to work on the Raspberry Pi but you
found a way to integrate it into what
you're doing within your team and that's
that's one of the the really cool things
about small embedded hardware is it it
lets you take projects from the you know
your software skills is the developer we
are normally coding on computers and
interacting with virtual things and then
move that to the physical world start
controlling devices um start making use
of power it kind of opens up a whole new
range of things to which you can
integrate with with your software
development skills and you know
hopefully most of you guys are Java
programmers so everyone who's a Java
programmer raise your hand okay now if
you've done Java on the PI keep your
hand up
okay so quite a few quite a few so very
good
hopefully I'll convince the rest of you
that you want to you want to give it a
try okay so Java 9 introduces lots of
lots of features into the platform and
I'm going to focus on a few of them
which are particularly interesting on
embedded platforms so you know biggest
feature in Java 9 you've probably heard
about this perhaps from our architect
chief architect mark Reinhold Java 9
I mean modularity and see it's it's so
synonymous with Java 9
I accidentally replaced modularity with
Java nine so that's how much this is a
core part of the release and it it's
composed of multiple jep's jep's our
enhancement process so all these Jeff
numbers if you google them and look it
up line you can actually see the
original proposals for the different
features see you a module system the
modular JDK modular source code so
that's kind of the core modular runtime
images is actually interesting by itself
so I'll talk about that a little bit and
then it also has encapsulating most of
the internal API so they basically
restructure the codebase into modules
itself and then J linker J link which
it's a Java linker and this also is
extremely important for embedded devices
so um oh wow you guys are going crazy
you're having way too much fun yeah okay
so this will be this will be an
entertaining test of the robot I
actually haven't I haven't tested in
tracks which crossover itself but I
think I think you guys asked me and I
said it was okay so we'll go with it
exactly test in production that's the
what's called DevOps way right yeah if
everybody does it but they don't admit
it yep that's true very true you on okay
so um the first one modular runtime
images so basically the you know jars
and sips and well zip zips are really
old I remember using zips and like
didn't they have them back in the AOL
days like the really early dial-up modem
days yeah so this is this is what yeah
so this is this is pretty old technology
so they're they're finally gonna
actually upgrade the format for modules
so they're getting rid of they're
getting rid of jars and zips creating a
new structure for how they're orienting
the modules they're going to use better
compression which will give you better
start up
time and also make it easier to load
resources quickly out of the out of the
modules so for embedded devices where
startup time is a big issue this is
actually a huge performance improvement
for your applications by improving the
file format for how things are going to
be deployed and it can also be extended
to different data types in the future so
you know it'll open up a new way of
packaging the libraries and stuff which
you're gonna be pushing to devices and
hopefully give you a nice performance
bump along the way and actually a lot of
the improvements for performance are
either going to fall in the category of
size so the module system in general
will help you with building smaller
applications and tailoring the JVM to
the size the application or arm speed so
this is a little bit of both because the
the the new modular runtime images are
going to be smaller than the equivalent
jars and zip so you save a little bit of
space but space is not at a premium on
the Raspberry Pi there probably what's
more important is you save some time and
startup okay and this one is probably
the future which we've all needed on
embedded devices for years so has anyone
compact profiles on the previous version
of the Java C okay so yeah nobody really
uses it we are we are gonna have
backwards compatibility for compact
profiles if your application depends on
it
but J link is really the way forward and
this is a tool which will actually
create a custom JVM runtime with just
the modules and the classes that you
need to run your application and so this
this allows you to actually optimize a
runtime just for the application and
then have a very small executable which
is what you're actually going to be
running as your application on device so
there's a lot of possibilities for this
on especially on small embedded
platforms this allows you to get run
java where normally it wouldn't fit
space wise it also allows you to save
space on larger devices
and will hopefully help improve startup
time and performance since you're going
to be having less classes and less blow
to your application in the in the
runtime itself and anything which
jailing spits out is considered a valid
Java Runtime that you can use with your
application so I think the way the the
licensing works on this is you're not
allowed to modify the Java runtime
yourself right so you can't you know you
can't arbitrarily go and modify it and
and publish a new version of the JDK but
j-link can modify it and then if you can
distribute that modified version with
your application so it's like you're
creating a modified JV JDK just for your
application and then just for general
usage a shell is a really important
feature because you can actually easily
execute commands on the command line so
for example if you wanted to test the
GPIO pins on a device or you wanted to
quickly do something on console this
lets you pull up a read eval print loop
so basically you type J shell you get up
a prompt and then you can type commands
directly into it and it gets rid of a
lot of the ceremony around Java you
don't need a main class you don't need
all of the imports and you can start
directly using things and then you know
similar to other scripting languages
like Python Ruby then you can actually
get a few things quickly done on the
shell in Java without having to create a
whole application in class to test it
run Java
okay so the question the question is can
you run Java as a script similar to how
you doing in school that's that's it
that's a really good question we can we
can check the command-line arguments to
J shell later and see if you can pass it
a file it's it's it sounds like it
should be possible yeah yeah it should
be possible I don't know if we're
encouraging or not so we'll say but I
mean rebels are really common in
different languages so it's a it's a
really popular feature set and Java just
hasn't had it for a while and this also
makes it much more approachable to young
coders so students and kids and other
folks who are picking up Java for the
first time it's fairly unapproachable to
have all the ceremony around getting a
main class before you even see your
first results so this matters to me
since I a lot of young kids actually the
the young kids are really good at this
stuff too they can they can build
hardware better than we can
okay and the last main feature of Java
non- call out and you can check the full
list of jep's
on the java behind the open JDK 9
website but I think another one which is
useful to mobile developers or embedded
developers is the fact that we now have
an upgraded HTTP 2 stack so particularly
if you're running like a web server if
you're accessing your device over HTTP
this should allow you to take advantage
of the new HTTP 2 and WebSocket
implementations and give you a better
API and also compatibility with the
latest standards ok so there's also some
changes under the hood that they're good
but they're also bad and I'll go through
those this is this is when you you know
if you've if you finish your breakfast
nvm you have any fruit left over just
get it ready and you can start tossing
at me as a as a as a proxy for Oracle
direction so you notice those red marks
on the screen there yeah so this one
here not available
available so this is why I was upgrading
my robot last night hi I forgot that I
had a I thought it was a Raspberry Pi 2
inside because it had the the 4 USB
jacks and I forgot it was one of my old
B pluses I had on this and I didn't
actually have it on a compatible
operating system so the Raspberry Pi a B
B+ and 0 all use the the older ARM
version 6 processor so basically all of
your single core raspberry PI's and
those are in the not supported category
and I'll explain to you why it's not
supported there's a good part of not
supporting it then there's well the bad
part you know it because you can't run
stuff on it so the good part of not
supporting is where we we upgraded the
the compiled Java binaries from thumb to
thumb to support so in the arm
instruction set there's four 16-bit
processors there's the instruction sets
called thumb and it's somewhat limited
because it's designed for 16-bit
processors so there's a lot of things
where you have to use multiple
instructions to get the same get the
same effect so you end up with larger
binaries because it's using more
instructions and slightly reduce
performance so for backwards
compatibility the Raspberry Pi
foundation back ported Debian Linux to a
thumb architecture so originally the
embedded Debian didn't work on thumb it
was only thumb two that's why raspbian
works on the older chips all these
raspberry PI's if you notice Ubuntu
which also has embedded builds they only
support raspberry PI's twos and threes
for exactly the same reason so there
they're targeting arm version seven and
up and specifically the new thumb to
support in some of the new instruction
sets so it's well it's it's awesome to
be able to run on older hardware the the
problem is there's there's a cost both
in terms of more testing and more
platforms to run on and also
an older processor set older instruction
set so we made the decision to cut over
and use the new thumb to support but
that limits the platform to raspberry
PI's 2 and above so if you're on an
older Raspberry Pi you're gonna have to
stay on Java 8 or compile your own
binaries and then hack the code so I'd
recommend staying on Java 8 if you're on
raspberry PI's 2s and a 2 and above then
you can take advantage of the new
release so a little bit of good and a
lot of bad so any fruit yep okay this is
where the fruit starts no no g1 garbage
collector so I believe this is another
testing resource issue with actually
making sure g1 works well specifically
on the arm 32 platform so I think it
does work and g1 is an option but it's
not going to be a support adoption and
definitely not the default option on the
platform for small embedded devices this
actually probably isn't that much of a
deal because you don't really want to
spend a whole processor the way g1 works
is it does collections while the
applications running so it's it's
slightly better because it's it's
theoretically more pause less but then
it eats up one of your processor threads
or one of your processors in a
multiprocessor system to do the garbage
collection so you constantly have
background processes doing garbage
collection so you can use g1 but
probably stick with CMS or one of the
other garbage collectors on the small
embedded devices okay let's see no fruit
yet how you guys feeling okay there we
got one guy in the back who's got a
banana for me actually I could use a
banana and alright now here you can
really lob it okay so so somewhere along
the way in Java 8 we we released Java FX
support and that's going to continue in
Java 9 there's no official Java FX
support so swing and AWT both work they
both work on all the way up to the
latest version of Java 8 at some point
in the middle of the Java 8 releases I
can't remember exactly which minor
number we we dropped support for JavaFX
and you could only use swing and AWT so
if you're doing anything with GUI or
with screens then you know this is
challenging because swing and AWT are
much older toolkits I'm like the
monitoring system you're mentioning what
do you use for the UI for that okay so
using swing so you're okay you'll still
be able to run that but if you want to
upgrade to Java effects it's more
challenging ah okay so somebody was was
pointing out that the point of FX is to
support multiple make it easy to support
multiple devices and operating systems
and stuff so why wouldn't we support arm
that's an excellent question I will yeah
that's an excellent question I'll
definitely ask the T I think it's I
think it's a mainly a resource issue in
terms of embedded platforms typically
have different graphics chips which are
harder to support so I know they spend a
lot of time originally with bug fixing
it's basically an OpenGL stack at scorn
so you can sit on top of different
graphics architectures but optimizing it
for performance is hard and also it's
yet another platform to test so a lot of
this goes in line with reducing the
number of platforms which we have to
test and certify Java on so it is is
probably something if you guys feel
strongly about you should you should let
us know so you just did and I think you
are as well but as of now this is what's
going to be shipped with 9 so unless
somebody screams loudly then this is
what you'll get
so I
we alright so we have it we have a
motion to vote all right so that I don't
like to do votes in my sessions because
whenever you you vote in the session
it's awkward have you ever been in a you
present Brendon isn't it awkward when
you're you ask people to vote and then
people are like asleep and they don't
want to vote and it's yeah yeah I just
don't do it right it's not a good
practice but for you what's your name
man Matthew for Matthew
we're gonna break the rule and we're
actually gonna do a vote here all right
so everybody let's let's start let's
start with the let's start with the easy
one so everybody who who they just don't
care about job effects they think it
doesn't belong on in bed it's like
horrible technology okay raise your hand
who doesn't want job FX on embedded come
on be proud raise your hands
there you go yeah okay so who who thinks
that possibly Steve Steve and Oracle are
making a decision by not putting Java
effects on embedded anyone think that
maybe maybe we're making a mistake just
raise your hand okay yeah so yeah okay
maybe I'm making mistake sorry
alright sorry about that okay so I do
have some some good news to go along
with that and our buddies that glue on
does anyone know glue on okay you just
met them so there are they're Belgium
company they they believe in this like
weird thing called wara you guys heard
of that right once run anywhere if this
it's I think it's some legacy son
concept they're like stuck in the old
Sundays but they they have like JavaFX
running on iPhones and Android devices
and raspberry pies and they seem to
think it should run everywhere it's kind
of weird and on the downloads page for
for gluon you can actually pick your
your SDK which you want to download so
they they basically release free
binaries and then they also have their
own features on top of it which are kind
of value-added services which you can
purchase from them so they actually
extend the platform a little bit with
their own with their own additions and
then they release the core functionality
for free and you get Android SDK and iOS
SDK and an embedded SDK and currently
this is the best way to run Java effects
on Raspberry Pi with Java 8 so if you're
doing like for example for those screens
you want to do if you wanted to do some
animations or effects with Java effects
you could grab the the gluon Java FX
embedded SDK there's instructions in
there docs on how you can either have
your application call it or link it in
with the existing JVM on your
application on your device and you know
within like a half an hour you're up and
running with Java FX in your application
on small embedded devices so it works
well I use this for my kids workshops
we're actually using this for all the
demos in the hub as well if you've seen
the has anyone been to the Java hub yeah
ok a few folks we're gonna fix that for
everyone else soon but that has lots of
great examples of Java embedded
technology and they also ship scene
builder
so do you guys know what scene builder
is okay a few hooks and we're in the
room saying it so scene builder is a
drag-and-drop GUI builder for building
JavaFX applications yeah yes yes that's
correct so we we don't support scene
builder but we we open-source the
codebase and gluon has continued
development of scene builder it creates
F XML files you can use these F XML
files on your embedded devices for your
desktop you eyes and I also we use this
for all of the hub experience as well so
all the you is running in the Java hub
are also built using scene builder and
the cool thing about scene builder a lot
of the swing GUI builders they would
have to generate code and like um what's
that one in Nepean smoke motif mati I
can't remember starts with an M what
Mateus Matisse Matisse yeah that's it so
that I believe that generates code right
it spits code out at the end but the
problem with swing and earlier toolkits
is there wasn't a clean separation
between code and design and so with
JavaFX they fix this so this just spits
out an XML file an F XML file for the
markup and you can edit that offline the
code has a controller file which
integrates with this and you can
communicate between the controller and
the user interface pretty easily so it's
bi-directional and it also gives you
dependency injection so if you're used
to using on your Java EE apps this also
supports di and what that means is when
you make changes to the UI you don't
break your code when we change this to
your code you you don't break the UI and
you can actually have separate designers
but I mean just as an individual
programmer this is wonderful because
your you're no longer worrying about
like did I make a change to the
auto-generated UI code such that it
won't open in the editor anymore it
always works so anyway gluons doing
really cool stuff check out their site
support them it's a really small
banane the the founders are Java
champions and folks who are really
passionate about JavaFX technology so um
give them give them all hands and the
you can see their community app in the
store at gluon HQ comm / Java one so
this is actually a and if you're taking
a picture of the screen don't download
the app on your phone why do you have a
phone for so go go here to this URL and
download or yet the easier way is in the
App Store either the Play Store or the
iOS store just type in Java 116 and then
I'll get you the the gluon app will come
up or even searching for Java 1 it's the
besides the official app it's the second
one in the menu okay so anyway they were
really cool they built this entirely and
Java effects technology I'm sure it
would run on embedded too if you want to
run it there and ok so we have somebody
who says it runs better than the
official one yeah so as as an official
representative the Oracle events team I
I would have to say we're very
disappointed that you don't like our
official application and we're gonna
attempt to approve it thank you for the
feedback yeah yeah ok so um let's do a
little demo action so we got our we got
our make block line runner who we're
gonna we wanted to get to run around the
stage a little bit this guy is one of
the projects from the the Raspberry Pi
with Java book which I wrote and he's
he's got some fun sensors on it while
we're talking I'm gonna I'm gonna see if
I can't bring him to life dude
okay so the question was do I have the
design online I believe the answer is
yes
okay so this this is actually all the
parts for it so I did I did and Earl Wow
okay so I have all the code online so
you can see all of the the code for
running this in my github repo for the
book so if you look just look for
raspberry pi with Java you'll see the
full github repo the code the the
hardware and the parts are from a
company called make block in Hong Kong
and they have this this cool thing with
these extruded aluminum things so it's
kind of this is kind of like Legos for
big kids so what they've done is they've
they've basically taken this this idea
they found out about this in a assembly
plant where one of the workers had
created these ridged grooves and in a
extruded aluminum and then they could
screw into it at any points because they
just put straight vertical grooves here
and then you can use those as screw
treads to screw in and it's extremely
tight even though it's only pulling
holding from two sides you can get
really strong connections so between
that and the holes on all the different
sides of this you can really orient and
screw things together quite tightly and
quickly so um you know like normally if
you if you had a demo you wouldn't just
toss it around but this is it's a really
robust demo you can just fling it around
and it's quite it's quite good and the
full the full builds for it picture by
picture is in the book raspberry pi with
Java so if you want more detailed
instructions than code and kind of
hardware then you can um you can follow
the instructions of the book and try to
replicate it exactly okay and I'm also
going to give this guy Lowell Wi-Fi
access point he is he is running Java 9
so what we've got going on on him is we
have some GPIO code using pi for J the
PI for J library is a really great open
source library for doing access on GPIO
pins
it supports straight GPIO turning on and
off it supports doing things with small
analog to digital boards SPI interface I
squared C devices you can even do one
white one wire stuff with it or I think
that's a coming feature as one wire
support but there's there's just a huge
breadth of hardware which the library
supports and the guy who who built this
Robert Savage is a really cool guy as
well so he's a embedded hardware hacker
himself it sits on top of the wiring PI
library and it works on the latest
version of Raspberry Pi so it works all
the way up to Raspberry Pi threes and
zeros so he's doing been doing a really
good job keeping up the the code base
and here you can see the line follower
so it's pulling two pins for the line
follower and based on whether the
sensors see white or black it will
change the direction of the robot with a
very simple algorithm to try to stay on
the line alright so for our for our
folks in the audience who are um I'm
good at theorizing and algorithms what
what do you think happens when our robot
hits a cross in the road
anyone want to take a guess
okay so we said me said it stops okay
what spins maybe it spins in a circle
reverse okay those are all really good
guesses because I don't know the answer
but we're gonna we're gonna find out
hopefully and see what happens
okay so miraculously this this never
this never happens with hardware demos
miraculously I'm in the robot now and
you can see my mess of a file system but
we should we should have a JDK build
this here as well
JDK 9 we have Java
okay so we're running a early access
release of Java 9 the same one you can
download straight off the Java 9 website
the open JDK 9 website choose the 32-bit
version when you download it even though
the raspberry pi 3 is technically a
64-bit architecture they still compile
raspbian for 32-bit OSS so you still
want the 32-bit version I'm gonna I'm
gonna let you in a secret I don't think
J shell actually works let's try it and
while we're doing that because I think
it's gonna just grab this horribly fail
we'll open a second prompt up okay let's
see how we're doing okay yeah we're not
doing that good so you can tell this is
beta software oh we got something huh oh
okay this is good let's see
Oh huh please maybe yes
all right working Jay shell so you can
you can load libraries and do more
interesting things but I'm not gonna
push the demo gods anymore let's let's
get to our favorite little robot okay so
you can run things directly on the
command line here but what I'd actually
recommend is using IDE integration and
you can do this in IntelliJ you can also
do it in NetBeans NetBeans has built-in
support IntelliJ there's a Raspberry Pi
plug-in that you can use and for
somebody who's an eclipse guru they
probably know the appropriate plugin for
that as well but remote debugging on
your device is really the way to go so
in NetBeans the way you do it and you
can see all my little different
platforms for different raspberry PI's I
play with at home you add platform
choose a remote Java standard edition go
next tell it your um you know I want to
create a test platform my hostname
username password okay and this one this
one's a little tricky the remote JRE
path on devices is is difficult to
figure out so in this case we're gonna
point it to the Java 9 directory which
is just home pie JDK 9 and if you try
this at home it will fail and you'll
you'll notice it fails maybe it works
maybe it fails oh it worked okay there
you go
so things I don't think should work are
working all the time now this is the
opposite of how it's supposed to work on
stage alright so we've got our test
platform and now what you can do inside
of your project is you can just go to
one of your mini projects and then
choose properties and under run you have
to you have to create a new
configuration you can't be on default
and once you have a new configuration
you can see
you're on your test platform all right
so you guys believe I should be running
on Java 9 now right
we picked the JDK we saw it all hooked
up properly we even checked the command
line let's let's give our line Runner a
try all right some I'm gonna I'm gonna
start here well we'll get a little bit
of hopefully a little bit of working
room now sudo ah okay
this is another good trick so a lot of
the libraries require root access like
pi for J requires root access there's a
way to work around that there's another
mode in PI for J where it can go through
the file system which doesn't require
root access but your GPIO performance is
slower so just just give it root it's
faster you'll be happier so go to Java
platforms and the trick is an exec
prefix type sudo and then hopefully
hopefully we're better now no no oh did
I not save it or something something
silly I'm getting I'm getting all my all
my good Karma's disappearing for um
testing things test platform I didn't
know run yeah I'm on that test platform
yeah I mean I I don't know
yeah the directory has an extra slash it
it doesn't matter okay so it worked this
time it didn't work last time so I guess
the trick is you you wait longer you
tried twice alright so we're gonna we're
gonna see if we can get this guy to go
oh oh all right and what's rule number
one yeah don't don't you don't to sit
down okay so our little buddy's going
good now we also have a sensor on the
front of him which is designed to do
obstacle avoidance so somebody needs to
stand in front of him stick your foot in
front come on come on foot foot
oh okay it works so that's a safety
feature but it's using that optical
sensor on top oh come on you can do it
yeah made it I have the motors here at
half power which I think I think that's
not good enough this is this is a little
boring right
do we want to we want to make me go oh
how is he doing on the turn there oh he
saw the turn and he got scared of it all
right so we're gonna we're gonna speed
him up because this is this is silly
that he's going that slow hold on so he
he uses a pulse width modulation for the
motors and so we I have different speeds
in the code and we're gonna we're going
to see if we can't have him be super
fast
rather than super slow okay let's see
where's our motor director line follower
oh yeah that's because I killed the
program and one of the motors kept
running but that's okay we're gonna
we're gonna make them go faster
here we go change speed stick it here
let's see what I pass into this
okay I guess we did this one
and this is hard to see hold on okay I
won't make them speed up twice okay so
um I want to start him all right let me
make my way back to the guy so when he
when he finally wakes up you should be
going a little bit faster oh yeah all
right so let's let's see what happens to
the line when he hits it this time okay
so this is running full speed you see he
has less trouble in the curbs so the
pulse width modulation it does two
things it slows it down and it also
reduces the power to the motors is that
hitting like a little oh I see it yeah
it's getting stuck in that little
section but bump oh yeah there we go
oh he made it I don't think it was
deciding I think it blew through it yeah
yeah oh he made it through that one too
all right so so crosses do work all
right so our our design team did an
excellent job on the track give them a
round of applause all right so that's a
quick example of what you guys can do
but I I have more examples too I want to
show you and there's a there's a small
problem with that they they took all my
hardware and they stuck it in the Java
hub so um oh and here's well here's
here's my Koopa do
so who wants to go on a field trip
anyone in for a field trip
yeah yeah more more okay so let me let
me explain to you you have guys how this
how this works so um we're we're not
supposed to be in the Java hub right now
it is closed but we're gonna go there
anyway and there's a bunch of Technology
demos there so we have a CNC router
which happens to be hooked up to a
Raspberry Pi we have a embroidery
machine which happens to be hooked up to
a Raspberry Pi we have what else do we
have there we have the retro PI gaming
device which is a 3d printed Raspberry
Pi gaming device so we're gonna we're
gonna sneak into the hub early I'm gonna
I'm gonna force them to let us all in
who ever wants to come on the field trip
and I'll show you guys the demos there
and that way we also don't get disturbed
because none of the other attendees
they're all going to be busy in sessions
like you know listening quietly watching
the bullet points reading the bullet
points and will be will be having fun
over there so you don't have to come on
the field trip if you have something
else you'd like to do oh there's one
more example of technology as well so
the the voting machines outside they're
also powered off of a JavaFX user
interface and Raspberry Pi in the back
so I won their way out I'd recommend
that you tests the voting machine we're
not gonna be coming back yeah yeah so
this book it actually has a blue cover I
didn't fix the cover but it is in the
bookstore if you want to purchase this
one okay so whoever wants to come in the
field trip hang out for like two minutes
while I pack up and pack up yourself as
well we're not going to come back to the
room so if you want to do voting do it
now play with the voting machine now
then we'll do a little kind of little
line over to the hub and I'll walk you
guys through the experiences and then
explain what those how those use Java
technology behind the scenes for
everybody who doesn't want to come on
the field trip thank you
very much for coming to the session and
I hoped you learned a little bit about
raspberry pi and Java 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
