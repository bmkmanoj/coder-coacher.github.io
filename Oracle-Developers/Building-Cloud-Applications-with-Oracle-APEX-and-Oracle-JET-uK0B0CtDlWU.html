jet and apex two of our favorite topics
in the Oracle developer space so take it
away well you know we're doing a lot of
stuff with we've been Apex developers
for quite a while we've talked about
that a few times
we're big low code for proponents we
think it's a huge just a huge benefit to
Oracle customers to get value out of
their database using low code develop
applications quickly and deliver them
quickly
but but a p-- jed is rather new so
that's what we're really excited about
you guys announced jet 4.0 0.0 working
with j-b okb brock on that one so real
exciting to see that and you know what
jet does for us is it gives us a
framework javascript library and
framework that we can develop
applications a single time post them on
the web and post them on mobile so until
jet there really wasn't a single
framework that we could develop both
mobile and web apps I mean we have a
great presentation at JavaOne on
Wednesday where we've actually taken a
desktop app a framework called electron
which allows you to develop desktop apps
for Windows for Macintosh and for Linux
so now we've got a single piece of code
that runs great on the web runs great on
mobile and runs great on the desktop so
really and so applications that you
develop in that framework can run across
all three of those indeed Wow
so you know a single you write it once
and run it in many places I've heard
that somewhere before where have I heard
that before oh I think Java used to say
yeah so so how much have you done with
this with this framework so we've been
using it about a year
now and we've deployed it at multiple
customers we use jet in two ways one is
to extend Oracle apex give it some more
features we can also extend other
applications like the application
builder develop developer service mm-hmm
and then we use jet as completely
standalone server less apps and we
develop mobile apps oh good good so
let's talk a little bit about apex
what's new with apex Oh a pecks you know
they had a major release this year with
the 5-1 release we're loving the grids
and we're really looking forward to some
of the new announcements which includes
connecting apex not only to Oracle but
to any data source so we can punch out
to any kind of web service software as a
service
anybody's ERP including Oracle's and
consume data and I'll also post data to
to those systems from you know declare
Bochum ponents without writing a single
line of code about all we have to do is
write a little bit of sequel and and
we're really seeing a big rise in the
citizen developer citizen developers so
that's someone who possibly is in a line
of business maybe not is a it is not a
trained software engineer someone who
just has an idea of a workflow and they
want to be able to pull a quick
application result exactly you know an
excel wizard you know from my own
experience we used to use a program way
back in the day called Foxboro and then
access came out so so somebody that you
know would would do that back in the old
days now they can use Apex and they can
have a secured application running in
the cloud and they can extend it they
can support their themselves they don't
have to get IT or a consultant to do
that development
fantastic that's fantastic tell me about
some of your sessions that you're going
to be doing this week
gotcha sue the first session I'm doing
is really cool it's in the genetic space
we had a customer that wanted to scan
the human genome for certain genotypes
we call those snips and you know they
can be it can be for fun or for medical
reasons and doing that at scale is
difficult you're basically dealing with
48 chromosomes and you know you're
dealing with you know very large files
and you're having to scan those multiple
times so that first presentation is
about us deploying in the application
container or the oracle container cloud
and being able to scale that out and
then scale it back down Wow
so what a cool use case it is me I mean
genetic research sure that's really neat
all right well um we'll be talking
probably later in the week we're going
to do one of our now it's becoming
famous even though we haven't done it
yet we're going to do a tour of the show
floor and look at some cool demos and so
I'm gonna be walking around with rich
anemic and if you've got time we're
gonna try and pull you in on that one
fun I'd love to jump in there I would do
want to show you uh these superheroes
that we want so we like jet so much we
created this guy and this is jet pack
even though he doesn't have superpowers
mm-hmm just like Batman he doesn't have
any real superpowers just money what
he's got he's got money right thanks got
a jet nice are you gonna jet I mean what
else do you need exactly and and then we
also have apexis and what apexis does is
he can interface he's got a hand that
can interface to just about any kind of
application web service and he battles
the dark forces of shadow IT nice I love
it
so if you have anything up on your web
so people can go and check out not only
these superheroes but more let's take
that is it to do
okay we'll do all right but in the
meantime thank you so much for joining
me this morning it was really great chat
with a great show it is a great show all
right will you take care all right you
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
