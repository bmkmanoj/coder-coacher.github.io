this session before it's it's I think
it's the third year it used to be osgi
for the Earthlings meet eclipse libra
before in the last two years go so if
anything fails in the last two years it
worked where am I actual not a full time
osgi developer but at some time I did
some Eclipse plugins and i'll talk about
it later but i took part in a european
project which became the core of eclipse
zebra so I did a lot of research on
eclipse from Oyster around times profile
stuff but you might be much more
experienced in noise gime so feel free
to give feedback I'm a Java developer
for a long time I did flag squid in the
last year's I'm focused on iOS and
Android I used to work at iteration as a
principal mentor which after submitting
this session i joined Intel for the
Android team I'm an eclipse cometer I
organized jejeje stumble and also I have
a bench or badges of conferences so what
I'm going to talk about luckily it's
nothing about horoscopes it's just a
fancy name it's I told it's the third
year so I should I just felt it's time
to change the title of the talk it used
to be osgi for the Earthlings which was
first presented in Eclipse com 2010 I
think that time it was not even libera
it was awesome II the European project
name then I presented at javaone my
colleague brother presented back in
Eclipse cone last year again Joe
on so this year I added a little more
stuff on Eclipse Gemini which was
already inside so it was okay to add to
the titles also some weird girl but I
always took part on the lib report so
I'm again I'm not a Gemini or we'll go
expert so what source gee I just
wondering how many of you really using
go SGI on development or run times cook
how many of you are just interested want
to know about oyster cool basically osgi
is just an architecture for developing
and deploying modular applications
because jbm doesn't allow you to do a
lot of stuff so like adding different
versions of a project trying not to say
bundle also versioning dynamically
adding or removing modules so it's jay
is basically a more advanced runtime of
course if you need things which you
offer but when you move to do is
Javert's you need to be building using
the osgi api's you need to deploy your
staff to the osgi container so it kind
of changes the way you do develop the
applications it's it's not the very
regular job away it's not a lot
different but it's different so it's a
dynamic model runtime for java
developers actually i should have added
the book here i forgot it there was a
book i told you i wasn't it osgi
developer and i have never been a heavy
duty I developer but I tried almost
every frame work almost they were around
time because I was building the tools so
I needed to know what how they work and
what they need to have to execute the
bundles so my entry book was Jeff
mcevers book it was a great book if I
don't remember the title now but if
anyone interested just being me so
containers those cherry round times are
called containers it can run from
symbian to enterprise if any of you
remember there was a nokia phone i don't
remember the model but it was a James
Bond phones it could even run osgi on
top of it it it was I think on simians
60 platform there are a bunch of
different containers the most famous and
most used one is probably canucks
because of eclipse eclipse it can be
labeled as the most used and accepted
implementation of voice GI since every
plug-in which you add to eclipse if
you're doing android or web anything is
actually just osei bundles running going
on a osgi framer which is called equinox
there's one from Apache Felix knopfler
fish micro Jonas Jonas there a lot of I
mean I told you I'm I I tried almost
every in 2009-2010 but after that the
tools were complete and we submitted to
the Eclipse repo and i'm not sure if
anything new popped up i might be
missing that so in 2009 early two
thousand nine when i started on this
project I checked the tools direction
and space tools beyond the boundless
anybody use those
yeah they're cool there were also some
Eclipse plugins the funny thing was B
and E was actually it was a jar I don't
know how it works right now but you can
either use it we are aunt or you drop
the job jar in Eclipse and it works as a
plug-in so it was cool there were other
eclipses plugins abnd tools bungler
packs which was actually an umbrella of
projects concierge but each tool had its
own way to work each it they all have
their own behavior their own nature
later rational tools came out also
spring tools which later became Eclipse
we're go the moment I jumped in the law
into the severed arm what I felt was
okay this is not regular developer
complexity it's more complex than just
the regular guys so it's not the plane
Joey anymore there were bundles
actuators manifests it was kind of the
early days of Hawaii there were
different tools again like the early
days of jye j2ee actually they had their
own behaviors their own complexities
they had their own packaging they're our
own configuration files also different
containers different runtimes need
different packaging and different
configuration needs so I just felt the
early days of j2ee each server has its
own runtime its own configuration its
own way to deploy it was kind of just
the history history repeats itself so at
that time I was
a very I was very into Java and flags
but not really enjoys driver so it can
be a comparison I have rounded ears but
yeah I was trying to understand how its
GI nature how it works so as a regular
developer you also need to understand
how the eye works the first thing you
need to accept this it's a new platform
it's a different platform it works in a
different way so you need to learn your
tools you need to learn how they work
you need to learn how the container
works and gives the errors it's just
different than the regular Java which
again it sure was a similar program
problem to the j2ee era the early j2ee
we had different vendors we had
different tools we had different servers
each server and tool has its own
configuration whatever you deploy to
WebSphere you can't just port to
weblogic or any other server so it was
kind of a repeating problem and also
actually the old j2ee or java web
applications were not really portable
although they intend to be so what
happened in the j2ee the web tools
platform came out which introduced the
server adapters so there was an
abstraction layer between the servers
and the project which enables you to
deploy any project to any server it can
be the web container or e container but
it just works luckily the company i
joined was the contributor of the web
tools platform so we didn't really think
about what we should do on osgi it was
just the same
problem and the same answer looks like
just fitting the problem so what wtp it
offers runtimes adapt picture adapters
for each server which can just bitch
knows how each server works so the
server logic is actually encapsulated in
the adapter it knows what the server
needs from that project to run so it can
also have the target platforms for the
runtimes what we did was actually first
we started copying with wtp classes and
see what we need more to make osgi
worked on wtp which was the start of
asami it always sounded me like a
japanese beer but it's not it what ami
is it's a European Union project it
targets some social needs like such as
energy efficiency removed hell's
smartphone mobility and it was separated
to several countries for example Germany
was more on removed held and i think
spain was doing the smart home stuff and
friends on the energy i might be wrong
on the countries but everything was
based on is GI so they can share the
basics the starting points need don't
need to be re-implemented and they can
all share the same code base first
results was green buildings from
grenoble and smart home from VT key
siemens did some mobile stuff and a lot
of work on embedded site was
did with processed and we were each
iteration was responsible for the
tooling so basically they were building
the applications by that time we were
building two tools for them it was a
synchronous project actually maybe we
should be doing that earlier but well
that's how brokers he works so semi
tools was intended to be four or SDI
developers and already I developments it
started that way what we ain't was an
abstraction layer between bundles and
containers so that you can just execute
your bundle in another container without
doing a container specific stuff the
adapters know what they need to do also
be aims to because if any of you are
interested in server adapters it's
pretty easy to write your own you can
just take out the Tomcat adapter and
check what it's doing and you can write
an adapter for a new version of
WebSphere we did it in a client and they
were very crest like or you're the gods
so basically what we wanted to do is
just the same for osgi we cannot develop
all the adapters we can just provide the
basic ones like equinox velux micro John
a snuggler fish but there were a lot of
containers so anyone can just dive in
take our code from a quadruple story
check what's doing and right it's their
own adapter like five or ten minutes not
more which really Burt at one awesome we
meeting there was some guys from friends
I think it was the micro Jonas team at
that time we didn't really develop
anything on micro Jonas I didn't even
know how to start it so he just showed
me what the container needs from the
bundles to run actually that time it was
the
most different container I ever worked
because it needed a bunch of set of
files so and they were actually created
by the time when a micro new micro Jonas
instance is created so we created a zip
file and add the zip file into the
adapter which can just take all the
files out of the zip and create your
runtime so even that different approach
we can just do it in five or ten minutes
and we could just bundle we can just run
our bundles on the micro Jonas in that
meeting so if it works that way too as I
told you before Oh Sammy or libera the
adapters mostly built on wtp adapters
which was a problem model for us it can
I think its own market since the early
2000 the first demo was on Eclipse con
2010 which was it a huge landmark for us
we saw what we are doing wrong after two
eclipses gone most of the codebase
changed we rewrote most of the cold n by
2011 the project mood to eclipse is in
Cuba incubator I think it's in the
release cycle now not incubator anymore
so from when we started doing kissimmee
everything we had was PD the plug-in
development environment which is
actually a bundle development
environment but specified for our
building bundles which are called
plugins in Eclipse so it's the Eclipse
way we needed to extend PD and we
definitely need to write mark
different type of plugins not only
eclipsed plugins which was different
than PD we needed to support multiple or
SGI frameworks we needed to have a
runtime independent projects so bundles
don't need to implement stuff from the
runtimes the containers and what we
needed is runtime instances this was the
last thing I understood about this
project but it's kind of important too
when you download Tomcat to your eclipse
you don't need to redownload Tom yet for
the second server instance Eclipse does
the job it just creates a new Tomcat
instance from your installation so what
we need was because the first version
which I built was I was messing
everything downloaded I was not actually
creating a new Equinox instance I was
just putting all the configuration files
or other stuff into the downloaded
Equinox directory so if you want to
start from scratch make sure everything
is wasted you need to redownload so this
is a nice feature which we already have
in Eclipse so not having it in Libra
would be just weird so what's the
Eclipse Libra this is all taken from
eclipse website it's tools for creation
of deployable artifacts for application
servers which implements or SJ
Enterprise specification this is called
web application bundles it's tools for
converting jye deployable artifacts to
oil giant surprise to all deployable
artifacts which is actually just which
means actually just converting not
converting but repackaging dynamic web
projects to
education bundle projects so they can
just be deployed on or giant surprise
frameworks it's tools for editing and
validation of metadata of ohj Enterprise
artifacts so you don't just have text
views which you need to write not
typesafe text which is actually an
extension of pd manifest editor also it
includes osgi server adapters which I
mentioned before which provides a basic
implementation of configuration of osgi
based application servers starting
stopping redeploying creating new
instances so basically everything you
are familiar from the web tools just
wondering how many of you doing ever did
web development used eclipse so yeah we
are pretty familiar with webbed toes
platform it's kind of very integrated to
ellipsoids just keeping the same
behavior is very nature for developers
you can just take a web developer and
you can just start building goichi
applications as if is doing web stuff so
in short Libra is adapters for osgi
containers it doesn't have a runtime
information in the bundles the adapters
handled the runtime info it includes
dynamic packaging deploying run running
and debugging yes you can debug which
was not maybe in the early releases it's
pretty easy to develop new adapters I
told you we did
it's someone from friends or the micro
Jonas adapter it was pretty easy you can
okay i know the stuff but even if
someone is a little familiar with
eclipse plugins i think you can do it in
just 10 minutes there's more products
which is kind of cool it just packages
the osgi container with the bundles you
developed into a war file so you don't
need to have anything related to SJ
anymore you can just take out your war
and deploy it in a regular tomcat or any
other server and it will just start toys
chair container and run your bundles on
top of it so the whole war file is
responsible for starting toys Jack
container and running your stuff and
also a Gemini profile which is which is
the osgi web profile I have some demos
and they're also available at
eclipse.org libera documentation video
let's see first of all let me show you
this is the whole liberal projects I i
just updated them so i don't know if
anything new have dissed appears i
haven't done any committee in the last
six months and i don't know what other
guys are doing so you'll see let me just
create a new workspace I have some
I have I prepared some examples on
Gemini and war products they're here
which I'm going to show you but let's
from start from scratch now i'm sure i
have used that name so
that's fair on
okay it's the basic eclipse so what's
different is if you just go to
preferences and servers and try to add a
new server you will just see there's a
new tab of Eclipse zebra which are which
has Apache Felix equinox Knobler fish
micro Jonah's you can it a new adapter
sector I didn't check it there are new
adapters released let's continue it with
Felix because equinox is already in size
it's not much fun to make equinox work
again you need to it's just like the web
tools you can just if you download it
already you can just browse and show the
directory or you can just click download
and install i don't think i have a
stable internet connection right now so
i'll just use an old version to all five
so i created the run time and again just
like the server adapters i can just open
the servers for you create a new server
on Apache Felix I don't have any bundle
right now so yeah I have my framework
instance here I can just start
oh I didn't I think I'll have memory
problems yeah i forgot i had the heap
memory to the yeah yeah I it failed
that's the first thing you need to do
I just can't even terminate it's so
little around i'll just copy that wow
the new comparation fly and let me kill
my other oh it's already died okay so
let's run it again Yeah right to them
I wonder which one should get this one
okay not that one
so that's why you need to have a cross
speaker now he can just dance them like
i have SSD so it shouldn't be take long
let me recheck if the configuration is
ok so we don't fail again yeah psych
chew I'm just running a new eclipse in
eclipse because I have all the projects
eclipse is initiative initiating a new
way clips from my plugins you can just
download the liberal release and you
don't need to do those stuff so let me
reopen the servers view also let's have
the console so let's start Felix again
it should take plus
okay demo gods are not with us today
this is the very basic thing so if this
doesn't work all the demos will fail let
me restart the Eclipse instance actually
let me change the java runtime
okay let's not change it
okay i'm adding the server we've again
just because i terminated eclipse
I think it will take a while I don't
know what's wrong with it with basically
I have the let's continue while it works
what we have here is just like the
Tomcat or other servers I have the osgi
framework instance which is a new
instance from your downloaded runtime so
you can just right-click and start stop
if I had some bundles over here I could
just read employ them or deploy them ed
remove it's just the same major web
adapters web servers work but I don't
know what's wrong this time maybe I
should just create a new workspace you
shouldn't be failing oh let's create a
new one I'll just make it quick and if
it doesn't work i'll just skip it j warm
at first you can just watch the demos on
the website so I'll just continue with
the slides
so
by the way if I choose something totally
wrong it won't work it's it's validating
if you're in store if the folder you
downloaded is a correct instance from
Felix or equinox it knows the basics so
you can just do the mat okay my neck is
failing to it can just list the
directory come on
yep
now I add the server's tap
this is the edge and remove screen you
can just add or remove your bundles it's
just the same it was taken from web
tools so nothing really fancy so here
you can see the same commands actually
there is one difference which we changed
in wtp so we can support libre the start
is asynchronous in wtp so you can't just
make the server make the bundles wait
for the server or or the opposite so we
just did a synchronous start to wtp so
we can support osgi so let's click start
again let's see if it works
okay it shouldn't be Oh again i miss the
ram configuration it's about the memory
okay I'll just do it in a quick way for
the last time if does America I'll just
continue with the slides which is not a
lot
let me delete dose or
creating a new one travel one team
copying the arguments
at first you all seen how to create new
runtime environment for several times
which is not running get there so here
it is and I open my servers view
at the new wizard serve with the wizards
and finish so this time hopefully it
will work
if not all my demo bundles I don't know
what we are going to do with them I
wonder if anything i just pulled from
the kids just messed up my work spaces
okay seems like is it stucked okay this
is the very basic thing actually just
run storage a runtime and it's working
like for the last three years so i might
be okay with failing with another step
but so i'll just try to finish the
slides fast and try to see what's wrong
so if you want to stay we can just try
to make it run so but i couldn't show
you is we can create different osgi
instances from either the same wrong
time or different runtimes you can have
two equinoxes from one equinox download
or you can have one equinox and one
Apache Felix and you can deploy several
of your bundles to one instance and
several to the others which is not
something pde can do in pd you have one
run time one target platform which i can
show you actually it should work without
the starting to server so oops I closed
the wrong stuff nevermind so just like
configuring a new server we can just let
me show you click on the osgi runtime
and
you can just click on the osgi runtime
you can see the target platform you can
add several bundles here for example my
demos would need some osgi companion
bundles which should be here here so
when I add those those are added to the
target platform I don't need to import
them into my workspace or do some
configuration it's it will be included
in this target platform for this
instance so whenever I fire this
instance it will just deploy the bundles
I choose to deploy on this one and with
the widows I added to the target
platform so whatever we what else we
have it's just very similar to the again
the web server you is behave the jmx
console which you can control the osgi
runtime over gmx we have some bundle
overview which shows the bundles you
import it let me save this oh yeah okay
so maybe it works now
I'll just continue with the slides and
later check what what's doing what it is
doing what sector to Gemini it's
actually a muddler implementation of jye
each project can be used on its own or
combination with others or with any
other osgi bundle so you don't need to
have everything in osgi or everything
enjoy ye you can just mix and match
everything it's a reference
implementation for osgi 5.0 enterprise
spec so basically its enterprise osgi
again these are all taken from eclipse
website so you can find more information
on there its original called spring p.m.
so if any of you did some stuff on
spring TM dynamic models it's it's based
on that and later joined to eclipse and
now the reference implementation of ohi
5.0 spec for Gemini on the management
part we have the jmx management model
from moisture 4.2 spec we have
administration of moisture runtimes
bundles services all we are jmx so you
can just use jmx to do everything
actually Gemini is a set of tools set of
projects so what else we have is we have
DP excess and JPA which is a modular
modularized osgi implementation of gdb
see drivers drivers can be packaged
separately from bundles and you can just
add it to your around x or a target
platform basically it's JP it brings jpa
on osgi which is cool it's fun to play
with the
jpa part Jamie I web which actually was
a demo I wanted to show but i'm not sure
if it will work because i can't even
start osgi runtime right now maybe I
should try equinox next Jimmy I rep is
the reference implementation for running
enterprise web applications in osgi
frameworks it actually just creates a
dynamic web project but it's a osgi web
profile on top of it if you're familiar
with eclipse you know eclipse has a
facebook for projects so it just adds a
face to the dynamic web project so it
can be either used because it still has
the dynamic web project nature it can be
used as a dynamic web project if it
doesn't need anything specifically
specific toys GI but since it has the
osgi faces and just run as i always
tight bundle so i should have the gemini
demos here i'll just continue with the
slides and try to make the demos work at
the end and the last part is eclipsed
we're go I haven't done a lot with
eclipse we go but it's again an osgi
based java application server which is
again taken from spring p.m. it used to
be called spring p.m. server it's based
on eco knocks so it's it's not something
new to eclipse it's just the same base
ground you have the tomcat a servlet
container so again it's something we
used to have it supports oyes jab
bundles playing java web apps
shaped library Wars shape services so
basically it brings the it really makes
easier to do is GI on in a web way we'll
go has several good features to it is a
great web admin console it has gogo
shell which is a command line tool which
you can use via SSH or shell it has
plans scopes life cycles for bundles it
has provisioning which is actually a
dependency resolution on your local or
remote repositories which is something
again similar to eclipse p2 if you are
familiar which does the same thing which
does is a similar thing when you install
a plugin it certs other reports to see
what other plugins dead plugin would
need and you don't have it it has a web
container which can run plain web Wars
and it has spring tree inside it
supports hot deployment logging and
several other features so basically
these are my slides I'll just try to
continue with the demo and if you have
any questions I'm happy to answer it I
hope I will work even if not I couldn't
manage the project to start I had some
other sessions I am one today at five
thirty I had one yesterday and I'll have
one the next day so these are my contact
details I'll again show this slide just
in case you want to contact now let's
see what this one had oh okay
it can't just start to Apache I'll just
that equinox and try to see if if
there's a better
I'm on the wrong eclipse that one died
already no not this home yeah okay I'll
fire it up again
okay i'll just add equinox which is less
fun i know it's already included in
eclipse but I'm right what I will do is
what libera will do is it will run
equinox in a different way it will use
an adapter so it's it's definitely not
the pde way I'll just it will just
create a new instance on equinox and run
it that way so yeah
I think it's just feeling the same way I
i just updated some projects this
morning so I don't know if something is
messed up I I'll probably need to check
and you're running off time so while
waiting if you have any questions I'm
happy to answer i can guarantee this
work I mean this is the very basic stuff
we have been it's the starting the
runtimes is stable for more than three
years maybe so this is the very basics
and I had some nice demos but let me
show you the link again it's you can
just watch them running and you can you
can just try it will work so yeah
up can you get a little louder oh I
honestly I'm not a weirdo expert and I'm
just I have I'm i know a lot of stuff on
Libra I know more compared to gym will
go on Gemini but on miracle side I
didn't even know that current status so
I I really don't have any idea but I
think it will just continue because
those three tools are just works as a
whole and it can libera can work without
gemini or will go and others also can
work itself but when you have the other
it's just more complete without Gemini
you can't run the war products on Libra
although you have the shortcuts and
other stuff so but you can still do a
lot of stuff with only with libera you
can just create this adapter your
instances and deploy your bundles on top
of it just like the web way so even if
the others die with just one project you
can do much better than nothing but I
don't know if the current status on
we're going on I hope it just continues
in a good way anything else
so okay let me recheck the Eclipse if oh
we have an error now actually I know why
this happens just give me 30 seconds and
if it doesn't work i'll just leave it
I'm desperately trying to I had several
bundled projects which I intended to see
it show you but I can't even start it
the runtime sir okay it doesn't work I I
leading to check you can just go back
and watch the demos and if you're
interested just download it and it will
work if it doesn't just email me I'm
happy to help it's blame is just my
workspace I think I have a problem
probably even the ones i did before will
