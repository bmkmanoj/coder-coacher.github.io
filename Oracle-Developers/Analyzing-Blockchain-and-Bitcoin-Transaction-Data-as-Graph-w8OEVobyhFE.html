so I'm going to talk about analyzing
blockchain and Bitcoin transaction data
as a graph let me introduce myself
quickly my name is Eve o I am an
architect in Oracle database
organization there's a team called
Oracle spatial and graph architect /
engineer okay so first of all the
almighty safe harbor statement this kind
of protects me from saying anything
silly or offending or whatever okay now
a quick outline I will give you an
overview of watching technology and what
it coins are okay I would share a little
bit into details of Bitcoin transactions
one of the focus area of this talk is a
graph you know how a graph can be
applied to model or chain Bitcoin
transactions and analyze them okay so I
will quickly give you an overview of
Oracle spatial and graph property graph
is a feature in Arco station graph feel
free to raise your hand and ask
questions first of all a few basic
terminology on blockchain this is the
acronym that uses the concept is a chain
of a blocks each block has a few
transactions and some hash code we are
getting to in a few slides but
essentially is a chain of blocks on
Bitcoin is a an application of
blockchain technology it's one of the
applications yes many of you are
familiar with the you know the high
price are ups and downs recently ico
initial coin or
very similar to IPO in a stock market
you will see a cerium ETH and litecoin
and so many other know different digital
currencies in US dollars right
we have dollars you know 20 dollar bill
hundred dollar bill we also have one
cent okay in Bitcoin the smallest unit
is not a Bitcoin it's a so-called
Satoshi is you know the number is right
there you know it's really tiny decimal
nones
number used ones okay so this is
actually a critical concept so basically
it's a number we need to find okay and
attach to a block so that when we run
certain hash on the block the hatchet
result we have a particular pattern okay
so this is called number used ones and
sha-256 is a hash algorithm so basically
it can takes an input and produce a 256
bits hash it's also called a signature
there's a few unique things about this
hash given an input it's trivial to
compute the hash everybody can do that
even with a smart phone you can easily
do this conversion
however given a hash the result is
extremely hard to find an input that can
produce that exact output
oh whoops there are two important names
for blockchain bitcoins
the first one is Wadeye and who is
believed to be one of the first
researchers right who can mark with the
cryptocurrency concept there's another
interesting named Satoshi Nakamoto who
is believed to be the one who developed
you know a working prototype of blocks
of bitcoins okay but we don't truly know
who that person is there are few guesses
but none of them has been confirmed if
you know happen to know the exact
identity you know chop me an email
yeah um mining so many of you probably
have heard about you know the mining
blockchain bitcoins
so there are few pictures on the top so
traditionally when we talk about mining
ray you think about you know digging
hard working hard right dig a hole try
to find a gold it wasn't fun something
you know the person will be really
really happy okay but for the Bitcoin
mining is a different game okay see at
the bottom there's a screenshot of all
those you know customized hardware okay
that are used to mine bitcoins so what
exactly is mining here mining is nothing
but solve that you know puzzle ok the
puzzle in blue found basically given a
piece of data right data contains a set
of transactions the mining is to find
that lumps number used ones so that one
you can correlate your data with this
number used once you do this sha-256
twice you get a hash you know output
right and the output is a number which
is smaller
then a predefined difficulty are you
guys with me okay so you run a hash
function generates a numeric value and
the goal is that you know you need to
tweak your data a little bit right
append are there to build something so
that the output is smaller than a
predefined value and the one of the cool
thing about this well we all know
computers you know getting more and
powerful more powerful and empower for
every single day right so a year from
today you know this kind of difficult
question may not be that difficult
anymore right
but in order to keep the time to find to
solve this puzzle to about 10 minutes
right this difficulty can be adjusted
okay so every once in a while the system
we are determining okay
so now we need to increase the
difficulty a little bit more so the
purpose of mining there are two purposes
at least the primary one is to given a
chain of blocks an existing chain of
blocks mining we are trying to find in
the next block okay so that we can
append to the current chain a side
effect is if you you know happen to be
the one who mined a block who solved
that puzzle even blue found way you were
getting rewarded okay
at this at this at this time the reward
is about 12.5 bitcoins and each bitcoins
is worth about 10,000 u.s. dollars okay
I want to remind you mining is really
really expensive computationally but
it's trivial to validate those results
they say once you know I you figure out
you know the Lance right it would be
trivial for anybody to validate okay
that's indeed a correct walk right so
the combination of a block with the
correct announced I is what we call
proof
of walk okay it approved that sort of
you know you have done the hard work
where you did the mining you found that
not if you have a few GPUs or you know a
set of computers you may be missing hey
maybe I can give it a try
but I wouldn't really recommend that
because look at the picture right all
those you know sheriff's of dedicated
hard well and for people who are serious
in mining they usually find a place
maybe with wind electricity electricity
is cheap right you'll find a mountain
there's a lot of wind so you can put a
farm there just to remind the bitcoins
now if you still have a little bit of
doubt about mining and let me assure you
with a simple piece of code so this
piece of code is written in sequel
actually pure sequel but it doesn't
matter even if you are not psycho
developer the input is this string
Oracle code la 2018 you can put all
kinds of with transaction data inside
this is just voiceless trading and then
well the goal is to find out nuns when
number used ones there's no good way
other than brutal force we try one next
one increasing the further so and so
forth we have to do it in a loop and I'm
saying so here I have a loop starting
from zero to ninety thousand I just pick
a random value there and then we
concatenate the original data with this
nuns okay the next one is the critical
piece basically we run this chart two
hundred fixed 256 hash twice okay
so this part is quick and then this part
is to say hey does this output start
with three zeros okay because if a
number starts with many zeros on the
left that number is pretty small right
make sense and then if it so happens we
find a nonce
such that the hash output starts with
three zeros we stop so if we run this
program in about in a few minutes
seconds we will find an ounce which is
four 451 which produce this hash results
and as you can see there's three leading
zeros okay
so just to give you an idea how it runs
in practice can you see it a way yes
this is not even show one sec
okay can you see it from the back okay
so basically this is the program right I
just described
I say we modified the data a little bit
say Z send Jung 0.2 bitcoins right so we
modified the data slightly adding you
know some text right and then we run
this piece of code in Oracle sequel in
Oracle database okay so you find the
different nouns
of course I am solving a very easy
puzzle because the criteria I set for
myself is that the value starts with
three zeroes but if you just imagine if
the value starts with 20 or 50 zeroes is
a magnet user for hard right then this
trivial problem okay hopefully this
gives you a good idea let's switch back
to to the presentation
so when I talk about this is a chain of
block I I describe it as a you know just
a blocks way they chained together this
gives you a bit of a concrete idea so
each block has a hash of his own as a
particular nouns okay has a data portion
you can stick in many transactions it
kind of change to the previous block by
including the hash of the previous block
why do we do this okay because one of
the nice thing of blockchain is the
whole database way is immutable okay
immutable in the sense that if you touch
if you tamper the data even one bit
right we all know the hash value is
going to change if the hash value of the
current block changes the next block
will change okay so then everything is
messed up so it's really easy to
identify if somebody is tampering your
data so that's the sense you know the
the blockchain is immutable
you can only append and once the block
is appended you cannot really undo it
there are few motivations by why we are
interested in Bitcoin and blockchain so
it's really fun okay and there are a lot
of uses of bitcoins and most importantly
our Bitcoin transaction data in in
public domain if you ever deal with a
banks why if you do a POC with the banks
chances are they're going to give you
some fake data to or synthetic data to
work with
right for security reasons but all
Bitcoin transactions right if you start
a Bitcoin daemon on your computer and
gradually it were polling all
transactions every single transaction
from 2009 I did that it took about a
hundred gigabytes in Disco space so it's
a really valuable data set if you are
interested in to analyzing real world
transaction data
so some happy story about Bitcoin this
young guy about $27 was a Bitcoin for
forgot about them and then you know
after a few years he bought an apartment
with it okay and you probably have heard
the the crazy pieces angry this is
considered the first official Bitcoin
transaction right someone bought two
pieces you know using 10,000 bitcoins so
that's the probably the most expensive
pieces right and but there's a happy
ending so after that you know May 22nd
just now consider the Bitcoin pizza day
okay it's not a holiday
unfortunately okay there are a lot of
uses of bitcoins
the first one is quite obvious ye you
know the price just has gone up quite a
bit so bitcoins can be used as an
investment so I gave a talk July 2017
exam the price has gone up a lot right
to 2,700 and then all the way close to
20 thousand US dollars per Bitcoin as
you can see on the chart on the right
hand side and lately it has come down so
there's a lot of fluctuations so it's
not really for faint-hearted and some
researchers are worried about you know
this housing may fall apart
a if quantum computing a can provide an
effective way to to do the hash right to
solve the puzzle so there's a lot of
financial purposes Rea beyond investment
you can use Bitcoin to buy stuff okay a
semi Expedia or some other service
websites they do accept bitcoins and you
can use it you're going to pay ransom
well
wanna cry is one of the Ransom well
right the demand you pay them using
bitcoins so I was in Taiwan Airport
International Airport I saw a sign if
you carry more than ten thousand US
dollars or the equivalent amount in
Taiwan currency right you have to
declare I was saying hey that's not
convenient right it's kind of you know
it's a hassle if you carry bitcoins well
there's no need to declare that I guess
some people use it to keep their wealth
private but the the underlying
blockchain technology this chain left
blocks rain the distributed in larger
this immutable database way has much
wider applications okay like an
ownership like a smart country actor
whatnot there's a dark side of bitcoins
because this is part of part of reasons
some people are against it right you can
use it to buy drugs if you are you know
a smart hacker you can invite a ransom
well and demand people to pay you in
bitcoins but there's a chip here okay
remember wanna cry okay so it's
essentially a virus ransom well it's a
rapper on top of a hack
developed by NSA but this rapper wasn't
designed properly so even if you pay one
cries a developer array is extremely
hard to decrypt your flyers they say you
know the hacker system they encrypt your
files right supposedly if you pay they
decrypt it but if the rapper wasn't
designed properly so that's an article
about this if you are a victim of a
ransom well right would you rather be a
victim of organised criminal group or no
all right anybody lone wolf versus
organized criminal group well in this
case where if you are a grandma say it's
70 year old you don't really know how
you know much about computers you want
to deal with organized criminal group
because they can set up call center
right to help you to decrypt your files
once you pay that ransom well okay
there's some other talk use is making
you know if we want bribe someone with a
trace
it's getting darker stillness stop here
now let's look at some of the some
technical side what does a Bitcoin
transaction look like so transaction has
a hash you probably have noticed that
you know for Bitcoin blockchain there's
a lot of hashes so is transaction has a
hash and that has an output sound right
it's a total amount of bitcoins
transacted in our daily life right when
we make a payment usually is from one
person to another person right but
Bitcoin transactions sometimes can have
many many input and can have also many
many output okay so this is sort of a
you know tabular form or tax
representation a Bitcoin transaction so
now let's look at it visually so here
right the three transactions TX 1 TX 3
TX 8 on the Left there's one transaction
in the middle key X 9 the green boxes
represent Bitcoin address sort of like
the account number right now say your
friend want to send you some money
yet they need to know they need to know
the account number okay the Bitcoin
address can be roughly sort of as
account number here transaction X Y it
has three output ok can you see my mouse
movement No so there are three edges
coming out of TX 1 I 3 arrows coming out
of it
the second arrow goes to address X and
also is the input to the transaction 9
okay if we pay attention to the TX 8
which is the thought on the bottom left
so there are two output of these
transactions right and the first output
becomes the second input to transaction
nine okay and the output of transaction
nine goes to suite different Bitcoin
addresses make sense so in Bitcoin in in
this world where every single Satoshi is
accounted for okay so now it's probably
a good time to talk about what is a
graph actually what you're looking at it
is a graph okay so there are you know
this dots you know rock tangos those
essentially in nodes way or vertices
okay
they represent the entities in this
particular case they represent you know
transactions on the Left all the Bitcoin
addresses right in the middle and on the
right the useful thing the most useful
thing is a link right the links among
the amount of vertices or nodes so here
this transaction as a Bitcoin movement
from one a transaction to another
transaction or from one transaction to a
Bitcoin address okay so essentially a
graph is nothing but linked data so we
have data represented in particular way
that links right represents
relationships so before we can before we
only can apply graph you know
visualization graph analysis graph query
just how quickly how we can model this
way as a graph so now we have a visual
representation of the data
intuitively you know this is first to
try we can say hey you know we just use
this as is right we have transactions we
model that as vertices we have address
we model that as addresses as vertices
as well and all those Bitcoin movement I
become edges in this graph so we have
two kinds of edges by transaction two
transaction and also transaction to
address and then as I explained write
transactions input are actually output
of other transactions so in this case we
do can create links okay for example
transaction 1 the second output goes to
address X okay and then we can then draw
a edge right from that address address X
to transaction 9 so now we are bringing
the addresses closer okay my goal is to
create a graph with just address made to
mimic you know what we are familiar in
our daily life I pay you some money you
move some money to my account so we have
this account and the money movement
right so here I want to get rid of
transactions I just want to leave
address right and also the Bitcoin
movement among those addresses of course
they are definitely more than one way to
model it as graph so now on this slide
right remember you know the Bitcoin flow
from edges x and y to a transaction and
then go to K and L and Z right so now we
can forget all those transactions and
just you know create edges directly
among X to K X to L X to Z and same
thing for y now if there's a question
right because you know the Bitcoin from
address X ray doesn't go directly into K
or air or Z very how do we
you know calculate the contribution
right so here I'm using a simple formula
to sum it up and then you know depending
on the amount that goes to different
addresses right I use this formula to
assign the contribution so now X has a
contribution to to pay to L and so so
and so forth okay now let's look at the
an interesting pipeline so basically how
we can analyze Bitcoin transactions as a
graph right so this is a you know there
are five steps the first step is to pass
Bitcoin transaction data and then
there's a little bit about cleansing you
know data preparation we need to turn
the data into the shape we need a and
then we generate a graph load the graph
into the graph database and then
visualize and analyze the graph and the
last three steps are actually functions
of so called a graph database so now
looking at this pipeline right which
step do you think is the most time
consuming stab anyone
yes so actually the passing and data
preparation usually that's the most
time-consuming part you have to
understand your data you have to get the
data into a shape you need that usually
takes a few wrong shapes so now I want
to take a detour and quickly talk about
what a graph database is and Vladimir's
you know who the gentleman sitting there
he gave a wonderful talk about in a
property graph 101 in the morning so
this is the same architecture slide so
basically we have
persistent and scalable storage layer
for graph data okay you have a choice it
can stick your data into Oracle
relational database or if you prefer to
use a Big Data Platform we have
Apache HBase support and Oracle no
secret database support so you can start
data there in a very scalable way in the
middle there's a it access layer it's a
set of Java API s which abstract orders
you know many details of different
backends it also provides integration
with loosing and solar cloud right on
the top there's this very powerful
parallel in memory graph analytical
engine which can also run graph query so
graph query is like it's sort of pattern
matching you define a pattern a template
and then we try to find matches right in
the graph for you we have a writing
equation with visualization tor
coresight escape this is not the only
visualization tools with support is for
a set of different programming
interfaces in a Java Ruby Python we have
rest interface and know by the way we
also have a nice integration with Apache
spark okay basically you can define your
data frames in Apache spark and then
analyze them as a graph we also support
a different sort of workflow right you
can pull out graph data from the backend
created data frames in spark and ROM
machine learning jobs using Apache spark
so I won't spend a little bit of time on
PGX itself you say in-memory engine
right in PDX we use very compact data
structures to represent a graph so it's
very efficient you can run a lot of
analytical functions in parallel okay
you can also run the so-called property
graph query language in parallel so here
I'm showing a few algorithms rather
about you know 4050 well-tuned
analytical functions out of the box like
PageRank shortest path
clustering so and so forth okay so you
don't with this but you don't really
need to reinvent right you don't have to
redevelop you can just use them out of
the box we have integration with the
solar and loosing why do we do that
right because if one you are dealing
with a large property graph with a lot
of properties sometimes you don't know
where to start
okay with the text query engine you're
able to pinpoint what it is and edges of
interest and then you can start your
work from there
visualization one of the strengths of
doing a graph right is that you know you
represent your data as a graph and then
you can they lay them out on a screen
and then take a look at it yourself and
so here I have a very nice picture
near the bottom it's actually a graph
about sequel and payables different
sicko statements and different tables
right they form really interesting
clusters because some sequel statements
may involve say table 1 table 2 you but
a different single statement of a you
may involve table 2 and table 3 right so
if you do clustering you get really
interesting layout so cytoscape this is
a very powerful open source
visualization we developed a
 so from cytoscape you can
connect to a Oracle database or psycho
database or Apache HBase okay so from
this is a UI tool one can run you know
clustering find shortest paths between
you know to Bitcoin addresses right or
find the most critical Bitcoin address
in the whole a Bitcoin transaction graph
we also have UI this is from partners
and one of them is Tom Sawyer
they have really high-end visualization
web-based the company is based close to
UC Berkeley and we also have integration
women in curious Cambridge intelligence
one can also you know design your own
sort of you know JavaScript based
visualization for example we can use VCS
or Sigma dot GS p GQ r is a property
graph query language if you're familiar
with sequel you will appreciate this
syntax quite a bit because you will see
select it was a world-class right and in
the Selecta can define the query pattern
say I want to figure out you know the
hobbies of my friends right you can
easily declare that as a sort of query
pattern okay we also have notebook
front-end Jupiter notebook and Zeppelin
anybody using Jupiter or a Zeppelin here
okay good so Jupiter is python-based
wait
we provide Python wrappers to the Java
API there are a lot of existing Jupiter
and notebook users is happening sort of
as a slightly modern look and feel okay
gradually we see you know there's more
pickup of Zeppelin and we offer this
sapling integration in addition to
Jupiter notebook we support you know all
this you know popular API is resting the
face Java groovy Python if you have
tried neo4j or Titan rain chances are
you use the tinkerer pub api's so we
supporting pub api's so it will help you
you know if you want to ever try Orko
solution is pretty easy to to use the
same API is Monas the same API stew to
run your apps right on or cause probably
graph database so this sort of you know
a detour about a or ghost profit graph
database now let's go back to the to our
pipeline to this workflow the first step
is to to pass the the block data
blockchain data right here I'm using one
of the open source a blockchain a
Bitcoin SDK Bitcoin J so with that you
know I can just fill in the block Singh
and then can easily tease out all those
transactions input/output okay so now
that's the year the raw data right now
we have the raw data what's the next
step now I need to clean it up I
remember when I talked about the
different choices of prof modeling right
one of them used to to compute the
contribution of you know a bitcoins from
address X to add just K right here i am
using oracle database because i just you
know take the rotted out sticking to a
table and then use a few sequel joins
you can also use a spark or Java or
whatever very programming platform of
your choice so here I'm using Oracle
database
mr. CEO say an example ray
the family is funny it's a little bit
small but it's one of the key tables we
used right
so there are few columns right address
ray from my address there's a Bitcoin
address to Bitcoin address and the
contribution okay
so roughly each row represents a sort of
you know a flow of bitcoins from one
address to another address now I have
you know a table ray full of a
transaction train full of Bitcoin
records next step is to use the existing
one of the existing utility that can
convert from a relational data source to
a graph okay the API is a convert a DBMS
table to OPV opv is the the so-called
flat files is one of the you craft
civilization format that we defined okay
well just to give you a rough idea so
this flat file is very simple it's a
nine by nine record by record okay so on
the right hand side you will see you
know a sequence of records by each one
in this case represent one particular
Bitcoin address right we are signing a
unique vertex ID and also use the
Bitcoin address as the property of that
vertex so here we are talking about
property graph so we have what are these
energies in addition you can associate
properties puppies and nothing but a key
value pairs right so here our property
is Bitcoin address which is a key and
the actual haxe is the value okay so now
we have the all the vertices in this
graph we can run the model as the same
API but produce the edges okay so on the
right-hand side you see a snippet of the
edges so edges are similar to vertices
but in addition you know we have the
source vertex ID doesn't
what XID okay so we are done with the
steps we we have a graph now now we pass
the source data
we'll get the raw data from blockchain
we produce a graph data then we load it
up into Oracle database you can also
note the data into Apache HBase or our
core know sequel database it's really
simple here I'm showing the actual API
to do that to finish the data loading
when load data with sequel loader we
also support JDBC an external table you
give the username password and the
sequel or the path to the sequel order
and that's it we load it up into Oracle
database in parallel so this is a really
efficient
so um now we are at the most exciting
step okay finally we have a graph we can
run visualization we can run query and
graph analytics so here you see two sort
of a snapshot of a graph note that I
only converted a small portion of the
data into a graph so in this graph we
have about 364 K vertices and the 750 K
edges on the right on the left hand side
you will see this you know medical
address right represented as a vertex
and also some money flow represented as
edges okay so here I'm rounding page
rank if you are familiar with page rank
you know the page rank can be used to
sort of tease out important web pages or
entities in a network right so with one
page rank and then kind of you know
assign different bubble size right based
on the importance of different Bitcoin
addresses so you will see you know there
are some Bitcoin address that that have
bigger bubble size that means that it
carries higher PageRank value on the
right hand side you will see the flow
rate because the Bitcoin flows from one
address to another it doesn't stop there
it keeps flowing right as people are
doing all those transactions but somehow
in this part of the data you will see
there's a lot of bitcoins floating a
flowing from right hand side and then
goes to a sink right so once you
visualize it right once you place it on
the screen you will see this interest
empowerment
you will also see this sort of Fox right
there's a fork you know as another fork
keeps on walking so all of this way a
very easy to observe and identify okay
once you model the data as a graph and
then you visualize that okay so now
that's a look at a few Bitcoin can look
at you know how one can query the
Bitcoin transaction data remember you
know I got the raw data and sticking to
our core database try to do some
cleansing and you know transformation so
part the source data is in relational
form so with a single statement right I
can find top transactions and you seen
sequel so here I mean running a parallel
sequel I just do auto buyers as a very
trivial sequel query and then you know
have a row number less than five
essentially the filter just to show the
first pop five transactions so this is
the data is from one of the early it
coin a debauch so back then the amount
of bitcoins is sort of a huge in today's
standard so if you look at it right this
particular transaction ray has a amount
of 400,000 bitcoins that's in today's
value is enormous but back then it
wasn't that much with the PGX in-memory
analytics you can run PageRank and here
I'm showing a PageRank
output and then to use the Java API is
very OPC dark elf attacks right to read
out details about Bitcoin address so
here the output gives you the three most
important Bitcoin addresses in this in
this data set and you can actually take
this hash Bitcoin address do some Google
or go to Bitcoin info right you can
actually dig out a lot more you
about this particular address I
mentioned pgq our the font is really
small here but you know this sequel like
query ray select and come to em there's
a world class and there's a group I
order by okay so we we try to reuse as
much sequel syntax as we can so this one
can find this particular pgq our query
can find Bitcoin addresses with a lot of
sense
it's a Bitcoin address where you send
out a lot a lot of transactions okay so
we run this this query can be executed
in parallel by PGX Engine against this
graph in the US see there's a lot of
matches if we take a look at the first
one you know shows the this particular
Bitcoin address at the bottom this
address you can do a little bit research
by yourself right just cut and paste and
then go to a website and you see there's
a lot of transactions a lot of bitcoins
coming in and out of that address so I
bet you have noticed one thing in this
data set right you don't see people's
names right you don't really see any
readable easy to read the text you see a
lot of tax hex code by hashes so in a
way Bitcoin transactions are really
anonymous okay but are they really
really totally anonymous well you have
to be careful like in this particular
one right
a newbie is you know having a issue with
his or her transaction so this person is
essentially say hey please someone help
with this transaction way and the
transaction ID is listed there and also
with the the user ID okay boom there you
go so we kind of Revere some information
about this particular user okay because
from the transaction
we can find quite some input and output
right and then from that point we can
associate those addresses right to this
particular user there are some
observations for example right there are
some very active addresses I like the
one on the right hand side if we're
assuming like there's a lot of you know
bitcoins flowing into that address
you also notice that class this way
other on the right hand side I also
noticed this you know very interesting
pattern is sort of you know from one
address to another address and then
there's a little bit a small decline
flow of 0.02 the coin on the bottom and
the sort of repeats you know another
point zero to Bitcoin to to a Bitcoin
address it keeps on repeating it feels
like somebody is doing testing of
Bitcoin transactions
um I have two minutes left this talk you
know covered you know some basics about
Bitcoin blockchain blockchain is the
very useful technology gives you sort of
you know distributed ledger right it's
an immutable database you can trust it
because once data gets into the chain
you cannot really touch it you cannot
modify right we also covered the
property graph database Oracle spatial
and graph probably graph database the
techniques covered in this talk right
the graph modeling the graph query the
visualization analytics page ranking all
those kind of stuff right they can be
easily app applied to other domains so
who are the users that are using graph
technologies usually the customers in
banking they need to model user's
account and the money flow logistics
network asset network a social graph
social network of course right and
security the public sector the they're
tracking terrorists right if one guy is
with the suspect hops on a airplane then
it's important to see you know whether
there are his friends go to the same
destination or a hop on the same
airplane right so those kind of stuff
can be modeled as a graph so there's a
lot of future work about you know to
further analyze the Bitcoin transaction
data using graph like how do we identify
to varying of transaction right because
if value fluctuates so much right unlike
u.s. dollars I mean you sort of can
count down yet this Bitcoin one day is
up 30% the other day is you know goes
down 50% you know how do you keep track
of the true value
there's a lot of resources if we want to
know more about Arcos property graph
database ray there's a lot of blogs
that's a very interesting very useful
sort of getting started with a property
graph an Oracle database is by implement
software a gentleman from their company
called Arthur Dayton he did a beautiful
job we're going to have a analytics and
data summit in March in Redwood Shores
so if you want to know more graphs so
over there we're working to have ten
graph sessions in addition to a lot of
machine learning sessions and before the
right before the event on the Monday of
March 19 we're going to have a graph
develop a day is a four day workshop if
we are interested by all means send us a
email is free registration so if we if
you want to understand graph modeling
how to apply graph to different use
cases
feel free to attend this event okay so
with that I'm going to open up for
questions make yes
so the question is during the data
processing why did I choose Oracle
database there's no particular reason
just you know I'm familiar with both
Java you know and the Oracle database I
can pick a Java Hadoop or spark or
Oracle database so it suggests that any
tool so Oracle database in this case
serves as a tool okay so you can pick
whatever tool you like to do the data
preparation and data cleansing okay any
other questions okay thank you so much
