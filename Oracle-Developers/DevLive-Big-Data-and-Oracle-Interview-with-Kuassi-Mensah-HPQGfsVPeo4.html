here at Oracle code Azrael
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest today Quan Samantha who's
did I pronounce that almost right who's
the director of product management at
article and today's subject is Big Data
although contains talking about several
of the subjects but what's going on in
the world of big data first of all right
so a lot of things are going on in Big
Data so companies are now looking at
integrating you know the relational
database with Big Data and they'll get
more independent producer okay thanks
okay and then either you put your
process on premise if you have the
capacity to have large Big Data classes
such as the Oracle Big Data appliance or
you do it on the cloud with big data
cloud computed issues you can allocate
as many processing power that you need
to do your big day but that's one thing
happening people are moving into that
space either on-premise in the cloud the
other thing which is happening is people
are moving from reactive from proactive
you know which is analyzed the fact
after to proactive analyze the fact
while things are happening for that you
need what is called stream processing so
you even hear about SPARC
Fling being etc but beyond happy
so this is like post happy ok data
development and for that or occurs doing
a lot of things you know I'm only
talking about a small fraction of this
which is how to allow if you using spark
or Hadoop how to access
data residing in Oracle because you need
those data to complement you know to
clean up to compensate to join with your
Big Data okay so so what I heard you say
is that you can actually act so
basically that kind of two approaches
one is for Big Data one is to have it on
Thomas and you put all your power into
that or you have a more scalable
solution which is through the cloud and
you can allocate these sources to that
the second thing I heard you say was how
do you actually access that data the
database so you want to kind of just
elaborate a little bit more not yeah
sure sir Big Data by itself is not
complete you know you need master data
you need additional data which usually
comes from Oracle I mean relational
database iCal or O king of the world
education sector speaking of the
business well we do more than that so we
have two approaches one is in order to
process those data if you don't have
expert programmers in your development
environment you can use the famous
sequel so sequel Oracle sequel is one of
the best sequel engine around so we have
Big Data sequel which can be used to
process to do this joint between master
data or relational data one with big
data and you start from Oracle so Big
Data sequel start from the rapid
database and you can reach out it can
query all other data sources and they
join a page editor that's one approach
the second approach for customers who
are not willing or for some reason I've
already decided to use all the query
engine we are providing them an
interface so they can directly access
the Oracle database to do this ascend
joint operation with
the data residing on the Hadoop of
cyclist so that's what my team is
working and we have the data source what
I did which is part of the oracle big
data connector that's there and we also
looking into spot the same thing for
spot okay
and I think I just off camera we were
just talking about it you mentioned
about the fact that in order to kind of
access to say that you don't want to
make how to kind of copy this data from
one place to another success so
everybody those data shipping is a bad
idea in terms of general data ship into
bad idea so for this particular use case
the big data use case companies today
they the way they achieve this is by
copying from Oracle onto the Hadoop
ecosystem by using tools such as school
or Oracle copied you had Oregon software
called copy to huddle if your use case
is easier you know cleaning of data and
mapping data for consumption on the
other side that's fine but if you need
frequently to access that data from
Oracle so it means you need to copy
every hour and which data to copy when
you copy is already old and so it's a
headache for many organizations you know
believe me I've been when we on the road
talking to customers and we say we
providing this interface to avoid
copying data and do the merge or join
etc say oh that's exactly what we want
because they we're copying over all the
time on that I mean you're talking here
at a at the enterprise or a little work
level for me even at a personal level
when I'm at home I look at you know I've
got my phone I've got my Mac I've got my
laptop I'm just trying to coordinate all
of the things I've got stuff on a USB
it's I mean we it's a I know the the
cost to store data is it is all low well
but trying to trying to keep it coherent
is a much more challenging absolutely
and is there anything so with some of
these services I think you touched upon
it a little bit
their visitor is there some service that
sata3 absolute academ make the data more
coherent than the well this is just kind
of an off-the-wall question right it
gets into more advanced Big Data
forwards mechanics that I'm not very
familiar okay okay okay all right so for
the folks that are with over here at the
show or watching it through the live
stream what's kind of like one take
where you want them to think is there
some way for them to know it off in the
cloud trial credit for five hundred
dollars is that is that can they try any
of these services
- no definitely they can go to the
Oracle Big Data I mean Oracle cloud /
Big Data there they can see all the
offering and they can see how they can
subscribe we also have the Oracle Big
Data compute edition Big Data cloud
computation where you get the density
the platform and you can install we
provided in all those frameworks for you
as well so there are two cloud approach
to big data that are always provided
okay all right well cross here I know
this was kind of very ad hoc but I
really appreciate you coming down and
sharing with us and good luck with the
rest of the presentation thank you very
much it was my pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
