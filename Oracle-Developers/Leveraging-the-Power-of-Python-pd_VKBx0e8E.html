in New York City I'm Bob rue Bart with
the Oracle developer community and my
guest for this segment is Oracle ace
director nom de how you doing alright
thank you very much well tell me about
this session you're presenting today
sure my position is called Python for
Oracle professionals so python is and
language has been around for a long time
but it's only only recently is getting
some prominence out of that and my talk
is about how as an Oracle professional
you can leverage the power of Python in
many different ways and then use that in
conjunction with Oracle database why is
that important and it's important as
Oracle professionals we are very
concerned about data but the thing is
that data is not just for databases only
it could be from many different sources
like for example Excel spreadsheet also
it data some kind of data yeah about
that also comes from other sources which
is not convinced now take for example
Twitter or Facebook etc yeah and it's
all important as well so those it has to
be analyzed and consumed in some format
as well so and so the two are the
multiple types of data coming in and
that to be digested and maybe you put a
summary of all that in the Oracle
database the glue that that makes it all
happen is Python that's a very important
part of it then - is also language of
data science so and as Oracle
professionals we have to know about it
is in some way other so now in Python
helps as well and the final one is that
visualization data visualization is very
important right and instead of buying an
expensive package Python has many
built-in libraries completely free that
you can do great visualizations I'll be
showing all that thing in my session
today I have written an article series
called Python for Oracle professionals
ah okay so it's there and we serve a
tutorial series with the videos quizzes
and everything we're at Oracle
professionals who wanna would adopt
Python
what's the major challenge for that most
people think that is very difficult to
learn a language unless you are in
college or something
I'm still having trouble with English
extra so so
so what I try to break it down to that
so if someone tells you the comparison
of the language you're going to learn
the language you know already for
example if you know English so loosely
wound long Spanish so instead of
starting with the grammar and
punctuation everything from there
what if somebody tells you okay here is
the Spanish word for English some of the
concern of the few words you have to
know you'll get you static so that makes
it very interesting and easy for you to
jump start so of course once this
happens then it can become more
proficient all that is that initial step
people find very difficult and that's
what I'm trying to break that it's not
that difficult actually Python is very
similar not exactly same similar to
pl/sql tell me about an interesting
project that you've worked on recently
we try to do something called Twitter
sentiment analysis trying to find out
how people are talking about your
company no positive way a negative way a
new true Oh what are they talking about
specifically etc of course you can't go
through a human cannot go through every
tweet unless of course they come from
certain president of a certain country
and go through Twitter and finger route
but you need is some kind of a machine
to do this analysis and python actually
has libraries to do all this Wow it
requires some coding of course but is it
very easy to do the coding right I'll be
showing that today actually how to do
that Twitter and analysis and also store
the information back into the Oracle
database for analysts in the future yeah
so that I have done in the past so we
try to move the sentiments back into the
products development in the company and
try to find out a development is in it's
consistent with what we see in the
marketplace so you know our consumers or
is different that's very important
though they are diet in the past
privileged to rely on service which is
very limited twitter is like a universe
data is available for anybody to consume
it's beautiful this is all over the
world can we get that thing so you don't
have to go through statistical sampling
you actually got the real data from the
real sources so that's something abroad
so what's next so I'll be talking much
multiple things one is called micro
services I think that's a very important
thing for Oracle professionals to
understand and do it and that's the
future is going to be yeah the challenge
is going to be how we can enable Oracle
Gabe is in the micro services
environment well obviously it's all in
details so that's something I'll be
talking about as well and that's an
I've been working on for last two years
because technically Oracle database is
not conducive to containers I'm gonna
prove that wrong it's not okay yeah okay
so I'm going to say that like that is
how to do that so all the details of
that data science is something I've been
working on as well so I'm going to put
that together too for Oracle
professionals what they have to pick up
a data science not just simple mean
median average etcetera that's not
important
more like correlation trying to pour
models trying to find out what to do and
not necessarily for market also for
Oracle database infrastructure as well
for example do I run out of CPU in next
six months or one year what are the
likelihood of that happening yeah and
how can i model a that around those
things are important and it's not money
I don't see many people doing that
miserable talk about you know like
consumer impressions or preferences this
is dry but not necessarily data center
instant to specific space that's
something algorithm if you want more
information on Python and Oracle
database and anything else that
developers might be interested in visit
developer oracle.com thank you for
watching for the oracle developer
community i'm bob Rubert stay tuned
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
