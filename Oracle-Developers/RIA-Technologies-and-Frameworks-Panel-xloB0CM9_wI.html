the rear technologies and framework
panels so we take it slow for the starts
we're waiting for some CGI to show up
again got the wrong bag but I think we
can start with the with introduction of
the the cast here so a NAPA buttock Lee
auto rang so we got another zombie ray
from from canoe engineering they will he
sleep the Griffin groovy guy no yeah
okay if the word from groovy guy and we
get a carrot room vault so he was the
job expecially now he's the job X
specialist and IOT guy so I'm he will
bring the IOT perspective in our
Piniella and he ran away from ken you
and that has joined Oracle yes I was why
i had just update that slide from last
year so and you're wearing the red shirt
and he very confused yes a so the panel
works when itself you see all right so
we got max yes so specialized in lab
things try alright and we get Kevin
alright so you see long list so probably
you know him so for me I'm a little
different maybe but more Android iOS and
html5 stuff so he's blue line who
decides about native for html5 for
mobile absolutely so okay so we got some
questions for you then probably and so
I'm from Aris difference in space and
I'm just your host for this session
alright so welcome back Tony so what
we're doing first we have to think of
Steven Chen who has been part of this
panel for the last couple v
this but well now he is just too busy to
do other things so so Steve actually
although he kind of is in charge of the
content of the the whole conference and
all he i think he double booked himself
so he's actually giving it an agile talk
right now so oh he's the former fi
mythologist talk I just went by okay too
bad so yeah so maybe next year so okay
let's now start with the the poll we
have to do so what technologies are you
using so from the top we begin with
html5 who's using html5 whoo ok so I'm
sorry that was thirty percent maybe so
who's using swing yeah my brother's so
that's this more than html5 swt anyone
okay that's great we can skip this from
the list for next year anybody doing
javafx 83 d that's great three steps
great sure if there's any more session
about job x3 those guys really do
rocking things anybody using Duke script
yeah so okay at least one so the new kid
on the block next year everyone will
raise your hand yeah we will we will
keep track of that so any other
technologies I should have mentioned GWT
so okay JWT what is javascript in
this is a guy like JavaScript but it's
not so severe I would propose since no
one here is using Duke script then maybe
we have them come up and give a like a
30 second what it what is it and then I
can I talk about a Duke script yeah you
want to do that yeah come on up and all
right tell us what today that's a good
come on this is awesome so where can i
use the hdmi you can't sure no just just
tell us what it is we don't take over
the session just say let me let me
introduce you that's Tony Apple fellow
dream team member and Dukes choice Walt
winner for Duke script so okay do you
have a browser then just tell us what it
probably a stellar okay so Duke script
is basically light white light weight
technology for creating java
applications that run on any client like
iOS android desktop and even in the
browser so all you need is a virtual
machine and html5 component and we do it
together and so you can write java code
and we'll create great you ice and I'll
Jerusalem so where can folks go to learn
more to Duke's crib com awesome thanks
dot com or.org Oh Duke's crib calm
arc as well but that's the first one
that I found ok all right ok so that was
the technology list so now about a frame
works here using to do things so um
anybody using netbeans or CP out their
hands a few hands okay Jake lips r CP 00
so for my guys don't be shy so Griffin
that's one on the back I see him so new
things like GFX clips already know
probably not so I don't have to ask
about EFX jquery ok those are the
JavaScript guys done and the deuce coupe
skies alright so any angular folks out
there all right I us okay Wow was it iOS
yeah I can see you now no one there are
three people yeah once I say okay so so
there's Java conference you know so
they're using it but they don't develop
for it ok so I thought it might be a
good idea to figure out what language
you are using to do you're a development
so who's doing java that's great so
groovy yeah that's good scala ok some of
those guys in the background they just a
back-end programmers cloture more
tumbleweeds javascript ok I think we
covered that one and anybody doing Jason
and we are still guys doing xml so yeah
we ran out of buying a bracket yeah
anybody out there using IE six no all
right ah ok you're not doing I fix them
all all right good so we now know what
you do we can start you ask questions so
let's see to get it going so I've one
for Kevin native or html5 what's up this
year so I think it kind of depends on
the type of app that you're using right
there's a lot of folks out there who are
building internal apps administrative
apps things that are seeing you know
only within your company I think for for
stuff like that you can throw something
up really quick with html5 and really
get the job done there's a lot of other
great tools out there phonegap Cordova
you've got the appcelerator titanium
stuff those tools are amazing so if you
want to throw up an app that's pretty
good works really you know works fairly
well they're fairly perform at nowadays
that's a really great way to go on the
other hand if you're doing something
where you know the bread and butter of
your company is that app and how it
performs and how slick it is and you
know getting the the best out of that
platform and making things look and feel
and smell like a native application then
I highly recommend doing native
development so almost all the work that
I do maybe maybe all the work that I do
is in native development either native
Android native iOS or native html5 so it
is a huge huge burden to do things three
times but it's just the reality of an
Android user wants apps to feel like
Android and iOS user wants things to
feel like they're native you know male
and sort of not feel like gmail
and the platform's behave very very
different nav controllers in the iOS
world vs. action bars and Android and I
think those who try to use some sort of
abstraction framework I think they're
going in the wrong direction ok so just
wanted to know that you know ask
questions so you're very welcome to
shoot I think you want to know so from
the beginning so yeah yeah so my
thoughts are if you are going to do
something on the web do it responsive so
use media queries so that the layout and
the CSS adjust based on the size of your
screen and so that when you're on tablet
it feels like it was written for tablet
when you're on a small mobile device
menus change things shift and adjust
it's not that that much work to do it
boot straps are a great framework for
going out and doing that highly
recommend it you know looking at
something like bootstrap to do that but
but really the secret there is the media
queries that ncess that make it possible
so and not only like you know I talked
about iOS Android and web then you have
all these other blackberry and windows
mobile and all these things that I would
recommend covering those with a
responsive web version rather than you
know the investment to do those
platforms is really really large seizo
max yeah and just so I totally agree
with you with regards to can you guys
hear I'm not believe it with regards to
you know HTML 5 verses verses on native
so if you're building an enterprise app
in front a lot productivity app
you know in business out I think html5
JavaScript is a is a really good choice
and then you also mentioned Apache
Cordova so if you want to write you can
easily wrap it in the native right for
android iOS Windows Phone and then push
it to the App Store or maybe even your
own enterprise app store so we also
talked to a lot of enterprises and their
reports for like Gardner and Forrester
there is a huge demand for mobile apps
within enterprises and the IT just
cannot keep up with all the demand and
again once if you use html5 we can you
know at least in theory sort of target
html5 out the browser Android and iOS
you just want out if it's of course
designed correctly right target multiple
platforms basically at once so I am
curious for the folks out of the
audience how many do development out
there that is targeted in some way at
least partially towards mobile either
that's through websites with with
responsive design ok and then how many
people are actually do some native
development is a few just a few so it
sounds like it's a lot more seems like a
big up taking people doing responsive
design which is great to see rather than
folks just designing for the desktop and
forgetting about the rest so and for IOT
priorty yeah I don't see to be honest I
don't see html5 and IOT at the moment
because these devices are so small that
that means you need to at least an
operating system to run the browser to
run the page right but these devices
sometimes don't even have an operating
system with the visual you I so and I
don't know any browser running there are
browsers but they are tech space so it I
think it's not really the market at the
moment it might change in the future the
devices get more powerful but at the
moment I think it's not the right place
to go with html5 too no html5 know you I
well you know laris of course that's
drama packs for for these devices
available that if we talk about the pie
which can also be used with html5 but
then you need x windows and all that
stuff running it yeah it depends you can
do that but my experience is not that
good it's really slow these devices and
then running x window with the browser
with that that really takes a lot of
resources so it really gets slow it's
not the good experience then so i don't
see it at the moment all right questions
yep and the back
could you please speak up jsf on the
table so the question is jsf still on
the table their life and kicking I think
I think it is I mean to actually some
sessions until actually I am am I used
to work with yourself a lot so we're
sort of the company my company is behind
richfaces framework for jsf and there
are sessions here on Jess F&amp;amp;R see also
mobile Joseph related sessions here but
I mean at least in my sort of opinion
and perspective in Joseph sort of kind
of a it's there you know there is it you
know there's a community will use it but
it's not d technology today to build to
build apps because it's a server-side
framework I think it was a huge shift to
for mobile to just you know client to
client side so I would kind of answer
like I answered before where I would say
that you know if you're doing an
internal app and you want that
productivity gain to be able to expose
your you know your database queries your
services or things like that you want to
do it very very rapidly and leveraging
those components it may save you some
time in getting something up and running
to display your data especially if you
have those skill sets in house but
building a rich client more focused
toward the end consumer that's probably
not the direction to get the the best
performing app and kind of that the sex
appeal that you want with a nap if you
want users to go out there and get it
yeah definitely not I can
today but i think i think the jsf
question is more in the context I mean
GSF just generates HTML so it's really
at the end of the day it's just still
HTML Javascript right versus true native
but then so that the other thing about
jsf is just you constrain to the
response require a request response
cycle yeah and what I want to have in a
rich client is more like a component
cycle instead of pages you want
components it is possible to build
components adjacent as a whole point
have service I components the learner
movement on moderation occasion doesn't
make it that good yeah so the right i
mean the recommendation for building
great web apps would be you know
services this pew I JSON and then doing
templating in the browser using mustache
handlebar there's all kinds of you know
angular angler yeah yeah there's all
kinds of options out there but basically
you want your services just to return
JSON and that'd be the same Jason that
can be consumed through ajax in a
browser or through native you know iOS
Android javafx whoever it is on your
client there so what about Alima can can
you combine it with angular sure sure
yeah yeah try so what polymerase yeah so
the only each other yeah place to do it
so polymers more about web components so
it's this idea of imagine you have a
screen that has multiple widgets on a
page so you have sort of 10 different
widgets on a page or if I think back to
my days a tea tray we would have a
trading widget and then we'd have a
portfolio widget and we'd have a news
widget so I think something like I
Google where you have all these sort of
unique pages within your page or unique
components that you want to isolate and
you don't want to have to worry about
naming collisions so if i create a CSS
class called my header I don't want
another components my header to
overwrite that and you have to think
about this a lot you know when you're
bringing in third-party components and
such typically they will do some sort of
prefixing
I you know what polymer is doing with
components is making it possible that
that prefixing and making sure that
scoping of JavaScript variables and all
that happens safely even in older
browsers so it's sort of a new web
standard that's becoming available in
new browsers and polymer makes that
backwards compatible so dance we're good
yeah that does it work with I seeks
another one and I think gosh I think
like really it's like ie9 before you
really start like or I 10 I guess
there's like this is mild support in ie9
I think but a lot of things are broken
so don't quote me on that look it up for
yourself all right so for the questions
yes please
that most
so I would I was speaking more about
things like PhoneGap titanium Cordova
where what those are if people don't
know it's basically you write your
mobile application in JavaScript using
javascript and HTML and then what
happens is is they generate native apps
that run typically in webview so they
kind of have a shell around the to
native app so it launches his native app
and kind of has some native app
functionality but then a lot of the UI
is done with a web browser and the
reason I recommend it kind of stay away
from that is things like scrolling
performance don't work well and then
also because you want a user when they
go to your app they're not having to
figure it out you want your app to mimic
on android gmail as close as you can you
want the user to know what to expect how
controls behave in controls behave very
very differently on iOS and what they do
on Android and one example I can give
you would be like looking at the address
book in your list of contacts the way
iOS does it is more you know the
location of where they put thumbnails or
the avatar photos is completely
different right the way they slide off
is different the way that they have the
nav controller rather than a back button
the way that they slide screens out to
the left and to the right on iOS where
you don't really do that on Android it's
so fundamentally a different paradigm
that personally I don't think you can
build a quality app with an abstraction
framework without doing more work than
it would have been too
write them both separately right for the
questions okay so they were a question
about jsf so output rails girls well yes
I will say that if you really need to
build a web application and if your
company only supports standards then J
safe is the only thing that you can use
but if you need to your application just
to be any kind of HTML or into html5
they're definitely other options out
there my personal favorite will be
grills just because I know it well I
know that it's very easy to get it
started like any other framework there
are no silver bullets you will
eventually find pieces of code that have
to write more than what you thought you
had too bright but again my personal
experience at with JSF even with rich
faces or primefaces there is more xml
than what is actually i would consider
it's needed to get some things done some
things are definitely much easier but my
recommendation is just give it a try if
it's not Grails perhaps display you
during to ask Allah which I can't ask
the same ideas conventional
configuration command line tool testing
support you can find other frameworks if
he's group is not much you like or Scala
then you can use Java so just just find
something that will make you more
productive so Baloo I am I miss Ruby
anybody doing Ruby there was one hand on
the back yeah right ok so I'm Ruby to
the list all right what I would actually
like to I'm curious about is how many of
you like want to learn html5 oh cool and
then how many of you want to learn
android
interestin Wow iOS xcode yeah so it
seems like a lot of people at least I
assume with java backgrounds or are
seeing a push towards their skillset
being useful I guess in the web but i
think what i mean when your HTML it's
really javascript yeah yeah
sorry yeah baden any vaadin opinion um
so any opinions about wit anybody want
to share about GBT so nobody raised
their hand when this is when we
mentioned G TT so who knows what GWT is
yeah handful most people most people so
so GWT is a framework out there that
lets you take your services in Java and
then expose sort of your model classes
like your PO chose your domain objects a
cross over into the browser and it kind
of abstract seems quite a bit so that
you're sort of writing Java in the
browser rather than JavaScript and it
kind of compiles over or generates and I
know exactly how it works but it
generates JavaScript that ends up
running their so Vaadin is a as a
company you know Google kind of gave
that up and doesn't really push that
direction anymore and they're not really
give it back to the community and
they're not the main maintainer of it
anymore and I know vaadin kind of
stepped up quite a bit on owning that
and they're building a lot of components
and you know my answer is similar to
before where you know building things
with Vaadin if you're building internal
apps makes a really really great option
especially if you have a company full of
Java developers you know I think it's a
great way to prototype something get
something up and running something
that's actually going to work well I
think the vaadin stuff looks a little
bit nicer there's a little bit more up
to date and some of the other stuff but
personally I tend to target things that
are for the end consumer and really
that's you know for me native is the
recommendation all right for the
question is
yeah that fits all on that last date how
do you qualify the difference then his
number between like Enterprise
I mean I definitely do right to some
degree i think it just has to I think
you have to ask the question if you
built the absolute shadiest looking app
out there like how would you compare
right so you take that absolute extreme
and what would happen if our you I was
you know fluorescent green and like all
the text was bolded and like whatever
and it just looked horrible and the page
is refreshed like what would be the
impact on customers right and then by
doing that sort of extreme comparison
you kind of figure out like really what
is the importance and then how how many
people see this light subtleties as
extreme right some people see that oh my
gosh I can't believe they don't you know
they've they're on Android and they
don't support the back button or
whatever it is right so I think you know
it's something that is deep to you and
your customers and how important that is
you know I think a lot of companies who
try to start out they have a limited
budget or whatever it is they they're
doing something for that end consumer
and they'll go out there and they'll say
well with the time I have with the money
I have whatever i'm going to use one of
these frameworks that guarantees i'm
gonna fail and also and i know i know
max you're like hate me for saying that
but absolutely don't go do a start-up
and in launch it in the Play Store and
in the app store using one of these
tools you're gonna fail I i think i
agree that well that if if you're a
startup and you know your app is really
do anything it's out there i agree a
super yeah it's like for example like
there's a hotel tonight app right yeah
so that's what they do they have an appt
only on mobiles absolutely yeah i need
to do native yeah but anything again was
he said for again enterprises for
productivity apps for internal
for your you know sales people you know
and so on and I think that you know
hybrid approach is not do that approach
and again I will depends what you're
building your your skills I mean they're
good hybrid all day but I mean I think
I'll do even more broadly and you say no
I'll go even more abrupt and say if
you're out there today doing a start-up
is targeting that audience you've
already failed yeah I'm just saying like
if you're out there doing this you
better be in the mobile space it better
be focused on the unconcerned already it
better be native if you're yeah you know
like they all kind of go together for
that path that's giving you a chance of
succeeding yeah because at the end of
the day with the end consumer you're
going native you're supposed to be
accessed close to the metal as possible
and if you are using one of these
abstractions like PhoneGap for targeting
your internal users the worst case
scenarios they they ring IT support
because stuff doesn't work but the end
consumer does not have IT support but I
think I mean I do think I think match is
mildly writer I do you think that people
can't mildly I mean no more for the
right yeah thnkx is always really about
a few things to learn from max but
anyway I I do think people I've seen
some amazing apps that are out there and
built I know like the the Java one
conference app used to be built with
titanium and I don't know if it is this
year I didn't install it but but if if
it is I know in the past it worked fine
for what it was what it was meant to be
to get you that information and I think
you know internal things you know if
you're doing analytics product or
something like that would that you have
a limited set of people wear what you're
bringing to the table is so important in
that data or that information the UI
doesn't matter then it goes back to that
question of what if you built the worst
ugliest app what would be the impact and
if you're not concerned about that then
yeah it's probably the way to go will
definitely save your development costs
two in the third which is super
important yeah I mean I think most
companies have limited budgets and
limited resources right unless your
Oracle oh yeah so yeah you want to save
money you want to save time and again
they are grayed out so they're built
using the hybrid approach so again it's
not going to be super it's not going to
be you know you know if you're building
like the super fast performance in
really reaching graphics absolutely you
want to go with native but if you know
if you're building sort of a data-driven
app content driven app I think sort of
the you know hybrid approach I mean is
it is a fair choice and again you choose
let's just say it was kind of at that
point we talked a lot about in our
company we both enterprise apps we're
building companies not catalyze we
shattered you need you need certain
Thank You steering we get speed robust
you need to get there but it doesn't
need to be as slick as ready as a
consumer after you're selling on the
marketplace turns out that without care
it has automatic windows power over with
questioner coming to read I always on
the zombie
native apps is marking minimal traffic
one of the reasons I think that will
take the job laughs example there's some
things that I can do on the web pretty
much better like I want you look through
the catalog of sessions I have to put
them catalogue and have to click on coal
dust and then I like search with one I
want to look up and I do added as oh you
got confident that I got to go all the
way back to my schedule and believe
process all over again and love birds
with weapons you know I might have a tab
open for the catalog tab open for my
of course it and you can't do that with
them so well I've not seen EMS provide
that sort of
have it windows of the scene yeah I mean
so my my comment would be like these
kind of schedule builder apps were
probably built ten years ago before
mobile exists and like they're trying to
like I really people were actually using
it as their primary thing when they come
to a conference is like more glancing at
data and things like that and they
looked at as they built it they said
this is something for consuming and
using the web is like your primary mode
I think with you know this whole sort of
mobile first shift that's out there in
the industry and those who are leading
it I think like it really have to make
sure that all that functionality is
available in mobile and mobile is the
first platform that many of your users
will be using I think if they looked at
schedule builder all these kind of
things I assume that their usage on
mobile would be much much higher than
what it was on the web I think if they
started over today they'd be very
foolish to make the kinds of decisions
it that make that difficult for you to
do things in mobile so so mobile is a
huge huge investment to take on this is
absolutely to do it right and such right
for the questions not so let's see so is
Java affects the future of client-side
Java or is it already the present so the
question was if it's the future of
client-side java well if you talk from
about client side java then it's the
future of clients high drama yes
definitely it's not swing anymore sorry
entrance but it's only if it's just that
but that was the question right yeah i
think and because this is the up-to-date
framework that we have what sort of
trends do we see as far as
I would be curious to poll the audience
to see is how many of you have converted
to swing up to javafx problem the FPU I
thought I'd see more yeah how many of
you have javafx hops out there am i
selling apps and then the real question
would be why don't you stop on the
desktop right so that is the question
behind it who is building applications
for the desktop yeah well I have a
little question so so yeah we saw some
of you use netbeans some of you use your
own home room framework or no framework
at all do you want to see an application
framework make sense something that is
better than the dead swing application
framework JS r 296 would even make the
Ruby make your work a little bit easier
you have something like that yes no
maybe no hands javafx is a toolkit is
not a framework that's the difference
netbeans is an RCP solution then the
application framework can be more than
just that not more than just our CP
without c.j so maybe I'll pose a
question to the to the panel here
because I have no opinion but what what
is it if what what's missing from from
javafx like what what what do you see is
the future what tools are needed maybe
that's kind of what you're trying to ask
curious from the panel is is what what
things need to come to happen to make it
easier better for folks to to get a
better experience less code better apps
whatever it is what I think the NIP
occasion framework is something that
would be nice to have that's definitely
something that that I heard of from
people that asked me so is there
something like that available for javafx
which is not at the moment that there
are some approaches but there is no
general application framework that
handles javafx applications as far as i
know of course there is one is there at
least there's all right there's least
there is one yeah D which one is it and
and who like who do you think should
should build and maintain that because I
look at you know the lot of things on
the ee side are now coming back into
oracle back into the course pack and
standard i think you know where five
years ago everyone would go out and
build things with spring right do you
think for it to work like to get there
that someone like a spring or canoe
needs to go out and build something or
do you think that's something that the
folks should wait for
to be honest I think it would be good
for someone from the community some
company will come up because they really
have the experience what they need and
how should it look like so it's always
good if someone with needs it's
something that is a solution for that
problem right because other will have
the same problem so I think I like that
approach yeah so what would be the
different needs
okay okay so even further than the the
old frameworks yeah that that's what I'm
saying is if somebody would like to see
something that goes beyond what the
proposal of jsr 296 the swing
application was because that's just a
few of runtime aspects but what we're
missing is how you deploy how you do
package these things how you test an
application that target these particular
environments it is that that's the way
that I see so an application framework
is covering all the basic needs for all
the different needs yes it doesn't
matter to which tool kit you're
targeting yeah for what need you target
so for the automotive swells for desktop
yeah okay okay sounds interesting yeah
yes please
one of the top five reasons why I know
if none of those people
mobile mobile mobile mobile so they are
doing desktop apps you know so noble a
little oil we're not building new
desktop apps yeah but they they they are
not they are not migrating the existing
swing apps to Java facts that's my guess
so you're wrong so but you're still
maintaining your desktop apps also they
are still active and the development
features new features in your swing
desktop apps raise your hands please so
personally there yeah so still alive and
kicking yeah exactly swing is not that
the reason so we have we can even do
these kind of migrations we do both we
do swing Kendra effects what we see is
that we are missing some instructions
everybody that uses swing knows that if
you want to push a button and menu you
use and actually makes sense there's no
such thing as an action abstraction in
javafx and there won't be one coming in
standard graphics it will be coming in
the community there is whining controls
effects if you use this project there is
also whining griffin and it's also
whining groovy effects and it's bound to
be one in the scale effects many of the
missing things that you find in other
you do not find in javafx will come from
the community in one way of another
another thing that we see that are
missing a few key components a table
that make sense not what we have right
now something that when you have a mod a
real table model that does not change
whatever thing that you're doing at you
I something that is really separate what
we have enjoy effects right now it is a
good start but it's not I will say it's
not enterprise-ready we sought need
something else we need to enterprise
grade components and widgets so okay so
let me try the the 55 reason question
rewrite everything it came time to do
the next project marketing said that
next you I has to be zero
in other words you can't require select
inquire tom
you need packaging they're behind me
anything yeah I mean I think I mean it's
one of the big reasons by javafx has
failed so far is the deployment I mean I
I mean granted i used javafx last one
point one point something so it was like
three four years ago the deployment just
horrible I mean you could just never get
it working you know the you know the
plugins would never work you would never
load I mean I don't know maybe more but
but that got better that what better but
you can you build you can do native apps
with drug effects that part of the JVM
right so it will get bigger at the
moment that's that's true and it will
get smaller with JD Kane on but you get
for example on Windows and X if I land
on the Mac you get a nap file so this is
like deploying a native app and then you
can use installed us that they do that
stuff for you so like others too so that
this is possible and it it's much better
than the old stuff so for whom the
audience deployment is an issue that's
holding back from swing to javafx
diploma is an issue for fat clients not
so many what about the originals of the
community or the ecosystem how many
different projects or depends they can
use the widgets so availability of I
additional two links so anyone
so is it more time and budget time
budget time budget so big investment an
existing swing application and nobody's
really willing to well start all over so
slow migration path anyone anyone going
for this little migration taking bits
and pieces of the application and just
fall mega Java facts and then taking it
slow so okay so no migration
that itself is a huge squishing the
javafx crypt and you know like to swing
say well
then it has the example of the powerful
being
I
so you need a reference as you can show
to someone yeah you need the big killer
application and java effects ok got it
so that's the one top reason ok good can
we have their netbeans dream team work
on that so we put this question to
Oracle long long long ago and it's just
a big effort if you want to reach third
NetBeans but it's completely in Java
facts so there's no official statement
they will never get at any official
statement on that way from Oracle what
you can see is that they using webview
for special purposes I would believe
that they see an opportunity and using
things from FX since I netpage they will
do it but let's say slow slow slow
process so yeah so that um the just I
mean just this morning I figured out
that they there's a plugin for java
Mission Control that's completely java
facts and there is a java management
advanced whatever application that's
written in java facts that's part of the
advanced jdk java SE whatever edition so
Oracle itself seems to be producing
tools for its to chain that are written
in javafx but they are not making any
buzz about it not really so um yes
ah ok will be also interesting to see
perhaps what is it the job Mission
Control users eclipse RCP right now
should be using John effects what is
with the other one DNA profiling tool
that is written visual um we shall be
ambitious netting service OPP and others
jconsole let's start an MPO swing so
yeah zoo but if I just may add I mean I
think just to me it's interesting javafx
was released in 07 I think the first
version yeah so it's what seven eight
years now and we're still it's the same
every conference we asked the same
questions right is there a future for
java effects as your future for javafx
is it ever going to make it to mobile
and no one has any answers and it's not
on mobile and the deployment still sucks
in my opinion at this point I mean it
almost makes sense to just say look it's
a good it's a good tool set for very
specialized apps something very special
you do but for the rest I mean there are
other better technologies out there like
HTML HTML or native just every
conference it's the same type of
questions working too so I think it's
that's quite correct so for all those
guys sitting there doing swing
applications on desktop Java fax is
still the future so they won't move to
html5 I can't believe that so I think I
think we're actually about out of time
here so take me at one more question for
lady go back
if you're targeting just a JV n space
you're deploying to a JVM die effects
makes sense because it is the successor
swing my opinions not yet there but is
the only thing that wobbles i will use
today going forward if you're targeting
other environments where you can run on
the browser then you have more choices
yeah so all right actually I want to I
want to turn a wrap up the panel with
one last question for all the panelists
just quickly kind of if if everybody
could tell us kind of what what excites
them for the next year and and what they
see you know is going to move our a
forward and furniture the panels well
for me I asked the question about
polymer and when I saw a presentation of
polymer a few weeks ago it's pretty much
swing with HTML so we're coming back to
the idea of having real components that
can be put together but in this case
HTML and JavaScript and CSS interesting
to see that something that we travel
offers have been using for more than 10
years is now being brought forward to e
to the web whether this thing fails or
rocks it will still inspire people to
continue investigate and do am pushing
the envelope so if by some chance swing
fails totally and polymer goes up you
still have a chance to use your
knowledge in the Indian new world see
I'm excited about html5 and even those
talking about Patrick padova I actually
want to punch a credit to go away in it
well because I wonder I want the HTML
and one html5 spec to actually add api's
to access negative device features
making do geolocation for example you
can do camera now on some browsers so I
mean hopefully in the future we'll be
able to get rid of those wrappers I mean
those wrappers just to access device
api's and we can just access those in
the camera contacto on directly from the
browser so for me kind of surprisingly
super excited about Swift and the reason
being is you know for iOS developers
object being stuck on objective c in
that kind of dead language for so long
and then you know all this pressure all
the enhancements i think from java and
others i think swift not only does it
help the iOS world but it helps put
pressure you know on java as well and so
I think it's a great thing for everyone
kind of pulling the whole playing field
upper level I just want to see something
about that forty percent of the syntax
of Swift it's compatible with groovy so
if you know prove is very easy to get it
now you guys would sit okay also vb
section so yeah for me it's not i'm not
really excited about some technology or
framework i'm just because I'm
interested in IOT stuff I'm really
curious what will happen they are
related to you I in the future because
that's not clear yet so it's a it's a
new market somehow so we will see that
that's why we're most looking at it's
what happens in the IOT space related to
you I so what framework would make it oh
yeah yeah I LT Fisher rights then what
about you ready i'm probably looking at
the other tools so what's coming up with
new tools for our doing you I things so
that's always interesting so um was a
for example simpler new version if
they're doing anything so those are the
things that I'm I'm excited about also
very good alright thanks everybody yeah
