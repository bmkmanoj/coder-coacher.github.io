in Basel Switzerland and I'm also part
of the groovy ethics development team of
the crew via fixes an open-source
project two years before the founders of
groovy effects Dean Iverson and Jim
Clark gave gave a talk on groovy ethics
and the year after was Jim and me and
this year we planned that Dean Iverson
and me would do it but unfortunately
Dean couldn't come so if you have seen
his name in the being announced he he's
sorry but he couldn't come for projects
stress
I guess so I try to make it myself
this time I'm gonna present lots of
demos that that's all but the visual
packages are rep out who is using group
any groovy ethics in the room only a few
very good so because I'd like to
introduce this to all the others so
let's see that's done I'll stop going
here okay that's kind of weird
I don't do it in PowerPoint normally so
we have already seen the first groovy
ethics application just before which is
the local the logo is part of the many
demos that can be with groovy ethics and
it is built entirely in group ethics all
the stars that you see here and binding
this and the shapes and also this rather
complex path that makes us makes the the
ethics text and when I click on it they
run at different rates such that the the
the blue and the green ones have to
catch up in the end with the animation
and call is also pretty interesting let
us see what I can make it stand out
better
like so big over here is that big enough
to see come back yeah you can move most
of the front if if that's an issue put
this over here
so this is how how a typical groovy
ethics class looks like through VFX view
I would say you have a stage which
translates to to a frame where it's in
its JavaFX stage in the scene and
there's a stick pane with a rectangle
for the background border pane and a
group for the logo and in the in the
local group there's three stars and
there's an effective method for the
stars and the label that makes us makes
up the ethics label and we have a
parallel transition and into the
parallel transition we add the star
animation three times then onmouseclick
Beach is played that's some kind of
that's gives the initial feeling of how
groovy effects code looks like I must
say that and the amount of time that I
have to contribute to groovy ethics is
not remotely as much as I use groovy
ethics in my professional work I use
groovy ethics pretty much every day
making customer applications with groovy
ethics that's partly related because of
my work for open dolphin while I'll do
lots of demos with with groovy ethics so
there's there's lots of usage for that
and yep and it works
otherwise it wouldn't do it so let's
let's go back to the to the presentation
here
good so these are the essentials that
you start with your first application
this is a method and the method takes an
argument of type closure well it's there
for the the the braces who's familiar
with groovy syntax kind of in the room
everybody thank you almost everybody
sorry for the other ones not going to
explain everything about groovy pit yeah
it gives you some feeling how things are
nested how things are organized in your
in your application that is a huge
benefit in in JavaFX 2.2 there they
introduced the Builder syntax in Java
ethics if you do this from java java
builders this is a groovy builder that
you see here the java builders were very
nice i liked them very much and you
could come close to the explicity that
you see here from for groovy but this
feature the builders have been
deprecated for Java fx8 they will not no
longer be available reason for that is
mostly because of the inheritance and
generics didn't really play together for
that kind of builder setup that they had
also some licensing issues I guess with
the the tools that they used for
producing the builders anyway I guess
this would have been possible to
overcome but they deprecated it anyway
so if you want now with Java ethics 8 do
you have this kind of representation in
your code how things are organized then
in your in the user interface
groovy ethics is from my point of view
still the best version to do that
still best way so if you write this kind
of code and by the way you get code
completion for that this is this will be
your result hello pod right not too weak
sorry
the same application in Java is like so
you can do that in Java and just for
comparison the size of code in groov
ethics and it's not only about size of
the code it is it makes it very it makes
it much easier to understand how things
are laid out how they are organized and
if you ever have to change any of the
visual properties they're easier to find
I would say absolutely so that's the
main part of groovy ethics making it
easier building on the strength of java
and java ethics but making it easier for
the developer that's the point that's
the whole point of groovy developer
convenience right and integrating what
is on the java platform available here's
a second version in the scene graph here
well doesn't show my my pointer really
so we have a stage we're gonna show it
it has a scene with a fill blue and in
this may be now see a layout the border
pain and top right left and button and
it has a button in a toggle button
checkbox the text field label all these
factory methods exactly translate to the
respective java ethics type so toggle
button will have a toggle button type
with an uppercase T in the beginning
capitalized T of course these factory
methods are named exactly to the JavaFX
counterparts and they produce a Java FX
object right we are not producing our
own objects it's only makes it easier to
access the the properties and building
creating the widgets setting that
properties and and attaching them to the
parent this is what pro-v effects is
about these three activities is what we
do and make it easier how does it then
look like not surprising like so
what else can we do for example work
with not only plain widgets but colors
gradients animations and so on we'll go
through those kinds of methods in a
minute so a gradient we should actually
be red but yeah you have to forgive the
colors here the beam is not really
displaying the colors so a linear
gradient has has start and end positions
for there stops for the various stops
and you can give these stops in various
ways the respective colors we have extra
colors on top of the available JavaFX
colors groovy blue is one and but
there's also like convenience method for
creating red green blue values from from
integer numbers I guess you have seen
that before
and there's linear gradients and radial
gradients yep when you then look at them
they look bluish really they're
displayed here on over the Bema a little
bit grayish but it's actually a blue not
surprising someone if you have any time
that you have a question please
directly shout into the room graphics
and effects there's there's one very
prominent example lessieur a demo from
JavaFX that where all the language
implementers try to to get you the
respective picture and I will actually
rather show this as one of the demos in
the in the groovy ethics project let's
switch over to apps what was wrong oh
that is okay close that one that's the
colorful circles demo when you check out
the the groovy effects project from
github you get all the code of course
and NetBeans project for it but you get
like 25 plus demos
so and the way that I work with
groovy ethics is I have this project
open all the time and whenever I need a
certain feature I look into the demos
and copy from there it's actually the
the most efficient way of doing it
copy paste hmm now there's this colorful
circles demo let's look into that one
and first colorful circles here we go
first let it run and see what it does
it's actually animating these colors
over time and all the colors look a
little bit different however the Bema
bit may be good enough anyway so we have
colors look we have circles the kind of
blur and the kind of overlap right and
we have an animation that kind of
doesn't kind of gravitational pull on
disks on these surface how does it look
like in code colorful circles number
four it is exactly including including
all the initial paragraphs like kind of
50 lines of code and starting at line 20
25 so 25 lines of code for actual for
actual work we have a local variable for
a keeping track of the of the circles
the circles we use we use the DEF and
groovy if you don't care about the type
they turn out to be a group you see it
over here and groups a really good thing
to do in Java ethics we ever does Java
FX development read about the groups the
groups are are your bread and butter for
for doing user interfaces with Java FX
or groovy ethics stage scene group now
because we can everything that we put
onto a group
is transparently put on all the
children's of that group children of
different so am P can enjoy when when
creating a group we can enjoy the the
groovy way of doing things like if I
want to do things 30 times we don't need
a for loop for that we can just a save
30 times and we create create a circle
so creating a circle 30 times easy
give it some properties like radius fill
and so on stroke stroke type outside
means while the stroke actually which
gives the board of the boundary of the
circle will be painted outside of the
actual song and it gets an effect this
is how we get how we do effects right
again a factory method and the argument
to the effect method is the Box blur now
for all the various effects that we have
in Java fix this such effective method
that has the exact same name and that's
not capitalized in the beginning right
this gives this blurry feeling to the to
the circles and then there's also a
rectangle or the blend mode overlay and
the linear gradient behind it
so make gives it this this background
feeling to it and yes you can tinker
around with these values and then start
it change something started changed
something started or you could use
Griffin which is
a from how I said I would say platform
or toolkit library hmm that for
client-side development and in Griffin
itself if you have not yet seen it it's
it's worth checking out I'll give you
the the URL in this on the slides what
you can do that comes with the sample
the school called groovy FX pad and you
have two views one is in sauce view and
and the rendering view and you can
directly in but the both micro
iterations do some changes to your
groovy FX code and you see the accept
the error that result in the in the
other window that's very very nice for
development and then we do a transition
we do the transition in parallel cents
for every circle in the chain in the
children of circles of that group we
have a translate transition we play them
all in parallel indefinitely Auto
traversing and changing the from X from
X from Y to X to Y position of the
circle this is changing the center
position of the circle and we give it
and have to give it to note so if you've
ever done any groovy before this looks
familiar and let me just play mmm and
it's gone I mean essentially 25 lines of
code is not so bad for that kind of user
interface right I would say good let's
go back
zip that was graphics and effects this
is what you have seen now animation we
have seen a little bit of animation in
the in the example before and here we
see it more in in colorful shining armor
well translate transitions for dates
incisions field transitions somehow what
the name implies is not surprising you
can have transitions that you would like
to make to be sure that one the second
one only starts when the first one is
finished there's multiple ways of
achieving this one is having unfinished
Handler on the first one and in the
unfinished handler called the second one
or you can have put them in a sequential
transition right first this then this on
the other hand you can have a number of
transitions and pull them and put them
in a parallel transition and they will
happily run in parallel and first
argument is for the duration and here we
have a little bit of groovy sugar on it
for saying like 2 4 seconds or 4
milliseconds or 16 hours or something
that you can do but you can just as well
give the Java duration object in it go
from there
I'd say it's it's rather
self-explanatory when you just set
questions to that
so far good and what you see is well it
animates a really cool thing for
animations is as we've seen before
animating these transitions animating
transitions transitions are translations
or rotations or the other one
scaling they're automatically smoothed
out right they start slowly then
accelerate and then decelerate in the
end less those transformations are
animated that way but you can have
animations any in in any way you want
just changing a property over time and
this is where timeline translate
timeline animations come into play in a
timeline you can say first can have sake
counts in Auto reverse and so on it's
better self-explanatory but you can have
multiple points in time where you say
while starting at zero seconds of course
when we've reached the two seconds I
would like to have the layout X property
of that circle over here too to have
reached the value 150 by the way I'd
like to have acceleration and
deceleration along the way mmm declaring
that in in a more procedural way would
be really difficult
so here it's nice in one place yeah we
are we are directly doing this on the
property object that comes with Java FX
do I need to know how Java FX works when
using groovy effects yes you need to
understand job effects right groovy
ethics is a rather thin veneer over Java
FX I would say if you want to do any
serious work with groovy effects and and
you're gonna like that but you have to
understand how Java FX box and Java fix
properties for example Java FX
animations and so and once you have made
your your tour through Java FX you will
the more you will enjoy groovy effects
because it's so so much simpler than to
use like it's only easing the access to
JavaFX it's not replacing it also it's
not an alternative it is it builds on
top of it
throw some sugar on it right yes Jim yes
please
yes the question was whether this is
then implemented as keyframes yes
exactly
when you when you try to do this in Java
but the java version of of Java affects
the Java API then you have to take care
of the various key frames and and on the
objects and which properties are then
accelerated it decelerated in which way
yes it's it is it would translate to at
least five lines of Java code and then
it's not so much the line code it is
when you look at the code how how easily
can you spot what belongs together what
should what is your desired effect and
with this kind of syntax it's easier to
see what the desired effect should be
one thing that I that I stumbled over
when I first used this is the the add
method the the the name of the add
method the add method means by that time
after two seconds I'd like to have
reached the final state that I declare
in this in this context right yes this
is how to read it now we we went through
various alternatives can can we name
this in some other way because this at
is is not really revealing it its intent
to well I would say I first
misunderstood at when I read it
yep but but after some thinking and
going through the alternatives I
couldn't figure out a better way if you
have an idea about a better method name
or a better constraint please tell us
right the current version of groovy
effects is ODOT 3.1 that means
still far away from 1.0 mainly be not
because of the code so much mainly
because of lack of documentation I would
say this this is the the main missing
point in a way we would love to hear
more begin to get more feedback or even
having more contributors right that's
most welcome
the code base if you have done any
groovy before code bases pretty easy to
understand I would say so that was
timeline transitions very helpful if in
effect when for one customer project who
just Java ethics plainly with Java and
has out ruled any groovy codecs for
reasons that are beyond me I had to
revert back to using groovy timeline
because I just couldn't do what it was
was too complicated and then I just have
put groovy on the groovy on the library
path gravy on the class path and using
groovy eval to do yep so like one line
scripting them yes please yes
the question was seen builder and
effects ml whether this world whether
this is still a story with groovy
effects yes it is and we will come to
that thanks a lot for the question if
you give me a minute
we'll go there okay how we do it right
away thanks for the question because
that's that's a very important thing who
has seen scene builder before Java FX
symbol everybody thank you so you know
the story and epic smell how I'll be
using this from groovy ethics you know
let's go here we're doing exactly that
going over to the F XML example F XML
demo from single a file wow that looks
good so let's try first have a look into
the code the author is der könig Oh
what kind of guys that yeah cool so this
is the whole code like five lines of
code rows or six mmm
we do it we're starting and let make it
a bit bigger we have a note that's
olfactory method called F XML hey what's
that doing you can give it a file which
is an instance of Java IO file and give
it a builder try F XML right we read in
here is as a text X so we have a string
in our hands so you can directly do it
from strings if you want and it's
showing that let me first show the the
effect of this F 10 week and at this
time we could be finished we don't even
need the last line the last line is
already something special so this is how
it looks hmm we do have a menu bar we do
have whatever you have whatever you have
in your F XML constructed by seen Bella
is there well but it's kind of dead
right soon you would like to attach
listeners do something with it so how
are we doing this one way of doing it is
for the for the primary scene that you
have you can always
look up any any note in the scene graph
with this I'm not sure whether you have
ever seen that before that this is how
you can look up something by ID in your
scene graph hmm I see some nods okay so
you can sense grooviest Java you can do
this directly in groovy and then set the
chart title well this is how this is
where we set the charge battle when we
look into the respective F XML which is
this one you see the ID ethics ID my
chart on the bubble chart element right
that's it you can yeah I need some right
click here okay mmm the FX ml file in
seen Bella see me here this and the CSS
ID that we hear sorry I need for the
publish on the CSS ID that we have here
is is my chart now this is this is how
we do the connection now this would be
the whole story would not be so
compelling that would not be groovy
doesn't feel groovy yet right it needs
to feel more groovy and here's how it
make it more groovy in your FX well
delete this one or just disable it now
in your FX ml context what you can do is
provide a closure and here everything
that has an ID in your FX and L file
made up from sin bilder is directly
available as a reference I can say my
chart dot title equals well let's try
Oh what did i do right my chart is
lowercase doesn't have it should do it
like so
thank you stay calm
it's not good to get overly excited
special bet on your heart not not so
good for your heart missus this is
really very useful this translates to
the typical usage that I have for
Cinderella which is not making the whole
UI in seen Bella it is laying out the UI
in scene builder and having containers
for the various pieces that I work with
that I then have IDs in a fill them
programmatically and they may have been
dynamically nth in it that I have to
fill tables and so and and I have them
there directly available here or through
a reference that's this is how I work
with Waseem Villa and I I have heard
from others it's a good way of doing it
because I'm not mixing all the details I
do the general layout anchor parents
whatever but have you per seen for every
scene that I have from application I do
this separate F XML file and and give
the IDs
read them in and if I ever have to
change that I can easily change that
write this IQ I am NOT going into this
situation where I cannot change the F
XML file through the symbol it anymore
because my code is messing around with
it I don't do that right I'm not
touching any effects in L file after it
has been generated
despite through the tool that's that's
kind of the rules that we have and it
keeps us gives you very flexible in both
base from on the programmatic side and
on the layout side and by the way groovy
ethics works with the whole toe tool
chain that you have not only seen
builder but also scenic view which you
need to have if you're doing JavaFX
scenic view check it out all the effects
experience tools that that are on the
web very good and panning tools right
that's the tool shine job that you need
to have good question
not the ones that you're a sorry
question was whether there is support
for the epic smile annotations possibly
not the ones that you think of likely
controller once you know no we do it the
other way around you'll see that a
little I can show a variety right yes
well that's a question I should so
directly so where is that actually we
will see it in the analog clock demo so
here we go
so the in packages like After Burner
effects in other ones that you're using
the controller annotation in your java
code such that in F XML you can refer to
it if that's kind of Li the way which no
I wouldn't want to say any bad word
about it I prefer a different way let's
say I prefer a way where there's only a
unidirectional dependency hmm and the
way that I just showed for reading in
the effects of L and working on the IDs
is unidirectional because there's only
one who reads it in my code is my master
not my effects Mel as my master no no no
no no right Mike Howard is my master and
whatever the code reads in is there I'm
a code guy right so I want coders master
for the other approach that's also valid
that it leads to a dependency that I
don't want to have in my code but what
you can do and here is annotation story
on the analog clock demo that first I'd
like to show you the effect of that demo
it isn't analog clock not surprisingly
is that possible to to make a little
bigger here no it doesn't know it's
fixed okay so it's big enough
kind of so you have an hour a handle and
a minute handle than a second handle and
this is displaying the current time
obviously so I'm running out of time I
say as I have recognized
and you bind this against the model hmm
so how do I bind this against the model
of the current time well you would have
a time domain object that has JavaFX
properties in it that you have to
declare and if you have ever done this
in Java that's quite some work to do
javabeans property plus property method
of his get the story right so how is
that done in in groovy effects like so
that's all there is that's all the code
that I have to write for for binding for
making Java FX properties this will
compiled to bytecode as if I would have
written this in Java with all the
various methods that they have to
implement yep only by saying it's FX
bindable all the properties will get a
getter and a setter and the property
method in a result and even if you're a
few more ones that I'm going to show you
in a second
yeah
yep question was for all the various
strategies that you can have like lazy
initialization for property X's and so
on that what you should do which one
have we chosen here can can be chose
different strategies no currently there
is no no there's only one that you can
use with this annotation we could
support different ones
it's not yet implemented but the the
groovy language would allow it either
make it MMX lazy bindable
we should actually call this FX lazy by
little because it does the lazy thing
already from scratch you don't have to
care about it but we could have an eager
one or so aesthetic one if you want
either by having parameters on this on
this on this annotation or just by it by
creating a new annotation both would be
possible we have we we have gone for the
lazy one because that's that's what you
mostly want to have nobody keeps you
from doing it yourself the way that you
want to use it right so it's just
convenience thing thank you for the
question
good so that was animation I'm running a
little bit of time I go rather quickly
through the other ones now here is that
that was the effect of the timeline
animation we have seen the analog clock
what a surprise right and there is one
thing that I would like to point you to
hear it that's a very special one it may
be a little bit too small for the ones
in the back not only do we have the FX
bindable and the respective properties
being real Java FX properties and best
practices automatically applied no
thanks Jeff that we have various ways of
using them right we can for example bind
them we do have a property our angle
property you can refer to it like so and
we can bind it against the ow
and the hours are gone integers in there
since properties there bindable their
binder balls and when you bind this is
JavaFX method bind you have to provide a
binding target and or binding source in
this in this example and when you are
writing this in Java you cannot write
the star for multiplication you have to
write dot multiply who has ever done
that
such l thank you I feel your pain if you
do this in groovy this automatically
translates through the respective method
that he would have written in Java it
feels like like arithmetic that you do
with big decimal in Java right awesome
you totally lose but the oversight
overview of what you're really doing and
this translates on the so the hours
times 30 plus minutes over five and so
on automatically translates on the
bytecode level to exactly the same code
that you would have written in Java
with all the extra methods yes Jim
yes is question was whether it takes the
Precision's rules in context yes and
that is automatically because groovy
does it automatically it would
automatically apply the times before it
applies to the plus we have the extra
parentheses here but they actually not
need it because of rate of presidents
does it automatically if yes if you put
in the parents you run the full control
yes we all know the right thing that
comes automatically from groovy we don't
have to do anything special in groovy
ethics for that to make that work we
only have to overwrite the the methods
correctly so this is what you what you
get automatically if you follow that
route yes yes please
please do
yeah
can you good can you do conditioners at
that point no you cannot we could do it
technically but we haven't done it yet
we could overwrite the question mark up
for a bit only with a global ast
transformation so it would be a little
bit difficult would be a little bit
involved but it could be done so sorry
again yes you can have the you would
sort of the question was whether I can
go back to the binder pants but I can
get all of them only if for example you
have the hours times 30 which represents
bindable right so if you put this in an
extra variable before if you apply
extract variable refactoring here then
you'll have a hold on that yeah of
course
good there's various ways of of binding
the time here rotation but this is how
it is applied on this special version
good much more binding the binding is is
very flexible much more than I actually
knew when I started project so for
example if you have such an epics
bindable and you can put it on the class
or then it then it does it for all the
properties or just on a special property
like so quick test and we use quick
tests down below here we we have one
reference and use it multiple times for
binding you can bind we can use the
extra bind method that we provide with
reference to the quick test and giving
the property that we are binding that we
use for binding as a string and then
that's rid of result in a bindable
object we can also this this quick text
here has a text property method exactly
like in Java ethics where we could we
could use that or we could just say TF
dot text
which is a property groovy property but
it translates to the JavaFX property and
it's automatically transferred when it's
needed the text is not only a property
this this is but since it is in in curly
braces that's a closure write-ins when
the closure evaluates to an object which
then is wrapped in an in an observable
object okay that's what you can do but
there's also an extra text method which
does the exact same as text property it
directly relates to text property so you
don't have the oops probably it's
property lengthy code lines you just say
the method name and call it as if it was
a method mmm and this is it statically
compiled and bytecode if you do the if
you're then relaying from Joe if you're
referring from Java to the exact same
class like the the quick test class you
will get the code completion because it
from the bytecode right for that method
okay and then the very same down below
here you can even do what this using
that comes from JavaFX automatic
conversions over of of readable objects
our observed objects bindable objects
sorry so it's very versatile I usually
go for that version but the texts use it
as a method right what you see well
that's what you see in that example
table view control well if you do it in
Java with the table view control there's
lots to do to do your columns right and
it's easy to to lose the overview of
what you're doing you typically have
that in extra class and they have to go
there and so on so what we do and Java
way not even finished there's even more
code what we do is we just use F
expandable right either put it over here
canonical means we can just call we get
a constructor for all the various ones
here automatically just that we can use
it
so in courtesy of Jim there's a gym
person
this is normal java.util this serene
groovy and java.util list and we are in
good company
good and when we do a table view we just
give it the items and make table columns
for this property for this name which
will show up in the column header and
give any kind of property that we want
to have on the on the table column right
but we only say we know that the items
come from the items from the persons
list and and a name must be a bindable
property on it right which it is and we
get automatic update whenever the name
changes it's automatically updated on
the table you know listener them saying
blah right very handy
looks like so yep
table view control you can even question
is sometimes when you finally go into
edit mode when you edit directly inside
the cell how you do this out to your
right back to the domain model and so on
this is how to do it
when you see you can directly do it
inside yourself yes please let's on edit
commit is something that you can do is a
property that you can set on the title
column it is of type closure you get in
the event in the event knows table
position and items and what-have-you and
can work from there for your tip for
your domain models the story here is not
API specifics and details is we are
there for you that's okay yes and
layouting is the exact same story we
have there of the factory methods not
only for widgets but only for also for
layout containers yep and you just use
them as if you would use widgets by
putting the be box edge box and so on in
the bright inside here makes it very
easy if you change
mind in your in layouting for example
and that's what you see cable view
sorry DEP you in this case and then when
you do forms
that's pretty often you have label and
text view label and text view label text
view text area button and so on and if
you do this like programmatically
without this kind of nesting thing it
gets even more complicated actually my
style of writing this is kind of little
bit difficult different my able to show
you that because I usually have a
running counter for the color for the
year for the row and for the last entry
in that row of the of the grid
I'm just doing a plus plus on the
running counter and then if I then
change my mind on how organize things I
don't have to update all the counters
right what you see one of the samples
that come with groovy effects
I've talked about Griffin Griffin is is
a very good environment for you and for
doing client-side development and
there's a JavaFX archetype and you can
directly use groovy ethics with it in
has this builder syntax and so on takes
care of organizing your code and by the
way I'm going to show you an application
that has been built with with Griffin on
the client side but Griffin as your
client-side UI platform with groovy
effects for for the kind of stuff that
we have seen here on this it has a
server part which is Grails any grants
users some okay grads is groovy for web
and and the the connection between the
two is RIT is done with open dolphin
here's the where is the thingy should be
around here yeah so that's the
application some of you have seen it
before
I guess yep the container yard of
Antwerp this application has been
jointly developed by Oracle nevus the
broad market leader for container
terminals of fair and canoe and what you
see is a container yard from a path
that's a bird's eye view and we go from
2d to 3d just by clicking a button and
then we are into JavaFX 3d and the the
client part is organized in Griffin is
is using groovy FX server part is Grails
and opened often for the if you want to
save remote data binding actually the
application this application runs on the
server the application code is on the
server and client is only for attaching
your views on to the presentation models
that's it then the van comes in and you
can have all the all the enemy
that you see here it's just normal
animations whether you do the animation
2d or 3d
JavaFX doesn't care that's that's the
very interesting point that was kind of
its kind of logical but it was
surprising anyway when I first ran into
it all the stuff that you do
translations transitions what
what-have-you works exactly the same in
3d as in 2d and doing this kind of code
is actually not so difficult
I mean modeling the 3d cranes and so the
year that's difficult that and this has
been done by John Yan here's who's
worked for I guess Disney and Pixar so
before okay hey write that that for the
for the box is right for the containers
even I could do it if not actually I do
this quite often right now and it's very
easy to to step into this yep actually
it makes lots of fun just just if you
have never played with with that before
it is it is true fun so let's go quickly
back to the PowerPoint and yep so that
was Griffin Griffin comes within JavaFX
archetype that that installs
automatically groovy ethics so when you
say install archetype and create add
then you you're ready to go you have
running application already that you can
start with and then extend to your
liking it's a very very smooth
experience here's one one of the
applications that you can do and here is
the usage of groovy effects was opened
often and I'd like to show you that
application some of you have seen it
before anyway it's so cool and in almost
all the demos in open dolphin use groovy
ethics this one for example alright
let's let's do this one running a little
bit short on time here but I'd like to
show you the ladies lazy loading game as
you see in the code as at least you can
I'll see it maybe in peguin article from
the back is we are using a component a
radial component which comes from J of
extras right yeah get it okay let's work
here right this mr. han Solo
Kenneth Quinn Bart and we're using this
gauge and in putting it into the
interesting graph down below here right
yeah they have we do it and otherwise we
just have other text fields on the end
the normal stuff so you can use it
groovy effects with your custom
components it's a custom component right
just put it in and when we start this
you will see open dolphin with lazy
loading lazy loading is really important
for pretty much all or customer
applications yeah have a start of this
year control-shift-n that really
selective I don't know that's the view
sorry
start I have to start the starter that
works we are reading in a pretty large
number of addresses like ten thousand
address objects that's the total table
size and well table with ten thousand
entries is kind of difficult right but
we only lazy loading is about be only
loading what you see and as soon as we
as I start scrolling you will see a
little bit of a delay until the until
the data is there from the server I
can't go back like so I can when I
select one I get the should click on it
I get the details ready
you know that's master detailed you and
this gauge shows the the percentage of
real load how many data entries have
really been loaded from the server from
the 10000 only 222 have been loaded
right so that makes two percent even if
I take the slider
and move it to the very end only 6% have
been loaded right I can go even if I do
it as bad as I can like very slowly I go
up over here I did the wrong thing here
going back and forth yeah somehow a
little bit put my mouse okay
then even if I do it very slowly it
loads like maybe 20% or so right gives
you the impression as if you would
scroll through all the data while in
reality you're not really thrilling
you're not really seeing all of them
only very few of that nobody does ever
do this but this is the worst that you
can do going very slowly through all the
data and still and then then it feels
kind of to the 10,000th right back okay
but anyway and then it's full but this
is rather the the unusual use case and
now it's all cached and then you can go
as quickly as you want so that's kind of
the thing right you can it's very
versatile I can use it for also for
custom components here you see the
custom component it's good so to finish
that story back to PowerPoint
so that that was open dolphin lazy
loading our here is one which is where
where we use groovy effects together
with a 3d scene we there's the there's
like two sub scenes one for 3d 3d
visualization and one for 2d
visualization it appears that in most
applications that use JavaFX 3d this is
one that monitors a factory flaws
any kind of engines and whatever
facilities you have and give a visual
overview and how they are located and
what the current state is but you
typically want to combine it with a 2d
view that shows current details right
from selected ones so yeah this this
view the 2d view is fully groovy FX seen
better stuff and this is now combined
with also written in groovy but using
Java FX 3d through groovy but not yet
groovy effects there is not yet groovy
there's not yet 3d support in groovy
groovy effects itself so here's the
website please if you have any
suggestions problems whatever questions
go to come to the website there's a
mailing list or go to stack overflow
there's a there's a special tag on Stack
Overflow for groovy effects that you can
use and eventually I will see your
postings when you do that thanks a lot
and any questions yes
custom cells yeah it is a bit involved
it depends on what you want to do if you
only want to change to the visualization
that's pretty easy if you want to change
the editor inside yes you can but it's
not particularly so that groovy ethics
helps you there that's all Java effects
core Java ethics thing yeah yeah yeah
exactly good okay thank you enjoy the
