with a stinging party lined up so I
suppose you're all looking forward to it
so am I so okay so I'm going to talk
about Java applications on Oracle Java
cloud service they run that many here so
if feel free to we can kind of have the
session in a format such that I can
address any queries that you might have
so so we try to kind of customize tailor
it accordingly
my name is Harsha Duke and just little
bit about myself I am part of a Java
champions program and regulates director
as well these are the four books that I
have written I was a co-author in the
Java to EE Bible the other three are my
own books so if you remember j2ee Bible
used to be this Pope I don't know if
it's still available but this wasn't to
be one point for Bible long time back
and I last year I wrote a book about the
Oracle Java cloud service so I'm not an
order to employee being part of the
reckless director program and because I
have been writing about Oracle Java
cloud service I am kind of been trying
it out and seeing how its evolution over
the past few years so that's that's
where I come from so I can say things
that directly employees probably can't
so if you have any questions that any
candidate opinions I would be I could
possibly share that okay so first up
what is your idea of what the Oracle
Java cloud service offers tried it have
you tried okay just one person okay okay
okay great so okay so Java cloud service
began maybe a couple of years back the
initial version that was available was a
very slim slimmed down version of the
WebLogic server so you just had a few
basic things that were available to you
some API is that commonly used EPS that
were available to you but that's about
it right so that was how it was for a
couple of years and some time maybe
early this year or maybe late last year
where or I can really brought the whole
the whole version was available where
you get a full fledge our server and
full fledged WebLogic server and much
more on offers right so
it's been a year since the full voyage
Oracle Java cloud service has been
available and essentially the idea is
and then the kind of simplified one line
there would be web logic on the cloud
right so if you have been using web
logic so that's more mostly the
direction that it has taken different
versions different variants different
capabilities but essentially it's
WebLogic that's running for you okay so
currently there are actually a few if
you were talking to me a few days back
there used to be three variants of the
Oracle Java cloud service if you look at
all the documentation or Ector used to
say Oracle Java cloud service Oracle
Java cloud service virtual image and
write a Java cloud service SAS extension
okay but lately in the newer material I
see that they are only talking of two
services the virtual image still is
there but it's not probably being pushed
that much so the idea here is that the
SAS extension actually was the Oracle
Java cloud service earlier okay until
last year the Oracle Java cloud service
that was available as I mentioned a
slimmer version of WebLogic that was the
Oracle Java cloud service but last year
they renamed it as the SAS extension so
essentially the idea is that people who
are using Oracle SAS products if they
want to do something additional that
cannot be done with just the SAS
solution that they have or on the Oracle
cloud they can build that application on
the SAS extension so that that's
essentially where the named SAS
extension comes from but there is no
stopping you from building a proper java
application there and running it okay so
although the name says SAS extension
there for 80% of Java EE cases maybe the
SAS extension might be good enough right
so all the common API is that you might
require servlets and jsps and JSF and
rest api is and all the basic things
that you would require are available on
the SAS extension as well it's just that
you don't get full control over the
server and on the hardware and all that
control is not available it just meant
to be a simple shared web logic kind of
environment where you can build
extensions is what Oracle is now calling
it as where you build extensions for the
size exchange so for the SAS solutions
that they have right and the Oracle Java
cloud service the other one is the
full-fledged version that where you can
do anything you can more
which - really okay so let's directly
jump into I don't have that many slides
- al directly jump into the demo so
okay so if you subscribe for the trial
there are trial versions available for
the SAS extension as well as the full
Java cloud service so what it gets you
is a 30-day full feature trial right so
that's the good part of it that it's
30-day which is kind of short if you
want to really try out the the in its
totality but it's a full feature version
that is available for trial so I would
highly recommend that you do that so I
only one of you have has tried it out so
I will recommend that you definitely do
that so when you select the trial you
can select either you go for the SAS
extension trial or you go for the full
Java cloud trial both both the trials
are available so I'll show both of them
so this is where I'm going into the full
version of the Java cloud service
okay in the meantime I'll open up
another window where I can probably have
the other one going as well
so what I'm trying to do here is and one
in one browser I am getting the full
Java cloud service going and in the
other cloud I intend to just have the
sass extension running and we'll see how
both of them are different and what is
good or bad about both of them so okay
this is the dashboard for the full
Oracle Java cloud service so you'll see
here that apart from just the Java cloud
service there are many other trials or
many other cloud services also that I
have subscribed as part of my trial so
we'll see those as well but essentially
this thing here is the one instance of
the Java cloud service that I have and
there's also a database cloud service
that you would be aware of from Oracle
II so the database cloud services
inherent and kind of is something that
has to be there with the cloud service
so it's not like you can only buy the
Java cloud service and you don't take
the database cloud service along with it
you don't have that option currently at
least as of now the database cloud
services a must have for the Java cloud
service okay so if I'll just somehow
open in new window it's not friendly to
that somehow I get a page not phone I
don't know why so I just jump into the
service console so now this is the
version where I have determined exactly
what kind of setup I want I have decided
what is the hardware that I want what
kind of capabilities I want which
version of WebLogic server that I want
so while this gets going I will jump
into the other window and try to get my
sass extension going as well okay
you
okay here we are so this is my instance
of the Java cloud service that I have so
what I'm trying to really kind of
highlight is that it is a very simple
web-based kind of thing where instead of
having servers running on my machine or
configuring it in a very complex kind of
environment that is not the case it's a
very simple environment just a
browser-based thing where you select
what you want and you create this
instance accordingly so you'll see here
that I already have one instance created
and it's saying that it is saying which
version it is and what exactly its
capabilities are and you'll see some
other information about what the storage
is what the memory is so essentially
just in the browser you select you fill
up a form select a few things here and
there configure your cloud service
accordingly and within a few minutes you
have a proper WebLogic server running
for you in exactly the kind of setup
that you want ok so if I go to create
the thing is like I can't I could have
like to show you a creation right now
but the thing is the provisioning takes
maybe 15 minutes 20 minutes more than
that at time so I will just show you
what all I can enter there and how I can
create it but the provisioning process
probably won't get completed ok so while
this is going I'll just jump into the
other window where it is still not
logged in ok I think I need to change
okay while both these are struggling to
get to the next page what I'll do is in
the meantime I'll go over to NetBeans
okay so I okay with what I've shown so
far just a web-based interface where you
can on in one browser what I was doing
is I was starting at the sass extension
so where I will get a simplistic kind of
view where I can just deploy
applications and stuff in the other
browser I'm getting the full Java cloud
service where I have determined exactly
what is the kind of environment I want
okay now that means how many of you are
familiar with NetBeans okay many are not
ok so it means I'm just using it as an
example the cloud service provides
integration with all the popular IDs so
if you are comfortable it eclipse or
JDeveloper IntelliJ I'm not sure of that
but if it provides integration with the
Oracle cloud but eclipse and JDeveloper
work perfectly well so it will look
pretty similar to what I am doing here
with NetBeans ok so I will not get into
any coding and stuff I'll just create a
new simple project and we'll try to
deploy it to the cloud ok so you would
have those who have used that means you
would have probably done this a million
times
so I'll just create a Java one project
and ok you'll see that here I configured
my IDE to give me a choice there the
GlassFish server you would know comes
with NetBeans anyway so that's the
bundled server that I have but using the
plug-in that is available for NetBeans
for the Oracle Java cloud service
similarly for Eclipse and JDeveloper you
have similar things so until you get
this option there that do you want to
deploy to the GlassFish server or do you
want to directly deploy it to the Oracle
Java cloud right that's that's how
simple it is so instead of a local
server that I have I just select that
okay don't look install it to the local
server don't deploy it to the local
server just deploy it to the cloud just
finish this
okay in the meantime let's just check if
the browser's okay
now go to the next step here and in the
other browser also have got to next step
okay is it getting too much at a time
I'm kind of doing three windows at the
same time so is it getting too complex
too and lower you okay with it okay
okay so now I have a project created
here and I have already integrated this
with my sass extension so before I
deploy this there I'll just jump into
that window so this open browser is
where I have the sass extension going
Chrome is where I have the full Java
cloud service going okay so if you see
in the sass extension trial again I have
a database schema there that is there
and also there is the developer cloud
service I'll talk of that later on but
this is the simpler leaner which our
corrosion will see it listed below at
the bottom they're doing Java JCS sass
extension okay so if I jump into the
console here
it's usually not this slow so it's not
the fastest to respond even in good
times but it's not there usually doesn't
take this long but if this doesn't pop
up in a second I will go to the other
window okay so essentially what we are
trying to do here is if you have
experience with Java you have been
building Java applications traditionally
we always used to deploy it to GlassFish
or WebLogic or websphere or whatever it
might be you have on your machine or
on-premise environment instead what I am
looking now is just deploy it to the
cloud and use a server in the cloud
that's that's pretty much it and the
thing to note here is that the
environment is there's no new learning
SSO there's a very good use case for why
you should be adopting this so I should
at least be trying it all if only one
person has tried it all of you should be
trying it at least because there's
definitely a good no service instances
form okay that was not supposed to
happen let's see
okay let me just deploy from there beans
and see if it pops up or not so okay so
if I jump into NetBeans again you will
remember that when I created the
application I said I want to deploy it
to the Java cloud service extension and
not to my GlassFish server that I have
as part of NetBeans so if I just
right-click and deploy from here the
integration is so good that you don't
really need to do anything special you
just select the usual NetBeans tools use
the usual NetBeans commands and it just
does the stuff in the background that is
if it works okay okay so you'll see what
it is doing here is the plug-in that I
have provided is it's creating the
required directory is creating the jar
files and if you can read it it's saying
uploading deploying okay so what's
happening here is instead of deploying
to my GlassFish server now it has
packaged my application it is uploading
to the cloud service where you will see
the next step that will pop up here is
some initial checks are performed that
when you are deploying into the sass
extension because it is a shared
environment that is a slim web logic
that is available to you you can't
really do anything that you wish so with
the sass extension comes with a certain
set of restrictions so that you cannot
use certain things you can do certain
things there's a long list of that in
the documentation that you that is
available and there's a whitelist check
that will also happen that if you are
using something that or exchange and
does not support it will not let me
deploy the application but currently
because this application is kind of I
haven't really done anything there they
should go through it's taking too long
but okay okay let me jump into the other
Java cloud service ah are you okay with
this so far any doubts ooh this or okay
because instead of waiting here for this
to eventually happen I don't know why
it's taking so long but okay that's
supposed to happen during demos I guess
ok so this is where I clicked on
creating a new service now this is the
full Java cloud service okay now this is
not the sax extension
okay so here you will see I have two
where I can either create just a virtual
image now this virtual image is meant
mainly for testing and staging and kind
of that kind of an environment but if
you are deploying a real application the
other one is what you are supposed to
kind of use so I'll just say in the next
excuse me okay now here again I just get
an option of which WebLogic server I
want oh this is the full Java cloud
service this is not this a sixth engine
with the sass extension I don't get any
of these choices I don't even know what
is the exact hardware or what is running
in the background okay but with this
other one I get to choose all the stuff
that I want which version of WebLogic I
want what is the kind of capacity I want
all that stuff I get to choose with the
sass extension it Oracle doesn't even
tell you that what is running in the
background to get your application to
work okay so let me select WebLogic
server 12c I'm just going with the
default options you'll see that there's
even the coherence option if you are
used it or aware of it so you can even
select coherence and you get that
capability as well okay so now here here
is where actually specify what exactly
how I want to configure my instance so
apart from the obvious things like
specifying the name and description I
can specify cluster sizes you'll see
that I also it expects me to provide a
database configuration there so I said
that the database cloud is kind of
integral and kind of a must-have for
Java code so that that's the reason for
it that when you create a new Java cloud
service instance it insists on database
configuration for it as well okay so and
as the load balancer that you can
configure and also there's Oracle
storage cloud so anybody has heard of
Oracle storage cloud okay so there's a
separate cloud service that already
provides which is the Oracle storage
cloud and so for your backups and
recovery you integrate your Java cloud
with the storage cloud so essentially
what I'm doing is one is I'm configuring
my Java cloud in exactly the way I want
so I specified which server I specified
all the other stuff and I'm saving the
database that I'm using and I'm also
specifying what is the storage cloud
container that I wish to use to
get this cloud to actually work okay and
as of course the WebLogic username
password that you need to provide okay
so if you click on this here you'll see
that it gives me many options there in
terms of CPU capacity RAM all that stuff
okay so highly configurable in a very
simple environment just a browser-based
you click send dropdowns here and there
and you get a ready server available for
you so if you are willing to spend $1
it's not that difficult to get going
with it okay any doubts with this yeah
you you can change things later on yes
with this version you because you have
full control over the environment that's
it you you can do things later on okay
so this okay so i'll not complete this
step here because even if i submit the
form right now it will not happen
immediately the provisioning thing will
take 15 20 minutes
so instead i'll go back to my previous
page where I already have a Java cloud
service instance ready okay but
essentially this is what I this form is
what I paid up to create the cloud
service instance Java cloud service
instance that I'll now show you okay so
you'll see that I am anyway on the last
step here so after this step it just
confirms all the stuff that you entered
and it will get to provisioning your
cloud service okay okay so this is the
cloud service that I created some time
back so let's see exactly what I can do
with it
again it shows all the basic reporting
that you would expect from it and I can
now just jump into the WebLogic how many
of you use WebLogic okay many of you so
essentially you will see that this
interface that will now pop up it will
be a familiar WebLogic interface so I'll
just get into that so I personally
haven't really used by Pilate that much
but GlassFish has pretty much been my
thing that I've used the most part
yes
okay so you'll see that essentially now
you have a web logic console but this is
all on the crowd you don't have to worry
about any of the other background stuff
okay so if you know how to deploy and
run applications on web logic this is
pretty much the same thing right so the
beauty of the whole thing is that in a
very simple and easy-to-use kind of UI
you have essentially delegated all the
hard work that you usually have to do to
get the server's up to provision all the
requirements that you have for your
application and or at least now supposed
to take care of all of that but now you
have a web logic console and you can do
whatever you know if you are familiar
with well logic whatever configuration
information you need to additionally
provide you want to deploy your
applications warier or files whatever so
after this step really once you get here
it's pretty much the same thing as using
WebLogic server what what was earlier
when you provision the server was really
the only difference that you had okay so
now if I go back to NetBeans okay in the
meantime it has managed to which you can
read it here deployment finished so it
has managed to upload the war file and
if I go to in the other tab you will see
this is the log for the actual
deployment just about I just read the
key things there where the whitelist
check okay see you have checking web app
for compliance so essentially that is
what takes time when you deploy directly
from NetBeans so if it was a local
GlassFish server it would have been
immediate but when I deployed to the SAS
extension it usually takes a couple of
minutes because if you go through bite
let's check the virus check all that
stuff and only then will it actually get
deployed and now if I try this URL if
all goes well I should be able to see
your hello page or something like that
okay so this is the page from the
NetBeans application the index dot JSP
page that you usually get when you
create a new application in NetBeans so
you'll see that the URL here it is
saying Java - oh so essentially this is
my identity domain this is the name of
the sass extension instance that I'm
using and this is my application Java
one that I just created and index dot
JSP so fairly easily we have managed to
deploy an application on to the cloud so
technically you have been doing cloud
development although it's not really
very different from what you might have
done otherwise as part of Java EE ok so
if I can get to the sass extension
console okay so the sass extension
console now if it hopefully opens up you
will see is okay I am not sure why this
is happening because I'm able to deploy
to this instance but it is not showing
up here
so it's working fine I managed to deploy
to it from NetBeans but I'm not getting
the Java console for it
doing the same thing again is not going
to help
they'll just try it for a couple of
minutes maybe and if this doesn't work
I'll move on so what I expect here is as
part of the sacs engine control is now
this will not be a web logic console so
with case of the Oracle Java cloud
service not the SAS extension the full
Java cloud service you got essentially
go to WebLogic console right so it's
pretty much the same thing as running a
web logic thing but with the SAS
extension the console that I should have
got here is a very basic kind of console
with a few graphs there a few reports
about what exactly is happening what is
the performance what are the names of
the application deployed that's about it
right so the idea of the SAS extension
is that it's not going to give you all
the control and all the reporting and
all the information all the logs all
that stuff that you would require for a
full-fledged application you'll not get
it from a SAS extension but you can get
all the basic stuff that you would need
for most applications move if the
application is something that you are as
the name suggests a sixth inch and you
have an existing SAS solution you just
want to add some minor functionality you
don't really think it is worth buying
the whole Oracle Java cloud service then
you can go for the SAS extension which
is obviously much cheaper and mighty
even easier than the full Java cloud
service to use so that's really the use
case for the SAS extension control I was
hoping to kind of show what exactly I
can do there
okay again you'll see that I have a Java
database schema here so okay instead
what I'll do is I'll show you that even
the database anybody has tried the
Oracle database cloud service no okay so
even that is very good so if you if you
have so because I have the database
cloud service as part of the Java cloud
service thing or I need to use it the
database cloud service instance that I
get here
is also something you definitely need to
hopefully this will work okay so you see
that again this is a nice rich interface
that is available for you to manage
database so you can do your SQL you can
applica basic application building stuff
that if you have done anything with the
little database type apex so you can do
that and as SQL workshop where I could
actually fire SQL queries and so
essentially the point is that just
through the browser just a few clicks
and buttons in here and there you don't
really need to learn anything new and
you can start using the Java code right
away is pretty much the primary takeaway
from the tile I'll come to the developer
cloud service anybody has heard of the
developer cloud service no ok I'll come
back to that
here I'll just quickly show you the
other cloud services that I am using in
the process
okay so so it's kind of evolving very
well so if you had tried this one year
back it the interface wasn't really up
to the mark you had to do a lot of
things for example just simple things
like creating a public key and private
key you had to manually open a different
to will create those keys and do all
that manually and then submit that key
here it was it was much more difficult
than what it is now so Oracle has been
constantly kind of updating it to make
it easier to use the cloud so if you
look at it one year back it was really
more difficult far more difficult than
what it is today today it is much easier
they have kind of put in more wizards
and more tools to kind of simplify the
process
okay so quickly if I go to the compute
cloud the compute cloud is the highest
thing that you might have heard in all
the talks if you have gone to open world
or if you have heard any of the
recognize all the IAEA's thing that they
are talking of is mostly about the
compute cloud service so this compute
cloud service is pretty much the
foundation on which all the other stuff
is being built so the compute cloud so
what we are doing here L is is that the
compute cloud is my is setup over which
I am running the Oracle Java cloud
service Oracle database cloud service
and okay so if you see here it's saying
that I have two instances running one is
the Oracle sorry one is the database
cloud service and one is the Java cloud
service and this is where I actually
configure the hardware that I want to
use right so if I want to tweak
something with the hardware that I
intend to use the compute cloud services
where I need to tweak all those is
things the Java cloud service and the
database cloud service are the past
solutions okay so we get all of them
together in a pretty nice interface okay
so what I am trying to do is I'm just
showing you all the Allied cloud
services so this is not really show you
any code really because the coding part
isn't Java you guys already might know
that so what I'm highlighting here is
that there are just a bunch of cloud
services all very easy to use that you
can okay let me now jump into the Oracle
developer cloud service so nobody had
heard of that right so developer cloud
service is also special so I wrote an
article for Java magazine if you
open the issue for last month you'll
find out last month I wrote about
director Java code of humans back I
wrote about the developer cloud so
essentially the idea of the developer
cloud service is that anything that you
need to do as part of the development
process so if you need a wiki you need
team collaboration you need version
control you need a maven the repository
right so all these things that you need
as part of the development process you
get as part of the developer cloud
service ok so the idea is that anything
that you can move to the cloud you
should move to the cloud is what or
acting really is pitching ok so if I
open this console ok I haven't created a
project here so what you do so I so if
you want continuous integration
continuous deployment if you want a jl
sprints you can configure all of that ok
this has come a long way if you tried
this one year back it had very few
features it was not that easy to use but
over the past year they have added a lot
more to the developer cloud service so
what you can think of maybe not
immediately but over maybe next year or
so is gradually how you can adopt all of
these solutions if you are kind of
comfortable with using Oracle as your
vendor you really don't need to do
anything on premise on your machines or
on your in your development environment
so the developer cloud service can take
care of all the wiki agile part of it
all the source code management you can
even configure bills so that it gets
automatically deployed so the continuous
integration and beyonds deployment thing
that can also happen so all those
features are in the developer cloud
service the compute cloud service is the
is part of it the Java cloud service and
the database cloud service are the past
part of it and all of them come together
very well to kind of get you what you
need for an application
okay so the SAS extension unfortunately
did not open let me just give it one
last shot if I don't get it I'll move on
because that's a sixth engine one soul
is a little different so I was hoping to
show you that no okay fine but this is
something that you can try right away so
if you haven't tried any of this I would
recommend that you try the SAS extension
first up because that is the easiest one
to get started you don't need to set up
your web server sorry you don't need to
set up your web logic or the hardware
you don't need to worry about any of
that we'll just get you a ready-made
server just deploy to it and you're
ready to go so recommend that you try
that first up okay so okay I mentioned
some of the clouds here but there are
other clouds as well so have you gone to
the order the cloud site for ugly okay
there there are like $0.10 about 30-40
different cloud solutions that Oracle
has come up with so the idea is that
based on what you need you just pick the
clouds that you want and you kind of get
them to work together right so the Java
cloud service is what he just saw so
even just in the application development
cloud space there are these eight
different clouds of which even I haven't
tried four or five of them but based on
what you need so if I need messaging
right so the basic thing does not have
the messaging capability so I just get a
messaging cloud service integrated with
my other setup and I have the messaging
part of it so similarly developer cloud
for the development environment mobile
for the applicant mobile part of an
application container cloud is the
interesting one where it's containers is
the in thing right so that's the if you
are wondering of if you have attended
any sessions on docker and containers
and kind of interested in kind of
exploring that space so this is where
they give you just a container
essentially it's like having a JVM
available to you so I just upload a jar
file for my application and I can run my
application there right so it's a
container based thing where I get a Java
SE for me ready to go I just it's not an
application server is not Java EE it's
just a basic Java SC or Norge ESS
supported there so
is what is available to you so again the
point is that you get all of these
clouds to work together to get your
application to do what it is expected to
do all right so it's not just one cloud
in isolation that will probably suffice
if it's a full-fledged enterprise
application just just buying Oracle Java
cloud service will probably not suffice
you will need to pick these other clouds
as well based on what the needs of your
application are okay so challenges what
do you think is obvious tell me what do
you think is the problem with using such
an environment any obvious ones
essentially you are getting you're kind
of pretty much committing to it right
you are if you're buying four different
clouds and entirely kind of using this
environment then you're pretty much
committing to it so you are kind of know
the Oracle guys probably will object to
me saying getting locked in because the
application that you're building is not
really cloud specific but then one might
if your kind of configured in a certain
way you are kind of tied in to using
that unfortunately there is no
standardization in the cloud where I can
just pick a configuration file from
Oracle cloud and I'll be able to deploy
it on some other code that is
unfortunately not there we don't have
any standards in that space so if you
are committing to the Oracle cloud you
buy four or five of these clouds to get
your application running it's pretty
much a long-term thing it's not
something that you can easily kind of
one from is what I would feel
future-ready
the reason I added at this point I added
only a couple of days back is because I
have been hearing so much about
containers and micro services and this
different way of building applications
so I personally am not completely
convinced of that being the right
solution for everybody but if at all
that is the direction that we intend to
take this is not really there you don't
have that as of now this is the
traditional WebLogic server with a
traditional java ee server now that
where you deploy a warrior and that is
what we have been doing for many years
so it works fine but if at all it
happens that one year down the line all
of us are going to be building only
micro services based container based
kind of applications this might suddenly
seem like outdated and something that
probably you should not have considered
maybe
I don't know well it's very difficult to
predict how the next couple of years
will go if I tell everybody starts
building just micro-services container
based applications then this investment
might not seem like a good idea two
years from now but if you think
development will serve your needs for
many years to come this this is
perfectly fine it's a completely written
one and you can do whatever you want
that's all the capabilities I would
expect from each other I said what are
there okay so that's about it
so I think I've completed much before
time so if you have any questions I'm
able I'm happy to address them my book I
think might be available in the
bookstore outside so do try out the Java
cloud service I think it's a wonderful
way to build applications that compared
to having servers on your machine and
managing all the stuff that you don't
really want to do so my primary thing I
tell people is that do the stuff that is
really critical to your business so
building your application is what you
need to focus on running the servers and
doing all that stuff is not really
something that you want your team to be
spending time on so if you can delegate
all that to the cloud and just focus on
building the core business logic for
your application the racket crowd I
think is a good idea so thank you so
much for your time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
