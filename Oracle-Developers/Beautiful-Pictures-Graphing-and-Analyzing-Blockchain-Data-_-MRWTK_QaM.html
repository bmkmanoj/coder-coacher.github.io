Los Angeles the first stop on the 2018
Oracle code tour I'm Bob revoir with the
Oracle developer community and my guest
is Alan Wu Helen thanks for stopping by
hi Bob your sessions coming up this
afternoon and you're gonna be talking
about Bitcoin and blockchain but before
we get into the head I want to ask you a
couple of questions about your
background you have a really fascinating
background what brings you to this point
in your career interesting question I
have been raised Oracle for about 18
years I spent a lot of time working on
RDF graph and then recent in recent
years property graph data model mm-hmm
essentially building a graph database to
support this roughly in a model and the
graph has always been really really
interesting to me because for one thing
you can visualize the data array in such
a beautiful way right I'm a guy who
cannot draw or paint or write if you
look at the stuff I draw it's just
really really ugly but with the graph
right if you have a data you can model
it properly you can ruin issue
absolutely beautiful picture so there's
something really get me going the
abstract to your session mentions a
pipeline I'm gonna I'm gonna read the
pipe leg that can be used to gather and
analyze blockchain data what's in that
pipeline describe that pipeline to me
yet the pipeline is sort of a typical
pipeline you're similar to machine
learning on data analysis pipeline right
you start with your source data here's
the Bitcoin blockchain data we get the
data out and then we look at the data
and see how we model it as a graph as
you can imagine there must be a lot of
transactions way
in blockchain right because people send
receive bitcoins all the time so those
can be easily modeled as edges in a
graph right so we model that as a graph
and then loaded into a proper graphic
database in this case Oracle database
and then we run query we're on
visualization we run analytical
functions to really gain insight into
the data it's impossible to open a
browser these days without seeing
content that focuses on Bitcoin and
blockchain and blotching in particular
as a disruptive or revolutionary force
within enterprise IT from your
perspective your focus is on
visualization and in malaises this kind
of data
how is blockchain disrupting that world
um that's a very good question
blockchain to me right provides a really
valuable set of data okay one of the
fact about blockchain and Bitcoin in
particular is all those transaction data
are in public or domain okay you can
easily start a Bitcoin daemon and then
the posting automatically all those
transaction data if you need to if you
have interesting understanding financial
transactions right how they work how
those factors how they interact with
each other right
this prop chain and Bitcoin data gives
you a really invaluable data set that's
how I see it because I always want to
analyze financial transaction data and I
have worked with different banks in you
know different POC setups right but
normally they do not give out their data
right it's all sensitive we serve our
customers it's about real-world
transaction data okay so as a developer
as engineer I never truly got hold of
real real-world transaction data and
this Bitcoin dated blockchain gives me
an opportunity to see
those transaction data starting from
2009 all the way to yesterday so that's
extremely exciting what challenges does
that represent for developers who share
your interest in it in in that that
visual aspect and the analyzation aspect
of that data I think it's a similar to
many of the machine learning or data
data applications right you need to
understand your data and you need to
bring it up okay the same thing applies
to a block chain and bitcoins okay you
need to be able to to pass the data
right to turn it into a shape that fits
your need in my case we get data from
all those blocks and then we do a
careful graph data modeling get a nice
graph and then we can do visualization
to graph query to analytical functions
what's the the easiest point of entry
for developers who want to dip a toe in
the water in it with regard to
blockchain and graphing data and that
sort of thing what's the easiest point
of entry for them yet there are some
open source blockchain Bitcoin you know
api's so using this API is you can
really inspect a block the contents of a
block kept those hashes or get those
transactions out right those are the
years a part and then for the graphing
part for the graph part right we
actually recently developed a set of get
started right how to get a study with
graph database so in sum the OTN is of a
blog website so one can take a look and
then it's actually not hard all you have
to do is to like you said if I dip your
toe in the water and then graduating you
will get their hand of it so do you own
any Bitcoin yes I and how are you
feeling about that these days well it
goes up and down right like crazy but
not very sensitive to the flock you know
price fluctuation to me it's very fond
Singh to hold and then also it gives me
this really invaluable data set to look
at so that's the priceless talk that's
what I was going to ask my assumption is
that you're less interested in it as an
investment and more in the technical
aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain
absolutely investment is it just the
sideline you know for bitcoins because
this is so volatile right mmm is you
know unless you Tunney want to diversify
in that direction you know we don't I
don't really recommend you know to do
that as investment but then the data pod
is very interesting for more information
on blockchain and a whole lot of other
stuff you can visit the Oracle developer
portal that's a developer oracle.com
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
