Atlanta I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network and my guest for this
segment is BD Wong BD thanks for
stopping by
thank you for having me tell me what you
do at Oracle and what sort of trouble
you get into oh yeah I have been working
for ago in the last I say what it say in
nine to ten years okay I'm a Oracle
cloud platform architect and focus on
Oracle technology in a pre-sale role
okay okay your session here is called
Edie Ellis to your chat how can I help
you
so tell me a little bit about your
session
sure sure definitely I would love to
share that so this is a story okay so a
lot of time you see customer have a
challenger with their e-commerce website
I usually come as example and oftentimes
the customer services one are important
pieces right as you see on the
e-commerce website you have a chat
session that you know customer can
conveniently chat with you now how do I
make sure you're just as in quality is
good and also you can provide 24/7
availability for the chat right so this
is a challenge that I do see a lot of a
custom may have now how do you dress
that so I use this as a use case to
demonstrate leveraging a modern
technology in this case I using AI
technology as a behind seeing chat
application that you can plug in to Adam
it eventually any application in this
case I using e-commerce as an example
and I shoe the cut the audience how you
leveraging this modern AI technology
build it out design it build it and
deported using modern technology which
is Oracle cloud who is Ellis
why does she talk so much and how is she
going to help my e-commerce application
that's right so Alice is open source
ái specification okay and the analyst
10-4 this is one of the question I also
asked my audiences which is who ever
answer discussion correct
I'll give the person USB Oracle USB
thumb drive okay so the analyst really
stands for artificial language
institution computer entity so in short
is really just a specification how you
would define artificial language in a
what we call AI markup languages so
that's what this is stands for so I put
those together
I call it Alice so you don't have a
picture of Alice in your wallet no you
know especially in popular culture
there's there's so much especially
science fiction you know depictions of
artificial intelligence gone haywire
does that in terms of the perception in
amongst customers with what you do you
know does that throw people off at all
yeah sometimes it's depend on how you
with that you know AI is introducing a
very unique benefit no III not just a
one way actually AI is providing another
learning capability so with this Alice
you can also let this antechamber and
learn what these strains are she
experiencing in this case you know what
the customer want yeah so she can
intelligently and changing the
conversation on the fly and and she can
do all that without taking coffee breaks
are expecting to exactly right here
that's the beauty of the the pop so will
you be presenting about Ellis or other
AI related stuff at any upcoming events
yes yes so in this version
my focus is show you how leveraging the
AI in
in one application right and there's
many phase of AI how to interact with
the people so the next version what I
want to do is actually adding another
human interaction touch to it
for example let's hope I add a voice
into this AI chepa right the way we want
to do naturally instead of you type it
in so that's another a variation I can
do in down the row for the Oracle code I
hope people can join my sessions so
rather than just a purely text-based
conversation which would be it actually
yeah have you played with the Aleks I
have not have you play with the Google
home I know I do have arms I do have
Alexa yeah yeah so you can speak to
Alexa and you can ask question to Google
home just like you would ask at it yeah
I like so makes me nervous because she
listens to everything I'm yeah so that's
a learning part well bTW thanks for
stopping by and talking to me and keep
me abreast of what you're doing this is
interesting stuff I'm fascinated thank
you for having me enjoy doing that if
