I'm your host Javed muhammad here I
develop a week in Auckland and I have as
my guest today he my you know Rashad who
is the lead scientist at the CrowdFlower
yes okay so am I in welcome thank you so
thank you so you have a great exciting
presentation as it happened or is it
gonna happen it will be at 8:35 3:25
today so if you here at the show come
check it out you know what room number
it's in I don't know you don't know but
anyway I'm sure it's on this show
schedule so what should what's your
presentation about so it's about how
wicked smart AI how we create a smarter
AI uh-huh so based on I met in the loop
most machine learning techniques that we
are developed mostly deep learning so
they are using either train data so we
have building a system database on
active learning and transfer learning
and we also use the course forcing to go
file label a data
so basically when we have a customer who
have a on label data in large amount
millions of data either can be text it
can be audio video images okay let me
carry just pause there for a second
because you covered a lot there first of
all you might talk about making AI
smarter yes I mean isn't by definition
AI smart we have we have using a tricks
and such a way to create machine
learning efficient a hand model and not
only all the models but we are designing
system based on our knowledge
so in short a bit of time more efficient
okay now so I'm just trying to kind of
parse what you said here because there's
a lot there you talked about active
learning you know what is that you want
to just talk to that so a in active
learning so we have like if we have a
customer who have one mil of data so one
way is that we take the data it's on
label so you got for either
so saying either maybe I hire some
labourer who entered those images are
data and I will train a system but in
active learning if we have a data we can
use existing lis available deep model or
machine learning model
we divide the data into confidence high
confident and low confident subset and
we go only for call sourcing our
labeling need no confidence data we
don't need to label high confidence are
already we have the system I didn't know
how to classify how to detect object in
that images ok so in that case we reduce
the performance reducing work of the
crowd or delay blur in that case we have
small things to do so and then we do
train the model only on low confidence
data then we improve the performance as
it's a pretty deep subject but if this
like one takeaway you want the the Peter
hopefully people will come and check
check it out and the show but for those
people who not what's like one takeaway
you want people to take it from your
presentation so one takeaway that I have
done study with the at our Medical
School about medical image
interpretations so in medical images the
biggest challenge is to get labels for
medical data and in conventionally
labels yeah so conventionally we use the
experts medic experts like pathologists
radiologists to label the medical images
and it becomes challenge that it's
time-consuming its costs costly and the
important things that is subjective it's
not a to be reproducible there come to
study in publish nowadays about the
disagreement or concordance rate between
pathologist is certainly they paper
publish in when a famous journal dhama
about 75 percent pathologies agree on
high-grade cancer and fifty percent
pathologies agree on early grade cancer
are non invasive appear invasive tissue
it's this random number how we can
generate a data from the car or from the
experts
where is 54 agreement so we'd need a or
debrief systems to assist the
pathologist to make a dag
says because this adaptive nature so for
that we need create a smart systems
scared computer area diagnosing systems
for that we need label data how we can
go the label data so we use I explore
the court sourcing in core sourcing
their multiple factors one factor is how
we can train a crowd to label a medical
data who don't have medical knowledge
okay so we can define it task and then
how we can aggregate so not one people
is using outsourcing yeah well it sounds
like a very intense presentation and I
hope the folks out there will check it
out mine thank you so much for dropping
by thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
