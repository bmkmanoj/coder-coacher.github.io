in Berlin my name is Yan feier from
Oracle technology Network and my guests
today are both from Jaipur so Florian
and hence Henry
welcome thank you
so I you to have the session today about
front-end and device effects with J Pro
so so what is Jaipur first of all Jaipur
the technology to run basically job
application in the browser to be more
technically it allows you to run
subjects applications in the browser so
you can go back to the old flora
principles that you write one
applications and can run it everywhere
Anthony what were the key points of your
of your session today yeah one of the
key points is like Lauren said is always
that you can run you can write one
single source code and run it basically
everywhere meaning mobile Android iOS
and stuff of course IOT and in the
browser and that's the new thing which
which is totally new for the world and
the second thing is that if you come
here the the the efforts of creating a
cross-platform application today with
Jai Pro and how how you have to do it
with classical web technologies today
with the currently high product like
yeah well I'm not going to mention any
names but today you have something which
is very - in two years statistically
you're going to have something totally
different which is very high and the
Java you know that you have consistency
and you can have a team which has Java
competence Java skills and they can
basically create software for all those
platforms and that's a token you knew
situation so right and you can
collaborate also I mean run something
that would be in the clouds with some
kind of back-end and front-end as well
yeah Java I'm assuming yeah that's the
next next thing that you can actually
take the absent put them into the cloud
so from a user's perspective the
perceptional from the user is that it
runs your application runs on his local
device but it can still run in the cloud
so it's very easy to administer and in
this case alright so you have an example
for us yes so that's what we've been
actually seeing on the screen so what
what is it's a sweater chat yeah at our
presentation I read a small 10-minute
live coding session where developed a
small chat application which is really
small it's very hard to make a smaller
chat application it's 20 lines of code
without imports and what makes it
interesting it sets application also is
a multi-user application either it
doesn't look so in the first place ok so
so tell us a little bit like so what are
we seeing on them yeah on a screen this
application basically has one shared
variable which are chat messages and
because of the architecture of kaypro
ceased chat messages I can be shared
with all the users which are visiting
the server and a chat application
doesn't need a lot of components it has
or it basically shows a list of the
messages which can be very easily
written in Java EXO and Pedro it has
input field which where the user can
write this message when he press ENTER
the message must be added to the chest
with a list of the messages and that you
must be cleared here even close to the
end of the program the messages are at
the top and to input you below and send
me an adder background images and finish
this your chat application I can quickly
run the application use so you can see
it's running
and when this application is run the
state floor and the webserver when you
can the multiple users can access it and
chat with each each other
okay and so like what would be for
example a way to deploy this application
so with what else can you integrate it
could you integrate it in a game or is
it just like more standalone chat
application so if the Jaipur platform
actually allows you to do more
integrations as well yeah because it
becomes very easy to create the
applications which collaborate because
sharing resources in the same layer it
becomes very easy so that's why such
chat application can be written in ten
minutes like lip oriented during our
presentation that you can only do with
this kind of architecture I think so
where can can developers find find out
more about the project and how to
develop with your tool right now we are
about to finish the release I think many
people would be that have monitor or
full of those would not be happy to hear
I think that we are coming eventually
now coming close to release final
release because you presented it at
JavaOne in last year and as you know we
got the Technology Award for that and
since then many people have been
registering our ticket system and
participated in the better program and
now I think they are starting to become
a little bit unpatient and now what does
do to eventually do the release of the
final product so that is now coming
close and it will be an article in the
new Java one magazine in Germany about
this release which is coming out of the
15th of June so before that people will
be able to to work with the final
release of j-pop excellent well
congratulations so thank you and thank
you for stopping by and talking to us
about some Gypo
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
