going to show you how to build a
reliable remote communication device
with Java ME eight battalion about me I
am a software development manager at
viacom i'm also v two cones
representative at the JCP ec to the
executive committee I believe you heard
a lot about the gcp on these javaone
hopefully you can get involved and I'm
also expect leader for the GSR 363 which
is units of measurement which is I
always pick a little more about the
units of measurement API here and these
are my contact information if you want
to get more information about what I'm
talking about here and played about my
company if you to come and we offer
Smart Grid technologies I've been doing
this for 10 years already I were at my
company at 49 years we do smart metering
an IOT before I OT and
machine-to-machine was like a big thing
with being reading electrical meters and
water meters in Brazil we have more than
one media devices connected to our
infrastructure using an hour device we
develop both hardware and software and
I'm possible for the guy responsible for
all software firmware in server side we
use Java from end to end we use Java or
embedded as I'm talking now we use Java
EE in the server side application so
that the data that is received from the
field is presented we use jsf and not
the GPA and all technologies to show it
now but in this talk will be talking
about the device what we actually do so
I'm going to talk to you about what is a
device that is reliable what when you
say reliable what does what do you mean
by reliable I will say what Java me
eight brought as improvement to our to
our development day to day so we didn't
have many upgrades and in Java me eight
until this year and I will talk more
about what Java me eight brought and if
you've been to Emmy eight sessions it
will be a little repetitive apologize
and I would also explain how Java me
eight is being used to improve our
current code so we are developing our we
are upgrading our firmer to be
compatible to Java me eight and I'll
show you more about what why Java me
eight is bringing more productivity to
us and also as my previous presentations
we also want more from the platform so
that's one of the reasons that we are
starting this GSR and I believe that
Oracle still has more work to do we in
the jsr s and the JCP can do more to get
the platform as best as possible to
build even matter devices so the
definition of reliable is a very wide
one when you say someone is reliable you
can mean say anything this is from the
dictionary something that can be relied
on dependable in achievement accuracy
honesty and etc but this this tree are
words Eve meant accuracy and honesty I
they define very well what we do at our
company so we define achievement as you
do not fail so you whenever whatever you
have to do you do not fail you'll have
to take into account many things so that
you achieve what you are your mission
our accuracy and do not lose data so
when we talk about the mark read and am
I devices we are talking about devices
that has to gather data every 15 minutes
or every minute or the painting and I'll
say if it's a sailboat from vinny issues
it's like every minute or a second and
can be to keep a drone to keep a drone
in route it can be micro second so you
but all this data you don't want to lose
it and honesty honesty you say do not
let the others temper with our data so
what it made the means means that
whatever you report that you read it has
to be what you read and others can't
like change it especially for example
now company in Brazil we do billing
systems for a large
lines so we are talking about billion
dollars revenues from utility
distribution that is being transported
by our devices so we can we can't afford
to be unreliable on that part so when we
say do not fail we have some have to
have some protections and the
protections are against the environment
so it's pressure I Brazil is like a very
hot plate and these devices can be up in
the polls and they can achieve up to 70
0 70 degrees Celsius which is a lot of
Fahrenheit so I don't know how many
sorry and we have to have protection
against the heat against humidity so do
we have clients by the sea so we have to
have a box and this does not have much
to do with software but we it's a device
that has to be very reliable and
protection against that not only the
environment can harm you but your own
your own soft hardware parts can be
dangerous as well so for example if you
use capacitors they can somehow explode
especially when they when it's hot and
then there's a capacitor and kit can
blow on your face so we have to test
against and protects against hardware
failures software failures are what we
normally call bug as a shortcut and what
we think is every software developer do
bugs does bugs on their life digiti life
it's a fact of life in but we have to
have protection against it so we try not
to change the developer we try to
protect against himself and attackers
when I say attackers we do have to have
protection about others trying to get SS
so I don't know if you've seen the die
hard for movie that they attract the
infra state infrastructure and they try
to black out in the city and stuff we
have to build a massive amount of
security into these devices because it
can be used as a tech vector for
infrastructure terrorist attacks and
stuff we are still not seeing this much
but we believe that this trend continues
we are going to see more of these and we
have to be ready to protect me protected
against it and when I do not lose data
we are talking about not losing data and
making sure the data is transferred to
the backend services so when you read
especially for battery-operated devices
view gather the data and then you store
it on a local machine and you have to
transfer it somehow afterwards or once a
day or twice a day so you have to store
it in a safe way and also transfer it
and guarantee that it's transferred and
now there are plenty of protocols being
merged emerging like Co app and H MQTT
that have some of these guarantees for
you so it's easy if you can use one of
these but they can be costly for for
example HTTP connection of our HTTPS
connection can be costly on over a
cellular connection or over satellite
connection so you have to have some
trade-offs as well so it's it's
important to guarantee that the data is
being stored on the back end services
and as I said a do not mess with your
data you have to take into account many
many problems then when you say security
as when you say sick reliably have the
definition that's broad when you say
secure have a definition that is broad
as well so I listed the three main
characters characteristics of security
that we take into account which is all
tainted authenticity like the data is
really sent from you so we are not being
personated by another device
confidentiality so only you and the
right server so it's only the target and
the center that can see the data and
integrity the data that is received by
the right person is the data that you
send so what we have to do to achieve
that we have like hashes we have HTTPS
the LS connections DTLS for Datagram
security have public key infrastructure
to guarantee that we are talking to the
right p
and digital certificates and all these
kind of stuff and Java ME supports all
of that so it helps very well and as on
this part so I'm going to talk briefly
about the Java ME improvements that we
have had on since April and now we I
didn't prepare my presentation for Java
for any it a tot one sorry they just
announced it but broadly what it brings
is a better conversions on the Java ME
and java SE I don't know how well it did
you work with Java ME before if you did
you will remember we had only Java ME
bonded tree syntax so we didn't have
many of the language improvements that
we see since Java five so collections
generics works for each try with
resources and stuff we have a server
slaughter pattern so it's very now Adam
being in this but his lecture he said
about the micro services now everything
is micro services and now we do have the
same abstraction here we can send event
and have services talking to each other
not in Jason but we have services as
well we have a finally out device I
abstraction so that we can interact with
objects in the real life very well more
security improvements with up-to-date
protocols for TLS one up for two and
other security protocols and we can
share the share libraries between inside
the device so what that means you don't
have to have multiple copies of your
libraries on your firmer anymore so cute
it is a sorry excuse me these shared
libraries what it means it means that
you have now you had once upon a time
you had one jar that you upload it to
your femur and it worked and if you try
to have two jars it could be a really
really messy now what is what did they
do we are now able to upload fragments
of code so Lee blitz that
contains code that can be reused by
multiple midlet and these makes it very
easy to do versioning to do controlled
update so you don't update the whole
firmer anymore you just play the part
that you need to be updated so it's less
prone to errors if there's a bug in a
version you don't spread it to others
you just spread for that library
specifically and as we the size of the
updates are smaller so is the the cost
the size and time is smaller as well the
service loader I don't know how many of
you have used it java SE 7 loader
pattern but we can now much like a GPS
lets you update defined services that
can be called by others we have the
service loaded pattern where you can
declare a client interface and have your
midlet served at interface and that
service which is implementing the
interface and the infrastructure the
Java ME runtime will resolve all your
interim dependencies for you somewhat
like osgi not the same complexity as
osgi but it's good to have now these
kind of microservices approach because
we can now instead of have monolithic
firmware we now have many services being
served in the in the framer so one of
the ways that these services
communicating with each other are with
events and this is now something that we
envy to come had developed in the in our
old former and they update it to Java ME
eight we have the same abstractions
about sending events and sending
messages that we have in JMS we can have
the same idea running on Java ME two so
we have a publisher publisher subscriber
pattern we have the firing forget a
pattern we are very well how do you say
that unlimited by what the platform can
do it's very easy now
to think the same way that you've
usually to think on your server side you
can think on Java ME you have also like
the intermediate communication with is
raw one-to-one communication so it's a
very fast and reliable way to know that
the guy like want to talk is there and
establish our like a local host
connection to another socket on the java
SE e version but it's our way of
communicating inside the former as i
said before the network security has
been enhanced it then we now have TLS
one day to support so it's a very good
way to not have to worry about security
anymore you just establish an HTTPS
connection and so you are secure and if
you are using UDP you can have CLS over
UDP using the dtls we also have a better
way to manage the application which is
an application management system they
can get really fine grained control and
what get installed and where and also
there you can install your agent that we
control that so you can implement the
infrastructure to get connection get
connected to a central server see if
there's an update for you if it is you
download it and install it and you can
all do that program at programmatically
that will suit your own need so it's a
very good that we now have that before
we only had just update this and you
pass any well and it downloads and
install it for you hadn't you didn't
have much control of the other device of
the update process and again the device
are you I there were many talks about
the Vice I believe I did I had seen some
and what it means it's a unified way to
interact with IO so when we are talking
about devices I have wondered such
device here I'll show some iOS from it
in a few minutes and it means that we
finally now have a standard way to
interact with many protocols that are
used
the embedded space sorry so I to see
gpios PRI uart PMW post counters
watchdog so it's very easy to to
interact with those and before you have
to if you were in the raspberrypi for
example there was the pie forge a
library or you had to rely on the
libraries that your provider gave to you
so the Gemalto for example the in their
chips they gave you some private classes
sorry proprietary classes that you need
to interact an open iqc connection with
AT commands so if you wanted to support
another board that was from telit for
example you had to rewrite your code so
it now we have a standard way to work
with the vice I with devices that are
external to our device so it's a and you
can do your own abstraction you just
extend the abstract device in the vise
provider and you have four if the
platform don't support what you want you
can extend your own and also continue to
use the same paradigm and as I mentioned
briefly I won't go into the tales I
believe all of you already know what is
like improved collections is we had to
only use vectors and hash hash table and
we didn't have like least and map and I
will show some code that now finally we
can use it we have english table two
modes of generics autoboxing static
important variation try with resources
all this is old news for java SE
developers where for java me develop it
is very very good to have and finally
somebody which Java Sea experience can
really go to Java ME and code and be
happy and not only using Java Sea
embedded but Java me for real low
capacity devices and how is that all
applied so I mentioned that the Java me
brought on lots of let's say improvement
that but that's good how how we VIP to
come are using it and what we had before
I did
last year saying what were the hurdles
and how we structured our firmer to have
a better way to work so because our we
do around for hardware so we have
multiple their own devices that we have
to support it go ahead I can go into
that when I run the demo there I'll show
you the memory footprint ok add memory
and storage ok so what we had before was
a three piece of software and one big
file to manage these three big fight
these three big part of software were
merged into one single file and Java
Wanda tree language which for us is like
letting which speak Portuguese we can
barely understand the Latin we can try
but it was very hard for a java SE
developer come and read java miko and
now instead of having one big file we
have multiple services instead of big
libraries we have less boilerplate code
instead of having like a if switch if
else if switch statement with strings
for 30 strings for commands for in the
shell we now have a noon so we can parse
twin home and use eight and we win a
switch statement which is much better
for each tribe with resources to avoid
leakage of resources and as the platform
incorporated more of these boilerplate
code we have to maintain last so it was
ok we had some of the pieces for logging
for example we had to maintain it and if
there was a bug in the login platform I
don't want the business clients they
don't want to care they don't care about
the you had a bug in your logging
platform they want to it to work so now
with let's go to maintain its easier and
faster to to attend the clients desires
these are the i can show code sorry but
these are the libraries that we are
developing that goes against the java me
eight library
so when you think about like an embedded
device it has to be reliable and be
always on and work with many kind of
devices that remote device legacy
devices we can talk about these
libraries so Krypton hashes I believe
you heard about the bouncy castle API
for crypto as well if they are a very
good library for that so some some
hashes and crypto protocols that they
are not on the standard vm you you can
can incorporate as I library advanced in
math show IE conversions and some kind
of operations are tangents kubek and why
this kind of operations we had into some
product also we have a shallow breath
for that cues as in file cues we can
send messages and receive these messages
concurrency so Java me eight guys they
decided they didn't need any concurrency
API so we only have synchronized to
synchronized code and synchronize it is
a very tough keyword because if it your
fur murlocs you don't know what where
it's locked and how long has it been
locked and you can't rely release the
lock easily so implemented our own lock
clasp so this kind of concurrency and 3i
sector service how this is concurrency
and personality that we have in Java me
java SE seven and eight we implemented
eyes lightweight version for it advanced
it by a string and might manipulation
that's really in device protocols and
units and measurements is jjs are that
we are working on an event bus there the
name is very easy to understand so
device protocols we have to talk dnp3
IEC 104 brazilian standards the lms with
many protocols it's not part of the
platform so we have to implement it and
as in service here so all these boxes
were merged in a single firmer and now
we can split the former into many
services that talk to each other
didn't draw lines because it was like
really messy because every service can
talk with anything so we have system
configuration remote transfer power
management firmware update management
resource management when management so
we can if the device loses connectivity
it can reload it and watchdogs logging
so a lot of services that we develop to
keep our device being reliable so safe
storage instead of relying only on the
platform we need us really safe storage
that will encrypt data have hash
verification black box so that we can
trace back what happened to our device
when it's for example being our wafers
for some wild so the technician can go
to the field and analyze what happened
and many other use cases and some data
acquisition with this the application
itself so read the term thermometer read
our a GPIO for alarms and this kind of
use cases and we believe that even
though the Java ME it was a huge step we
still have many more improvements to
come and we have room for improvements
and we are working actively we have
fatigue Kumar working with Verner chi
which is here in the audience as
speculates for the jsr 363 units of
measurement so one of the highest bug
highest recurring bugs that we have here
on the bed development is we don't know
how to map i'll be no no no sorry we
don't we did we don't have how to map
data in a static safeway so when you
read a thermometer you read it and store
it in an int or a long or a float or
double depending on your precision and
you could end up being reading in
Fahrenheit or in Celsius depending on
what the harder provided gave you and
also you could do mathematical operation
about with it so the developer could end
up summing two temperatures or a
temperature
and a timestamp so this kind of
necessity we always had in our framers
and also unit conversion so when I said
fahrenheit in celsius this kind of
conversion it depends on who is using
the code and who is reading so when you
statically type it it's really easier to
maintain the code as well no this is a
code example that we are working on
right now so it's a temperature record
it is a time stamp but it's time so you
know it's time instead of a long so a
temperature you know it's a temperature
it's not our velocity it's not speed
it's not anything else and what's the
sensor that you can each coming from so
we still don't get the name of sensors
or it's a string on and also we are
targeting these jsr for oh sorry we are
targeting these GSR for Emmy because
that's our strength but also al-kitab
you with auto fuel sorry no todavia
which is so Java member and commuter to
open g gk is actively working on as a
seaport for the GSR so also we not only
we get because as the Java ME 80
language is closer to the Java Sea it's
when you code for java me eight you are
actually coding for java SE 7 because we
don't have lung disease streams and
parallel pies and all these cool stuff
that everybody is talking about and we
don't get any of that so out of you is
enabling de jsr to become more java sc8
like and now we have stuff like streams
lambda high precision that we don't have
big decimal in the java me so he's
enabling that and also all this stuff
that you get like producers sorters
summation group and filters that's the
kind of that's a simple of code that we
can't run on java me but the view is
making sure that we can run this the
same epi but implemented by the
implementation for java c 8 it will be
easier to to use as a java 8 api
when you think about it like every I
guess every developer uses some kind of
unit it kit is bank users they have
money okay but uh this the people have
at least age and some others
characteristics that normally we could
as int or long or float and it's it's
bad when you have like four int in a
class that we each is one out with one
value in others so we are trying to
solve that kind of problem and also
conversion so you don't have to write
your own angles to radiant conversion
and Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
tools enough of this kind of the code
boilerplate code now let's try to make a
standard for it so we are going for this
GSR and should you can get involve it I
skip the oh sorry let me go back this is
our overall for the project so you can
get involved it we have the JIRA that
you can fire wishes we can we're also
making sure that there is a compiled
version so you can download and try it
and as from room for improvement week we
need more configuration support as there
is there's a prob not private a
proprietary API for configuration which
is really simple doesn't take into
account multiple devices or multiple
variables so it's where we can go as
well and yeah you may have heard about
the configuration API that Anatole was
working on we are trying to make one
single configuration API for java me SE
na let's see if it works out concurrency
utilities as I mentioned we don't have
any contribution support and we'd like
some and some standard protocols like
ever and there are some emerging
protocols like MQTT co-op Jason HTTP and
rats that we didn't have to have to port
a library or implement our own
json.parse or stuff like that so we are
looking at Oracle is also making some
improvements for HTTP and JSON for
example let's see how that goes and
that's the presentation so
I it's question and an interest but i
will start entering your first question
with a demo so blah blah blah boring no
developer likes presentation they likes
code so i will show you i just need to
make sure that it's working or not
working visible sorry if I know it's
it's really small right now trying to
guess it's best to really configure
there how do you do that options editor
fonts and colors mah no space 18-24
readable ok so ah just yesterday and the
day of the day before yesterday we got
Java me running on this platform so what
is this platform it's a frisky okay 70
platform so it's a relatively not
expensive version it's not the case 64
that they are now set it's another
platform the different platform because
this one we we have more memory and more
storage available everything runs from
the SD card and they shall this
development kit that you can buy and it
ends up being like this tower here and
here we can we have internet we have an
SD card the serial port we have a gpios
and i'll show you some code that i don't
know we'll show you how how good we are
on java me development it won't even
look like Java me if I showed this to a
Java Sea developer he will say okay it's
I can understand it so logging logging
framework everybody who uses but nobody
uses but everybody is of knows that
there is a java oh you to blogging and
we can use this for for logging we
didn't have that we have you later with
generics listing our GPIO pins
and we are going we are going to find
out which are la deepings we are going
to list all your our gpio devices and if
the name starts with gpio light
underscore that we note in this board
that they are LED pins we are adding to
our tour led pins collection we didn't
have that collection and then we use a
timer passing that the timer will blink
these lads enough okay fashion and then
we just say goodbye and forget about
these other code let me show you blinker
blinker have collections generics
diamond operator are for each it has
also tried with resources these other
ones will show you try with resources so
we can try GPIO pin open a GPIO name and
it will blink setting value is so
instead of doing 80 comments to operate
or instead of having others proprietary
net proprietary the API that when you
change your device for any reason you
have to rewrite our code against another
API you have a single way and one good
thing that they did for the eight dot
one release is that this is going to the
JDK so the same API that is available
for java me is going to be available to
the java SE as well so it's a work in
progress but they are doing it shows
that we are getting even more
integration for Java ME and Java C so i
will run this code just to show you how
easily so did that means i don't know
how many of you like it or not but they
have a pull a very good plugin for it
and we when you start a java sdk it'll
installs your device connections manager
install you some emulators here you can
see the mount right here and what
happened is you this java verily
you can interact with it over tcp/ip so
you had a new device let me you start
from scratch so i can add i can do it
over comport the painting of the
platforming if it doesn't have an
internet connection you can have a
comport but the tcp/ip connection is
best is better you just add a new device
it connects it shows on netbeans and you
can right click and run project there
and it will open sorry it will open and
it will open yeah demo time is always
interesting right it will open so let's
try again as well because the other one
was open when I removed it that's right
tension tension tension yeah there we go
so replying to your so now it's blinking
that the LED let's have photo photo
booth here so it's blinking the LEDs it
has it found four LEDs and it's now
blinking in alternate fashion so it's a
this code here so let me show blink here
again so for each gpio that it has for
each you set up our current value and
negates it so in the other one will be
off if the next one was I this one was
on and so it blinks alternate and so
going back to blink here there goes oh
it's blinking and it's a very simple
application just to show you how you can
really start working if you are a java
SE developer and start working with Java
ME and to answer his first question
about the the footprint this is a big
device it we chose here that we have
almost 2 megabytes of of heap without
any running application when you just
run it it gets down to 12 52 and this
and is for ram and 4 for flash
requirements I have it here somewhere
it's a very simple show as the car so
the Java me being is 3 megabytes and we
have also these everything here it has
to be copied to the to the SD card so in
total we have yeah 3 megabytes of
data that it has to be stored in the
flesh and just the jvm with all support
to all API so it's not a nada is Molly
not a small environment it's a very it
has configuration generic I euro it has
Jason plop parsing it has web services
crypto events oh well too so a very huge
environment and the base ram that you
needed to have available to you is less
than 200 bites the Holly kilobytes sorry
so and depending on the board that you
are working with so the key 64 the way
they did it the key 64 is a very
restricted chip and but it's a
system-on-a-chip so it has fixed memory
and you only have 60 60 k of ram to work
with it on for your hip but they taking
a cut in vm and all stuff on this one
this board has external memory so you
can make your platform as big as you
want if you go higher than I don't know
64 megabytes or even less you can start
already working with Java Sea embedded
because you already have a very powerful
platform but for has been pi you can go
both ways you can go you can have Java
ME 84 the device highway p is for
example or some security p i said that's
not there yet or you like the
provisioning model for the java me or
you want to run the same firmware but
faster or more instances you can go java
me for the Raspberry Pi and now you can
go yeah you can help you can have both a
vm running as well so it's a it's a very
good point to start and then decide what
their our needs and go lower or go
higher if you want and that's so that's
the requirements i guess that answers
your question
on the phone so okay okay so the place
for Java ME ok so it's a very good
question on droid is odd Java let's
start with that so Android is uh let's
say it looks like Java has the same API
says Java but is has a different vm
dates a implementation by google it has
nothing to do with Java ok yes and
phones are not embedded anymore so my
iphone 6 iphone 5s has more processing
power than that board way more they cut
off so phones are not mobile phones are
embedded that's the one definition and
when we say that the internet of things
happening and all these devices that has
to be connected or that already exists
and have to be connected or that are
being connected they have a very
weakened and the same processor as our
phone or the has berry pie it's very
expensive when you are controlling a
lamp LMK low cost fifty dollars more
just because it's connected to the
internet so we do have on a chip that is
very small very low power consumption
can run on batteries can have femurs
running to it and we now are talking
about five to ten dollars at most so I
believe that's where the are your client
will sell tell you it's so expensive for
my need or if you our case for example
when we started ten years ago there
wasn't many platforms like this one so
we started with a SE microns of
microcontroller and we had these
assembled phones as the modem because
there wasn't many many platforms
available and we use it the motives we
send SMS messages as communication and
when we had to transfer large files
did a CSD connection which cost which
which was very expensive and as the
platform the technology evolved gsm came
to to existence especially in brazil it
took a little while and the platforms
with Java ME started to show up we could
develop hardware and firmer that the
deed what the client had to do so for
example smart metering we the guy has to
go a person has to go each month to read
what's on the meter of the client either
residential or commercial or an industry
and these has a cost and some of these
are in the middle of nowhere in San
Paulo in the in Sao Paulo state so it's
like 400 kilometers away from the base
it has a dr there so so there's a cost
of operation and we started doing
solutions that cost the last then the
curt the current status quo I saw the
client see value and they buy it so when
is when we say Java ME it is the
language that's good for embedded as
devices that are not operated by humans
inna direct way like phones we like we
operated and all of the I don't see java
me being language we each start they
tried and I don't know how and why it
failed for phones and I guess maybe the
technology the whole technology the
processor power of the phones that was
not good enough maybe the language
wasn't ready the development community
wasn't ready to customers weren't ready
to to buy into having mobile phone and
mobile applications now it's much easier
and yes we have Android and have iOS and
they are the windows is trying now and
they are the current phone languages but
I think for in real embedded as in
devices that had to be controlled by
other systems or order divided other
devices java me is really strong unknown
that
they are using a lot of internal edge
device so it's what's on the field
really owns also on a sailboat sorry
naturally the Arduino platform is less
processor capable of this kind of
solution so our he can he's Arduino fan
but they are really low power really low
memory really low energy consumption and
you yeah my level below so if you if you
were to draw let's say spectrum of
devices you could say that you are you
have a twin on cortex m0 and these kind
of really low level microcontrollers
that they are going to do one single
function it will do it very well and
will mostly not likely have a firmware
update so it's like a switch that turns
a lamp on and off in its use your case
you don't have to have fermer upgrades
because you either turns the lamp on or
off or not you can't fail on that yeah
even without j unit even without a unit
it can fail right if you if it turns on
or turns off it's okay so but this these
really low device will have a
communication port so I QC rs40 84 85 a
serial port communication what have you
and it will communicate with something
else or some wireless protocol it will
this gateway most likely be Java me so
it will be it could be Java see if you
are like being a home gateway so and
what they're building or what they built
over using Java even java ee with
glassfish and open lab right it was like
us
Tom java ee application ready but if you
don't have debts like power hungry and
that's a power processor-intensive if
you want to do something cheap and
something that's industry standard so
that it can stand heat is stand be a
fanless operation it's a very important
for industry to not have any moving
parts so these kind of devices that are
good for java me and I'm sure go ahead
yes so what what I showed here it is a
synchronous so I did it very simply but
here you see it's a timer from what we
have as in timer and timer task since
Java for I guess or Java three I don't
know don't remember since when do we
have it seen Java 103 so we w two timer
it starts a new thread and this is at
red that's running and let's try to
debug the thread here can i debug
Terrence should work okay let's write in
the bucket yep let's every bleeding
edges so I like the we made this board
work with the latest Butte and this week
and Java one so it's bleeding bleeding
edge here right oh I guess it may not
work from a low access windows so oh it
works see impressive eh yeah it's here
yes it work yeah so we have three tribes
we have three threads and once I do
schedule here it will let's do them I
step I'm not a
ok so it's so there is a no there is
there's a blinker thread here which is
the name of the thread that I specified
here in the timer so you have it running
so now it's blinking even though the
main thread is stopped here at the
logger and if I show photo booth again
all right there you go it's still
blinking so it's really multi-threaded
so it has stretch it has everything and
yes so that's one of the reason we we
have a Java niño which is the new I off
that has a very much a synchronous
coding either we it support on Java me
eight as well so not the fool juvenile
is not java niño too but javanne oh and
there is four so if you are reading a
device for example that has serial port
communication instead of being led in
the board you can do an i/o co2 against
it so your protocol can be really a
synchronous on that note on that sense
yes and you have timers we have we don't
have for example as I said we don't have
lock still I want lock but they are
going to build it these Terrans he's a
project manager for pres manager right
for java me and we worked really really
together to get these platform running
as as good as we can because we don't
want to keep maintaining this
boilerplate code at once I've walk like
I haven't Java Sea so why not can why
can't i have it on a me and all these
kind of discussions we are having using
so on let me show you another board that
i took a picture in the here in brazil i
did a talk about java me eight as well
and this board is a Gemalto concept
board i don't know if you've already
seen here we have let's try and not fall
we have our Gemalto e hs6 chip that
already in bed
the cellular communication 3g
communication and here so it's at the
board that you can prototype with it's
compatible with arduino so if you have a
shield that due to your sensor already
you can just attach it here he'll put a
sim card connection antenna and you are
good to go you can prototype these and
then take these out and go to production
so it's very really a concept board is a
good name for it because you can build
your concept and go to production after
you saw the project so it's a different
platform and a good thing for us what we
want Java we can go at the same firmware
that runs on that chip should run on the
freescale ship without any changes that
one runs on Java ME 32 so it's not the
same version but when they release the
Java 8 version it should run the same
general that's what that's why we want
Java to work in how it works on
computers now we want you to work the
same way on the embedded devices okay
that's it you know yes go ahead no
because it's huge as hell yeah sure how
can I start so Java me eight let me just
I can show you the admits if I have
connection so there is a lot of material
on the internet I just close it it so
you have to own on Oracle's site you can
you have many examples about how to use
Java me eight for example I had a
problem with permission when I was
developing this code i forgot about
permissions and it so it's a very step
by step how do you do it especially with
the hardware pie it's a very good
resource if you choose do and to start
so you want a Java ME eight enable
device and then you want to start coding
against and you get netbeans you get the
ma SDK and there's documentation you can
start it as they announced it let me get
Wi-Fi
let me unplug this so they are now you
are now announcing the a dot one
developer preview so you can buy this
board as well so it's a really
inexpensive board it's thirty dollars
you can go for example Mouser they
resell it no not yet yes the massive
online course yes so let me just show
the part so you can go to our retailer
we're like mouser electronics they sell
these boards it's info fortunately out
of stock already it was it they had 17
on stock one day before they announced
it and I bought two and it should arrive
on today on my hotel and so you can buy
it's a simple board there are very
simple aboard that you can its arduino
compatible as well it's a what me show
you on the it's very small so it they
are the Reno form factor it's made to
fit on altoids you already know that I
believe and not all toy box box so it's
really really small and let me show back
to camera so here this is the main
freescale chip and we get a a CD to to
store your data but all java machine is
run run again from the chip here and
it's very simple as it has a direct
connection some breakout pins so you can
have gpios it's very easy to get it
started with this kind of platform you
just plug it on
the Micro Micro USB here it shows as a
as a disk on your on your computer you
run job you drag and drop the Java
binary into it and bang it prints java
so it's really a dress i can try i can
have some six minutes i can try and ruin
not the right cable ah yes a second yes
thank you
I have to put it on the other end as
well
let's see if everything works now let me
have to reboot it so on also I was
running this on a virtual machine inside
Mac OS so even if you don't on windows
because everything is very windows basic
for java me unfortunately so but if you
can code using the vm so it's not a big
deal and after you do install the api's
you can have it over internet so if you
don't even need the USB connection USB
is only for for power source
mmm let's see I guess it will be which
console put it in a video
and I don't think it's let's get
captured a USB port but it should be one
of one or two let me just do a quick
pain
yeah it's 100 into you yeah there we go
so it should appear here somewhere some
okay any time now so this is it shows
here as well and this one is a little
has less information so helpful as
capabilities so it's a very this is up
cheaper device it's a less power-hungry
last memory has everything so but it's
still run java I don't know if it will
work with my code maybe we can try I
don't know if it has as many how many
LEDs that is does it have to know turns
tree all right it should work yep
platform here and say okay okay I should
work the same
is gpio LEDs as the surface kill the k70
is the same the names LED well let's do
it like this assistant oh that will make
perfect sense
I should be able to deceive run up the
air assault
now I like it here
so now it shows that much less ran and
heap size available to you so and it's
slower and it might work let's see if it
works if it doesn't then new files a new
bug so file yeah I'll know that the
problem about the versions different
versions remember the different versions
for the device manager it won't work
here it over here so there is a known
bug sorry we tried yesterday and even
work at yeah so let's but the idea is
the same you can do take it and run in
with get it running after you Oracle
release the a dot one final release
general release it will work the same
using the using these the same API is
the same devices will work on this zone
there you go that's it I don't think we
have any more time it's like 5pm row now
there you go thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
