Haley we work for Oracle and this talk
kanna came from us starting something
entirely new we we didn't really know
anything a couple of years ago about the
mobile space we're both the server side
developers and are sort of very strong
on server side architecture and then we
we kind of ended up on this new project
about mobile cloud stuff and we didn't
really know much about mobility we knew
about the cloud we we've been doing some
work there but as far as a mobile cloud
platform we didn't so we did a lot of
Investigation we did some homework
looked around an awful lot read a lot
and finally kind of got a grasp of the
landscape and where things were going
and and then we started working on a
product at Oracle that is called mobile
cloud service and the result of all the
things that we learned in general we
thought we could kind of abstract that
out and provide an overview to to people
about where mobile server side is going
in general so that's what this talk is
it's about mobile cloud service for the
enterprise this is not about
applications how many people here are
mobile developers people that write apps
for the mobile device okay so it's just
a few of you I'm can we close the door
and lock these guys in because this may
not be very interesting for you we're
essentially going to be talking about
the server side because that's all we
know but but but it does become relevant
to the client side to the mobile device
because this is the new world of
developing mobile applications this is
how things will happen in the future for
enterprise mobile apps with that in mind
we'll move along and talk about mobile
devices for just a second vaca I
remember a time when when I didn't want
to carry more than one device on me I
swore that I would buy a smartphone when
it was really smart and when it could do
everything that I wanted it to do and
that would be my one device I didn't buy
into the fact that I needed one device
to do one thing and another to do
another thing but is it
note you know it becomes really hard to
run an IDE on a phone there's just lots
of things you don't want to do on
certain types of devices so it then
became the norm for people to come into
a conference room and no open up their
laptop lay down their tablet put their
phone down beside it and who knows what
else they're their watch and their
glasses or you know our devices are
starting to proliferate and devices have
their own purpose and we expect to buy a
device that's fit for that purpose and
we use a device in a given context so
devices are not actually getting fewer
to do more things are getting more and
more specialized now and I was quite
surprised when I saw you know the Fitbit
or the you know whatever your favorite
brand name is that that does it tracks
your life in the bracelet that sort of
very special and yet you're wearing a
whole whole device for that wearables
are becoming more and more popular so
the ubiquity of mobile devices is
probably not under question and we're
not going to get a lot of questions
about that one however i think the
philosophy that each device does mean
something specific in a specific context
and is meaningful for a specific type of
application is probably not well
understood by many people but what we
want at the enterprise is to be able to
develop an application that is
multi-channel meaning that we can
provide the application logic not have
to rewrite it for every single channel
you're developing it for but that each
of those channels has and supports that
application in a way that makes sense
for that device that is contextually
sound and appropriate and that's where
the challenges of enterprise
applications and mobile devices come in
you have all of your data sitting in
these backends if you talk to an
insurance company or some of these
companies with lots and lots of
resources and people and money and data
it's all sitting and you know a few
places very very protected guarded
places with locked doors
and cooling and and certain gray-haired
people with beards who could access it
well this this data is just the
beginning you have to integrate with
that data from all of your applications
and it turns out that more people are
worried about one thing than any other
and that one thing is security so they
keep their data locked up and they're
used to knowing that the data is locked
up if you go to a mobile device and the
data is now wandering around wherever
the guy who's holding it is wandering
around then that makes IT people a
little bit nervous they don't like the
fact that the data is out of their
control and that lends to security
problems and and they're right I've seen
people at airport security walk off and
leave their laptop or their phone and
just forget it there that's that's a
whole Lots precious data they've left
there and that's made it vulnerable so
there's security and then there's the
problem of developing the client side
with every device comes some native OS
or proprietary p is and those api's may
require if you decide to go native may
require a whole bunch of development and
so the questions all these questions are
part of the problem that IT people have
to answer when they say we're developing
a mobile strategy and then there are the
process problems I don't know how many
people work for bigger companies that
have been around for a while and that
have a lot of processes in place but I
work for Oracle and Oracle has been
around a long time it has a lot of
processes in place and changing those
processes has not been easy it's never
easy in a big corporation to change and
when Oracle changed to suddenly become a
cloud company that took a lot of getting
used to we had to we had to go from
releasing a product potentially one
every every one to two years to now our
cloud product ships an update or upgrade
of sort of new features every quarter in
a patch release every two to four weeks
this was a huge change for us and this
is just an example
of process changes that exist out there
and then make things difficult for
mobile applications and then of course
everybody wants it done yesterday and we
know that there's pressure from all
sides on IT staff so Jason's going to
show us some of the other problems in a
more concrete way yeah so I mean you
talk about applications and then you
know it's it's not that big a deal you
know you want get all the stuff in there
this is the type of app i'm sure a lot
of you have seen in the past no very
fairly straightforward human resources
application you've got a profile photo
some basic employee information how long
they've been with the company
information from your last evaluation
know their office location that sort of
thing you know what that's that's
manageable you know I can do that I can
write that type of application we just
start to split it up and you realize
well there's actually a lot of different
pieces of information in this to break
it down again there's a lot of
information it's a lot of information
coming from a lot of different places so
in this case the profile photo might be
coming out of cloud storage somewhere
your basic human resources information
could be from your on-premise HRM system
your social social network information
could you know it's coming out of the
web you've got your talent information
soon as your last set of eval reports
you know how's this employee doing that
could be on some cloud talent management
application you got your google maps
pulling out your location all that sort
of stuff there's a lot of information in
there so all of a sudden this simple HR
appt got pretty complicated pretty fast
we're going to leave this up to your
application developer to try and figure
it all out if they're writing android
apps and iOS apps so they have to worry
about writing push notifications to the
two different types of systems what
about analytics how do you capture
analytics if everything is being written
on the mobile device do store your
metrics on the device you call up all
the people using your app and say can i
download all these metrics now to do
some analysis you can't do that the
client guy is already worrying about
what dev tools he's going to be using so
you don't want to confuse the the topic
even more of that
then the big problem is the integration
so we talked about the a lot of those
back-end systems where this data is
coming from it can be from all sorts of
systems they can be on premise that
could be hosted in the cloud elsewhere
all sorts of different companies the
protocols how you communicate with these
is all going to be different securing
them is going to be different it's a
really big challenge and we're just
talking about one simple human resources
application if you're working for a big
company you're going to have dozens and
dozens of these applications are you
going to do it all over again have each
app developer learn how to integrate
with SI p year with the oracle database
not likely will take a bit of a look now
at the platform itself so basically so
these are the problems the app developer
faces that's where the platform comes
into play that's there to basically
abstract a lot of those problems away
simplify the life of the application
developer so that he doesn't have to
worry about all these details the
platform should be doing that for you
and it'll provide that framework to
allow you to write multiple applications
shared with those with the using those
reusable pieces that you've created so
we'll take another closer look at the
platform now start to drill down but
first we'll just take will take a bit of
a another look at some of the different
apps that you might be writing so b2c
and b2b business to consumer versus
business to to to employee so when
you're talking about the
business-to-consumer b2c this is your
typical angry birds app you're trying to
reach out to the masses you can't really
trust them because you have no idea who
they are for the most part and it's a
large large number of users you have no
control over the device you don't know
it again if you're reaching out to as
many customers as possible they could be
using iOS that could be using Android
you don't know what version of the OS
they are using you don't know what
configurations they have on their mobile
device you don't know what other
applications they have no the sky is the
limit they are the the permutations of
things you might have to worry about
this grow and grow
and user profile for the most part these
will be anonymous you may have minimal
profile information typically if you do
self registration when you first
download the app you might give them a
little bit of information but for the
most part these users are anonymous you
don't know anything about them contrast
that to your betta yet so these are for
your enterprise applications for your
employees for them for the most part you
trust them you hope you trust your
employees you're talking about a much
smaller scale in terms of number of
users you have somewhat more control
over the device itself your employees
are still going to be bringing their own
device you know company like Oracle
isn't going to buy mobile devices for
100,000 plus employees so you're going
to have a multiplet of devices but it is
fair in that situation to promote to add
a few more constraints to the
environment you can require before your
employees use certain apps that they're
on a minimum OS version that they have
certain configurations enabled and they
may have certain other applications
installed as well the flip side to that
is you've also got because it's their
own devices you're also putting
potentially critical corporate
information on that possibly sensitive
data but it's your employees device so
that's where the M am and MDM come into
play those are mobile application
management and mobile device management
will go into too much detail on those
today but in a nutshell if that device
ever gets compromised if it's lost or
stolen you know you could potentially
wipe it remotely and even if it's not
that it allows you to make sure that the
data on that device any corporate
information is properly secured and in
this case unlike the the b2c apps you
tear I'd like to be to see apps you
typically have a good idea of who your
users are you trust them they're your
employees they typically have identity
stored within your local IBM system and
it's a bit of a hybrid to these types of
apps you know these are sort of the two
extremes there's everything in the
middle if you look at a banking
application
no that's out there for the masses large
number of users but you can typically
trust them because you you'll have
information about them they typically
hold bank accounts at your bank so that
there's a bit more profile information
things like that you take a high-level
look at the platform itself so on the
left you've got your devices so this is
the the application developers realm you
dealing with multiple os's multiple
device types native cetera et cetera but
that's completely decoupled from the
platform itself so your app developers
free to use whatever tools they want in
whatever fashion they want the only
thing that they worry about is there
going to be talking to a pap is hosted
on your platform and for the most part
those will be done over rest at the top
is sort of another layer the the
management layer where you do all your
monitoring administration configuration
again will typically talk through rest
through met these management API is that
your platform will expose for those
types of operations the thing that's
interesting about this view is dependent
what your role is at the company when
you log into this console and start
doing your work you're going to
typically get a different view if you're
this guy over here who's the application
developer and you login the main thing
you're interested in and what you'll
likely see is a list of all the api's
that are available to you what are the
parameters that are required and so on
if you're a system administrator and you
log in you'll be able to see how the
system is performing there been in the
outages things like that or again if
you're a business type you can log in
and look at various analytics reports to
find out you know how is my application
being used is it being accepted is it
being used more North America or in or
in Asia on the right these are the
external systems we lure it to those
earlier these basically put the
enterprise in in EM Baz that's where all
the that the real critical information
is going to be or you're hitting your
external databases your your human
resource systems and the communication
to those could be different it could be
so could be rest different security
protocols like we talked about before
all those pieces are essentially
external to the system the platform the
heart of it is what's in the middle
job is to really simplify going from
point A to point B I said before the app
developer he's just worrying about the
api's he needs to talk to and the
platform is what helps your server side
developers take care of all the hard
work in talking to those back-end
systems and providing all the api's and
all the utilities that your mobile
application developer can use hand over
to Mike again so API management how many
people here have are using have heard of
are aware of this whole idea of API
management okay about half of you so for
the other half of you to kind of fill
you in on on what's going on in the API
management world API management is about
the ability to define a set of api's
through some API definition language and
there are a number of definition
languages out there and then be able to
attach some kind of implementation to
that API definition and that
implementation then is decoupled from
the definition itself the user just like
you know if you all know Java you know
how Java works you have an interface and
you have a class that implements the
interface and the interface separates
the client from the implementation makes
sense well that's exactly what an API
manager does but in a more generic way
API management tools tend to be more
arrest oriented and they allow you to
define the API in terms of some restful
spec like Rama or some such thing and
then allow you to upload the
implementation for that API and that
implementation may take any form the
important thing is that you're
implementations decoupled from the API
that it implements and then the API
manager provides a way to secure your
API and that might take any number of
forms as well and we'll talk about how
that works shortly but the idea is that
API managers provide a whole backbone
for invoking and supporting hosting
api's and that API catalog the Jason
alluded to in the previous slide where
the mobile developer wants to look at
all the API is that they can in
this API catalog would be typically
provided by the API manager it can list
all the API is that it hosts and of
course there has to be some runtime
hosting that goes on there you have to
run the implementation somewhere and
this happens again on the API manager
level and then the last thing API
managers do is they can monitor and
allow you to find out what's going on to
your api's who's calling them and how
often and how long those api's are
taking to be run and so forth so API
management has come to be a very
valuable thing and it's I think sort of
blossoming right now and their number of
companies out there that are sort of
strictly API managers and making a
pretty good business at it well we're
talking about mobile backend as a
service and mobile backend is a service
I think of that as actually API
management plus plus it's it starts with
OPI management because it is about
multi-channel right we need we just we
determine that at the beginning of the
presentation that you may have all kinds
of different devices and channels that
you'll need to support but you have a
set of additional core services in an M
boz that provide mobile features for you
and this goes above and beyond what any
API manager would do these special
services from mobile would be things
like push notification or geolocation
these sorts of things special analytics
for mobile devices these are features
that the mobile backend as a service
platform will provide on the server side
in addition to all the API management
facilities that you're going to get and
then it has to provide some really nice
mechanism to be able to connect to
external data sources because remember
that's where all the money is that's
where the data is that's where the real
resource rich stuff exists at the at the
sort of final data level and these
external data sources are what people
really need to access in order to get
their system going this is where the
data comes from the analytics we've
talked about already they're pretty
valuable again the mobile events from
mobile devices
get registered on the server side you
need the support on the server side for
these types of analytics features and
events so M Baz takes the lead from I
would say from API management and then
carries it off into the mobile space and
provides much more now we're going to
dig right into the the platform itself
on a feature by feature level the first
thing on the this is similar to what
Jason was showing on the Left we see the
the devices that are accessing the cloud
service and these devices are
essentially making rest calls to API is
that exists on the platform so the
platform api management layer is sitting
there in the mobile cloud service and
these guys are invoking that through
some rest call and there helps it
usually helps if there is some sort of
SDK there it doesn't need to be there
but if the mobile cloud service provides
some kind of SDK to run on the
particular platform that you're running
on then it makes for much easier in
vacations it will take care of some of
the security wrapping you know creating
tokens for you making rest indications
for you anything that might take a
little bit of work can be handled by
some SDK layer that sits there and then
on the other side on the far right are
the external apps and systems those
external apps and systems we talked
about as being external data but if you
look a little more closely they could
come from any of three big categories
the first is and then another cloud
service you know the cloud services
themselves are fairly broad and and
specialized and so you might from this
cloud service invoke other cloud
services it's more and more common to do
that each service provides its own
special benefits then we have the
on-premise packaged applications and
these applications are typically quite
protected by the by the the customer
they they have may have a lot of special
types of data there and and then you
have custom applications that that might
have very custom protocols involved
there and so you might have data that
you want to access in in each of those
and as mentioned already rest and soap
are probably the more common protocols
that you use to get to them and one of
the problems that we found as we were
investigating this problem is the idea
that some of these backends actually
require a kind of a session interface
there they require state fulness on the
part of the collar and if we are coming
into a mobile cloud platform and they're
restful calls going all the way through
the connector then you you don't really
have a great solution to to call these
stateful session-based backends and so
this is a problem that the mobile cloud
service has to has to deal with and
figure out some way to do and and I
think there's probably different
solutions for that one is that you store
some kind of state as some sort of
identifiers that gets put in the storage
service and then the client device just
stores that identifier and passes that
in as kind of a session ID as it were
and then its own code goes and looks up
that state in the storage service then
goes off and calls a connector with that
state that's one that's one way there
there are others as well but but that
does that it is a little problematic
when you it's sort of an impedance
mismatch when you have a restful system
speaking to stateful systems in the back
end so it's not unique to this cloud
platform by any stretch but but the
connectors themselves need to be
configurable they need to be
configurable so that you can be flexible
in terms of how you define and connect
to these different kinds of back-end
data sources next thing we'll look at
the next feature will look at is push
notifications so with push notifications
now we're talking about mass messaging
mass marketing if you will 12 that all
the users of your application we want
your platform to provide you with useful
notification AP is that really gloss
over or abstract away the details of
dealing with all the different different
protocols that exist Apple has their own
apns google has GCM windows has their
own protocol you don't want your
are you don't want your application
developer to worry about the details of
each of these when he's writing his
client when he's writing his client app
or even your server side developer when
he's writing his app you don't want him
to have to worry about the details of
talking to each individual service
that's out there your platform should
provide a generic API for you that
allows you to do it and it will take
care of the nitty-gritty details
underneath the covers when you're
sending out these notifications your
platform in these ap is it should allow
for different ways of getting that
information out there different filters
you want to send you a notification out
to every single user of your application
basically some sort of notice to say hey
you know there's a new version out there
it's got some really cool features you
might want to check it out you might
also want to filter them out based on
role we looked at that HR application
earlier if you're a manager HR might
want to send a notice out to all
managers using this application to
remind them Hank your employ evaluations
are due next week you better get on it
another way is location you can make the
use of the contextual that the locality
information of your device its GPS the
stuff to send out notification to
particular users in a particular
location so if they're using your an
application from your big from your
favorite big-box store and that store is
having a flash sale you might want to
push notification to everyone in a
particular store and say hey now we've
got a clearance sale on socks and I'll
five you all go check that out so the
API that the platform provides should
allow you to do those types of things
and there's still problems with push
notifications I mean there's no there's
no standard for them like we saw before
Apple's got their own Google's got their
own there's no standards on how these
are done there's no quality of service
standards how do you deal with timeouts
deliver interruptions those types of
things that is the kind of stuff you
want out of your platform it should
handle those types of issues it should
handle the retries to the servers just
to make sure that those messages get
through when you want them to get
through it shouldn't be up to your app
developer
worried about next big thing is
analytics so you want to find you know
I'll find stuff out so you got your
application out there great you built it
is anyone using it how are they using it
now or could they possibly use it in
different ways or they using in ways
other than you expected them to well the
first thing you need to do before you
can start analyzing is you need data to
analyze so those are the metrics or the
events that you might have generated in
the system and there's different types
of events and your platform should
provide API is that allow you to
generate these different types you might
want to generate custom events from the
client-side device so this is one of
those occasions where you know what your
app developer actually does want to
store information about certain things
that happen now if someone hit the big
red button on page five of the
application they might want to trigger a
an event so that gets registered in the
platform so that data can be analyzed
after custom code we'll talk about this
a little bit more later but this is
essentially the business logic that your
server side developer would be writing
in the platform itself he can also
generate custom events that are specific
to your application to your to your
business area and through all that the
platform itself is going to constantly
be generating events as well when our
API is called what time was the API call
when did the requests come in any
outages that might happen every time one
of those things happen the platforms
gathering all sorts of data that you can
use later on to analyze the important
thing about these events two is you're
not just triggering that something
happened you're collecting a whole bunch
of contextual information at the same
time you're capturing where where was
that event trigger where's the device
where is the person who triggered it
you'll capture that type of stuff what
time did it happen if you have profile
information you might capture are they
male female age that type of information
Mike alluded to at the beginning about
all the different devices that exist out
there you know you got your smartphones
tablets SmartWatch
is as more and more devices come out
you're also going to want to capture
more and more contextual information
along with some of these events in the
case of a Fitbit or your favorite health
device you might be able to capture the
heart rate so trigger an event you know
every every time they run a mile you
might want to trigger an event and
capture their heart rate at the same
time if you've got a Mon that are built
into it and you can use that information
later to perform analytics so now that
you've got the data you want to analyze
it and there's two two broad categories
of analytics they're sort of the
application business level analytics
you're looking at even for is the usage
of my application mainly in North
America versus Europe is it the male
population that's using this app more
than the female population are the using
Android are they using an apple those
types of things and you've also got your
system level analytics that is more for
your system administrator you might want
to look at the throughput you can see
how many how many calls how many
requests are coming into the system per
minute how many outages there were all
those types of things there's a couple
of slides hopefully clear enough just a
couple of examples of couple of reports
you might get so this is showing how
many active users there are by region so
it's using the locality the contextual
information of the device to say you
know where are the users who are using
my application well in this case you can
see it's a strongly way towards the
towards the US that's where the the bulk
of your customer customer base resides
and some in Europe as well and say that
one so that this sore here is kind of an
example of not so much system level but
these are the types of analytics that
you're probably to be getting for free
so your platform is registering every
request that comes in the users etc and
that contextual information and you
should be able to get this type of
information for every single application
that you write but you can also write
your own custom events like we talked
about before and this is in a bit of an
example here there's this this fix it
fast application that we we often talk
about it has to do with you've got
problems with your appliances and you
call it a technician this fictional
application well
the writers of this application decided
to generate events about every time a
request order or every time a technician
is dispatched the customer logs and
entries saying you know I've got a
problem I need I need someone to come
out here's my service call it can
trigger events for that they can trigger
events when the order was accepted and
when it's been completed so this is
completely one hundred percent specific
to your business case which can write
very powerful events and then analytic
reports to look it over afterwards and
the business guys really love this stuff
because you know then I can find out who
is their market how are they using
things they you can see with API is now
if you look at your application is
broken up by API as you can see which
api's are being used versus which ones
aren't if you see a whole slew of API is
not being used it might be an indication
that your app isn't written very well
users might not be able to navigate
easily to that page and that's why
they're not hitting it or there might
just not be interested in that part of
your application but at least this way
you know and you can start to make
decisions based on concrete information
user management Mike
so this kind of falls on a security
category user management just as a term
that we use to define the ability to to
manage users and what users can do from
within the system and you can typically
do this in one of two ways the first is
declarative declarative just means that
you define when you find the API what
what kinds of users can access that API
and that's normally done through the
definition of roles this kind of falls
on from Java EE based security where you
define roles and then you define which
roles required for a given API and then
once you've defined that then the user
that calls or invokes that API must have
that role assigned to them however how
many applications and customers do you
know that are just happy with the
features they have very few they all
want to do things themselves be able to
customize stuff and so that's where you
need typically some programmatic way of
saying can this user access this or not
and it might be defined or decided based
on some parameterize ation of some kind
or whatever it is that that is
domain-specific that the user or
customer wants to define so the the
programmatic way is just that the custom
code as it gets invoked has some epi
that it voakes to determine what this
user is which roles it has what it's
what it's authorized to do and then it
can programmatically decide whether to
allow that that invoker on through into
the system and carry on or to throw it
back out again earlier on it was
discussed this separation between the
two different types of applications
there was the business to consumer or
b2c in which you had all these untrusted
clients all using your application and
when you when you think about that how
does an untrusted client use the app and
access server side logic what user are
they using so there has to be some
notion of self registration or some way
to say i'm a new user let me in i'm
somebody and then that somebody gets
remembered some somewhere but there's
not really any more information than
it's just to somebody and we call that
essentially anonymous access you're a
somebody you're allowed in but you
probably can't do very much and this
anonymous access support needs to be
explicitly supported in the mobile cloud
platform on the server okay a couple of
things that appeared in the middle of
the cloud just now and the first is
object storage the second was database
storage so they needs to be some kind of
support it stored for these applications
to be able to store their data for
whatever reason normally they're going
to be reading their data in from the
enterprise out through some from in from
some connector but you may or may not be
writing out to that through that
connector you might just be writing to
some database that's accessible to the
cloud and that database might be in one
of those two forms either an object
storage system or a relational database
system the object storage service we see
these all over this is nothing different
from what you see around us most clouds
have some sort of object storage service
their unstructured they're typically
just blobs of data and quite often key
value stores and there are lots of them
that are slightly different out there
but mostly very much the same they allow
sometimes namespacing to separate where
things are being stored through some
hierarchical space you can definitely
add attributes to this to the data and
and normally the most common type of
data is being stored is a blob of JSON
and so if you have a really good storage
service then you provide additional
features to query on the JSON or do
lookups based on that you have JSON
objects that are read write specific to
just JSON and then it's kind of helps
you it provides a little more
convenience using the storage service
and finally the other thing about
storage service is that they they are
easier to use if they have some kind of
collection of things or container based
API and that allows you to categorize
the pieces of data that you're storing
and to find them a little more easy than
then if you didn't have some sort of
container
it it provides some sort of basic
querying if you will that you don't
normally have with structured stores and
you can do that a number of different
ways if you don't have containers but we
we find that most of them have some
level of collection or container that
you put these things in the relational
store well it's not really much
different from any other racial store
it's just accessible from the mobile
cloud service it might be some other
cloud service as a database cloud
service or it might be something local
to within the cloud service itself and
hosted at Oracle we chose to actually
supply both where you can define some
data internally within the mobile cloud
service or you can access some remote
mobile cloud service which is a database
service but it regardless you as a
tenant you need to be able to control
that database and have some management
capabilities and that allows you to
create schemas or perhaps modify the
tables but keep that restricted to the
code itself as opposed to coming in from
client devices one thing you don't want
to have happen is a client device coming
in and you know deleting a table or
changing the table structure on you or
the schema or something of that nature
so so you kind of lock it down to being
local to the server normally and that
provides the security that most you'll
really want out of a database all right
so custom code is the next one that
shows up somewhere inside the cloud here
now they're just right down the bottom
lock bottom right custom code is where
you get to add your own personality I
guess to it to the platform we've been
talking a lot so far about the things
that the platform provides for you out
of the box so using the API management
layer when you go into it you'll see a
list of API is that provide you know the
analytics API is the event generation
object storage all that type of stuff
custom code is where you get to create
your own API s and add to that asset
catalog this is where you get a chance
to build reusable chunks of business
logic register them and
have them available for use by your
application developers in whatever
application that they write so I mean
really it's just it becomes just another
service it's able to access any other
service in the system typically the
reason for that is the business logic is
also where you're going to start
aggregating information from all these
services we looked at earlier at the the
connectors the backend systems you know
maybe talk to the SI p Talia whatever
else these are complicated systems
returning a lot of different data you
don't want to send all that to your
client device it's an awful lot of data
using up a lot of bandwidth and it's
just way too complicated than you want
your app developer to have to worry
about so here's where you write your
custom code you insert that business
logic and you use it to call out to
those back-end systems it'll collect
data from multiple systems aggregate the
data shape it transform it in a way
that's suitable for consumption by your
application device you also want to
support multiple languages or
potentially support multiple languages
in your platform javascript seems to be
the predominant language of choice right
now for for mobile development nothing
saying you can't use Java have that in
your platform Ruby anything else you're
almost getting a mini pass at that point
you have this this mini code repository
or code code engine to depend on what's
supported you write your code you upload
the system and then you have access to
it where you want to be careful with
custom code is so up until now we've
been talked about what the platform does
what the platform provides you as the
platform provider sort of trust yourself
especially when you're talking about a
cloud hosted service you trust yourself
to write safe code but as soon as you
allow your client to write custom code
and inject that into your system you
need to start worrying about it so you
really want to be able to sandbox that
code and make sure they're not going to
do anything malicious to your system
it's one thing if you know you're
dealing about with on-premise and he'll
you got to
for writing bad or malicious code he's
going to take down your own company he's
going to be in a whole lot of trouble
but at least he's you know he's only
impacting where he works when talking
about a cloud system when you allow them
to write custom code injected into your
system you've got multiple tenants all
using the same cloud service you want to
make darn sure that they're not going to
be able to bring down your system do
anything malicious to access other
customer data or anything of the sorts
so yeah so you just make sure they they
don't have any kind of access to the
underlying infrastructure or execution
environment or anything like that
geolocation we talked about context that
the various devices help provide
geolocation is probably the one of the
most common ones that I think the one
that everyone's is most familiar with
now I think every every smartphone has a
GPS in it you're going to want your
platform to provide you AP is to help
find out well where is that device know
the device that's currently invoking
stuff where is it right now where is it
in relation to other devices or other
locations other points of interest that
you might have related to your
application like we talked about earlier
we lost send a push notification to
everyone that's in your big box store
you need to know where that device is in
relationship to that stores location if
they're nowhere near that store there's
no point in sending them a push
notifications that's where you make use
of it here and things like geolocation
locality really starts to provide a
value add to just about any domain I
mean we see it all the time and we take
it for granted if you do a search on
your phone you say you know find me a
Chinese restaurant you you take for
granted that it's going to use your
location to find your Chinese
restaurants in your area or you say you
know what I need to go and get some home
renovation supplies you know what till
what time is the home depot open you
expect it to always return the closest
home depot to you you don't care about
the home depot that's 500 miles away
from you across the country we just
expect that it should know and that's
where the locality comes into play the
geolocation
and you can as you start mixing in
geolocation with other contextual
information it can become more and more
powerful start using temporalities you
know you'll look at the current time
when you say now find me find me all the
Italian restaurants not only what can it
start giving you the local ones you'll
only tell you which ones are currently
open and as more and more devices are
cradle you know we talk about the fit
the fitbit's and the stuff earlier
they're each going to add their own type
of contextual ax t and if you're writing
an application a mobile application
that's built for those types of devices
you're going to want to make use of that
specialized contextual ax t and build
that into your app so make your queries
the data that you return smarter based
on the information that the device
itself is giving you peace our last bit
okay PS R stands for performance
scalability and reliability these are
things that you just expect out of a
cloud service you're not typically going
to expect your cloud service to go down
and you also hope that as your mobile
device scales out and you have more and
more customers or employees or whatevers
that your service is also going to be
scalable and support that increased
demand so that's obviously just going to
be a basic must have the thing that the
thing that just showed up there now is
the integration with the development
tools when you do custom code
development then you're all used to
using certain development tools we
generally use git or Hudson these kinds
of kind of state-of-the-art modern-day
tools that we want to use when we do to
Cod development as well and so you have
to integrate with these tools so that
you have the same sorts of life cycle
that you are used to it can't be hard to
do development in the cloud it must be
sort of the same in the end or easier if
possible and finally it needs to be
rock-solid secure we we don't we don't
want data leaking out we don't want it
to store it in some cases if if it
shouldn't be if its proprietary or
confidential it has to pass through the
system and not yet leave any footprint
not get stored anywhere accidentally the
data can't be accessible when it
shouldn't be all these kinds of things
it all sort of goes around this mobile
platform a self-supporting secure
protocols and being able to provide the
support for client custom code to be
able to control who accesses what when
and all of these bits of security come
together in in the forms of security
protocols Oh auth I don't know how many
people here use OAuth or heard of Oh
auth to more than half of you that's
that's good and they know off tues
become very very popular now and as you
as most of you know no it's some being
used in many many places and this is I
think I must have as well when it comes
to the client devices being able to get
authorized or authenticate it by the
server talked about ssl a little bit
essentially you want your day to be
protected going between the device and
the mobile cloud platform but you also
when it comes time to pushing that data
or pulling that data from the connector
into your back-end then you want that
also to be protectable and so you want
to support ssl allow those paths and be
able to support certificates and things
to be uploaded into mobile cloud service
so all this management of certificates
and keys and token propagation if you
have identity of a user you want to
propagate that identity all the way
through to the back end from the mobile
device you don't want to have some other
identity you know you may have that
specific user necessary as it gets
through to the connector so identity
propagation also needs to be supported
these are all deserve aspects of a
secure system and they all need to be
there and I believe that most of the end
prize embas support support this kind of
thing so we just wanted to I think we've
got a little bit of time left for a demo
I was a talk about 10 minutes so we've
talked about in general general purposes
in EM bass but we since we've been
working on one we thought well if we're
going to show them one may as well show
them the one we built so we do have that
one let me see if I can find it so this
is this is the one that we have called
the Oracle cloud service that is a
mobile cloud service and log into a
domain
can't actually see what I'm typing here
so I should probably careful
so I'll just log into this mobile cloud
service this is a kind of a development
instance that we use so that's my out in
case anything goes wrong this just kind
of welcomes you out and then the thing
that we defined that represents that the
stuff that sits on the server side is
what we call a mobile backend since
these are all mobile backends as a
service it makes sense that we call them
a mobile backend so we go into mobile
backends i'll create a new one thanks
and i'll call it geo MBE
so this is a mobile backend I don't know
how visible it is kind of let me push
this out a little bit again you can see
that there's authentication keys the
authentication keys here provide
depending on which authentication
mechanism you want to use you might use
OAuth from some devices some devices may
not may not you may not want to use
OAuth in which case you use just basic
authentication but the the device then
puts the client ID in the client secret
I'll show you the client secret if you
promise not to tell anyone there that's
the client secret for this mobile
backend so now you can all access my
mobile backend it doesn't do anything
because I just created it of course but
you can do it so these are the things
that the mobile application developer
would include in the mobile app when
they go and get an OAuth token next
thing I want to do is I want to create
some sort of connector so not my
computer and I'm not used to the little
there we go actually its breath it's
Jason's brand-new computer too so so I'm
going to create a new connector so a new
rest connector and my rest connector is
going to be going to be called gio con
and it's going to talk to
ww geonames calm that's kind of a zero
service it provides a web service let's
create that oops
okay so that's my connector I need some
rules let me push this but back in what
do the rules give me well to access his
web service I've defined a user so
anytime I want to call this connector
this back-end I want to pass that user
in automatically I don't have to be
passing it in from the API I want it to
be automatically passed in so the thing
i'm going to do is pass in that it has
to be passed in as user name and the
other thing this thing takes is a
country code because the you are the API
that we're going to be using it for
expects the country and we're from
Canada so I'm going to use Canada as the
country and I'm going to save this
securities gives us a chance to choose
what security policy if there's any
propagation needs to happen across to
the connector we're not going to do
anything in this case and here's a cool
thing now I want to test it I want to
test this connector right from my
browser so I need test credentials the
Geo MBE I have to run it inside the
context of an MBE
they're so now I've got some information
there what I can do as well is I can
specify a specific URL in here so here
caps lock is off
hmm let me see what what that was cold
it's called postal code lookup Jason and
I'm going to test this API with passing
in postal code my own postal code
we'll see if it worked whoops 404 I I've
messed up the URL here a little bit
postal code lookup JSON
I see that I actually made a mistake
here when i typed in the name of the URL
it's actually instead of wwtp I
you save that about to test so i just
made a change the connector so the base
URL
and now you can go back to this again
what was it again look up
then I paul i miss Danay in there that's
the problem when I wear glasses when I
have to look close any other type ones
before I try this out that looks good to
me I think it should work do you think
that you work you see something I can't
hear well let's try it and I'll see what
what fails
osed no that's all right
I've done something else wrong here
postal code lookup API geonames supposed
to code lookup JSON and username country
code so that'll looks good and once it's
problem
well I've made some sort of typos
somewhere but I don't know what it is
I've been bullying back and forth did I
type it wrong no all good ideas all good
ideas but none of them right yeah cheap
I can't get to the service right now the
problem is that it's oh did you go into
VPN okay that's why there's our answer
we actually have to because it was an
internal service you have to be on VPN I
don't think we are so so ends the demo
the next step would have been to define
an API which calls into this connector
and decouples it from the implementation
itself and then invoking the connector
and the nice thing about at least our
service is that we allow you to kind of
test this in line you can test your
connector and test your AP is we have
this thing called a mock service and
that mock service provides a way to
I'm all service provides a way to
actually test your API is and connectors
out of just in line and make sure that
you've done things right obviously is I
wasn't able to do that here but once we
get our connectivity back maybe the next
time round will show you again um anyway
hopefully you got the idea of what we're
what we're talking about is a mobile
backend as a service these are this is
sort of the next up-and-coming thing
from mobile it's it's the beginning of
how to use mobile within an enterprise
it's not it's not the Angry Birds user
typically it's going to be when
enterprise needs to deploy mobile
applications for all their people this
is what they're going to use and that's
that's all the time we have I guess
there's any questions i guess you can
come and see us afterwards thanks for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
