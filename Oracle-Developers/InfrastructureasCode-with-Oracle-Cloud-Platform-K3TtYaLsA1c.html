to this session my name is Mitch Donna I
work for achill and I work for
organization called
SCC sales consulting Center this
organization is you know a part of the
sales consulting ecosystems in Oracle
now what we do is we help the field and
customers throughout the cell cycles
from technology and self consulting
standpoint so we help you know
conducting POCs workshops explaining the
new features and etc etc so it's just a
you know whole spectrum of the lifecycle
from you know lead to implementation and
particularly in a team I asked him
infrastructure as a service and mainly
focusing on you know the OCIO see a
classic are clouded customers and all
the other couple of path services like
the VCS so with that introduction I will
just you know move it so what I am going
to talk today is that you know from
infrastructure as a quote standpoint
what oracle has been doing first of all
we will understand in a very brief what
infrastructure is code means right and
then I will just deep dive into you know
terraform the chef - tech manager PSM so
terraform is of obviously an external
tool but then we also have our native
tools in oracle right so we'll just sue
and if time permits I will see if I can
you know quickly show you a demo as well
so with that if we try to understand
what is infrastructure as code right so
I mean as the definition says is
primarily a process of provisioning
managing and and and destroying or
decommissioning or terminating
infrastructure but not interactively or
manually or which we used to do it in a
GUI portal right but through a machine
readable files right it's a
configurations file so that's the whole
idea
you know the key thing here is that you
know it's machine readable definitions
as opposed to interactive configuration
now now if we try to understand what
means is that you would codify whatever
the infrastructures you want to create
in cloud and and and and that would be a
declarative language and I will just
explain in a moment what that
declarative means but at the same time
what it means is that once you do it
what are the benefits of infrastructure
is code right and and there are some of
these so essentially basically once you
have done it right
it becomes extremely agile to basically
work with this infrastructure I mean you
can rapidly build up and and destroy I
mean it just takes you know a couple of
minutes to really build up a complex
infrastructure involving your compute
storage and Software Defined Networking
right so that's the agility then then
and and because it's now it's codified
it's not that if you look at it in
contrast of how it used to happen so
it's not that you know one person doing
and the second time second person doing
and some inconsistency will creep in
right so here rather than you are
getting a consistent because it's been
codified so and and and at the same time
it's repeatable right once you have
codified it you can use it again in
again so that's the repeatability we are
achieving extensibility what it means is
that I have to start with I put it some
infrastructure or codified I prepared my
configuration file now if I want to add
incrementally to it I don't have to
start from scratch
whatever there I have already done I
will addition into it and that's
extensibility and now think of this that
these all things we can do it at a scan
right I mean it's to to to spin up a
hundreds of VMs is now possible think of
that in a manual way or even a script
way and how to do it we know that we
have operations of the administration
team using automated scream but it's not
a purposeful for you know achieved the
things which we can achieve it
infrastructure discord specifically from
infrastructure so these are the benefits
said couple with these you know if we
look at from DevOps angle now once I
have codified into this text file what I
am
- hu now is there a conversion
controlling now if you think from
operation standpoint that idea of
version control wasn't there so far so
that's what we are able to and now it is
version controlled and it's the cord
code review can happen so I mean you
know said jr. or maybe a mid jr. I mean
which senior person has done it then no
others can even review it that okay
whatever he is building his as per our
requirement or is there any problem
right so that's an end with that now
that it has been codified and if you
apply the DevOps principles you can even
apply our automated testing as well if
wherever it is possible and and and the
other aspect of the DevOps like you know
releasing the managing that release and
and and once you codify it right it's a
self documented so far what used to
happen is that you know one
administrator has done or another
operations team has done either he has
to really put it into a document
documentation and somebody will read it
but here because what I am creating I am
creating compute okay I'm creating
complete with this shape with this
storage is it a block storage is it nvme
storage or I am putting a lot balancers
what kind of load balance is it ah see I
always say classic everything is now
becoming self documented so these are
the benefit and if you really tie these
up from the business standpoint agree
that these are all that IT benefits
developers are now know okay the other
thing is that you know now what will
happen is the developer are empowered
why because so I mean I mean as of now
the developer v-lite that depends on
somebody doing it right if they will
request it and somebody will spin it
they know they don't know which accounts
and how to do it right but now think
like this that if operation solve the
C's admin team will do it codify it put
it all the developer has to do it
consume it right I mean of course there
would be some governance required right
some approval will require all those
things can be put it in place but if
somebody has done it all form
development standpoint is that you have
to just consume it right so that makes
the life much easier for
so with that I will just jump into the
telephone so what is styrofoam right so
telephone essentially is you know comes
from Hershey Co it's it said a basically
you know right plant create
infrastructure as code it's a leading
open-source software they do have a
license the enterprise version as well
but it's I mean essentially it's an
open-source you can use it to really
practice infrastructure is code right
that's what it does best if we look at
you know what exactly it is it's tool
for building changing and versioning
your infrastructure right that's ssv
understood it and it's cloud agnostic
you know the beauty of this this sauce
or software is it's clouded let's take
across against nature it works against
Amazon it works against Oracle equally
so learning curves is almost negligible
if if somebody has used it in other
cloud provider it can easily be applied
in Oracle configuration files are used
as we keep talking right so I will be
qualifying in two text files of course I
have to learn that how to put that into
file but that's how exactly it's done
now once that is done what will happen
what this says is that you know
terraform generates an execution plan
now once I have put it into the
configuration file what I have to ask
his paraffin instead you know it will
tell me that okay based on what you have
put it into this file this is what I'm
going to do if you you know asked me to
put apply this correct so it describes
what it will do and the other thing is
this this is the important point to
understand desired state right this
particular tool what it says is you
don't help to make a procedure you don't
have to tell terraform that do this do
that do this do that right it's not
procedure it's declarative and what you
are telling is that I look I want you to
create five servers of these attributes
for me if you find so what is what what
what you are doing is that I need five
servers at the end of this if you are
already existing terraform will
intelligently put three more and come to
your desired State
that's what
it means so all you will be doing is
that today review rot telephone scripts
for file tomorrow you change it for 7:00
then it will create two more for you
because that's what you told that affirm
that okay this is my desired state you
don't have to tell figure it out if you
would be writing script you will be
figuring out what is existing then I am
putting this correct that's the idea of
that and and and and there is the
configuration changes telephone is able
to determine what changed in and you
know it creates as we understood right
that it's in incremental plan if you
look at from Oracle standpoint so this
is what we provide and this is what we
support if you see we have on the bottom
we support from terraform our
infrastructure necessaries that's you
know compute network storage clouded
customer now this is important to
understand clouded customary server
public cloud services which is
essentially our you know which runs
inside the customers firewall I don't
know how many of you would be knowing
that but that's also been serviced by
our terraform so within the cloud
customers telephone can be used to
provision you know modify it and and
decommission it so OCI I mean the
infrastructure but we don't stop there
we also support a path I mean recently
we had I did a support for terraform to
even a provision these database Java app
container and my sequel services right
and yeah so basically this is the
support we provide for terraform now
before I move further there are
practical things we if you tomorrow
start after this session want to
practice this right so a couple of
things I would I know bit this thing
because of the this resolution but what
it essentially I am saying is that if
you go to your cloud account right and
if you if you are hitting the compute
classic there would be a to three things
you have to notice one one would be here
or instance ID there would also be your
rest endpoint and there would be a ID CS
ID just keep not of that why I'm
mentioning is that when you are going to
you know use your telephone
configuration
in telephone configuration file the
first things you will be telling is that
you know your credential right you want
to provision against some cloud account
right so you will be providing a
credential and that credential will be
essentially you know user password and
your identity domain now what I'm
showing here is that and this is a
classic you see the screenshot I'm
showing is that you know if you are
writing a telephone scripts for running
a pins the infrastructure OCA classic
then this is the you know providers
configuration and here Oracle has a two
type of account a traditional account
and some some of you might be having
what is called as an IDC account right
is his account is nothing but it uses
our IDC s service for you know
authentication and authorization okay so
if based on that account you might want
to write you know identity domain name
or service instance ID for OC a classic
that's what this slide is you know are
showing the next is the same thing for
the pass now if you are using credential
for pass then what you need to keep it
in mind is that again for IDC s you to
use identity service ID and for identity
domain name for the traditional account
now here your endpoint would be our
Duvall's endpoint and and when you go
into the DB CS like we have a compute
endpoint rest endpoint you will have a
DB CS endpoint that's what you will be
using so and and and finally OC i
classic support for terraform comes in
built-in telephone so once you download
the terraform you don't have to do
anything else you don't have to download
anything else you provider equal to OPC
and you are not running your
configuration against the Oracle public
cloud classic I mean don't see a classic
right but if you are doing the I mean OC
I then you know or CI is still not out
of the know terraform executable what it
means is that you will
download orc tariffs on binary and then
you from the github we provide a plugin
for OC I you download it and use it so
it's two-step right third thing is that
you know we also provide the terraform
plug-in from you know if anybody are
familiar with you know you linux and the
packaging of the software in RPM package
right so we have this Oracle Linux
Channel right so you can connect here
and and just download it it's yum
install basically so that is also
possible if you don't want to go to
github okay so after you know getting a
familiar with terraform now this is the
you know essential of telephone what it
means is that you download anything you
write for terraform you will give it an
extension of dot TF okay so you have one
directory this is where you will start
you want to qualify your infrastructure
suppose you want to know prepare a
compute instance so compute instance
would have you know what is my viniq
what are the storage is i want to attach
with this ssh key right I mean cloud we
use the SSH key for authentication
so all these things you want to put it
into the configuration file you will
prepare a txt well you will put it into
the you know dot TF file extension this
is the learning curve you will go you
would have to do a little bit learning
with how to write that even though it's
not that much fancy you can quickly
catch it up it's a declarative language
as I say it right so when you will read
a sample you could easily will try to
understand that how I can use it for my
environment right so what I am trying to
say here is that you put it into your TF
file our terraform follows some
convention so you know typically you
will find that main dot TF is the file
where most of your configurations are
encoded provided the TF is where you
will put your credential of cloud
account right and then there is a
variable stored TF where you will define
all the variables you are going to use
into your main go TF
and those variables value you can either
default or you can provide at the time
of execution or you could provide the
value of those variable as an
environment variable right so those are
the couple of ways so variable main
dirty of variables 30f DF was dot EF and
basically a priority these are the
traditional name but it's not hard-coded
what is thing is it to know is that if
you put anything in the directory where
you are going to rent error from
execution anything with dot TF telephone
will use it that's that's what is the
meaning now once you do that and and and
you know if let me just move to the next
slide where it will become more clear so
here is you know I mean what it shows is
that you know typically it's the
language which is used is called at CL
language haricot configuration language
but when you use it in a you know an
automated fashion the Jason's of what is
also there but typically what you will
write it a configuration file is it's
your language and I mean it's just a you
know key word some some identifying name
you use those bracket and and it's an a
key value pair I mean whenever you will
study this is the pattern you will see
so this is as I was saying correct that
you know first thing to do is your you
know you will be coding your provider
information right so depending on you
are connecting to us see a classic or
OCI you will use a different our
basically these variables name right so
in case of OC I tan and CID users for
that basically a tenancies fingerprint
and private key path now these are not
the Newton if you have already used or
OCI
these are I mean I don't know I mean if
you attend any of our CI session you
will come to know that OC i which is of
a bare-metal service requires this kind
of an authentication so you would have
your various IDs to authenticate you to
your cloud account that's what you are
giving here so this you will get if you
have subscribed to them
account then this would be with you and
that's what you are giving here right so
that's exactly what this is all about so
these are the various these things in
the provider then this is just an
example of the resource when you want to
put instance and and and in which
availability domain right which region
are the host name label and and image
right which compute shape you want to
use this is what you are putting it here
hmm now if you are really getting
started not to very much we already
provide a lot of samples you can just
bootstrap very easily with too simple so
it's not that you will start from
scratch right but you start from that
and then you you know quickly learn or
maybe modify it for your environment
requirement that's the idea so broadly
what is happening is that you know if
you are really starting from you know
experimenting correct you put the
terraform executables you have
downloaded the require terraform
executables or plugin then this is how
you will start so the first things you
would have in directory where you are
invoking tariff room right you will say
tariff a minute now this is a another
one time job you don't need to repeat in
general you can but it's not must why I
showed this differentiation is because
this is what you will run it again in
again you know you may plan you may
apply you man destroy correct if you
think like that you are creating
infrastructure you you basically you
know plan apply ami apply is really
creating it and if you don't need you
destroyed right and and once you
destroyed you may again want to plan it
and you know apply and destroy right
that's why this is a repeatable stuff
but in it is what you are doing
essentially here is that you are
initializing your telephone
configuration for that particular your
home directory now what it will do is
that you know once you say it will some
some basic plug-in which is required
will also be downloaded
telephone websites and these are the two
directories I have given here where do
your plug-in goes in Windows and Linux I
mean in and the path here given is that
no there is a important directly to
known is got terraform dot d and inside
that there would be plugin and in
Windows it goes basically you know you
you go to your app data directory or
your users app data directly right so in
my case a user's youth and I have
roaming something something like that F
data those directory comes so that's
where it by default goes so don't worry
you will get these powerpoints so later
on you can download it even if it's not
visible right now but point I am trying
to drive here is that no this is what
happens during the image and this is a
bit important to know so that you don't
get lost when you are really trying this
out now once you do it it's just this
cycle now so as we were talking correct
that you know I have already installed
it I've initialized it I put some
configuration into my text file and I
now want to really see that have I made
any mistake right let me see what will
happen if I really now apply but before
I apply I mean any of the DBA will know
that we do execution plan how did it
will basically run it this is nothing
but that right so what will happen here
is that telephone will go into your
directory it will pass all the
configuration file and will give you a
nice output they took a look this is
what you are going to ask me I am going
to create this for you I'm going to
change this resource for you and I'm
going to destroy this resource for you
right if you are ok then in next step
what you will be doing is you are ready
to apply so apply will really take those
configuration and apply against the
cloud account whose credential you have
put it into your provider I mean once
you know you it's very easy but you
should be knowing that you are really
doing that change against that account
right so that's what will happen so you
know it quickly goes in and and creates
your infrastructure I mean if I if I get
time and we will do it we will know that
it's very very fast
now think like this that if you would be
doing in a console or if you will be
doing it to some other manual process it
will take a lot of time and think how
you will let you the scale you need it
right so that's the beauty of such
infrastructure as code tool and once you
do it and and it suppose for XYZ reasons
we come to the end of the life cycle of
that infrastructure or I am just doing
it in an test dev environment
I want to terminate it I just achieved
what one day what I wanted to achieve
then you just said Terra firme destroyed
whatever the configurations were there
in that file those resources will be
destroyed right so what you are assuming
is that you I now have an ability to
rapidly create do whatever you wanted to
do against that infrastructure whether
it is some testing whether it is some
whatever you are building you are done
with that you destroyed you have no I
mean think like this your your your
cloud consumptions you are decreasing
correct so your cost is decreased so
that's essentially you know that life
cycle of terraform now other good thing
telephone does is that if you are really
creating some complex infrastructure
once you do it you can prepare this kind
of graph which shows the dependencies of
resource right so my compute depends on
that computer chip or the storage right
it also depends you know SS key SSH key
is used so that master detail
relationship it will nicely show in the
club okay so now this is of fundamentals
of use of para form and what they are
for me is what is required to do you
know use that against OSI a Class C
against OSI i right this is good stuff
but we go step further what happens is
that you know I don't anybody knowing or
knowing docker containers communities
okay some hands are raised right hard
cuz now gives if you want to stand up
communities you know it's not at the end
of the day easy job it's a good tool but
if you want to stand up on your own its
mess
right so what we are riding now is that
we provide you a kubernetes installer
for telephone what it means is that a
complex piece of code of telephone
configuration script is readily
available if you are using it against
our OC I that's Oracle cloud
infrastructure which is a bare metal
right what you are going to achieve is
that you know very production-ready let
me repeat production-ready
it's not that you can use it on the
template I mean just a couple of days I
have used this know basically piece of
code it's extremely fancy so what it
means is that if I am building a highly
available Terra for kubernetes setup
with you know multiple master for higher
ability multiple workers for higher
ability right and at CD node on top of
that my load balancers right not only
that what will happen is that when you
are exposing in kubernetes environment
your applications which is not balanced
right when you said type equal to log
balancer it requires to dynamically
create a lot balancer meaning when you
deploy your application you are telling
that I want to use a lot balancer for
this it would require a dynamically
create a lot balancer resource in your
cloud account that integration is also
provided here so through our communities
as something called its Cloud Control
Manager so we are integrating with the
cloud control manager to provide that
functionality second thing you will know
the Dockers require persistence right
storage so that storage will be using
the OC ice block volume again we
integrate it with kubernetes something
known as flex volume driver right this
is extremely rich ok so what I'm trying
to say is that all these things if you
go to this URL download it if you have
our CI classic as I explained the
terraform if you run it I think five to
ten minutes it will all take you to
stand up your kubernetes
osya again when you are running this we
provide the customization what does it
mean you decide that how many this code
you want
how many marker code you need you just
say right as I was explaining right it's
a telephone configurations it's your
choice
so this is highly customizable you just
define in open one file edit it it's
already written
you have to just modify it you want to
use a bare metal shape use it you want
to use a VM shape use it you want to use
a dense I offer or C I use it right so
this is very very flexible you want to
you you want to have you know a private
load balancer or public load balancer
you want to open this whole
infrastructure to Internet is in your
control so that's is extremely flexible
ok so now I think we are I will just
jump on to the explain you the chef
support in Oracle so chef as we know is
a configuration management - right it's
another aspect of infrastructure as code
if you look at infrastructure as chord
you can divide it into two aspect one is
your provisioning and you know managing
and destroying resources on the other
side once it is provisioned you want to
configure your application so that's the
configuration but what we are supporting
here is provisioning right because we
thought that you know many people who
are already what what if I can say so
that you know they are chef shop then
they need this functionality right so we
thought that we will provide this so
what we have the I mean in chef I mean
very briefly that you would have your
you know a chef DK which is the
development kit you will use it from
your workstation you connect to SEP
servers your recipes and everything will
be here so you interact with chef server
through your chef decay and you manage
your environment right it's essentially
at that kind of environment
so what we do here is that again we
provide this support of chef to
provision against two of our flavor of
cloud you see a classic cannot see I am
bare metal basically right so I just
gave a reference that you know a1 is
again out of box right if you download
the chef and
and use it Cosi a classic is fine OCI
again you will require to download the
plugin but I have already given where it
is available so what I am showing here
is that what all you can do with you
know the chef OCI plugin right so
basically you can launch an instance and
and and some of the things you can
delete the instance you can list various
visions and other Sdn aspects if you
want to install it you will just use
your shape decay and use just a shap gem
install knife or CI so it will just go
to the appropriate URL and will download
and install so what will happen is that
of course you want to use this against
the cloud account so you will again
configure all those OC IDs so there are
two way I think there are default
directories in your home directories of
it will create a dot or CI directory and
put your configuration there if not in
your chef DK you go in a knife dot RB
it's a ruby script extension so if you
configure your wherever suppose you
write a one text file where you give
credential and this files path you give
in to you know knife dot Ruby
a knife no Darby and and any optional
you want to create against some
compartment so this is the essential
aspect of configuration in the a knife
plugin once you achieve that right you
are almost ready to run the knife
command or knife OCA command rather to
work with you will see a cloud account
for provisioning aspect right
I hope drawn blog around it if I have
given the URL for you know explaining in
detail if you want to know go ahead
later on and so I mean how you again do
for the classic how you do a
configuration I mean it's it's very
imperative because in classic all you
three things user password and your
identity domain is all required so you
can even use this kind of syntax and and
and essentially after that Oracle cloud
is the key word in the knife command and
you are connecting against the classic
and use
provisioning so these are again you know
the classic I just listed out some
commands if you want to try out you know
based on this PDF and PowerPoint
whenever it's available so this this is
just a quick reference the next item in
the support we provide from the
infrastructure is infrastructure a score
is you know see a classic right so think
like this that you are working with a
Java cloud service so Java cloud service
requires a DB and that DV is inside
database cloud service database cloud
service you want to take backup so then
you will use our object storage and
there would be a container where your
database will be backed up right so we
are now having you know a stack of
services which are interdependent right
now what you can do in state manager is
that you can basically a provision as
multiple service as a single unit using
spec management so what it means
essentially is that you are again
writing a declarative Ammal file right
again it's very easy to pick up not
complicated languages such what you will
be doing is that you will be preparing
one file and in which I mean it's a
template file as where you will put all
these attributes of your services into
this and that set of services will
function as a unit so you know in a one
shot you are just spinning up all those
things in basically that's what the idea
of you know combining this is a one unit
now for spec Manager we give a three
interface one is if if for XYZ reason
you want to do this in cloud console you
can do it CLI you can do it and I will
come to you in a second or if you want
to directly use our rest call from using
say command like call you can do it so
essentially what I am trying to say is
that once you have a template file there
are three ways you can interact with
your cloud account to consume those
templates right
so I mean what essentially you will be
doing is that you know you will be
coding into that template you know
whatever the services are attributes of
that services is I know dependencies of
that services correct once you do it you
will be you know taking that or
importing it into your cloud account and
then once it reaches into the cloud
account you will run another command to
really create the infrastructure out of
that stack template right it's
essentially that so you are importing
into your repository and you know
creating a spec so this is just one
examples but what we know is that you
know this is what where you will put
your JCS DVCS or object can't object
storage containers details but again
don't think that you know I mean you are
learning from scratch you will readily
get this template if you go into your
cloud a couple of templates are readily
available you can always modify it to
suit your name so that hat start is
already given to you right so this is
what then which is the location where
you will get it if you go to your for
example I have taken here the I think
the example of JCS but when you go into
your say console of Oracle Java cloud
service or any other path service and if
you click this this this this one right
then you will see here crowd spec
manager that's what we are talking so
when you will click that then you will
get the cloud stack manager GUI and here
if you go into that template you will
have a readily available template so I
just listed out some of this so in case
if any of you have access and you want
to try it out go home or go to your
office tomorrow and then you will see
you will have a radial templates
available you can download it study it
modify it for your need and running
right so that's and then again is so
when I was talking of CLI this is what I
was talking PSM and I will just quickly
tell you what PSM is in in couple of
slides so this is just the color
examples now the next support is the PSM
CLI
now PSM CLI is our CLI solution for
working against our past services right
so you don't want to go to console you
want to do no path related work for DBC
SS years you want to create you want to
do a complete lifecycle of management of
that dbca so Jessie s services you can
use the PCM PSM to appear SEM CLI so PSN
CLI is essentially you know Python base
realize that the installation is rather
straightforward after you take care of
you know Python requirement that's the
only tricky thing I could say if I can
you know highlight watch out for that
Python deployment and most of the other
thing is you know you just follow some
simple simple instructions and your your
watch station would have a PS M ready I
think it supports in con Linux and
Windows boats so once you have that you
know these are the kind of supports we
provide I mean in the series of our past
services DB Java analytics all the
services so all what I'm trying to say
is that all these things you can work
forth using this PSM CLI so PSM CLI
again is you know all you are giving is
because you are using what's a classic
it's your user password identity domain
and whether you are in EMEA region or
North America region or epoch right so
that's all you are just know providing
here once you do that and and then you
will say okay whether the output which
will be generated by PSM I need it in
which notation as short notation no
longer JSON or like this so that choice
you'd run and then your PSN setup is
done so I have listed here I again I
know little bit of these things but when
you will have slides with you for your
reference I have given you can always go
to manual it's really exhausting manuals
there but if you want to quickly
understand and if you go through the
slides you will understand that it
supports the complete lifecycle of your
path services so this is just a
reference of PSM p sm d bcs okay
anybody in the audience who have used
our developer cloud service
okay so developer cloud service
essentially you know it supports the
complete development tasks
right starting from your codeine you
know version-control
to deployment basically you can use it
in your DevOps implementation so what
I'm going to show here is that you know
whatever we just learn right if somebody
is using a developer cloud service what
you can do is that in a developer cloud
service they can write a build job and
using that build job they can hook it up
with how they can provision the required
services
I'm sorry required infrastructure that
can provision into that cloud account
right so this is the Donora basically a
richness you can achieve using and
combining these various internal native
tools we provide right and similarly so
what here you can do is that right in
build job you invoke your PSM CLI that
is out-of-the-box from the developer
cloud service and then PSM CLI supports
you to create the infrastructure of Java
cloud DB CS that's what you are doing
here second thing if if you if you want
to in your build job not use PSM but
pierce him CLI also can allow you to do
execution of the Linux command here what
you can do it you can call a remote
execution and you can do anything in
your this VM you can put any software
and from this workflow you can call it
so for example you can put tera from
here so what you have now achieved is
that from your developer cloud service
using telephone you can create your
infrastructure so that's the you know
richness of the native tools real
provided so this is just you know I just
explained that you know how that
developer cloud service can be you know
used to make execute shell command call
and finally the CLI I mean I know that
you know when we talk of infrastructure
scored on top of that basically the top
of the table is a terraform because it's
a you know or software what should I say
it's it's it's directed or it's targeted
to achieve that functionality so yes it
is a high level tool you can use it but
for XYZ reason if you don't want to use
that then CLI also provides you a rich
functionality you can download our CLI
and in CLI we do provide a support spur
you know majority having compute storage
software-defined networking and you know
CI we also have a D BCS supports and
load balancer support all these things
you can manage through a rich CLI as
well so again OPC CL the executable for
not again running the CLI against
classic is or PC you download again the
download is very straightforward you put
your credential into one file and point
that file using these two environment
variable you are ready to roll you have
to use the CLI against your classic
account and in same way for running the
CLI against OC i I have given a couple
of URL we're very good know getting
started guides are there the
configuration for CLI for OC is a bit
tricky I won't say it's it's complicated
but I just want to make you aware that
just pay a little bit of attention it
has a you know a little bit flexibility
that you can run some commands and you
can set up automatically or you want to
do manual because it requires Python so
if once you take care of those things
then again and it's it's not that
complicated ezreal you can easily put it
into your workstation and start running
it and the configuration is again very
similar you will provide your resource
ID compute compartment users or cid your
fingerprints and private keys so once
you do that you are all set you connect
it and you use the rich set of URL
finally I have given one table when you
will learn download this you can always
reach out very quick
Clee - what all we talk right starting
from you know rest api - orchestration
do you know CLI past service managers
tech manager i afraid i will not have a
time for demo but what I will suggest is
that again finally I have given a ready
set of we know our github 2d table you
are elsewhere all the samples are
available just try it out it's very very
intuitive so I think with that I will be
running out of time the next speaker is
already here so I conclude with this off
this would be useful to all of you thank
you but if anybody has any questions I
mean you can just meet me at the booth
also the infrastructure is code booth as
well or maybe outside the room we can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
