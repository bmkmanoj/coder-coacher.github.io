the various session of the conference I
know you guys must be tired and now I am
so we're going to talk about text and we
mainly going to talk about what change
behind the scenes in text the new API
text flow and you're going to talk about
internalization or support for by the in
inscribe Unicode so my name is Philippi
i am i work in graphics I'm a graphic
engineer in the java fax team we work
here out in Santa Clara California at
least majority of the team so I'm going
to start off talk about text flow which
is a new public API then I'm going to
talk about things that are not API is
really how we take care of text how take
care of business behind the scenes and
what changed in that sense and why now
the David talk about know the
orientation that's about left-to-right
or low cost versus right left to right
versus right-to-left and Unicode support
at some point will bring the two themes
together I'm going to talk about why am
I talking about text and orientation on
the same talk hopefully that will clear
to you at the end of this talk and if
you need to interrupt me or either to
make me go slower or just to throw a
question feel free to just raise your
hand and I'll get that the disclaimer
the usual stuff so text flow so that's a
new API is a subclass of parent and
that's our answer how to get rich text
so if you were html5 developer you'd
probably get a div and a bunch of spans
throw those together and you would
create rich text and on java facts you
can have all that so it is a subclass of
paint so basically you had your children
that and all like who they're going to
be taxed nodes and text in java facts a
shape and a shape has a lot of rendering
attributes that you can use and they're
just going to work for you wrapping is
always taken care by the tax flow that
is the container think of as the
paragraph
and I'm gonna try to have a little demo
a few of them actually to show you what
we can do and what we would like to do
for the next time around as well so I'm
gonna start something really really
trivial so I took a a paragraph out of
Wikipedia which just starts if job
effects a software platform blah blah
blah had a couple links had a first word
in boat so that's how you would write
that using job effects the rendering
output is exactly the same you would see
in the web have I written this code
using effects ml which are markup
language would look very similar to HTML
as a matter of fact that said job
effects in general is not a box in model
as the web is we have layouts that are
different so that is the code to create
a text flow that's my CSS pretty simple
right both this boat a link is blue and
it has an underline and has a cursor and
text flow is um that's the parent so all
the text within that paragraph will also
have the font family the font size set
the last four padding border this is for
the the paragraph itself so that's how
it looks like right and very simple if I
was actually executing the demo if I was
moving the mouse over the text so the
text that's blue that's the link you
would get a hand cursor and you could
just easily hook up action listener to
that node and get the click and then you
do whatever you like to do when is your
click if you want to navigate or change
page I'm just going to go back this one
just going to flip over here - maybe
that's worth showing so
in this line here that's where actually
I hook it up the mouse click I could
have hooked it up the auction listener
so if a run is a guy
I miss it okay so it C it is wrapping
properly and you see that this guy here
the rich tax Internet applications is
that guy over there and when it wraps
the text flow was actually able to break
that guy apart into visual distinct
nodes when it goes down to the rendering
phase
okay had I had a by diarrhea already in
here that would have been handle very
similarly right and I have the the
listener so if I click here and if I
showed you console that's good right so
if I'm clicking the atom I'm not doing
anything too fancy I'm just printing out
where you clicked a real application
will get that information is something
sensible I want to get I get this
question every now in the end is like
well so if it's so similar to flow pane
our flow pane if you're not familiar is
a container in Java fax that will lay
all the nodes in a row and we're up to
the next row ones that were towards
robots got foo but that's not able to
split the text apart like so if you read
the rich Internet application it should
have been split because I still have
enough space to put words on the
previous line and text flow does not
know about the glyphs does not know
about paragraph properties it just knows
about nodes so it is it's fuse may be
similar when it goes to use and that was
really our intention to make that
familiar to you so you don't need to
learn a new API or new concepts but the
implementation behind is really
different and so when go decks flow it
don't really have no API for you you
just say just a parent and that's really
what we wanted we didn't want to add new
concepts so it will take care of the
dropping of the text we will take care
of by the reordering contextual shaping
so if a node if you have two types nodes
and the text of the first guy actually
change the shaping of the previous guy
that will get handle as well and
as any other node enjoy effects it
actually works really well is refer a
mixed move F XML and CSS for your Styles
is because text is a shape you can
explore that API and you can do things
that you would not be able to the html5
even though they are they're getting a
large new features nowadays but I can do
a faxing into gradients animations blend
modes Stroke attributes so in this next
one here let me see okay the first one
because of the original have a low
resolution monitor here the job effects
you can barely see but I have actually a
list of eight no I'm sorry for blurred
effects that would create the the few of
having a cloud behind of that Java fax
the next one I just have a linear
gradient running virtually and that the
third one just use the stroke so the few
is transparent and I stroked so you can
really go far using all the combination
that you have available to you inch in
shape so looking shape about stroke and
Stroke attributes and the effects that
you can apply to that note and you can
apply that to your text and you are
gonna get that on the screen for you the
right way following on your code rules
for line breaking and everything else so
one thing that would like to get four
eight and we just didn't have the time
so you're gonna work on that for the
next release is able to get this Dex
flow that's the display node it does it
just display the text there just the way
of rendering content in Java fax would
like to give there enough support for
you to go and use that to build your
head store we have editors build on top
of text but because they are not built
of text flow you cannot do rich tag so
you cannot start a super range of that
text that said we have HTML editor that
is basically a browser running
JavaScript editor that for you and we
want to get something that's more Java
fax in terms of API now the finger
had had time to do his arrange a
background arranged for a text so the
first one get the edge tour you need be
able to heat do did his test properly
give an axe and why I really need to
know where you clicked in what car get
your selection get your carrot range
background I have here what I would like
to actually this works I have them so
instead of styling did they did the tax
itself I styled the background of the
tax right so so the first one just a
round racked the second one is a round
racked so actually the second one I have
sty of the foreground so I just did the
stroke in black without the feel and the
background is a bluish linear gradient
we've seen a round rack and the last one
I was just playing a little bit with
stroked so I just stroked the outside so
if I run that guy
so again see like that doesn't matter
where the text goes it will put that
background in the right place we know
how to do that internally we just ran
out of time to think of API but that's
something that I think should it be in
for the next release because if you're
building a text editor such as Eclipse
for example they use backgrounds too or
that or if you're going to rename stuff
anyplace they're using your a box and I
wish you could add enjoy effects as well
so it that's something they're going to
be working in the next release moving
forward so there's a bunch of properties
in text that when you go to text for
those properties get ignored
for example text if you're using text
independently you can set the wrapping
really for the bounds type line space
and all that stuff when you're inside of
a text flow for text we're gonna ignore
those okay the wrapping width is set by
the text flow that can be thought of as
the paragraph and an orientation which
you're going to talk about more later
also comes from text flow so all those
properties that maybe have used when
working with text with alt text flow now
they will not have an effect so don't be
surprised now going to just change a
little bit of and talk what we did
behind the scenes as well so Java facts
as well as job in general whatever
platform we go to we also had a lot of
code that we would we would load their
phones and read font files pretty much
by hand and when came time to get glyph
outlines and glyph images we use a la
lai berry called t2k and when came time
to get cars and convert those to blips
with a complex script such may be South
Asia or Arabic or Hebrew we would use a
library that would support that the
choice was ICU but even early in the
process one Windows when you get the LCD
tags on Windows you can you get those
glyph images from T to K and you just
use that as is it looked pretty weird it
didn't didn't look right on Windows so
back then we had a little bit of native
code using GD
Gigi is probably the first graphical one
of the first graphic libraries on
Windows just to produce the glyph image
for the LCD text just so that your text
looks native looks proper for your
platform moving to Java fax 8 the pitch
looks like this right so on Linux to do
the work that I see you used to do we
replace that with spangle we could have
used half bus and that's something we
would like to do at some point and to
get the glyph images in the glyph
outlines we are using freetype which
pretty common to do on Linux on Mac OS
my choice a you score text so all the
work that I see you in t2k gave to me in
the past
now I'm getting from cortex cortex is a
native library on the Mac OS is also
available in iOS and that was pretty
cool when we made that switch because
will allow the guys to get that code and
build that cone iOS from from the ground
up and have a java fax bill that would
run the in the iOS so it would run in
your iPad or iPhone so that was pretty
much the main reason it's just like it
is available iOS as well Mac iOS and on
on windows is also a lot of options for
work with text on Windows we had some
GDI that GI plus plus the processing
text unit scribe is a pretty strong
library their own windows at the time I
chose direct write because I fought I
thought that was a pretty pretty
powerful a PR thing she could do with
that so so that's how the stack looks
right now the reason why we did one was
be able to open source to a lock
although we had like a we could open
source and ship ICU we could not do the
same 42k so and we want to be fully open
sourced so we just decided to move all
of those technologies in code something
more modern
LCD text we never really support also
the text on a Mac so even though if the
application request I'll see the text on
the Mac
would not honor that not because it
wouldn't work we just ignore because it
looked pretty weird like once you have
to 2k rendering text on the Mac it just
looks out of place the text just looks
bad so we just stick with great tech
grayscale text now if cortex we get the
ugly finish it just looks right it looks
like every other application your Mac OS
and Macintosh has a pretty distinct look
and feel for text and the user on the
Mac OS expect to see that ICU is a
pretty good library and but but we felt
that was a good idea to move off from
ICU as the the component within ICU did
lay out ancient component that's the
component as you that maps car to glyphs
and as you was not as alive and as
powerful as other options out there so
we move off on that as well
and I student had support some of the
things when doing the future such as
advanced typography like small caps and
swashes and some replacement in India
glyphs and the technologies we are
moving to excluding pongo they all
support that advanced typography so when
you have newer phones you can enable
features such as swashes or historic
representation for some glyphs small
caps a fractional number representation
diagonal I don't have an example here
because not a feature that we have is a
feature that you would like to provide
so just use technology that will enables
to easily get at that point so right now
they did what you when you get java fax
you have both we have our ot2 cabe base
stack and we have the newer stack that's
based on native technologies so if I run
on the Mac and or if you run on Windows
we are using the default or the default
is the native so on a Mac right off the
bat I'm getting cortex there and on
winds are going to use direct write only
look so we still have the old one on by
default
but you can enable that if you set the
flag the only reason we didn't get linux
at same level as Mac or Windows it's
because we ran out of time for doing all
the tests that's required for such a
that's a big change when it goes time to
test all your code right you can you can
specify that that prism tax g2k that's
gonna work in java fax 8 I make no
promises going beyond that but I
personally like to keep just the new
stack and at some point retired to the K
to the K we have been using that for
well over ten years now so it might be
time to let go of it it's pretty good
when I'm testing to know if it was a bug
in the order new another thing I would
like to look into in the future is half
bus he's it's a library that well
essentially that's what I see will do
for me it's been used in a number of
products um from Google actually it's
actually open source but the main
developer works for Google I believe and
I think will be better for us
replay replaying some pongo hard bus
okay now I'm gonna totally switch topics
again I'm gonna talk about northern
intention so that section is a little
bit isolated after know the orientation
I'm going to come back to text and I'm
gonna wrap things up and things you just
come together so okay and it's a new API
in node and also seeing as scene is not
a node and what it does we try to be a
little bit abstract here in a and what
we say but it will change the way the
data flow within your node or if that
node happens to be a parent all that is
within that parent will flow according
to the LOC how so if you have a local
that the data information should flow
from the right to the left then we're
gonna honor that for you that said we do
not make any guesses so if you get your
application and you run that application
and able
we will not gonna enable we're not going
to the default is left to right so if
you never say anything we're going to
assume that is left to right which is
the right answer in a majority of the
world but we expect you to well if you
have a translation to Ebro Arabic and
you have test your product on those
locals you to take two lines of code for
you to change that before and I'm going
to show that to you in a second
so we do not guess we do not guess if
you have if your application is ready
for you for Arabic or Ebola cow and so
that sometimes you can have to set it's
super easy I'm gonna show the code
organize Red Coins is it all got you so
the orientation give me two things left
right right left or inherit so if you
set in your window it inherits down all
the nodes right but at some point there
might be a note here let's say that you
have your application let's say your
application to the Eclipse
it's a job idea where I guys would not
well I just suppose for exercise that
you want the whole thing too big be
right on Ebru so you want that view to
be on the other side anyone the treat X
painted left but the job edge to itself
is showing Java code and that you might
want to stick that be left to right so
just set the first node that represents
your job edge to be left to right and
then all the children that inherit from
that guy is going to follow so it
inherits from the first parent that has
the property explicitly set anything is
let inherit it will get it right for you
most of the time I have a little app
here right in very simple right
just a little dialog why not and our
neighbor I want it to look like this so
the button on the far left for me here
it should be there the okay see oh
I don't show the carrot here but the
carabiner and lock all right I'm gonna
just show that quickly
it's
nothing so basically when I wrote this
code I did not think about Eber or
Arabic I just wrote the code and I saw
my code work in English and I have a
resource bundle right my resource
bounded by default has my English
content and about just one single
translation - Ebru and and to make that
work I added this code here I don't know
if you can have a slide if it is anyway
so basically I get the current locale
and if the current locale is Arabic
Hebrew Farsi or older are gonna set that
flag that's going to change the default
in the scene to be right left so every
window that I created my application has
a scene and if the scene is right left
all the children of that scene also
going to be right left and so every
single note in here became right left
just because I said you know the top
parent is going to be right left if I
had to force them something here to
always remain I'll have to write they
know how to express to go there it said
that
yes we do not support that so the thing
is I don't think my ass ever does that
I'm pretty sure that the windows will do
what you're saying and to do that I
would need supporting glass glass is our
low level window interface and you need
to set the flag in our H Wien to get
that and should be able to get that for
you you probably want your close
minimize maximize but in the right place
that would be a bug you feel free to
report that it will let you shoot to get
it right actually maybe it works I'm not
sure happen I haven't run on Windows
it's sometime internally what we do we
use a technique called mirroring so your
orange in the left to right so your X
will grow as you move from the left to
the right when you same mirror is a
technique that's basically scale and
then a translation but effectively that
minitor 0 0 is on the top right and grow
growth as you move the opposite
direction so when I'm looking at to the
left right so things like text alignment
left will become right and right really
becomes left so those are the POS you
get so no Dorian tation effect of
orientation is like where you have a
node down there and it inherit from
someone if you need to really know
what's the effect of orientation you
have a property for that then you have
the two you have the same properties in
scene then you have the JavaFX scene the
orientation right left and that settled
it for for all the scenes the last one
is a little bit hidden you might not see
it first time you read API but it is a
protect mat in node and if you say that
if you override this function in your if
you're doing your custom control or
stuff of that sort and you return false
we will not gonna taste like a free
translation followed by a free scale of
Paul bad translation we will not undo
that for the unknown in particular right
and then even have to implement right
left by our own means
and that's actually use with text and
you're going to get that in a second
so I mention that so it's the three
options you go ahead oh okay I have a
little bit about Unicode support so I'm
talking about the in this is like
Unicode support for me is get our
paragraph layout correctly get the right
glyphs okay whatever locker you are and
we are we are pretty good with that
because we are using the same technology
as the platform so if you are in the Mac
or on Windows and you complain that we
cannot support a given script changes
are there's not a single application or
not a single native application in your
desktop that can do it either buddy the
both Mac OS and Windows they have a very
wide range of scripts so you have a very
wide range of Unicode support there for
you in terms of getting the glyphs
getting the car to glyphs mapping than
bright line wrapping I'm handling that
using Java so it's a break theater
behind the scenes here by dialing I'm
also using Java
so by that class in Java in heat test we
still have a few bugs there but it's
also done so if you click not cluster
and that might be tight we are gonna
place that in the right we're not going
to just give you some random offset in
the middle of the cluster or so that
you're gonna not move your cursor
properly over that we are going to get
that right - so all the exact so I
cannot really tell UK which part in the
code lab of five zero six zero or six -
it really really is what did the
underlying technology gets you but I
don't think I had not not worried there
because well if you will don't get it
change there nobody else does not in
that platform unless they have some very
specific code for that okay so now we
can bring together gonna talk about text
and orientation
so the mirroring so when you take a
picture of text you're doing a mirror
that we're just gonna look wrong so we
for tax and tax flow that uses mirroring
we say false mirroring for text well if
you are familiar with DD by diagram it
really changed the default paragraph
level used to process that paragraph
right
so there are some libraries that we
analyze your text and you're gonna find
the first strong car in your text so the
first car that is not a symbol or a
neutral card for strong Arabic or
English letters will actually define and
it's just really a way of guessing what
to do and and here just gonna follow the
same philosophy and we will not going to
guess that we're just gonna expect you
to set that and we expect you to get it
right and if you do so then it's going
to be good the paragraph did this
default level is real like this and say
you have English text and Arabic text
and and right in between the two you
have a parenthesis or postmark way over
a point and that point in belongs to to
the English section or can actually
belong to the Arabic and the algorithm
by itself cannot tell because it's
ambiguous and that's where that
paragraph level matters and so I'm going
to have a little we're going to try to
get as simple as I can't explaining this
concept so this is okay then I have a
double quote in blue then I have some
Hebrew text no the exclamation mark at
the end of Libra text and remember the
Hebrew text gotta run from the right to
the left so the first car that you see
visually gonna be on your far right
therefore the exclamation mark as the
last should be on the left so visually
should be the first one it then I have
my clothes coat in blue as well
and I threw all that we feed my tax flow
and I just lay that out for me and
that's what I get
and if
if you have work with by the eye or you
have done some of this work before
they're gonna know that the the
exclamation mark is not very supposed to
be right
I said exclamation mark should be on the
left it'll be the visually if you're
reading like I read from the left to the
right you'll be right behind it you
don't have a mouth of the hollow but
should be on the other side of the
liberal word right and what did that
happen if I go back here so you have
English then you have quote
so that's a no trocar I didn't have a
bunch of Ebro guys then you have up on
tuition up on tuition on tuition again
it didn't have nothing so for all those
guys at the end it can go either way
is that is that part of the Hebrew text
it's parris that part of English it just
cannot really tell so this kamesh marks
the wrong place so you can try just to
change instead the Attica and see if
that's going to help you and definitely
doesn't that's not okay that I forgot
that's not what I wanted what I wanted
is to have a little word in Hebrew
embedded within my English paragraph my
paragraph does majority English language
so that did not work and the thing is in
Java fax we don't have a way of handling
that that's the higher level API so you
are back to bite I control characters
right I work for Eclipse in the past and
this is a part some of that really
matters when I'm working also calls
because they're gonna need that to solve
a wide range of problems like paths URLs
regular expressions the list goes on so
it's a real problem and there we had we
had like different API ways to solve
that problem here we still don't have
that overall I think they did is support
in Java fax it's pretty mature
especially for such hourly a project has
been around for two years in its new
state and we already have by died there
in mirroring
working but this problem particular is
you gotta handle yourself is some sort
of tax processing strategy right so here
is easy enough to handle in the code
right so tax the two is really the tax
that contains the Ebro content so what I
said there
well rough the left embedding right
that's what our e stands for that's
defined in the on Unicode and by the
algorithm of Unicode they put my text in
there and then PDF is I forgot but
stands for but it basically go says go
back to the default pop that lovely at
the head enforce previously right and
I'll see the exclamation mark it is very
supposed to be and if you have people
testing those locals in your company
they will probably pick the start of
problem right away right so that's
pretty much what I have for you today
actually I had one more that was not my
work per se but we have a new control is
a data picker it is based on the new jsr
so it is very powerful expressing if you
need a data picker that supports the
different calendars right and here I
didn't go find suggest open up your
simple just English right these are
everyday calendar but it's basically the
chronology so you can bind that your
control and will get it right for you so
that's all I have so it's pretty good
questions yes of course
I don't have a native data picker no I
had a had a session Tuesday if Steven
Hager and we had a simple how to
actually embed a native dialog within
our java fax application so if you are
in a platform whatever that is that has
a dialog for date picker or
time whatever you can actually leverage
that and use that but you're gonna have
to hawk some code it's not right off the
bat you're gonna have to do some some
dance but we in the damages open a print
dialog and you got that work so I think
that the a little bit of sicko there to
talk to your native resource you just
can do it yes
that's right
I will
oh no no that that no in general in my
experience in general they're cooking
about mirroring that it gets a lot of it
just right
flag 95% it just works so I'm just going
to go back to that damn I had before
okay so if it had only changed the text
all I would have here I would have
column first name I'll just change the
tags that was just the only change I
would have happen in this damn in
particular you had you see the
punctuation before they F because it
would say well I have a punctuation and
you told me to be right left so since I
cannot resolve the labboard the
punctuation are gonna guess based on the
orientation so the point where it's
gotta be Arabic or Hebrew and it's going
to move as the first visible glyph in
your text and that's would not even work
we're not even bigger one so you really
want the whole thing to flip around in a
network or a Mississippi can run medina
here for you I might not be set up for
that but why not was give it a try
that's one of our we added them around I
don't know if she's running here I
haven't tested but basically they're
like the scroll bars are not gonna be in
the left and bottom right anymore gonna
be the left
oh that would work right so I have some
I have a button here okay so I'll just
see the things I okay that will do I
don't have the catalog so it will keep
the English text in it but that will do
it so now where was that tree there was
okay so the tab folder oh that's a bug
yeah should I that's right okay so there
are things that so actually this bug is
a classic problem so as I said Miren
gets you off the ground real fast
Oh in that in that case
some submit right so maybe in that case
you don't want to set that globally you
want to set that specific that
subcomponent and let the enhanced do the
dance for that self component but so
around there are problems in mirroring
like the handling of arrow keys when
they're doing the key down processing of
events is something that you might want
to actually this is actually right
because I'm to doing lessons actually
going left visually so there are some
classic box that's also a classic
problem here this is because it's trying
to position that window that has the
item one two three in the relative to
the desktop and desktop left right so it
a go the translation a little bit off
but that's like it's not the first time
I've seen this bug I think just were
just through right laughs and they are
more for the fun of it just to see it
going right but it was a really test so
the popups on the wrong place but that's
not your hard fix yes they will images
will not pass the will there's another
control or there's another shape there's
a canvas right so there's a little a
little bit of a debate for canvas I
don't know if you ever play of canvas in
java facts so if you basically get a
graph contacts in a draw and you just
draw like html5 canvas so that guy does
I request a mirror that guy for free for
you
so you're gonna probably do that but
energy
well image
and in a research bound for your
application there are images you want to
mirror so you have a Harrow in that
image they want to mirror that another
images you don't want to mirror is the
log of your company you don't want to
our code to be mirrored there right so
so sometimes you need to localize a
research bond for images as well and
that's a common problem when you're
doing this sort of support but if you go
if I just open up I saw that last night
no image of you so there so when you
come yeah when you build your image view
we tell it to be left right so base what
you're saying here is that be left right
regardless of what your parent is
because that's gonna because we
explicitly set in this node so whatever
has has been set in the parent will no
longer be on the register
so npf is a shape in a shape we will be
mirror yes next question okay let me go
back there so you have a data entry and
you change input method your keyboard
layout to Arabic yes and what kind of
text are you entering is that a URL or
file path just something simple okay in
that case I don't see I don't I don't
what's the problem then yes so it will
handle the text dynamically based in the
default paragraph so if that is if that
text field is left right like there are
time is very need some special
processing like if you're entering a URL
or numbers or things that are more
complicated but for that text I like
really gotta show me what what is going
wrong because it should just work
oh yes yes of course yes it should it
should work text input is a little hard
to do sometimes okay it's some manual
when you have a chat and there are
things happening it can be challenging
and if you have regular or a complex
expression that's the name we had in my
previous job so getting that right it's
like words then I slash then word an air
then ebrill then slash then Ebro it
anything's get all wrong because then
that path you need you need some special
code that knows that that thing that
your input is a path and process that
properly in
and dynamically insert the biocontrol
cartridge but if you're just entering
hello world
switch your keyboard layout - Ebru type
some ebrill switch back to english that
said that should just work and you
should not have any problems in there
not at all that should just be fine
I can be very crazy I don't know don't
have a brinstar okay I didn't you
usually have a bunch of locals and
starting my machine but I just got this
machine a few weeks back and I don't but
that should just work for you that's
that in not going to be easy every day
is not gonna be easy everytime sometimes
there'll be some problem it'll be in
your heart any more questions yeah oh
yeah sure I'm sorry what about what
no no vertical text not not in Java yeah
it's a shame but we didn't get around to
do vertical text so not no top to bottom
so yeah comp is a lot of work just to
get what we did in such ah yeah I know
it's not easy it's not as not it's not
as easy as people think Rhys you can
rotate text but that's not what you want
this is particularly complicated for
mixing mixing text and there are special
rules for to follow there it's not
trivial it's not the end of the world
but you just didn't have the time all
right
so thank again for coming you know if
you have any questions or mailing list
or Kamau is there and there's like more
more guys another user group and we're
pretty good at getting answers and we
are also pretty good at getting back in
in our bug reports we turn around about
end bugs they're being pretty good your
things tip bugs in this area really
quickly like in a matter of weeks really
so if you find something you can
actually get it to fix for the next
release in the spring all right so
that's it for job 1 2013 for me nutrient
thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
