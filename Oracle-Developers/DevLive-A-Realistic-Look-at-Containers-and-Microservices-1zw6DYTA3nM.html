New York City I'm Bob rue part with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
another dev live interview my guest for
this interview is Karthik Gaekwad the
tongue twister right there yeah and it's
early in the day I can't either too much
or too little coffee tell me about your
session here at Oracle code so my my
talk is going to be about containers on
mic services for realists and basically
we're going to talk about how so DevOps
is 8 years old and so containers and
micro versus like the new phase of
DevOps where you can have you know
people building services not as one big
monolith anymore but you know building
them into smaller pieces and we're kind
of going to go into a lot more details
on you know how you do that what are
efficient efficient ways practices and
maybe some case studies from that the
title of your session kind of begs the
question what sort of unrealistic
assumptions do you encounter from
developers regarding micro services and
containers sure that's a great question
I think one of the things specifically
with containers there's all there's a
lot of information out there and much
services as well it's like everybody
kind of wants to know how you build
Micra services and you know answer a lot
of questions associated with that but I
think the the key thing over there is
you don't have to actually do everything
that people recommend and you know
there's a there's a paradigm called the
12 factor app and so a lot of developers
know about you know the 12 pack or a
paradigm but you don't necessarily have
to implement each and every one of those
things in order to have there's no such
thing as a perfect mic service
essentially you can pick one start there
and then load up your services in a you
know in a in a manner that's acceptable
to your business what's the one key
takeaway that you hope people walk away
from your session with I think the one
thing that I'm trying to stress on is
both of those landscapes are really
really fast
so the two things that I kind of want
people to take away are you know what
are some great strategies you should
think about when you're writing your
application so that's what that's one of
the takeaways and then also since Mike
services and docker container ization
and and serverless
is like the new phase of DevOps it gives
us the opportunity for having like devs
and ops to work together in better ways
and so I kind of want to outline some of
those goes into those topics so what's
next for you do you have any speaking
engagements or anything on your schedule
I'm so I'm doing this talk today at
Oracle code in New York and I might also
do some more talks and at other Oracle
top conferences all right that's good to
know
and if you want to attend an Oracle code
conference if you visit developer
oracle.com slash code you'll find a
complete list of all the cities in which
we're holding Oracle code events you'll
also find links if you want to submit a
session proposal for an Oracle code just
like my buddy here you can do that as
well thanks for stopping by and for
those of you watching stay tuned we'll
have more interviews from Oracle code
New York coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
