the compiler team of the Oracle studio
compiler T and I do performance analysis
so I'm typically down with the hardware
and disassembly so this is high-level
stuff for me I'll be talking about
calling native code from Java basically
so the overview of j'ni and then i'm
going to talk about debugging mixed
language debugging and then performance
stuff and then various other approaches
you can use so gen-i Java native
interface has been around for quite a
long time you know back 97 99 that and
it's a mechanism to call native code
from Java or to call java from native
code so I'm going to talk about calling
native code from Java because that's
probably gonna be the most common
scenario here the main thing about j'ni
is the infrastructure provides you to
call the routines plus it provides you
support the date data conversion which
is kind of the important bit of this
because Java data types are not
identical to native data types there is
some amount of conversion and some
amount of care needs are needed to be
able to do this sort of thing so that's
what genai provides you the motivation
for wanting to talk about why called
native code many situations can be
existing code base that isn't Java
legacy application you want to kind of
wrap in Java a good example of why you
might do this is hardware features you
know we have chips to support crypto
have crypto instructions and yeah
there's a good library you can use for
crypto but you might want to call in
some instances a particular instruction
and this is the way to do it performance
it's not so much of an issue in there
it's not a compelling argument but there
might be in some cases if you sat
sweated buckets and you've got the
disassembly just right and you want to
call that routine with those
instructions in that order yeah there
might be a performance argument the
generally speaking job is pretty good on
performance if you saw the talk I gave
on Monday you I discussed some of the
differences at that point so diving into
J and I right it's pretty simple in the
main thing here is you're going to tag
routines with this is a native routine
so in this example the routine go is
native so that means you aren't going to
provide the implementation here you're
going to provide the implementation
somewhere else and the implementation is
going to be in the shared library of
some kind so you'll need to call the
system to load the shared library and
then you call the routine in the shared
library it's relatively straightforward
from that perspective but there's a
whole lot of stuff that goes on around
that now the first bit of stuff is where
do you find these libraries so if you're
on a UNIX my lib becomes live my Lib dot
s o if you're on Windows who've been my
Lib DLL and so it automatically
qualifies the library for that the
library name for the platform it
searches the default search path which
in many instances isn't going to be
exactly where you would like it to
search so there are about three
mechanisms for finding a library
apart from putting it where it's
expected where it's going to search by
default there's the environment variable
LD library path now that's an ugly hack
I talked to the linker team quite
frequently and that's one of their
mantras if you see LD library path it's
indicative of it could be possible to do
this better because relying on a setting
in the environment isn't necessarily
secure if somebody else changes that
environment yeah you could bad things
could happen then command line where you
can use Java library path and pass in at
command
where you expect to find the light but
that's a bit better or you can do it
programmatically and there's multiple
ways you could do it programmatically
here's an example it's not the best
example so you can get the user
directory which is the current directory
that's kind of not necessarily the best
place to search for a library but
whatever and then you can append to that
the name of the library and then you can
say load the library the unfortunate
side-effect here is that you've actually
got to do the kind of the naming of the
library yourself so you have to figure
out what platform you're on so it's not
ideal and from certain perspectives the
LD library path or the command line
approach are better in that regard so
anyway he's now calling your code you've
got a library
you haven't got alive we've got to make
the library so let's look at how we make
the library so the first thing to do is
to compile the Java code as you get your
class file and then from the class file
you can generate a header file for your
C C++ code and the header file will
contain all the ornamentation that you
need and then you'll include that header
file into your C C++ routine and then
your compiled the library and magically
it will work so I could have done this
on the command line I will intend to do
some of the stuff on the command line
but it may go horribly wrong so Java to
Java C to compile your application Java
H with - j'ni to generate the header
file and this will generate a my app 2 H
file and then if you look at the header
file it will look like this so includes
the journey header it specifies C
linkage if you're compiling with C++
compiler because the linkage is kind of
important for that for name mangling and
then you declare the function so if we
dig into how
function is actually declared you see
that it looks quite complicated it isn't
actually that complicated but it's a
very flexible mechanism that it's got so
first of all JN I export if you're on
Windows you'll probably want to have a
deckle spec export or something in that
part of the the text so depending on the
platform that will get set to the
appropriate word then you have a return
type for the function a gen I call again
on x86 there are various calling
conventions that you could use in
different situations and so this is sort
of will get replaced on the platform the
appropriate calling Convention and you
have a mangled name I called my function
go and it was part of my app and it's a
Java app so it's Java in my app go so
it's kind of got a mangled name the name
mangling can get quite complicated the
only kind of thing you've got to worry
about there is to make sure the name in
the header file matches the name in the
source code otherwise it's all very nice
and then it passes in a pointer to a
Java environment now that will be useful
later on when we ask the Java
environment to do things for us like
conversion of different types from Java
types into native types and then you get
a parser to the Java object that's like
the self pointer comes in as well
when you have parameters this function
will get longer and arguably uglier so
then you write the native code so
basically you take the same header file
and fill in the the the gaps in this
case I'm just gonna write you some
printf hello world whatever the
compilation line I kind of like to take
the compilation line apart a bit because
it's a bit daunting given its length so
I'm using the C compiler - G tells it to
generate a shared object kay pic this is
for studio C compiler tells it to
generate
an independent code which is kind of
what you would expect find in a shared
object position independent code meaning
code that you can locate anywhere in
memory so that the library can be loaded
by the linker and just stuck anywhere -
G lowercase G debug information I unless
I forget it I always put - G on to the
compar lines because I find 99 times out
of 100 at some point I'm going to
profile this application I'm going to
want to know where the time is being
spent and then name of the output
library died so the source file and then
I'm going to need to include a couple of
header files this is for the journey H -
I to get the J Knight with the Java
include directory to get the gern ID h
and then there's a second include file
that be pulled in by jen ida h which is
the platform specific header file so in
my case I'm running on Solaris so I've
got include slash Loras and he'll pull
in the header part from there so it's
quite a long compiled line but you do
that and you end up with a shared object
I don't know if I I won't try and run
this at the moment I hopefully I'm just
gonna it's just gonna work later on so
that allows me to write a little bit of
code that I run but the real meat of
this is how do I pass parameters into
the Java and get something back so how
to have passed your parameters into the
C C++ and get something back this useful
so I need to handle parameter passing so
going to a slightly different example in
this case here's my native again and it
returns a double so it's actually got
return rather than a void and it's
called sum and it has it passed as an
array of double precision values and a
length of that array and you can guess
what it's going to do and I call it here
later on I pass I set up an array of
numbers and pass that array and and I'm
going to get a return value and it's
gonna be the total of that array
and Here I am loading up the library
again using Hanna's on default path so
as we discussed when we passed this
through Java age it will produce a
header file with the mangled name and
the mangled name will have both name of
the routine plus some identification of
the promises in so here we go here's the
name of the routine and it gets passed a
Java double erase an array of double
precision values from Java and a Java
int and so this is the point at which it
gets slightly more interesting now the
Ray coming in is in basically the native
format for Java which isn't exactly what
you want for native code because it's
not necessarily compatible but there's
one other thing that's going on that the
other thing that's going on is that
you've got garbage collection so in Java
your arrays are kind of flexible can be
moved around when you come into the
native code you want to lock that down
for the duration so this is going to
actually make a copy of that array for
the native code to work on and then you
do your stuff with that copy in the
native code and then at the end of it
you're going to release it which
essentially copies back from the native
array to the Java array so any updates
to that array will be modeled on
available on the Java side and you've
also got return so it transparently
handles the this sort of stuff for the
return type and yeah there's their
compute computation in the middle just
to make it look like it's doing
something useful so let's see if I can
do some this is actually I was just
trying this before I started here and it
really really didn't go very well but so
I can debug mix Java C programs and so
I've got a program here called average
okay so read it in
and I can run it
let's do step so I've stepped over that
I can print file hopefully there we go
so I'm printing out a Java variable from
the debugger dvx and then let's see if I
can step into this so okay I want to go
to
I could step through this of this loop
which has you know to 2048 iterations
but you'll get quite bored so I'm going
to skip that and this is the performance
version of my benchmark which just runs
the code lots and lots of times so it
takes forever
let's see whether it works oh look okay
so you can see the function call up here
fully yeah
line 9 I like that this function call
here that was in Java and now I've
stopped in the C code so I've gone from
the Java code to the C code in average
CC and here we go I'm going to stop here
and then I might get a bit confused it's
optimized code and
see what that works no okay it's
optimized
okay that worked second print I so some
of the variables are accessible
somewhere some of them aren't
okay there you go
okay so you can see that I can go
through my native code and my java code
from one dbx environment and if I built
with that optimization it would have
been a bit smoother you have a question
sir yeah this is what's a large studio
dbx can do so I don't know other if
other debuggers are able to do this okay
let's head back to the slides so I think
I demonstrated all this without yeah too
much there's printing a variable and
there we go so we can debug mixed
applications
what about profiling them so since I was
running the performance version of this
code let's see if I can actually get a
profile so the steps for getting a
profiler collect minus J on and then
Java parsing in the path and earth title
name of a class file see what this works
otherwise here's one I prepared earlier
but
just gonna make sure I get the syntax
right here
okay I know well done
great finally so this will run for I
don't know how many seconds not too long
hopefully probably about 20 and then we
can have a look at what the profile
looks like it's not gonna be a very
exciting profile I guess that
it'll probably do so the analyzers the
GUI part of this this comes up in user
view which is a sort of a more
simplified view it's meant to reflect
what a developer might see if they
aren't actually interested in a
nastiness that goes on underneath so
this is my C code there's a mem copy
here and then there's his the 2j and I
call the two conversion calls the get
array of double elements and the release
array of double elements and then
there's some mutexes and Malick's and
freeze interestingly enough and so if we
look at the java average you can see
that java average is called by average
dot AV which is my java code so this is
C code I don't know if I can show you
the source file on the right-hand Sun
hand side here no there we go average
dot C and the one I click that you see
it's in average Java so it's showing me
a call stack that's mixed we can
probably demonstrate even more clearly
if I did look at this here's my Java
code here's my C code and here's the
support functions now if I want I just
was happy at the moment okay so this is
my Java source file so this is my C
source file showing me where the time is
being spent and the time is being spent
on this rather useless bit of work which
I've made it do and I've made it do
about 10,000 times or something crazy so
all the time is spent here there is a
bit of time spent there's two seconds on
this get double array elements and
one-and-a-half seconds on the release so
we'll have a look at those in a minute
I'm kind of interested in what the
disassembly looks like so this is
disassembly of my native code showing me
where the time is spent and for those
people who don't read x86 disassembly
these are x87 instructions these are x87
floating-point instructions which are
kind of legacy pretty slow and should be
avoided so I should have basically asked
it to generate SSE instructions rather
than these and my code would run
substantially faster which would of mean
meant I just had to increase the number
of times I called it in order to get a
good demo so let's go back these two
they call some of the j'ni code let's
have a look at what they actually do so
Jen I get double array elements we can
put that in the middle it does some
stuff it does you know point zero six
seconds worth of stuff itself which is
no time at all and spends nearly two
seconds copying and it calls malloc it's
as interesting so immediately you can go
oh it probably calls malloc gets a chunk
of memory copies from the job array into
that memory and now I've got a native
version of the the array let's have a
look at what the other routine was the
release our routine here we go and that
does a very similar bit of work it takes
less time in the copy because probably
when it copied the stuff for the first
time it had to fetch memory fetch that
from memory and the second time is all
cached so it's going to run a bit faster
so does a copy and then it calls the OS
free so this is interesting to me
because this is a situation where Java
is calling malloc and free which are
very traditional C C++ code but routines
and it's an opportunity for problems so
one issue we sometimes hit with malloc
and free is if they aren't m multiple
multi thread hot so if you have multiple
threads hot calling malloc and free
today scale well and so this could be
serialization point in a multi-threaded
Java code you have to watch out for this
kind of thing so what else do you want
to have a look at right so if we go back
to the Java code
I can look at the white coat there's
wrong bit let's go back to the Java code
and let's look at the source for the
Java so here's the source for the Java
you can see that this is line here where
I call all a million times the this my
native code in order to spend some time
there and it's telling me that on that
line of Java there's about 14 seconds
worth of time being spent so that's kind
of useful to see I can also look at the
disassembly for the for that code and
it's in Java bytecode and here's the
function call so this is the invoke
special going call the native bit of
code so this is kind of potentially
interesting I'm not sure many people
really do look at Java disassembly
though even though it is relatively
readable and there's one more feature so
is this is the Timeline view and each of
these little ticks here is a bit of a
sample and you see this is calling this
is where captured a calling free and if
I go to one of these this is it just
working on the out bridge if those
things like garbage collection going on
there big gaps in the time line where
nothing was running but this code is so
trivial there's no GC involves so that's
one view as I said this is kind of like
the view that
so aha yes that's a good that's a good
lead-in so the this is showing me the
native code thought that for the routine
I coded in C but for the Java it not
it's showing me bytecode and as you know
Java does multiple versions of routines
it compiles on them recompile of jets
and then read yets and things so we have
a mode called machine mode here which
shows you the same sort of screen but
it's actually going to do now show me
what the Java code gets compiled to was
that the question you're asking did I
misinterpret no I showed the machine
instruction for the C code and I showed
the Java bytecode for the Java now I'm
because you are yeah your question was a
perfect leader because now I'm going to
show you the disassembly for the Java
hopefully so we have you know the idea
being that if you're writing Java you
kind of don't really want to see too
much disassembly at x86 level so there's
that's the user mode in machine mode you
like tell me what the Machine sees and
so this is kind of my favorite mode I
guess so I've got the caller's Cooley's
and here's my java code again so as my
average Java source file this time when
I go through the disassembly this is
what the JVM has generated and you can
see that here's the call instruction
down here which is taking all the time
because that's where I call in my native
code and surrounding it is yeah
beautiful x86 assembly and it doesn't
take any time fortunately because I
didn't write code that did if there were
multiple versions this function you
would see multiple versions you can also
see here now we're now we're looking at
the machine view there's a bit of code
called init the interpreter which is in
the call stack and that's basically in
when you're interpreting the Java code
rather than getting it so
let's take a look at the timeline
because this also changes quite
substantially so now we're looking at
what the Machine views what the Machine
sees I've got it looks like about six
thirds going on I guess some other
threads were created and disappeared
pretty much instantly so here's the main
thread going along you can see this you
recognize some of these things in the
call stack this I believe is the watcher
thread watching for anything that needs
the JVM needs to do and this is probably
an a yeah it's in the condition wait so
it's waiting on something I know sorry
this is the watcher throat there we go
what's this one
it's a monitor okay and if we look down
here it's kind of interesting so this
bit of time here is whilst the machine
as being low is what's the JVM sets up
so you've got all kind of weird things
in the heap on the right hand side here
I see lots of class table loading and
stuff like that then hopefully here is
the Java stack from the interpreter so
this phase just between these two times
between 200 and 300 milliseconds of run
time is the interpreter seeing the code
for the first time and then the jet
kicks in and you're actually in native
code kicks in you're into the native
code here as I said if those garbage
collection going on you would still see
a gap in the main thread and you would
see activity on probably five and eight
which is probably the GC threads and
this right so
let's flip back to the slides yes
so gathered a profile we've viewed the
profile can see the native code and the
Java code mixed it together in the same
environment and you can see the call
stack going from Java code to C code and
here's the Java source code showing you
which particular source lines correspond
to where the time was going and this is
the C source code showing me the hot
points in the code and as I said there's
time spent on the conversion to and from
and if you sum this up there's about 12
seconds in this particular profile you
can see that about 3 seconds so that's
about a quarter of the time for this
particular code is spent doing the
conversion to and from which is sort of
the cost of calling native code there is
a conversion cost so which goes back to
the performance point I was talking
about earlier where you may find that
you take your very nicely performing job
native code and then you put the
conversion and it's gonna have to be a
lot faster in order to amortize the cost
of the conversion right so we've got
through a kind of overview of J&amp;amp;I and
what the costs are there are a couple of
other solutions out there there's gen I
discussed means you can call native code
now what well I showed in my demo was
basically me hacking directly into some
routine that gen I provided you're
probably not going to use it like that
you're probably much more likely to say
right I'm gonna have a shim layer where
I do all the jail J&amp;amp;I stuff and then in
the that shimla I'm gonna call the
existing library so you probably will
have the library separate from the shim
layer so it's gonna be slightly
different than what I demonstrated and
there are a couple of approaches that
kind of make this easier for you there's
J&amp;amp;A and Jen are
they're built on j'ni and so they
effectively make the direct calls to
libraries easier to code but they're
still doing under the surface they're
still doing exactly what I've just
showed you so I'm going to talk about
J&amp;amp;A here so it comes in a jar file
journey jar and it basically defines a
library object that you extend and
you're going to load this library and
you're going to call a function that's
defined in that library and here's
yeahyou you're declaring the function
there and here's how you would call it
and then this is me just starting it up
a version of this so the advantage of
this is that I don't actually end up
writing code to I don't write this
shimla that I showed you earlier when I
was writing the code that was
responsible for handling the marshaling
the parameters and so on
Jenny does that for me so I'm actually
taking a library and just saying I want
to call this library and that's a very
nice way of doing it for the developer
because it takes a lot of the fault out
of lots of the trickiness out of dealing
with it so I'm just basically saying
here's a shared object I want to call
that shared object this is the name of
the shared object and this is the
function and its parameters that I want
to call much much simpler and so on my C
code you can see there's no including a
j'ni header file I'm just writing a
vanilla C bit of code that says this is
the function I want to write want to
call so much easier to compile it I want
to use Java C again the journey jar file
and the source code and then I compile
my shared object
whatever order and then I run it and
okay here's the the output from that
not particularly exciting bit of output
lights makes it invisible doesn't know
okay but you notice I didn't have to do
all the make ahead of file and deal with
marshaling the very various variables
from Java format to native format now I
can profile this actually if I can find
now
so
so here's the source code that I showed
you on the screen and I believe I have
an analyzer experiment I've prepared
yesterday so rather than try and collect
e I'm just going to load that up
now what you notice is that first thing
I would notice is this took nearly twice
as long to run as the other version and
you can see that there's a lot of time
spent in this routine which actually
disguises what's going on folks
flip to machine mode you can see here's
my routine actually some okay and I
spend about the same amount of time
there I can look at the source for that
hopefully yeah which is here and so I
spent nine seconds this is the same sort
of loop I had in the middle you notice I
don't have the marshalling at the
beginning that could be over get a get
double array on the release table rake
so that's why this routine takes less
time it's lost that bit of overhead but
the overall overhead is increased so if
we look at what it's called by it's
called by some okay let's add look at
look at the call tree here hopefully
that will be more elusive more
explanatory and go all the way down this
alright there's a proxy function and
then there's the gen a function invoke
and somewhere down here
right down here there's my function so
you can see that what Jana has done is
wrapped my C function with a whole bunch
of layers and stacks and my methodist
somewhere up here can't see them okay
there we go so that's my bit of code
then as a proxy room there's a Nimbo can
invoke another invoke lots of layers and
that's where the overhead is coming from
we can look at the get double array of
elements and release double array of
once they're there as well so that we
haven't lost them they've just been
automatically generated and they take
roughly the same time but there's a
whole bunch of other stuff but also
taking time that we didn't call before
so I've got all these additional methods
which add to the cost so
right so basically we've seen from the
journey side we can call the existing
code we can write new code that can be
called from Java and there is this
performance impact you saw there's like
25% of the time lost to converting
arrays and releasing arrays afterwards
so as it can be quite a substantial
performance impact but obviously if you
spend sufficient time in your C code
that's performance impact is amortized
by the time you spend there and so it's
probably not going to be hopefully for
your particular code is not going to be
particularly critical then J and a gen
are these are easier to use but they add
more of an overhead because they're kind
of general-purpose frameworks they're
going to inspect the library figure out
how to call it figure out what routines
need to be called to do the type come to
do the object conversion and do this in
such a way that it's safe for you so
there's going to be more of a
performance here as you saw that the
runtime effectively doubled for that and
a lot of that was you know the
additional overhead so in terms of the
tools I demonstrated I demonstrated dbx
debugging the mixed C C++ and Java code
being able to print out variables in
both and the studio performance analyzer
as I mentioned I'm in the studio team
and you know the studio Oracle Solaris
studio compilers are a free download so
if you want to try this out on either
Solaris or Linux we support both we've
got obviously the C C++ Fortran compiler
so got a debugger the performance
analyzer and we've got some other tools
which are interesting I think we you
probably missed the talks on those a
thread analyzer for looking at data
racers and a code analyzer for looking
at code correctness issues both static
and dynamic memory asset error checking
or wave you know done something weird
that isn't sort of legitimate code
it's yeah these are marketing bullet
points and basically it's a good
compiler suite now I guess we're are
like over a 240 on a Thursday afternoon
so you have missed all these
unfortunately we're on the last one here
you should be able to download the
slides I would heartily recommend you
downloading the slides of some of these
if you're interested in these domains so
hopefully that's some of these will be
of interest to you and then if you're
interested in slower studio there is a
redirect link there I believe somewhere
we have a booth but I don't know exactly
where and that is the end so thank you
what questions do you have
no I don't I'm afraid
I'm I'm not certain whether you can do
that very well or not I certainly think
it's an area that could be explored to
do this kind of thing the feeling I get
with Jay and I is there they came up
they came up with a relatively good
interface quite early on they
standardize on a good interface
beginning and then beginning and then
they've built on top of it and I'm not
sure that there's much demand for
rejigging it to make it any better so my
guess is that yes we could use some sort
of annotations but unless somebody
really gets has an itch about that it's
not going to happen very readily thank
you
so someone at the front is saying that
Java nine will have something to do this
that'd be cool
the compiler and tools I showed you here
are available on Solaris and Linux if
you're on Windows or AIX or something
else then I'm not sure what the best
tool would be to use in those four
windows you probably need to be looking
like B tune or something in that domain
from Intel and other platforms will have
other solutions there are a number of
Java profilers which across platform
that you could also look at
no swig okay yeah I don't know if that
one I'm afraid
okay thank you brilliant well thank you
very much and I hope you enjoy the rest
of your afternoon and have safe journeys
