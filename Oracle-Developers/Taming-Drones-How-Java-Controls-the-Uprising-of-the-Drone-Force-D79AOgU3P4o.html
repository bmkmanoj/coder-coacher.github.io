I do the training for the farmers and
the advices in appreciation agriculture
and I do not do coding yet but the
javafx looks very interesting so I think
I'll give it a try it next year all
right I'm Tim fauna and the architect
and lead developer for Echo sense the
open source for management software
which one Duke shorts award last year we
are still developing and developing it
in the company called lime tree which
has a few very good developers and some
other experts and trainers and well we
do the best we can so this session is
about drones what are drones drones are
well in this case little bees and worker
bees and they are specialists they are
they are there to fulfill specialist ask
for example if you look at bees bee
colony the specialist task of a drone is
to collect honey or in the ingredients
to make honey so and this is also what
humans use drones for a very special
istic tasks that help us into our our
daily jobs or do the things that would
otherwise be too dangerous or too
tedious for humans to execute and you
can think of the military to do
reconnaissance or in our case you can
also think about farming because farm is
becoming more and more and the farm and
farms are becoming bigger and bigger and
the people on the trackers are becoming
the workers and the farmer is drawing
back to the office more and more and he
is lacking the eyes and ears of the farm
he is no longer in touch with its field
every day so we thought well let's
provide the farmers this is extra set of
ears and eyes and this will be our drums
so next this is an example of what you
can use a drone for in this case there
is a field of out and there has been
some very heavy rainfall and when the
falls and a lot of rain on the crops
they can become too heavy and they fall
down on the ground they collapse and
when they are collapsed and they are
very hard to harvest because if you
right out of the field with a combined
or you can imagine the combine is about
10 centimeters above the land and if the
crops all falling down you can't harvest
them so this is damaged and but it's
from the ground it's very hard to spot
or to estimate how big the damage is you
see big spots in the middle and the
edges are pretty good still in pretty
good shape so with the drum you can
provide a unique perspective on your
field and give a very good overview in
the extent of the damage being caused by
the heavy rainfall and now you can
adjust maybe take some measures or
adjust your your fertilizer for next
year that the crops do not grow too fast
so they will not they will keep strong
and you have less damage from heavy
rainfall this is a picture is done from
the front camera of the drum and there
are actually two cameras the camera in
the front is HD so you get pretty nice
pictures and this is from the camera
which is beneath the drum and we use
this camera for two things so as you can
see it's not a very good resolution so
it's not very good for the human eye so
we use it for calculations and one of
them is to adjust the position to
stabilize the drum so we look down we
see how the ground is moving and we try
to stabilize if the drone needs to be
stable the other one is that we can use
the raw image data to calculate biomass
what you see the picture you see here
it's adjusted for the eyes because the
eyes are more sensitive to specific
colors the raw data is being adjusted so
the I can
repeated into a real image in what you
would see normally but they're all data
contains much more information than you
can see here so we can use this raw data
and to calculate how much bio master is
on the field so you see the gray
purplish spots those are fields the soil
and the green spots those are biomass
plants so we can use the calculation of
the biomass to create pictures like this
so we can fly all over the over the
field and we combine all those tiles we
created with the calculated biomass and
create very detailed pictures about the
concentration of biomass on the field
actually this is not biomass picture but
it's another fiction but this one was
more clear so I use this one as you can
see here on the in the top of the field
there's a there's some red going on so
this is a warning signal for the farmer
so if this was a bio mass spec you could
say oh the growth of the plants is
falling behind in the in the northern
part so he can take some measures maybe
adjust some extra fertilizer in that
area or maybe there is a disease going
on so he can just if all is fine you can
just leave the field behind and you can
focus mainly on the problematic areas so
we can get on its bike if it's a Dutch
farmer and on his car if it's a farmer
elsewhere and then he writes to the to
the problematic area and you can
visually inspect what's going on because
that's what needed if you have a problem
you need to inspect and you can see well
all the plants that are being too small
or maybe there's too much water in it so
he can race elevate the length for next
year so there will be less problems with
water maybe there is a disease so you
can spray some insecticides or
pesticides fungicides everything and to
solve the problem
so what do we do with drones it's
twofold the first it's all
experimentation and a face and it's by
far enough prediction ready but it we
get some very nice results already first
goal we had is to control the drone
because if you can't control the drone
then what do you have something you
can't control them it won't do you any
good so we created a javafx application
it connects via a Wi-Fi connection to
the drone and instructs the drone to
move to the left to the right adjust the
altitude moving forward moving backwards
and that way we can give them give the
drone some details instructions from the
code so we know how to use Java to
control the drum second phase we
implement the same but then on an
autopilot so we attach the autopilot on
top of the drone and instead of manually
giving the drone instructions we use GPS
to figure out where you are and what
direction the drone is facing and we can
tell the Drowned to move to a certain
location and that is one a big step
forward into usability for the farmer as
you can imagine if the farmer has to
manually control every drum so let's say
yes hundred fields all on the wrist
control oh he can't drive to 100 field
so he wants to use drums if he has to
manually deploy every drone he has maybe
it will be 10 maybe it will be a dozen
maybe 20 be 20 then he will be all day
only flying drones so this is way too
expensive and it's not very helpful
because in the same speed you can also
move to the location so we want to be
able for the drones to fly on their own
and just go to do the task fly back and
provide the results that way you can
send out 10 or 20 drones automatically
maybe 100 maybe a thousand that's all
the future did you start with one
you can send them out to do a certain
task which is gathering gather data fly
back and provide the data to deter
farmer and then you can use it to spot
some problems things like this so
control the drone from Java I will do
some flying now they'll become
interesting so people in the front if
you see something an earring with great
speed please dive to the ground do not
stick your arms in the air because you
might lose some limbs well you know what
they say about women behind the wheel
maybe I can do it like this okay hear me
well this is the actual drone it's a
pretty small device someone said it was
big but I don't think it's really big
and we didn't make it ourselves you just
can buy it in this box and it contains
everything it has the camera on front
the batteries here sorry the battery is
over here and the connection is here so
that's where it stores the data the GPS
system is not installed right now
because well it can see the satellites
and the automatic pilot is not really
necessary here on the back you see the
other cameras and it works with
ultrasound so it can measure the height
and now we can
this is the cap for protection your
protection well actually it is not it's
also for protection from the walls and
stuff it's a pretty strong material and
it met some trees already still working
sorry oh you can fly about half an hour
and if you attach the GPS the autopilot
then it's reduced to about a quarter of
an hour so it's not that's one of the
problems we will we currently have
that's if there's very limited fly time
but this is a fairly cheap model and if
you start experimenting you better start
cheap because you can waste money all
you want of course but our funds are
limited so we start with the cheap one
first and figure out if it works how it
works what the problems are and then we
can also always buy a bigger one with
more battery capacity in the clinic this
one is about 600 euros so it's it's it's
affordable it's the expensive toy but
for for intelligence for for machinery
for a farmer it's its penis really if
you buy a tractor you you pay a hundred
thousand zeros easily for a new tractor
so if if you you can buy how many drums
you can buy for your for this amount of
money and it's the same everywhere it
comes with a device for every country so
really handy
so this is the the UI we have created
and well you can see the imaging from
the cameras so it's very easy to see
where you are flying and it has some
some meters is very nice they are ja 5 X
components going from the jf extras open
source library library and we have one
for the x y&amp;amp;z velocity so you know which
direction is moving and we have around
on for our altitude on the top right you
see need a battery so it's also pretty
handy especially with the limited
battery amount you have to see how
rapidly its declining in you can return
the drunk before the battery is dead
otherwise you have to mainly return it
which you have to do a lot of time
because it has some some precautions
built in so if you fly out of the Wi-Fi
range then it shuts down automatically
and it can be pretty far if you're in
the open field so you have to work all
the distance to retrieve it so we have
to do this a dozen of times already well
we had we had some fun in the fields and
below the battery we have a sensitivity
slider and this is quite important
feature because you can also there is an
app from the manufactory here
manufacturer you can use on your tablet
or on your iPhone but then it's really
really sensitive and it's pretty hard to
control with the series of thumbs on the
touchscreen and it's not always working
correctly so now we can use the keyboard
and with the sensitivity slider we can
adjust how how the response is from the
drum so we can get a feeling on how fast
we can turn here yeah Christmas just
apply outdoors oh yeah sorry the thing
that's around
what I put up what I put it on it that's
only for the insight when you fly
outside it comes off and the film you
saw and that was real testing so it's
for outside yeah because outside you
need as little space as possible because
it's very sensitive to wind because it's
very very light and the more space in
air space you take the more sensitive
you are to win so if you fly with this
cover outside and it will blow away
pretty quickly but for insight you have
a lot of turbulence from the wall
because it blows all the air and
downwards and it will well the air has
to go somewhere so it will go to the
sides and if there are the walls then it
will fly back and it will affect the
steering so to minimize this effect
there is also and discovering around it
but as you can see it has four rotors
and it allows you to control the drum so
on the opposite side so the front left
and the right back they are turning
clockwise and the other one other ones
are tuning anti-clockwise in this way by
slowing down the front rotors and it
will dive and then it will go forward
and for the back you slow the back
rotors down it will go backwards and you
can also make a turn by slowing down the
clockwise rotors it will turn
anti-clockwise and if you slow down the
clock why anti-clockwise it will turn to
look one so you can make all the
directions and by making them to go
faster you will go up and down so any
movement you make you will be possible
can apply we actually flying it
the direction angle by router speed and
you have to be conscious of all of those
all of the rotors the question is if we
have to be conscious of the rotor speed
of all the routers and have to do this
manually but luckily no we can just sent
it that's a handle by the hardware
inside of the drum so we can send
instructions go left go right tilt left
till right forward backwards upwards so
now it doesn't go to the right or to the
left it twists and goes forward or
backwards but it doesn't go when it when
I use the arrows it only turns but it
doesn't go to the right like in a car
with a steering wheel no no no critical
of course it's not working yeah sure no
it's a demo so we won't be the first
demo north on something that doesn't
work it makes quite a lot of noise hmm
the lights all right so sometimes it
gets into the fallback mode then over
lights are red as you see now for
example if you fly into a tree it will
do the same thing which happens a few
times as well so if someone if if it's
rotating and if it hits something it
will shut down automatically and because
it's very light well if you take a dive
into the ground and your fairy lights
and you have very little chance yes sir
wait work accomplished
waits for connection now we have to wait
for the boot up and for the network
connection maybe you can ask maybe
someone has a question in the meantime
yes sorry okay yeah well we connect to a
video stream and what it does it sends a
picture every 200 milliseconds and what
we do is just paint a picture on an
image campus imageview I it's more or
less the same i think i guess because
it's just painting a picture but the
performance of painting images is very
very good in javafx i guess the
performance will is better'n here it
goes
mile away
that's now the court is long enough so
as you can see now it automatically
shuts down and then we can just reset it
by removing the battery
so we'll try not to crash into anything
again any more questions until we have a
new Wi-Fi connection yeah yeah what it
does it's when it's boots up it will
start up a Wi-Fi network network Wi-Fi
network with a certain idea air drone
and then you can just connect your
laptop to the Wi-Fi network and then you
it has two channels one is for video and
one is for navigation three channels and
one is for sending commands and for
sending commands it's using UDP protocol
and you can just send very low level
commands and it has to do it every I
think every 20 milliseconds and then it
will check and how long it didn't see
receive a command and when it didn't
receive a command for like a second or
two seconds it will shut down because
then you're either out of Wi-Fi
connection or maybe the battery of your
phone or your laptop diet you can't
control it anymore it is oh here we go
again
it's actually quite hard to control
inside because of the turbulence and the
air conditioning is also pumping air
into the to the area but she's doing a
pretty good job I'm really pregnant you
can see all the controls responding back
to the present day yeah I think that's a
good idea you can feel it really feel
the air conditioning it's it's so light
you can feel every if you say then you
don't feel it's really weird it's
different like then then a car with a
remote control it flies relatively to
the aerosol if you have a look here
what's the land is land and takeoff of
those two buttons this in commands this
somehow have a sequence for landing
yeah learning and the question is if the
buttons on a lower left for landing take
off and land if they send up a sequence
of commands yeah thats its also a
instruction you can send to the drum and
we both have it bound to the buttons as
well as to the keyboard so you can use
the keyboard to take off and land and
you want only thing you have to do is
send the command and then it will it
will do the his magic what we'll do if
you take off it will go and try to who
for a stable at one meter not a
questionable
yeah that's what what we are doing as
well oh yes sorry I really have to
repeat the question how accessible is
the platform well what we are doing is
we are creating a top set up box like on
the TV and so we put the gps navigation
it's a raspberry pi so and you can
attach any sense where you want to the
Raspberry Pi and then collect the data
on the on the pie and then send it back
the drone itself is not on the Raspberry
Pi they use their own hardware and well
maybe if we take this further and then
we probably will be in contact with the
manufacturer and then we will ask if
they can make it on the pie as well
because that would be ideal to have the
the GPS directly on the main board of
the of the parrot of the drum because
that will save a lot of power and then
we can also plug in infrared sensors and
then we have even more possibilities of
providing extra data the other question
is always our sensitivities
yeah how our extensive is the API well
basically any any maneuver you can make
you could we can control and there's
luckily there was a student thinking in
Japan and he was so kind to create a
library to for java to control the drum
so it contains all the low-level
instructions and they have an API
documentation with all the low-level
instructions you can send to it but it
is a lot of work to implement and nevis
attitude and some students have a lot of
time apparently he created this for us
and what we did is we build on top of
that and we created a new layer of
commands and then on top of that we
created the GUI so this is basically
what we did so in the right you see the
our air drum 4 p-5 that's the library
created by student is able to connect to
the parrots are a drone 2 dot 0 with
this is the one we have to the version
before it's a 1 dot 0 and I think also
to another one but I'm not sure about
this but it it works for our drum and
this library is responsible for sending
all the low-level commands to the drum
and we will take a look detail more
detailed look like and keen one
I McCune and what we did is we created a
drone controller which reps this library
and make the API a bit nice and because
we were of course we are programs so we
are never satisfied with someone else's
work or rarely so we created a layer on
top of it also to create some
instruction and then we inject a binding
and keyboard binding in our case but you
can also easily use another device in
this creature your own binding and then
F xml controller which connects the user
interface to the drone control and so
you can visualize all the all the data
coming from the drone and sending
instructions back so this is how we
initialize it this is our drone
controller we take off all the offense
coming from the from the javafx
application and we initially applied the
keyboard binding and then we set it down
control and this is how we connect to
the library itself the are a drone class
is coming from the library we are using
so you connect to a local network it
always uses the same address so it's
very nice to just leave it in like this
it never changes so it's very useful
then we connect to the to the drum we
connect the navigation and the video
streams then we started and what we do
is we don't start the drone itself that
we start the connection with the drum
and then we execute the reset command
because if it's flew into a tree and it
crashed down on the floor and you
reconnect the batteries is still in a in
an error state so we need to reset and
the interesting and this is actually a
part of the library so this is the the
code I was luckily not have to write and
test as you can see is all very low
level commands and it just opens the
sockets
to the very low level data circuit to
the to the drum and send all these
commands so this is the one for
initializing and every every thing you
can do with the drum that just took the
API documentation and filled in all the
commands and tested it for us we are
really thankful for this and this is the
wrapper we created so we wanted to have
some easy way to bind for example the
keyboard to the drum so we for backwards
we created a function and then we can do
backward on the drone itself and this
this is for only four simple
instructions which you can imagine that
you can now also provide more detailed
functions for example go up fly to the
left and then land again you can all do
this all in one function so we have we
can create some more complex function
with this this is the binding as you can
see it's one line of code / binding so
it's fairly easy this is the default
keyboard binding it uses the JavaFX
keyboard combinations so we bind enter
to take off escape to reset space to
length and so forth as you can see it's
very easy to apply binding also to
another controller so if you have a
gamepad and you connect it to your pc
you can also make bindings custom
bindings for your gamepad or maybe also
for your leap motion controller or the
movement controller from the from the
xbox you could also implement as well so
now we gps we have a drone and the drone
is not aware of its location it only
knows how high it is and that's it
that's about it so it does not know in
which direction is facing it does not
know if it's in Brazil or a United
States or in the Netherlands it doesn't
know anything it only reacts to
instructions so if you
go left it will go left regardless of
where you are and if you say a fly into
a tree it will fly in two or three so
but that's not what we need we need to
be able to use a user interface and say
well go to this field and make a round
gather all the data you need and fly
back so in order to be able to do this
we need to you need a drone to be able
to aware of its location and that's why
we need the gps Raspberry Pi is very
useful platform you can run java on it
so it's very accessible and you have a
whole range of things you can plug in to
a Raspberry Pi and one of them is a the
ultimate GPS break out as they call it
from Adafruit and it's very easy to plug
in and to get it running so this is our
first thing we need the gps will look if
you can putin anyone who doesn't who
knows how gps works nobody knows how GPS
GPS or or everybody yeah who doesn't
know how GPS works next everybody knows
it so there we go who doesn't know what
Arctic a GPS is so there are few so i
will explain this if you gps it will use
satellites to determine its location but
you can take a margin of 2 meters to the
left to me to the right so it's not very
precise so for the drone it's not really
that big of deal and a big deal but you
can imagine that the more advanced your
drone gets the more precise your signal
needs to be because you can of length 4
meters away from where you are supposed
to length so that's where rtk comes in
and this is a network of fixed locations
fixed GPS receivers all over and spread
all over the world and what it does they
of course are no
aware of their location so they know the
exact GPS coordinates they are on and
they will ask the satellites where am I
and they will say you are there but it's
not there it's here so it knows the
deviation of the GPS compared to the
location exact location of the antenna
and they can use this deviation as a
factor and send it to all the devices in
the area so what we can do we can add an
extra receiver to the Raspberry Pi with
a GSM chip and then we can make
connection with the rtk network and they
will send for my location from the
nearest antenna in the neighborhood
center correction signal so it will say
you have your gps furnace if you go two
meters to the left then you are really
where you are and now we have a signal
that can determine on two centimeters
exactly where you are so this is very
useful because one meter can be the
difference between a ditch and the field
so for tractors for example if they want
to drive in a straight line 24 meters is
quite a big deviation so this is why we
use our cocaine so GPS this is a piece
from the GPS device on the Raspberry Pi
and what it does it reads the signals
coming from the from the GPS on 10 and
it looks like this all the lines you see
here and as you can see it looks a bit
like a date and a time and that's also
what it is it's packaged in a date and a
time and it will send the signal every
few seconds you receive a new signal so
with all the signals you can for example
if you have five signals and you can all
plus all those signals on a map so you
know at every second what the new
precision is for the further drunk
if you compare two of the signals you
can extract a vector and the factor has
velocity and direction and also to speak
because you know the time it needed to
travel from one location to another
location and then you know the speed so
if we add another factor which is the
location we want to go to which is the
red X in the logo in the upper right
corner then you can adjust the current
speed and direction towards the X so if
there is cigna if you are at one and
you're moving to two then you're all
right you're moving in the right
direction but then a gush of wind comes
from the left and it blows you out of
the out of the way then you need to
adjust the direction to another course
so you can move it again to the to the X
because that's why you want to go in the
end so this is what what we used and we
are able to send to drown more or less
towards the location we want and that's
already a great result result for us
what are the challenges because we face
a lot of challenges because it's an
experiment so if everything goes right
in it's not really nice experiment maybe
win sensitivity if there's even a medium
a force of wind then you already are
almost not able to fly with this drum
because it's so so light you can maybe
you can pick it up and have a feel of
how out it's very very light and almost
late nothing and this has the advantage
that if you crash into a tree it can
shut down and just let itself fall into
the ground without any damage or not
guillemette spray how many window am I
talking about alright well now I have to
do some estimation I think above 20
kilometers is it's already problematic
to fly yeah so that that's not even a
really strong wind and we can adjust the
course if it's windy but if it's if it's
beyond the 40 50 kilometers now and then
it's really not doable to fly we can fly
in the rain we tested it by accident it
was really nice weather and we were
flying outside in the middle of a field
so it was like 500 meters to watch new
york 3 and then it started pouring down
we were flying well it survived so it
can get some conservative right the 30
minutes of flying time but it's probably
not enough especially if you have a big
farm and you want to place all the
drones in the center of your farm maybe
create a big Tower and put all the drums
in the tower you can imagine some
picture and I think with this if it
takes 10 minutes to fly to your field
you only have 10 minutes left to fly
actually on the field so this is this is
a problem unless we create some
automated drones stations next to the
fields where they are which is a
possibility of course and if we add the
autopilot and the battery goes down
really really quickly yes
largely how do you image well the
question is if you have a fairly large
field how do you cover the field if you
have to create a proper image but we
already in anger since we already have
an algorithm to determine the proper
path for tractors to drive around and we
just just use the same so we we have a
certain altitude and the higher you fly
the less precise the data will be within
largely the area you coffin so if it's a
very very big field and we need to fly
it within 10 minutes we just choose a
higher altitude to fly off and then you
can make that you just fly to the one
edge and then turn around and fly back
create a zigzag pattern like this the
connection is for Fei Wi-Fi which is not
very efficient especially if you use the
autopilot then well you're already only
device or why would you use Wi-Fi and
Wi-Fi takes quite a lot of energy so it
would for us it would be better to have
the Raspberry Pi inside of the end of
the drone doing the instructions as well
but maybe if we have a successful
experiment we can talk to the
manufacturer to create a special drawn
for us and we can show it next year I'm
going to write
just normal Wi-Fi network and I think
well it's not very big I think it can
reach the end of the room and then
probably in practice it will probably
die yeah we can try although the
question was what's the range so from
here to the end of the room would it be
possible for to use cell phone network
well there are already experiments going
on to use a remote control they also
also used for the for the toy planes and
there are some people who built a
receiver I don't know what's the network
called they use the signal it sits on
some high level frequency signal they
use to control airplanes and they build
it on top of the ayah and the parrot and
with that you can increase the range
very very greatly so we could we could
use something like this as well to
extend the range but if we if you want
to let it fly on a song then we don't
need any range because it can fly
wherever he wants as long as it returns
when it's flying on its own is record
the video yes you can plug in and USB
stick so it depends on your USB stick
grenades and
program can fly according to
the question is are you planning to use
the lens the field coordinates of the
farm yes that's exactly what we want to
do that the farmer can just click a few
say well I want to gather data for this
field and if the drone will just use the
coordinates of the field which are
already in our financial system to fly
to that corner yes so connection fire
Wi-Fi base station would be a
possibility so maybe we could create
some base station and spread all over
the farm and it can fly departing from
the base station in return and recharge
for example and then we can just create
a wired connection to the base station
or maybe fire a directed wife I'm within
the laser direction outer charts will be
on the base station and another
experiment we were doing is to align the
flight with the tracker so we headed
land on top of a tractor on the roof and
fly and while detective was driving to
try to land again on the tractor news it
was quite a challenge here maybe you can
show no no no we didn't dare to use it
on autopilot no because it was would be
very hard to predict whether a tractor
was moving anyway I forgot oh yeah
this is the drone on top of the tractor
and it will fly away and crash into a
tree it was just an experiment as you
can see it does not contain the the
other health so it was quite a lot of an
hour ago and they seized oh oh it's
still like still in here no very good
and not anymore another's dead yeah this
was the same day that when it started to
rain if you look up you see some very
nasty looking clouds over there in
general it was sooner was nice day so
this is our these are some URLs that are
relevant of course the eager since
project it's the source code from the
library we used and we will publish the
code for the drone GUI as well so if you
buy your own drone you can use our
software to to fly and the Adafruit
ultimate GPS on raspberry breakout
introduction learning web site any any
more questions or remarks yes
yeah the question is if you considered
using gas power yes but they are x
factor then at least more expensive than
these ones and we are not very we are a
start-up so we have to be careful how
much money you spend
did you have any issues with privacy we
did not hear any cows complain in
general we are flying above private land
because one of my colleagues she's a
farmer and we just use her length to the
flyover and this this will be practice
at least for us the farmer will just fly
off their own lens and I if it does need
to cross a house or something else then
I don't think it will be a big problem
there are no loss yet at least in the
Netherlands there are no no loss to
prohibit this and I think in the United
States nine what is your desired outcome
of this trial project I mean it's
probably not practical to take this AR
Drone to to the market solution
your platform how do you pull your
experiment services yeah what's the
desired outcome of our experiments well
it's it's it's a new ground so we are
not sure what to expect but we want to
explore it because we see an improved
use of and precision agriculture we see
the farmers moving back to the farms and
we need to solve some problems for them
we need to provide them with more
information and this is one possible
possibility and maybe it if it can fail
and it can prove to not to be viable to
use drones for this but the successful
outcome for this is that we are able to
automate the process of the drone in to
gather data whatever it might be and if
you gather all the data and let it fly
back again then it would be a success
and then maybe it's not really high
quality data but then we have something
to build on top on and if we have
problems with the range of the drone
Demi and we have some clients interested
in it then we can buy a bigger drum and
improve from there so this is the first
step yeah sets satisfy our
then somewhere new
the question is what do you do if your
drunk gets struck by lightning and it's
flying on autopilot or on some other
reason it will fall down and this will
happen and we will lose drums because
the problem is that we don't have a we
don't have an idea of very drawn is
because the only one who knows where it
is is there on itself but because we
have the rtk we can create a stress
signal emergency signal by sending an
SMS and with the late last known
coordinates so it would be something
like a black box for a plane this is
possible to do yeah yeah yeahs second or
a cow yeah yeah we could send the wrong
crowd yeah yeah it's our security
connection between the client and run
it's probably not very secure that but
what it does it only allows one
connection so you have to be first then
you're probably able to let it fly yes
but we try to what do we hang for in the
future is to get rid of the Wi-Fi
because we don't need it basically it's
nice to do let us fly in the air for
photo reasons but we need GPS and we
need to autopilot I hope we can get rid
of the Wi-Fi there for the security
issues
there's GPS module came up for this art
rock concert using this one
zero
yeah the question is recently be there
was a GPS module for this drum well the
GPS module released for this drum we
considered using it but it was too soon
before Java want to really get it
working the problem with only death GPS
module is that you still need a Wi-Fi
connection so the only thing it does is
that you can say well return to base and
then it will return to the place then it
length and it will track the flight but
in the Delft University technical
university adult they created an
autopilot based on this hardware
together with the GPS add on and which
is able to fly to a point that you
indicated somewhere outside of the Wi-Fi
range so we will definitely get in touch
with them because well it's the other
side of the country but in u.s.
perspective it's very close so we will
definitely get in touch with them and
see what's possible and because it will
it will save us doing things on their
own yeah
the question is you're probably not the
only one doing this stuff yeah but if
you call Google then they'd probably say
well you're too small for us you're not
talking to you and in agriculture I
think we are pretty much the only one
because it's very conservative markets
and even if they are doing it they're
not really eager on cooperating with us
but I don't think especially in
agriculture there I don't think there
are any other companies doing this but
if there are any companies and we find
them then we will get infection and ask
if they want to cooperate or not we are
always open we publish this an open
source and we I think it's for
innovation it is important to
collaborate and work together and then
you can accelerate the innovation I'd we
don't believe in patterns or in in
keeping everything on your own and doing
everything only you can only afford to
do this if you're very big company and
we aren't we always seek collaboration
with all the company anyone else
the river how many how much time you saw
it like five minutes shall I fly it
again yeah yeah yes I think yeah because
of the wings we can go to put it in the
middle
go ask the difficult expressions
now the question is if you change the
model which you have to contact yeah and
the Japanese guy yeah if it's good
program we will probably hire him we
have a lot of colleagues in the in
different countries so we're a small
company but we live everywhere it's
really cool
smile
as you see the battery is already half
empty that's how fast it goes
that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
