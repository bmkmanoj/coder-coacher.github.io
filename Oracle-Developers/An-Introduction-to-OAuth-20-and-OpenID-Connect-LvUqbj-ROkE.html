right okay let's get started
right so graphing everyone we're kind of
at the halfway point that open world so
we are pleasantly surprised to see this
level of engagement and and we hope we
can make it a informated an educational
session my name is Sanjay Radha Pali I'm
a product manager for my ITT cloud
service we're not going to talk about
identity cloud service a lot just
towards the end you might talk about
some of the innovative stuff that we are
doing in identity cloud service but you
know that's it's I will give it to a
minimum and then with me I have Kiran
Tucker he is part of the Oracle a team
so this is a SWAT team of top
technologists in Oracle they they help
customers in everything from technology
adoption implementation of SAS and fast
and so on so they are the all-round
experts so I'm the song-and-dance he's
the brains of the outfit that's that's
the way we're gonna do this just so
we're here to kind of a quick
introduction to what Roth and open IT
Connect is and and why you should be
using it and what we in in Oracle or at
least an identity cloud service what are
we doing about it right what are we
doing differently if you will I will be
saying some things that are upcoming or
that are in the roadmap either for this
year or next so that's my you know don't
believe anything a PM says slide right
we're not going to talk about the spec
so if there are folks who really love
reading the ITF specs and RFC's you know
I'm afraid you're going to be a little
bit disappointed so the first thing is
you know why why
talk about what in the first place right
so what what was life in the Dark Ages
or before life before what right you're
building an app you need access to some
resources you need access to some
information whether it is you're logging
into Google and you want to access
Flickr and how many remember Flickr it
was way out there image sharing I guess
I'm showing my age here we're talking
about Flickr but you need access to to
the users information the photographs
there and how do you do it
you ask the user for this password right
I don't know if you ever go back into
the Wayback Machine and take a look at
Yelp back in the day the way you kind of
shared your contact shows you actually
gave your username and password for your
MSN or hotmail and so on right
the the problem that people were trying
to solve is how does a user give you
access to some information how do you
delegate that access without kind of
sharing the credentials right and I
think you know Google Yahoo Flickr each
one of them they had their own kind of
proprietary protocol and and you could
say you know what's wrong with that why
why think of doing anything different
what what changed was what we call as
the API economy right when I kind of go
when I go out of this session hopefully
that all my limbs intact know one thing
that I'm going to do is I'm gonna be
ordering some food so how am I gonna do
it I'm going to go on Yelp
look for the closest kind of restaurant
of my choice I'm going to find that it's
probably going to take me to stop hub
but it's going to take me to order ahead
or any one of these
services so what what is happening here
right you have a application that in
turn is calling several others right
where you're sharing information and how
did this happen well when I try to
access the app it's going to ask me are
you sure you want to share the location
are you sure you want to share your
personal information and so on and
that's really what is happening in this
API economy right no one is building
monolithic siloed apps you're building
apps that your end-users are going to
use across devices and they are going
and you are typically going to talk to
other api's whether it is you know
location mapping so you're probably
going to use Google Maps API you're
probably going to use square for
payments you're probably going to use
some other service to do you know some
other business function so really you
this is kind of the age of you building
apps using api's and it's never one
company's API as a set of API is so the
the problem that you have to solve here
is how do how does the end user give
that permission give that access or the
permission to access that information
without having to share their
credentials all over the place right
that's where you you that's where kind
of what fits the bill it's not an
authentication framework right that's
the first thing that we we cannot want
to get out of the way
authentication does happen because the
user has to some somehow say I am Who I
am but the main goal of auth is to
delegate access right how do I give one
application permission to access
resources that are being held by someone
else right that is really the core goal
of the OAuth framework what is the
benefit well when you write an app you
no longer have to worry about how do I
manage this users password how do I say
otherwise where do I save it how do I
securely save it
you don't really have to worry about it
because it's it's someone else's problem
so you're kind of delegating the
authentication aspect you're just
focusing on access on delegating access
right
how do kind of explain this and this is
the way I like to understand or this is
the way I like to keep the various
actors in the flow and mind write the
key card my end goal is a nice is my
hotel suite and and the minibar right so
what did I do when I came in earlier
this week I stepped up to the front desk
I identified myself I gave my you know
showed my driver's license and so on so
there was a form of authentication the
check in person you know she looked at
it verified I was who I said I was
pulled up my reservation gave me a hotel
room right she the the check-in person
was was kind of acting like a gateway or
an authorization I had to get through
her to get to my room you get a key card
that key card doesn't mean I can go
anywhere I want right it is coded to a
particular hotel room I go there and now
again depending upon my reservation
depending upon you know the points I
have there are a set of capabilities
that I can access right I can you know
access some movies movies on the TV or I
can you know order Wi-Fi or I can
basically order food or raid the minibar
and so on
right a set of capabilities are
available to me that's kind of the way
that's the that's the kind of an easy
way of looking at what is it that Roth
is trying to do it's not trying to
authenticate you is delegating that or
someone else its focus is to give you
that keycard that's the all this
explanation is to get that key card
right that using that key card you can
go access certain capabilities that are
exposed in
some resource in some API in some
application and kind of this is you know
looking at it more how the protocol
flows
I am the resource owner I am the user
right
I hold the credentials there are some
resources that I have control over and
and there is an application that
application needs to access that those
API are those resources within those
resources you can have what we call a
scopes or another way of thinking of
them is permissions for example reading
someone's profile accessing an image you
know accessing the premium channels on
on the TV all of these are our
permissions and basically I give my
consent to the application so that it
can access those resources and there is
somewhere in this mix there is an
authorization server that authorization
server may or may not do authentication
so again part of the this whole the song
and dance about OAuth is how do you
become a la gente que ssin and
authorization right so that completely
someone else can manage the credentials
and the job of the authorization server
is twofold one is to verify that the
resource owner or the user is who they
say they are to give an access token
which allows the application to access
the api's and then of course validate
that token as well so that someone
doesn't try to replay an old token or or
perform some malicious activity
so looking kind of into a little bit
more detail into each of these actors in
a typical odd flow
first and foremost both is all about the
clients right your mobile app that you
use to order a cab to order you know
uber or lyft or the cab of your choice
that's the client that client is going
to be invoking api's or accessing
resources either on behalf of itself or
on behalf of the user and a client has
to be registered right so the the first
step in this whole kind of auth flow is
to define this client register the
client and when you do that you specify
a couple of things what type of a client
is it is it public client or is it a
confidential client so what does this
mean public versus confidential a key
you know you need some way to think of
username and password right so the
equivalent of username and password for
a client as what is called as a client
ID and a client secret and whether a
client is confidential or public depends
upon you know can it maintain or can it
protect that client secret JavaScript
applications single page apps which are
mobile apps which cannot be you know
they cannot guarantee that they will
protect the client secret they are
called as public clients whereas
server-side applications so you write an
app running in WebLogic you write an app
running or nodejs a server-side
application there they can be relied
upon to maintain the confidentiality of
that client secret they are called as
confidential clients scopes right the
goal of this client or the aim of this
client is to access certain api's right
I want to know where the cabs or where
the rides are in in around Moscone so
I'm gonna use uber API I'm gonna use
maps api I'm going to map the rides to
the map right I'm going to be accessing
certain api's these api is typically
have capabilities or permissions list
rides
you know locations or so these are
called as scopes another way of looking
at this is think of a bookstore write
lists books buy a book or place an order
or cancel an order
each of these are actions your app or
your client is trying to perform these
actions so the other scopes you as an
end user you have control over granting
or denying access to those scopes so we
we've kind of seen this screen many
times right when we try to sign up using
our social credentials there's a little
dialogue that pops up saying you know do
you want to share your contacts you want
to share your life history with you know
whoever this this what you see each of
these scopes are these permissions they
are the capabilities that the app is
going to use right when I sign up for
Pinterest or when I sign up for reddit
if I'm going to use my Google
credentials it's going to want to know
my first name my email address maybe my
phone number is if you know it might
even want to know my my social
connections depending upon if I'm using
Facebook or Google all these are scopes
that the app that I'm trying to use is
going to try and access I have the right
to say yes or no and again it depends on
the application whether it wants to
continue with you know partial consent
or if it want to just cancel out and say
start all over again
once you give your consent the
authorization servers going to give you
an access token this access token
contains the permissions that you have
consented to or or that the application
has requested for and there are two
types of access tokens and we'll go into
kind of more details on when which is
applicable but there are two types of
access tokens that you were typically be
concerned with in an or flow the first
one is the access token itself this
access token commonly is in a jot format
JSON web token format and the second is
what scholars are refreshed open access
tokens are short-lived meaning they have
a short expiration time you you
obviously don't want to have an access
token a long-running access token with a
long expiration time because that's a
security hazard the the app can keep
using it forever so typically you will
have short-lived access tokens now
sometimes there is a need for the
application to perform actions in the
background and and that's where you have
something called as a refresh token so
when the access token expires and again
it's the job of the app to keep track of
that it uses the Refresh token to go and
fetch a new one right so if you have a
job submission or a scheduling app you
put you submit a job it uses the access
token but then it needs to go and check
for the status it's not going to keep
using that access token and it's going
to use that afresh token to get a new
one make additional API calls again with
access tokens you you depending upon
whether you are using a confidential app
or whether you're using
a public app it that's where you you
basically keep track over the user
refresh token or not
in case of a public app there is no
refresh token again because you can't
maintain the confidentiality access
tokens can be opaque our access tokens
can be self-contained when access tokens
are self-contained they have all the
information they need or the app needs
to validate whereas if it's an opaque
token then there is a specific end point
and the authorization server where you
will go and validate the the token
validity so what is the role of the
authorization server in in all of this
right we looked at an application app or
a client this client basically asked you
to authenticate and you gave your
permission to a set of scopes now now
what what what happens next in this in
this whole cycle the job of the
authorization server is to validate that
you are who you say you are look at
whether you've granted access you've
consented to the Scopes and then it's
job is to manufacture an access token or
a refresh token depending upon the flow
and give that to the to the requesting
client and so kind of what we there are
really five endpoints that play a role
in in this whole flow right the first
one is the authorized endpoint so the
client is going to call the authorized
endpoint and we'll kind of go into
we're the authorized endpoint is is used
and where the token endpoint is used but
the client calls the authorized endpoint
it will typically get what is called as
an authorization code think of it like a
proof that I have you know authenticated
the user have validate the user it then
takes that code and gives it to the
token endpoint the job the token
endpoint is to issue an access token or
it can issue a Refresh token when you so
you know when you need to validate the
access token and the resource server can
do it even the client can do it you call
what is called as the introspect
endpoint and the job of this endpoint is
to return a response which says you know
whether this token is valid what is the
expiration and so on now I've mentioned
another kind of an endpoint that's
that's not typical which is device code
and we'll come to this when we talk
about apps which don't have access to a
browser right I'm sure most of you use
Netflix when you sign up for Netflix
when you go to your TV or your even your
ps4 and you go to activate it what does
it tell you you know go to this
particular URL enter a pin and the
activation continues right so the device
code flow that's that's an endpoint that
you would use if you are talking about
working with apps are devices which
don't have access to a browser so
typically device code or the device code
endpoint doesn't play a role in getting
an access token but it is of interest if
you're building apps that run on you
know TVs or that run on ps4 or other
devices where there is no browser
so given that you have public apps and
which run in the browser and you have
confidential apps or server apps what
are the different ways that you can get
an access token oh it has six different
flows and and which determine what type
of token you will get and been and so
why you know why do you need to worry
about this well a lot of this has to do
with what kind of application you are
developing if you are using you know
Oracle jet or you're using knockout or
jQuery you're building a an app that
runs in the browser doesn't run on the
server then you're building a public app
and that's where you need to kind of
keep the implicit what is called as the
implicit flow in mind right primarily
this is used where the confidentiality
of the client secret cannot be
guaranteed the whole auth flow here
takes place through a browser redirects
so you are going to see the client ID
you're going to see the access token you
know in the URL and basically that's why
it's considered an insecure flow and
this is where you will not get a refresh
token right the authorization code by
far is the most commonly used flow when
you're building server side apps right
and typically what happens here is the
app or the client will first redirect
you for authentication
once authentication is done it kind of
contacts the authorization server with
the proof of authentication to get a
code and then it takes that cold and the
browser submits it to the token endpoint
to get an access token this is where the
client can
specify what scopes it is interested in
for example if you are talking to the
Gmail API and you want a set of
capabilities or you want a set of scopes
from the Gmail API so that you can build
your own you know email application this
is where you might say that I need a
refresh token so that when the user is
not in front of his computer I can
refresh the Inbox right I can be doing a
background refresh
I need a refresh token for that
basically in this so refresh token is
optional so the the app may say that I
need a refresh token I can specify an
offline scope I can specify that a fresh
token and I get a refresh token which I
can use to then you know refresh the
users inbox you also can build
server-side applications where you have
two services talking to each other
and this is where you have what is
called as the client credentials in this
flow it's a headless flow there is no
browser interaction there is no user
agent present and the the service or the
app can either assert or can say you
know it has a shared secret so maybe
between two services there is a mutually
agreed-upon shared feel that they can
use or there are other shared
credentials that it can use or it is
talking to itself right it is it is
basically you can have a situation where
an app is both a client as well as a
resource server you can use the client
credentials flow to to get an access
token resource owner password is really
for legacy applications right it's it's
used when you're doing desktop apps when
you're doing mobile apps it
it's supported primarily for legacy
reasons backward compatibility reasons
it's not something that we would
recommend people use but you know you
have desktop apps that needed in this
case and the reason it's not encouraged
is because it directly deals with the
users password so when you make a a
token call using the resource owner
password flow you're actually going to
take the users credentials and you're
going to submit it to the authorized
endpoint and so it is considered
insecure you don't want the app to be
dealing with credential collection right
and and so basically we wouldn't
recommend that people use this now you
can have you know when you're building
apps your users will not always come to
you with credentials they will not
authenticate with you right they might
have authenticated elsewhere for example
your company has a sam'l identity
provider or maybe you're using Kerberos
or maybe you're using some form of PKI
authentication has occurred elsewhere
and you your end user is accessing the
app they come with an assertion or they
come with some token that the app can
use to into basically exchange for an
access token and that's the assertion
flow so in this scenario which is
commonly Federation is a common use case
you you kind of federate using a sam'l
identity provider you come with the
sam'l assertion the expectation is your
app can take that sam'l assertion and
exchange it for an access token the last
one and and yes in this flow there is no
no refresh token so again again the
theme that you're seeing here is flows
in which you cannot maintain the
confidentiality of the client secret or
where a lot of the communication is
happening through redirects and so
sensitive information can be exposed you
don't want to do a refresh token the
last the device code flow that's what I
said is when you're building apps for
devices that don't have access to a
browser so it could be a command-line
tool that you're building it could be
something that runs in a TV or runs in
some other device you know it could be
like your nest a smart device there is
no browser there but you need to
authenticate you need to interact with
it the way you would do it is the device
code flow what happens in the device
code flow is the app will give you a URL
you will go offline
maybe you'll use your computer or your
phone you will go to that URL enter the
pin and all the while the client or the
app is pulling the authorization server
to see if a pin was entered and the flow
was completed and when that happens the
client gets an access token and the
request is completed so before we go
into open ID connect the whole goal of
auth just as a refresher was talking
about delegation of access right there
is no mention of user anywhere in this
flow there's no mention of you know what
others users attribute so what is you
know what is their favorite movie or or
what you know any of this there is no
user information and and this is by
design the goal of authors purely to
deal with authorization so there has to
be some way in which applications can
get access to user information that a
source owners information enter open ID
Connect
so open ID Connect is a layer that's
built on top of OAuth so many of the
flows when you when you look at the API
calls when you look at the interaction
it's often easy to say well this just
looks exactly like Oh which is true it
is it is it is built on the OAuth
protocol or framework what Open ID
Connect does in addition to supporting
the OAuth flows is to give something
called as an ID token right this is a
sign token and this token contains user
information obtained through a standard
endpoint
called as the user info endpoint in
addition to that it provides certain
other useful capabilities for example
custom claims so imagine you are
building an application where you want
to control what capabilities the user
can has access to and you want to show
those capabilities keeping the users
preferences in mind you need two things
you need access to the Scopes
you need access to the user information
right if you were to simply do this
using auth you would not have access to
user information you'd have to make
additional API calls and that's where
the value of open ID can it comes in the
ID token can give you the user
information and not only that you can
add additional information that your
application or your applications can use
without having to go back to the server
so what does that flow look like well
like I said it's very similar to to the
OAuth flows you primarily have an
implicit flow a basic so when your
application makes a request for a token
it has a choice it can do ID token it
can do access token or it can say I want
both ID token and an access token you
have used this flow a lot like I said
any time you access the popular apps on
the Internet
you login using your social credentials
that's your kind of doing the open ID
connect flow there let's take a look at
how some of these calls look like right
so what I did is I'm using Facebook as
an example and and you can see here that
when when your app wants to authenticate
a user using Facebook you're going to
make a Roth call unauthorized call to
Facebook and when you do that you can
specify two things right you can specify
that what scopes you want you can
specify where you want the user to be
redirected once they have finished the
authentication flow successfully and
then you can also specify you know which
token you want once you get the token of
course you can validate it you can kind
of add that at the introspection
endpoint you can also exchange the odd Z
code for an access token and so on three
different flows again this depends which
flow you use depends upon the type of
application that you are developing if
your application is going to make use of
user information and of course it's
going to do access delegation you
probably want both the ID and the access
token all the time on the other hand if
all you're trying to do is authenticate
the user and you don't know how to do
anything else just use the access token
or if you're just going to use the
authentication then use the user
information just use the ID token right
it's really you have the choice of which
one do you want to use when should you
use OAuth versus open ID connect well
each of these protocols have their own
role to play right when you are building
an app you want to delegate
authentication
use open I reconnect when you're
building an app and you want to then
delegate access when you want to control
what API is or what scopes the
application can access that's where you
would use auth now they are kind of
interchangeable to some extent primarily
because open edit Connect is developed
on the OAuth protocol so the flows are
going to be the same right you're going
to find yourself using the same set of
authorized and token flows
I'm going to stop here and we'll do a
live demo of some of the concepts that
that we've spoken about both using open
ID can I can orthe kitten sure so just
to quickly talk about what do we have in
the demo is identity cloud service
that's running in Oracle public cloud
and we have Apache angularjs application
running on one of the compute nodes it
is running on Oracle cloud
infrastructure or bare metal cloud
service if you guys have heard of it and
we also have no J's application again
running on a computer on OCI Oracle
cloud infrastructure
they both implement open ID connect flow
with with ID CS and the angularjs or
angularjs application that we have build
a single page application what it does
is once user is authenticated and once
it has ID token
once it's done with Open ID connect flow
with IDPs it exchanges that ID token for
an access token and once it has access
token it invokes some of the REST API
that it needs to access to get some more
user information from other resource
servers that hold that information
and for some of my existing customers
you know we don't want to forget them
they have that on 10 web access
management stack and they would think
okay I want to run my node.js or
angularjs application on any cloud
doesn't matter right and wanted to open
ID connect flow with Heidi fears but
what about users my users exist on Tam
in some anger so for those customers you
know some additional details
IDC s can synchronize users from your on
cam active directly and it can do
Federation flow with your on time and
solution so when when your Apache or
node.js application when it redirects
user to IDC s with open ID connect flow
IDC s can in turn redirect user to your
on-prem vamp solution doing Federation
so that you know you don't have to worry
about migrating users credentials from
where they are today to IDC s but that's
not power of the demo that's not you
know what we want to see right now we
will see open any connect and OAuth flow
so this is a patch a single page
application and by the way we are using
you know what I ran into the same issue
in my other session too so let me what
I'm doing is I'm hitting my single page
application that is as you can see a
patch instance start B MCS for example
calm slice single page I hit that URL
it's doing open ID connect slow with ID
CS so I'm redirected to IDC F login page
I will log in here and it shows me who I
am it has the ID token from IDC s now
what it does is it exchanges ID token
for an OAuth token from IDC s and
invokes some of the rest API and what
I had to do projector only mode for this
to work I have to look there and do this
so when I do this personal information
as you can see it's invoking me endpoint
on IDC s and you guys I'm sure are aware
of code so it first as options and then
get calls and when it does and if you
can see the URL it's IDC s blah blah
blah dot identity that a little cloud
that come admins even me so it wants to
get information about the users based on
the auth token that it card and this is
the token that it sends in the HTTP
request and IDC s can validate that or
token because of course it was generated
by IDC s but there is one other URL here
it says work information what this is
doing is my work information is running
somewhere else it's it's it's an API
endpoint that returns some JSON data so
I'm invoking that API here Apache
instance where BMC s
banking services rest account
information and when I make that call
I'm sending more token that I received
from IDC s and this resource server the
banking information or account
information so endpoint is defined as a
resource server in my IDC s and this
client request for account information
scope while asking for X or token and it
can then use that or token to request
those api's
oh yes
okay so I'm logged into my computer on
OCI Oracle cloud infrastructure and we
want to look at code of single-phase
application
I do need some air
so if you guys are aware of angularjs
you have app tortillas so this is my my
information tab that we saw in the
application I'm invoking this URL here
and I'm passing this access token and in
the work information tab as you can see
I'm invoking account information
endpoint with the token and we decided
to add one more demo of last moment
there's no J's SDK demo it is using a
IDC module that we have published
this is publicly available you can you
can use this you can use this module to
do open ID connect flow with IDPs from
within your node.js application and it
uses passport module if you guys are
aware of passport you know you define
your authentication strategies so what
we have done is we have created open ID
connect and with ID CSS one of the
strategy in passport module and we have
published that that you can use to do
open I reconnected Tiresias and when i
click this it initiates open ID connects
Louis Odysseus and gets the user
information from ID token
it's not yes by the time I open this any
questions yes
sorry house an authorization taken care
factorization is tile still done on the
resource server side resource server
validates your or token can you go to
JWT that I own and show the Bennett oh
yes exactly so what you're going to do
is we'll take the the bearer token and
go to GWT dot IO and show you that so
some of the things that that you will
have are the Scopes you will have the
issuer when was an issue the expiration
time you may have additional things like
authentication context reference heart
disease or attending a you may even have
custom claims which are nothing but sets
of custom information that you want to
pass on and that's what we're going to
show you is we copied that and GWT that
I yeah
okay
yeah
yep pasta and since that is me scope
here I was able to invoke me end point
or 90s Oh tamper-proof tokens are sign
yes there are additional capabilities
that we didn't cover like pixie BTC and
so on but the primary way is no JWT
tokens are not on paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
