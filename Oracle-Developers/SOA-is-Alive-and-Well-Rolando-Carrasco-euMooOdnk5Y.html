Lounge here at the corner of Oracle
OpenWorld Avenue and JavaOne Street, I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle Developer Community,
and my guest for this segment
is Oracle Ace Rolando Carrasco.
Welcome, Rolando!
Hey, Bob, how are you doing?
I'm doing good. How are you doing?
Great! Enjoying the event.
You're a busy boy here at OpenWorld.
You have, let's see, I think you've got two sessions...
Yes, I had one last Sunday and one today.
So talk a little bit about those sessions.
Yeah, the one on Sunday was with my colleague Leonardo Gonzalez.
The session was about why SOA is more than alive.
We've been reading, hearing, and watching videos about why SOA is dead.
And we're not aligned with that message.
I feel that during the last maybe 18 to 24  months
there have been different ways, in my opinion, to build software.
One of those, for example, is microservices.
And people started to say, &quot;Hey, let's not use a service bus anymore,&quot;
&quot;And the SOA idea is an old one.&quot;
So I just thought that it was a good idea to highlight why that is not accurate,
and why SOA is more alive than ever,
and why it is going to be useful for you even if
you have actually decided to go into the
micro services architecture.
So that was on Sunday, and today, Wenesday, we  that was
on Sunday and today, Wednesday,  we are on at 4:30 at the Marriott Marquis,
at 44:33 4:30 p.m. at the Marriott
delivering a session about cloud native development...
OK.
...which is also something that we want to...
not to clarify because we are not the ones who need to clarify things...
but we we are the ones who want to give to the
audience a good way to understand things.
Because also, again, for cloud native development,
we feel that there is a lot of noise around it.
People trying to do it, but at the same time,
people doing it in the wrong way,
or people doing it without clearly understanding what cloud native is all about.
Let's explore that a little bit.
What are people doing wrong?
Correct! For example, let's go into to a real scenario.
So we have a need of an application which is a monolithic application.
We want to divide that monolithic application
into different services to make it flexible.
And then we decide just to do a new data model, for example.
And then then we decide to create REST interfaces
on top of every single table of that new data model
and expose it as a REST interface.
People will call that microservices.
And because of the interface, because I am deploying it on a cloud,
then I am thinking that, first of all,
it is a microservice, and secondly, it is cloud native.
And that is wrong because the only thing you are doing
is exposing a rest interface, and that's it.
But that but doesn't make it a microservice in any world.
Let's say it that way.
And secondly, you are using the cloud, yes, absolutely.
But what you are doing is just basically exposing something as a rest interface.
That is also not a cloud native development.
Which is exactly what we are going to do during our session at 4:30.
OK.
Those are the type of things.
And because of my experience and the way I do constantly with customers
and projects and so on, those type of topics are the ones that I really enjoy to
discuss with the architects and have this type of conversation about,
&quot;Hey, why are you telling people that that is a microservice?'
Or &quot;Why do you think that that is a good way to architect a solution?&quot;
It is great. That's something that I've been
including
in presentations that I usually do in Mexico and other countries.
I include a set of slides that talk about this era of IT,
which in my opinion is one of the most important ones.
It is an era where the developer has a lot of relevance in our daily activities.
Whatever we do it is related with technology.
It is related with maybe a few lines of code.
But there was someone who coded that.
Right.
So everything we do is related with that.
And I feel that it in this very important era of IT
we need to be very clear on how we architect things.
So I always include those type of messages in my in my presentations.
And I feel it was a good idea to present those topics
because in such a way they are related.
In the first one, with SOA,
SOA might sound like an old term,
because we were talking about SOA... I don't know.
It was like, maybe at the beginning of the 2000s.
Now we are here in 2017, so obviously we've been
talking about SOA for a long time.
Oracle has been pushing a lot about SOA.
Personally, I've been working with
the stack since the very beginning.
But now in 2017 there are many new things that we can use.
There are many different architectures and innovative projects.
For example, chatbots, IoT, DevOps,
machine learning, artificial intelligence,
obviously microservices, the cloud.
But you know what?
SOA, if you really implement it the way it is supposed to be implemented,
there is no way that you cannot create those type of projects.
If you did it in the right direction,
if you did it in the right way,
SOA is going to prepare you for any of those type of projects.
And that's the message I wanted to to deliver.
What you're saying brings to mind two comments that I hear.
One of them is that microservices architecture is simply the
way service-oriented architecture should have been done
in the first place.
But that leads me to a second point.
Would it be inaccurate to describe microservices
as simply a flavor of service-oriented architecture?
I mean, the difference is literally in
the size of the services you're dealing  with.
I think, yes.
I will try to elaborate around that,
highlighting that both architectures are based on service orientation.
Right.
And that service orientation is a key thing right here.
Because if you go into the design principles of service orientation,
it doesn't matter if it is micro or macro or a large or small service.
At the end it is a service, and if you go through the design
principles of service orientation, then
then you are okay
What happens is that I feel, and because of articles, the internet,
books, videos, people commenting things,
that we tend to say this is a microservice,
and because it is a microservice then it is a very particular thing
that we need to understand in such a way
that the only the only person who understands it
is the one who created it, and that's wrong.
It is a service.
So if it is a microservice and I am using
it as a service,
then I need to get engaged with it as a service.
And people aren't doing that.
People are like, &quot;I just created this REST
interface and that is a microservice.&quot;
But in order to use it and in order to
make an operation with that microservice
you need to call these other three microservices,
and and then you are like, &quot;No, that's not the way to do it.&quot;
Yeah.
You are breaking, because that's also important,
you are breaking the monolith,  that's true.
But you are breaking it in such a way that
those small pieces then are not understandable.
So let's just keep in mind that this service orientation thing
is about getting aligned with the business, right?
That's what we are trying to do.
Building components. Building things.
Building services which are very aligned to your organization and to your business.
So if at the end you have like a thousand small pieces,
and those thousand small pieces are not well aligned with your organization,
then...
So what you're saying, and correct me if I'm wrong,
is that the principles of service orientation still apply
if you're developing with micro services.
Correct!
So in that sense wouldn't it be accurate to also say that,
rather than a movement or a force that runs counter to service-oriented architecture,
that microservices are simply the next phase of service-oriented architecture?
I think it is an alternative, definitely.
It is a good one, actually.
You can definitely go into that direction,
always having in mind that you need to
to get aligned with design principles of service orientation,
and then you are ready to go.
If you understand that and microservices is a good fit for you
in terms of your needs, in terms of your goals,
then you are ready to go.
But that does not mean that if for any reason
you were already engaging with an SOA project,
then you need to get rid of that. No.
I think both architectures are valid.
They can be very well aligned and they
can complement each other in a very good
way.
Now,  I have to mention now that I have you on this stage,
that you and Arturo Viveros put together a
2 Minute Tech Tip two years ago that
is the all-time most-watched,
most popular two-minute tech tip,  to the point that I actually
had to put you guys in a special category,  in a Hall of Fame,
because nobody else had a shot at number one.
Really!
Yeah! There are whopper views on that particular Tech Tip.
You can see that on YouTube.
What's on your calendar? Are you speaking
anywhere else in the near future?
Yes,  I'm doing an Oracle Developer Tour in  Mexico, Costa Rica, and Chile,  hopefully.
That's at the end of October 2017 and the 
beginning of November 2017.
I don't know if there is going to be an Oracle Code in the upcoming months before the end of the year.
If that is happening then I'm definitely participating.
I have submitted papers for other third-party conferences,
such as JFocus, for example.
I think that is happening in February 2018 in Sweden.
Hopefully they accept my papers.
I am trying to create new content.
For example, I'm creating content about chatbots,  which is also a very hot topic.
People are interested in that.
Yeah!  There's a little white robot to my right
that's been chattering away for two days now.
So that's also a  very interesting topic I am building new conten t on.
I would like to deliver some workshops around chatbots.
Chatbots, because of my experience and
the things I do, are a very good topic for me,
because I just wrote an article about...
In my opinion there are two elements that are feeding Chatbots.
One thing is obviously AI, artificial intelligence.
And the second thing is APIs.
So those are the two ingredients that
the chatbots are very likely to get engaged with.
So in the APIs  arena I've  been working a lot.
So I find very naturally the way that I am engaging with chatbots,
so now I am trying to create this content around.
Well, hopefully we'll see some 2 Minute Tech Tips
out of you on chatbots and some of these other topics.
Absolutely! I have four articles in my funnel for the upcoming weeks
and I'm definitely going to share with you, Bob.
In fact Rolando's got a fairly recent article on Cloud Integration Service, right?
Cloud integration and API management.
Right. Right. And that's available through the Oracle Developer Community.
Rolando, thanks for stopping by and talking to me.
I know you've got a session this afternoon.
You probably have to go and meditate a
little before you deliver that session.
Correct!
Thanks again for stopping by and talking to us.
Stay tuned for more from the Oracle Developer Lounge
here at Oracle OpenWorld and JavaOne 2017.
It is 2017 still.
Thanks for watching.
I'm Bob Rhubart.
Stay Tuned!
