deploy the application successfully the
third one is also in a cat enema in the
spectrum of configuration it could be an
application core it could be a coward if
you are building a Java g2 application
it could be database connections which
you require to connect with and that
could be changed from environment to
environment so that is our third point
conflict the LA the last three on the
first segment backing service build and
process those are the the fundamental
rules behind the application give me a
second I'm just I'm watching it sauce
and I forgot to get this thing done okay
I should have set this up earlier all
right okay
from there we talked about other six
principles portability concurrency and
disposability rather than speaking and
talking about each of those individually
I'm going to walk through when we do
alive them off how are these principles
going to be met with the platform which
you are chosen right and the last three
here specifically for the parity logs
and admin those are the key assets you
require in order to manage and maintain
your application throughout it
operational side of life cycle okay but
again the premise of 12 factor is for
developers productivity simplicity and
then you want to have a development
environment which is scalable and at the
same time it is elastic in nature so out
of those 12 principles which we talk
right if I then further want to
synthesize and simplify that it falls
into this four different bucket or
bottom left you see agile development
right so idea being when you are doing
the agile development you want to have
categories wherein you could create
issues you want to be transparent
assigning those issues and going through
what is the lifecycle and at what stage
your application are so that's your
agile development methodology you want
to do the tracking you want to do all
kind of stuff and you want to have a
tool to make make it happen from there
the concept really second parity is
infrastructure as a code any anything
you to build anything within your
organization which you build you want to
have a code based which is whether you
write a script whether you write an
environment and whether you create
anything it has to be version control
whether it is infrastructure
or software you have to do that
traditionally speaking I had seen this
or an or that our software code has been
kept in the version but not
infrastructure this is a fundamental
shift infrastructure as a code finally a
sheared version control so you we talked
about application having version
controls now you also talked about that
version control of application along
with infrastructure when we marry those
together that's what the whole success
comes in right and then when you when
you marriage this together and when you
kind of Club this together that's what
the concept called mineable
Minimum Viable Product right that is the
product which you require when you ship
the product out of it it should be
running so you should be running the
test before it goes up you should be
able to do all the Greek mythology he
was explaining earlier it could be
really solved by doing that right and
finally in order to accomplish the goal
of agility to do the things faster to do
do and do things effectively you want to
do on automation how heavy automation
which talks about when you do the build
it should be automatically triggering
your when you do the commit to your
source control it should start some
build process and when you start a build
process it should eventually do a
deployment at some some server where in
your application is life right so those
are the four constructs to your
application now if you think about the
ops right and this is different and
people will come with different
perspective but you have to think about
this that the Ops is an allegation of
six or seven different capabilities
right I kind of summarizes into this six
categories right left is configuration
management you could use the tools like
ansible puppet chefs in our presentation
later today I'm going to talk about
specifically and share a chef being
utilized and how chef and its cook
could be utilized for configuration
management in the space of continuous
integration continuous delivery you have
Jenkins ansible
redneck those are the core features and
when you talk about container those are
aware it's all connected the dots
version control most of the on primal
occations you must be doing some kind of
version control in in cloud native
application development you talking
about version control using git
subversion and others main topic for us
today's virtualization Dockers right
docker is a synonym to containers again
they and you could go on public docker
image and get it or you could use vendor
neutralized docker container on your
organization further you could use
Gradle Jenkins or maven and to do the
build and functional tests and finally
for once you build the codebase and your
artifacts are ready and to deploy you
want an artifacts binary management of
artifacts that's your artifactory or
nexus before I move on guys do you have
family ready or you guys know about this
stuff feel good about anything you want
to add on top of it so security is part
of it and and the way it is is it's
embedded within it so if you go further
down and look into those principles
behind it it's at each layer of those
principles it says that you have to
ensure your security is there and others
so it's embedded within that but it's a
principle good question all right so we
see from industry perspective what we
are seeing is containers are being
heavily used or whether it's on print or
wearing you have rights from virtual
machine to making containers for
agility and faster development there is
also this concept of why you want
containers and right side you see the
three main points one is obviously your
developer productivity being the top use
case along with that other important
thing is continuous integration and
continuous delivery these are the things
which you going to talk in detail but
you think about when the code is built
by the time the code is built through
the time it gets deployed you are
talking about weeks to months cycle you
talk about QA approvals you talk about
the environments getting going through
different cycles that's where it is
it causes time delays right you don't
get necessary any efficiency gains by
just wandering around the process but
it's you are adding more of a baggage to
your software development lifecycle
finally when you move to cloud for
obviously agility and cost factors and
other other main reasons of Mundi cloud
you want to have a way to move the
workload from on print to cloud okay all
right so this picture illustrates on the
left-hand side traditional virtual
machines right how this virtual machines
has been used in past and how the
containers are shaping it up and how
they are changing the way to operate so
on the left hand side you could see all
the way from you elation from
infrastructure to your host operating
system to your hypervisor
right and then on each hypervisor you
have your guest operating system and
then you have your build app and then
you have your binaries and then your app
so think about that is it's a linear
model for developing it and this was
good to begin with that that's what it
happens when you are talking about early
2000s to late 2000 like an past decade
you could see that virtual machine was
always
on the rise right and the one major
thing it shatters the things is all this
are tightly coupled with your
infrastructure and it's also tightly
coupled with your guest operating system
meaning today if you want to move your
platform from windows-based to Linux or
Solaris or something like that
it's very hard to do that right and now
when you want to do new vendor
neutralization when you want to do a
migration of your codebase from
different operating systems that's where
you use containers now containers it
helps in dependencies right it is
basically talking about getting the
kernel now the if you see the right side
the basic difference between a V virtual
machine and containers are the layer of
hypervisor is gone right
so when hypervisor gone it still needs
to do some kind of kernel operating
system kind of manipulation of your data
and by docker engine which provides the
same kernel helps you to virtualize the
application and yet it provides you it
provides user space for running your
workload independently this is core
concept of your Dockers so that when you
run your doctor doctor a on your
application it doesn't interfere
application P neither it helps and that
it works on infrastructure neither it
works on neither it has any problem when
you run on different infrastructure
right with that so we're going to jump
to the second topic of how we could
leverage oracle cloud for DevOps and use
n containers see thought in the end his
earlier keynote talked about various
capabilities that Oracle provide right
so in a nutshell I'm not going to go
deep dive but think about when you are
with the organization
right you are not a single person who is
developing the code and deploying in all
the way to Maine to maintain your
application you need services which is
required to be effectively available
throughout your organization so then and
your journeys are different too all
right your journey is someone are in
on-prem to do the application and then
some applications required cloud native
kind of development cycle so when you
merge those together and when you have
citizen class of developers who are
business analyst right we called a super
user who want to develop an application
you want to provide them the
capabilities so talking those three
different audience and how this platform
helps so on the left-hand side you see
back-end services right our topic today
is of container so we going to go more
details in the application container but
in a nutshell if you want to understand
what it is it's a docker container which
which is available for you and it is
therefore a polyglot style micro
services development we'll go through
details on it but think about it as a
fast application development platform
which proved which which comes with all
the packaging for deployment to manage
as well further if you have a Java GT
workload and you are already on using
web logic or WebSphere kind of thing on
your on-prem allocation you could
literally use that workload and move to
Java cloud service with your
dependencies than others yep
yes was that can ribbit so j2ee provide
it still it's tied to your application
with some kind of operating system with
that right but when you are talking
about the user space you want to manage
your infrastructure connected with your
application there is a layer of
dependencies always there container
shatters that dependency and you use the
space wherein you can run your workload
independently yeah yeah so in a nutshell
you just can't live with just
application right so bottom left side
you see the services for data as well so
you have OLTP kind of workload if or if
you have my sequel kind of workload
node where you pair a key value pair
kind of things so you so you just can't
live with your application but you need
to move your data as well so this
platform provides you that capability
wherein you can literally take the
workload and move to cloud right there
are migration tools available as well
which helps you to migrate but in a
nutshell you have to think about your
application and then the data along with
that when you talk about application and
data on the right side you see
integration services as well you have to
your application doesn't work in silos
it worked with Intel dependency whether
it is an on frame or off frame where it
is taking the data in or giving the data
out so those are your integration
services on the right side you see
front-end tooling those are the things
which you require to help your
developers to do your application
development those are really focused
towards your
citizen class developer let's say you
have business analysts who need to build
a mobile app but he doesn't have to go
through and details about what are the
intricacies of lower environment how it
works how can i shape it up those are
the challenges which is solved by app
builder which is again as a service in a
cloud it's very easy to use and leverage
on the top of it and in the middle
section we talked about common services
irrespective of you are using a
front-end service or a back-end service
you require something called a plumbing
work right which is provided by this
common set of services going from
developer cloud service which is your
continuous integration continuous
delivery mechanism we're going to go
quickly details on it to a p.m. to other
stuff right so when we talk about our
DevOps it really go through three major
things one is application development
and build second one is once you build
an application you want to deploy that
application this is your runtime second
bucket and third is manageability so
what I'm going to go through is walk you
through a scenario where in how you
could do a gel development and deploy
your apps in the container okay to
narrate this I'm going to leverage all
four office who is working on project
wherein they want to get voice of
customer and every other lines of
business want to get a Twitter feed
information so that they could listen to
their customer engagement and could
model their behavior based on how the
Twitter feeds are acting right to help
that and they could have gone with a
monolithic application build as well but
in this case they had chosen to use
micro services kind of application
development which is gonna get this as a
micro service development platform and
they're gonna create different server
since four applications for different
line of business by literally reusing it
now in pursuit of that and they hired
Lisa Jones and these are our three
characters which is going to come up and
Lisa is her job is to create projects
our job is to make an assignment and is
her job is to start a sprint this is all
about your agile development from there
my second character comes Bala whose
responsibility is to write a back-end
code and also he since we are talking
about micro service so he's going to
take a JSON feed and also send a request
for merging final character in our story
line is John tuber a small individual
who build and front-end application and
he uses an jet code jet application code
and again once the line hub here is
important as well submit the moistu code
request that's where is when the request
is gone and the request is approved by
literally so for this sake that's where
you're going to kick off automation
build and deployment of application and
that's where the agility comes in
picture ok so let's talk about what are
the tasks Lisa is gonna do and I'm going
to walk through how developer cloud
service helps you in accomplishing those
tab the first one that says she has to
create a project she will use users
she'll add users in those projects
Ambala and John and to track the work
which what they need to do and then
finally using the agile board and she
will start the sprint so let's go into
details of its I'm going to leverage
okay there are various application for
our this time out I'll give a second or
so is this network going to be like this
yeah but if it takes my life demos gonna
go blow up if I go like this you guys
guns and we'll to wait for that long so
let's talk that I hope this works let's
let's say Lisa
start our new day ops project alright
and I'm going to walk through quickly
but idea beam is once you create the
project either it's a shared repository
or initiated everything she could create
the project and literally the push of
that button the environment is being
getting created for you what it helps is
think about before I do this thing about
if in your organization you want to
start a project and you've been a
project manager or a project team member
how long does it take to just create the
basic things like creating a scrum board
creating an issue tracking list creating
a core repository creating a build
continuous build kind of environment you
talk about weeks to months to ear
sometimes right within a click this is
less than a minute or so this is going
to shape you up and provide you an
environment look at this which will
provide you a blank template of
application which literally you can use
it just now we just created it right so
next task for Lisa is she own add users
to her tasks right so she's going to use
the user now in our cases Bala she add
his as a owner and she could add another
user
Shawn which we talked about earlier
no no internet I'm going to quit on this
Internet
but don't worry we have Bala here but
what I did is I kind of anticipated some
problem might happen I had kind of
created a project sample before this and
I hope this internet still helps me but
essentially we we we got this users and
Lisa Joan is an owner up here and she
added Bala and John so once you add
those user to your profile she could
literally do all em from the reporting
standpoint she could see how many open
depicts are there features other stuff
but as think about you have to have
visibility once you create the project
and her job is a project management so
first thing she does is she goes and
create an issue and what are those
issues look like and she creates saying
OK in order me to create an application
I want to create our Twitter feed and
she assigned that to Bala once that
Twitter feed is created she want to
display that in a tabular format she
assigned that to John and then finally
she also created Twitter feed for John
to deploy that and using a user
interface and John is having another
task to create an app and show that now
with John we again going back switching
to our tap here
so we gone through that right first
staff we talked about okay so I guess
okay we talked about and she added user
she created issues to add Twitter micro
service she had created any issues so
that UI will be created by John and then
now let's talk about what the agile
board and what this print looks like
right
switching taking time so what what she
immediately does is what are the issues
she has she gets those issue and she
creates something called a micro Service
dashboard she creates something called a
micro Service dashboard and once she
created a micro Service dashboard she
can take those micro services that word
from her backlog what are the issues we
create in agile sprint world you take
this black backlog and then assign those
in a sprint once you assign those in a
sprint you kind of manage the sprint
using active sprint basically you say
that what is what are the events what
are the deliverables and who is doing
and this is transparent to everyone
right and the idea is once you create
this these features need to be made
available to developers as well as for
reporting purpose to her as well so idea
is providing those reports and
capability there are also something
called burndown chart and sprint report
which is going to provide her an inside
of who is doing what at what pace okay
so those are from Lisa's point of view
so she created the agile board secret
and she created a sprint and started it
and then we talked about adding the
sprint as well now I'm going to use this
rather than switch here
second a second task is now M Bala is
going to come up he is going to leverage
whatever Lisa has built earlier using
the Sprint agile and task he takes the
task which is assigned to him and he
builds the artifact in the process he
connects to developer cloud service and
to get his coat he created the
repository and let's go through that in
given we have less time now I'm going to
leverage and the same account otherwise
I could have used other accounts wherein
he could log in and do the activity but
first thing first is he needs to have a
code repository so in this case we
created a code and it is as simple as
creating a public repository let's say
for example Twitter code right and he
could basically import or he could
create a new one and once he created
this repository it's available for them
to use right then and there
okay now in our case he has already a
Twitter repository he had taken that
work and he said I have completed that
work now the second step you could do is
in order to do the application
development he could use his own UI user
interface to build an application and
then once he built an application he
could push in or in yeah
one second yeah okay so once he create
that we talked here right we're in the
assignment is done to Bala and Bala is
creating the github and once he create
the github he needs to get the code once
he get the code he kind of take that
code and move is this okay to my so he
take that code and he moves that code is
you use the Eclipse plugin to take that
code and move that cloud to cloud in the
process if he has to see whether the
changes is applied or what are the
changes he can done he changes is also
available in developer cloud service
where and you can see the diff and see
what are the changes he did so that
you're transparent about what code is
change and how that code has is behaving
now once that code is build John is also
doing the similar stuff here right we
talked about how he get the project he
got the project and build using
developer cloud and then the next task
is is he's going to take this workload
and push into container cloud service
okay in the similar note our friend John
also is going to leverage his UI skill
and use his developer cloud service and
other capabilities which is provided and
build his artifact and once he built an
artifact he's ready to deploy an
application container clock so what is
an application container cloud so um in
the in this there is a tight integration
Oracle did in order to achieve that so
in order to build in order to deploy on
a runtime environment before that a step
comes in in the build right so for this
example I created something called a
build which is here to configure
basically what it does is it's a build
job name it says what are my deck
it takes Java JDK as a dependency it
says where the source is coming from we
just said that it is a gonna coming from
the get repository it takes this git
repository as source and finally it
takes it says what is how I am going to
build it build is done using maven ok
maven is again an open source tool
Oracle has kind of walked with this tool
to create the workflow and once you
create this workflow you build this
artifact and finally once the artifacts
are built you basically keep this in
some kind of repository and it goes into
a zip file once you have this artifact
build the next step is you want to
deploy that and and for deployment
purpose and this is again oracle has
built this developer cloud service and
integrated build and deploy options
wherein it will be deployed into
application container cloud which which
it talks about the verities content this
is our cloud instance what the
application looks like is it a micro
services and other stuff once you build
that you are basically I am switching
gear here and I am moving this into
container cloud service once you build
that automatically with this push of
button of build it goes and create and
runtime instance behind us in the docker
image darker image is taken in that
docker image you order the codebase you
have created it put on the top of it
because the JDK which we saw earlier it
knows it's a Java code and then it
creates an application for you in a
nutshell once you create an application
this is the application runtime it looks
like it's a basic application but idea
being once you create this application
you could leverage the content and
manipulate the tweets out of it ok so
I'm going to switch from here to the
next topic now if you are in
of if you are in journey of already
building applications with open-source
tool let's say you are already using
Jenkins chef or maven this second demo
is going to walk through saying how you
could leverage those those tools and
connect using Oracle cloud to again
build your pipeline right there is first
one which we saw that if you are
Greenfield you are creating a new
application and you have hadn't done
anything in past so you can literally
use all the developer cloud service
which is free free okay it is free all
it comes is you need a subscription of
either a Java cloud service or either a
mobile cloud service once you have that
it's a free platform for you to use but
think about how it helps you it helps
you in bringing all this loose and tight
together right but if you are in a
journey wearing you say okay and my day
of efforts is not new I have been in
this world and I'm doing this from last
six years but I have some open source
which I want to leverage on so there is
another ways of doing it as well in my
second name I'm going to walk you
through few of an open source a
cloudberry is simple like this if which
is basically helping you it's kind of an
explorer to connect between your cloud
instance and see this is a cloud this is
Oracle cloud and on my Explorer to move
your files that is one second is Jenkins
you guys are aware of Jenkins mostly
right now I'm going to liberate Jenkins
and what I am going to do for this
product is I'm going to go through the
story of how what are we doing here but
look at this these are the different
jobs we had created in order to create
the developer pipeline okay okay so
let's go through actors so that it helps
you to understand again simul
a set of actors idea being helping I
that it is a collaborative development
platform for application building right
and these gentlemen are going to use and
Lisa is going to use this environment
and the tooling which I'm going to
quickly go through on chef Jenkins get
and docker or to build this next demo
right so first in first
first in first this is the Mac second go
yeah
first in flows John takes connect to the
git repository download the code use
developer cloud service and clone that
code right so once what he does in the
process and I have another project which
are created for us is called sample
application and you see this Facebook
style of application development that is
really what your twelve factor
principles talk about and this is a
direct representation of how the
transparency between developers and
operation teams could be achieved now
that particular one he created a sample
repository and he take that sample git
repository and get the code for to the
gate right here now with that is going
to move I'm going to go to the next one
next one arm what it does is once the
code is available using good and git
repository with push with when we do the
push get when you had to commit the code
and think about your SVN or even get
once you push the code what needs to
happen is there is a trigger we're in
the if there is a commit happen you want
to have a trigger in your application
upon once you commit this you're going
to launch the job which is in jenkins
which we just showed but i will go more
details which will call on api on a
computer out
in cloudy API which will build and
virtual image for you now what basically
behind the scene it creates a container
for you
these are my old sketches so bear with
me on that but it creates a container
for you now how do you do that is in
order to integrate with in order to
integrate with Jenkins this developer
cloud service provides you something
called web hooks and think about
anything which is open source the
standard way of operation for connection
is this web hooks what it does is it's
basically a plugin and plug-in calls for
tell me where you are
Jenkins server is okay and you can then
further add your authentication and
other pieces as well but once you tell
where your Jenkins server is it provides
you saying that when you do the commit
this is where it takes that handoff and
say that when you pass this message to
me I will take and kick off a job to run
a build process within my Jenkins piece
now once you the once you have taken
this commit close you also need to have
code repository in case we use sample
gate for this now that's also a second
task now he took the Jenkins job it
called the API and once the API is
called it called the computer service
and it builds and container for you
moving on
and moving on
moving on our second piece is once that
image is built all the way right here
okay once the image is built and Jenkins
in in in the process it goes and fire
another job wherein it calls off a knife
call which if you are familiar with chef
if not chefs has something called
cookbook recipe and it operates in
something called knife a knife is a
calling mechanism to call and
orchestrate your events wherein you take
that calls and build your artifacts on a
run time in this picture it demonstrates
saying when you use this knife call and
at that time Jenkins basically call that
and that particular image which we just
created it goes into public repository
takes the chef's client and install that
chef client on your machine okay let's
see how that that integration work I
have in the dashboard I talked here of
our Jenkins job let's quickly go through
how the chef what is chef and what chef
does for you I mentioned earlier saying
that chef has different ways basically
the configuration management tool and
what it does it it has different nodes
and policies now within the policies it
talks about what is when you need to get
something on Java it could take a Java
from Oracle cloud look at this Oracle
cloud or it could also go to IBM cloud
to get IBM flair of Java and download
those content which you specify in your
cookbook it's there in your recipe file
you take those cookbooks you call those
recipe Falls and then orchestrate your
job using Jenkins right that's our
second part of it and once you kind of
build that one
to build that chef job next thing is
since your content is Java you kind of
take a Java Runtime it goes to Oracle
public cloud look for what is the
content required in order to build the
binaries download those are real-time
and Jenkins is orchestrating all this
right it's building that real-time
and creating a web logic instance for
you what once so how do you do that is
there is something called build job I'm
going to go through something called
build pipeline this is the heart of it
this is something called DSL structured
language where it talks about how you
could take various environment variable
you create and how you could orchestrate
a creation of your job using your
defined parameters now whatever you have
defined here in a script is hard to read
but think about these are your
environment variable you take that and
you call the chef command to say that
when you when you call the chef it takes
that nice knife call up and it creates
your runtime capability to create the
chef client right once you create the
chef it also goes and download your
something called
together so I'm going to go through and
show what that looks like
yep so Web Apps and say that this is my
developer cloud instance I'm going to
take this code and push it under web
logic okay so bear with me here it taken
this cookbook it created a web logic
instance right and second piece it does
it now your code is ready to deploy your
code is ready to deploy into a runtime
artifact so it's going to take John's
code use the maven repository and again
there is a job which we have created for
o which will create a build and deploy a
web logic app it we just talked about
where is the source and where is a
target it takes that job and finally
deploy that the job and make a runtime
app in a nutshell this is how it looks
like but if I then do a next step out of
it this is how it looks like big picture
but we have gone through step by step
which provides you how the integration
between open-source and developer cloud
works ok so give me a second I am going
to wrap this in less than a minute or so
and I'll open it for Question and Answer
okay
so what so this is my closing now what
we had seen three things we saw a
developer cloud service how it helps you
in to do in helping out your continuous
integration continuous delivery I talked
about it's free right it's literally
take one minute and it has all the
plugins to connect with your open source
platform using web hooks that's one
second we talked about application
container we hadn't got too far in the
containers but think about if you have a
polyglot soil modern cloud application
development and you want to use node you
want to use PHP Ruby by a Python J all
these new technologies but you don't
know how to deploy on that come to a
record crowd it helps you see that
developer cloud service it will help you
to bind those together
and it could be a different target on
the right side you see mobile to Java to
application container
those are your targets where you
indicate deploy and run your workloads
finally on the cloud development it's
also if you talk about the TC or total
cost of ownership of building your app
and how long it's run
it's literally fifty nine percent less
as compared to on Prem and also there
are lots of deployments artifacts to be
Java or non Java and finally we had seen
using the web books how you could
interoperate with your open source
tooling so you could literally leverage
whatever you are using and work with
developer cloud to connect and again
these are all restful and Oracle cloud
support that so one thing if you I want
you guys to remember is how easy is it
using the toolset and you don't have to
throw away your existing investment
which you are done for open source so
with that pause open for questions sure
this one
so so when I mentioned it's all
lifecycle right from provisioning of
your container to provisioning of your
code as well and I summed this up but
for developer perspective if you are
just developing your web app giardia to
air your path is maven and but if you
want a shippable product it has to
combine those together and that's what
the volts flow look like right right
using my own but you have to think about
that if your underlying image has to
change if your winery's has to be
changed you still need to Club those
together that's the whole idea
infrastructure as a core being promoted
when you talk about doe ops and plus
factor application that helps alright so
on the containers perspective it's a
docker under the cover right and it so
when docker
you are taking darker you could specify
the Oracle Linux or on the marketplace
you could even go on public linux and
get those utilities and deployed
by default it is running in some
instance of a cloud right and it is on a
docker container which is virtualized
for you last question
chef orchestration different from yeah
yeah so yeah good question so when you
want to liberate something called when
you want to leverage platform when
docker is specific constant within that
but when you want to extend and you
don't know necessary how those
third-party works chef puppet those are
the tools which provide you
interoperability and provides you
mechanism to connect and pull the
runtime artifact and it provides you
guiding principle how you could
integrate and literally use those
commands to develop it okay all right
anything else guys we've been using from
last three years
absolutely
