Oracle code 2018 in beautiful downtown
Los Angeles California I'm Bob Rubert
with the Oracle developer community and
I've got two gentlemen here are who are
part of the roster of presenters for
today's event this is Rolando Carrasco
from Mexico satellites were from Mexico
as well you gentlemen are presenting a
session on I'm gonna look at my notes so
I'm not being rude it's a best practices
for API design good design principles in
in design and development are always
important but what makes them especially
important in API design Rolando yeah we
feel that and this is part of the
content of our presentation that and
this is something that a friend of mine
feel Wilkins that you may know him he he
was writing an article about that we are
living in a happy world like age API and
I agree with him because there are many
api's or web api is to or for developers
to use and we feel that there is a very
strong need for well-designed API is
because at the end the API is are a
product that's the way that we need to
understand them and I don't know if we
will take a look to the products that we
buy and we are very straight on the
products that we consume and the API
still is our product so we really need
to be very good on design our API is
because this is this is the way that the
world is moving and we feel that the API
is our part or a very important part of
the digital transformation and I can
even say that api's are those building
blocks for the digital transformation so
in that regard we need to have very good
principles of design it is just it is
not just a matter of exposing a rest
interface or exposing something no and
this is what we are going to cover in
our session it is about how to design a
product a product that is going to have
a face and that faces the API
Leonardo Woodard Rolando forget to say
we need
to think that we need to monetize that
API we need to take in count some design
principles that applied for any kind of
service as well
for example micro-services web services
any kind of service we need to think in
that to apply these design principles to
our API what is unique about design
principles for api's what sets those
design principles apart from design
principles that apply to other types of
development we need to think in services
always we need to think in services even
for the API is designed because an API
is an interface of a service what
service any kind of service can be web
service or micro service and those
principles applies to to our API is
Rolando yes I think more than were
Leonardo is saying the API is for for
someone for an organization who is
trying to make more money that's kind of
the objective of the API because it is a
new product for this organization and
they want to make money around the API
so the difference and that was your
question I feel is because the API is to
generate more money for your
organization that's the intention of the
API obviously if it is a an external API
if it is an internal API we can discuss
it on a different interview but for
exposing api's to the world for any type
of developer or any other third-party
organization then you need to design it
as a product that's the main difference
because we make a step back into the
service design principles service design
principles is for the organization to
reduce cost because services are for
that all the years Oh anything is
because you want to reduce cost within
your organization but with api's you are
trying to
Cree's your your revenue you are selling
something to the external world so so it
is that it is similar but it has a shift
that makes it unique because you are
trying to sell something to the external
world and that is what you need to have
similar design principle but some very
specific ones for example and that's
something that we are going to cover in
the session you're gonna think about
api's for longevity because you may
think that this is something that it may
last obviously not forever not things
are not forever but you need to think
about longevity in terms of this API
needs to keep pace during the upcoming
months and maybe years right mm-hmm so
that's that's one thing abstraction
because I don't want you to know how my
product is built why this is my product
you are going to use it we have a
contract between ourselves that's good
but you don't need to know how am i
building it so I'm not going to reveal
anything about my product because that's
what happens in any type of product
right so those are the difference what's
the single most important factor in good
API design the first contract of
approach it's a it's a good approach to
the same design API is because you need
to set the contract first and then think
about the implementation of the of the
API I think is one important thing it
can be like ready to use API because are
ready to use product is something that
you go to the supermarket or whatever
and you just buy it and you are ready to
use it you don't need to follow so many
instructions or manuals or whatever to
use it right you just go there and
whatever you are buying that you just
buy it and use it and that's it with API
is I feel that it must follow those
principles that though Europe your API
is needs to be ready to use but that
doesn't mean that an API
needs to be developing on a very fast
pace and that's that's not the idea the
idea is that wherever you are going to
as an API needs to be ready to use you
don't need your consumers to be very
hard on following your instructions
about how to use them
don't make them think about how your API
works in the other hand just make them
use it just as any other product is a an
easy to use product that's that would be
my take right it's a black box thing
they don't need to know what's inside
just how to use it you've got a brand
new article on Chapa development on the
Oracle developer portal you had
threatened me that this is going to be
the first of several articles on chat
pots what do you have coming up yes
that's my idea
my idea is the following we need to keep
pace with the chatbox obviously but on
only the chat ball by itself and I think
I wrote something last year about the
relevance of the api's within chat BOTS
so I think my next step or my next take
is to how to join them because you have
a chat board as a very good channel
digital channel for your consumers easy
to use easy to understand you can engage
very easily but at the same time you
need to give services to them right so
if you are going to create a chat bot
for for a bank let's try to make the
chat book to be useful for the user and
that implies to connect the chat bot
with your back end and while doing that
then then again the API topic is is
there so I think my next my next take my
next articles are going to be around how
to create your chat bot or how to
connect it to the backend and you'll
find Rolando's latest article on chat
bots on the oracle developer portal
that's developer oracle.com
I'm Babu Bart with the Oracle developer
community stay tuned and thanks for
