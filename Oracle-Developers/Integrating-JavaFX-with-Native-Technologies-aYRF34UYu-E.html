wasn't on anyway not that you said
something okay with me is my good friend
Philippe Heydrich all we're still a bit
loud their levels down a bit we're still
a all-around wizard who can give you the
answer to any any question about text or
anything about fonts or any kind of nls
stuff but that's not on the menu today
on the menu say is integrating javafx
with native technologies this is the
lawyer slide which means everything I
say don't everything I say BS discount
is a lie discounted so I wanted to make
the plot to so small that you can't read
it could say anything in there so I
guess we'll just give a quick FX
overview because you have to you know to
integrate with that backs you've gotta
understand a little bit about the
architecture not going to go into a lot
of detail about that a little
description of what native code looks
like in glass in prison then the meat of
it integrating and then we actually did
a some performance work to use OpenGL to
speed up a benchmarking so why do you
want to use natives there might be some
OS specific call that you need to make
that has not been surfaced up through
the portable api's of javafx you might
have a pre-existing piece of native code
that takes the form of you know some lot
of me do a lot of dialogue that would
collect connect to a server or something
you've just got this legacy piece of
code no one wants to rewrite it so it's
some giant sea piece you might also want
to improve performance by using some
features of opengl or you know something
that's that is not available through you
through prison and I guess native code
could be faster because Java is slow
good
okay so this is probably the oldest
diagram we have to show the architecture
of prism it's actually still good today
on top is the api's that you call and
the scene graph quantum toolkit which
binds the your AP eyes to the underlying
widget and graphic system of FX quantum
toolkit we're shrinking down these days
getting a bit smaller but anyway and the
very very stuff underneath so this is
the classic so everybody say happy
birthday to JavaFX so javafx has two
threads to do its to do its magic one is
the UI thread that your code runs in and
another is a dedicated rendering thread
and y 2 threads because while the UI
thread is executing your code and code
on your behalf at the render thread can
be putting the bits to the screen and
that can happen at the same time and so
you can see that where the user code and
render code overlap is an area where
there's parallelism that will speed up
FPS right and there's a sync operation
where the where the state needs to be
synchronized between the two threads
good now alright my beautiful voice so
during this sink phase the state which
is kept in the epic NOFX knows the API
that you call is copied over to
something called ng nodes and the render
thread chews on the end eng nodes and
you know uses that to put java string or
do whatever and this so that was a sink
phrase we saw in the previous diagram
okay so i'll talk a bit about glass
glass consists of some shared java code
some platform-specific java code and a
bunch of native peers and the native
peers are written in amazingly three
different native languages for three
different platforms because it you know
i guess there's one commonality in there
as they're all based on see but there's
objective-c for for mac c++ for win32
and ce4 gtk these are that the desktop
platforms i'm talking about
unfortunately there's no api like j awt
to get the handles out of glass and
that's unfortunate because that's what
you need to integrate to make those
operating system calls and these are the
kind of handles that you might want to
get out of the out of glass right
something is delicious is h wind that's
been around for quite a long time so um
yes what's delightful my favorite h wind
yeah i like I unknown actually it's one
of my favorites but anyway to make it
more fun the handles and the glass
objects and the native handles are not
necessarily one to one so view is
lightweight on windows so there's an H
win for the top level shall the top
level stage but there's no there's no h
win for the inner stuff whereas on Mac
it's there's an NS view and an interview
blah blah blah blah so not only you know
is there dif different c code or
different implementation languages for
the natives there's also a different
structure
which makes it a lot of fun so given you
know given this how can you survive so a
problem you you need to get you have a
stage FX stage and you need to get a
native handle out of it there's no api
to get this from glass or from quantum
and you know the native code it's all
subject to change right so one thing you
can do is use reflection to reach in
which is horrible thing to do but you
can use reflection to reach inside and
map from a glass for from an fx stage
the underlying handle and this relies on
the implementation of FX you know
quantum and glass underneath and it just
turns out that there's a half there's a
get native window method that glass
provides it's not API which is not API
so I mean this is a sort of thing you do
when your debt would you desperate you
know you need to get at that handling
and you know get your job done so
Philippe you're under the clip over to
the number two from there we want to run
it down with Steve sure sure it takes
two seconds okay can you get number two
oh sorry so this is just a do a piece of
java facts code and it's my me say Mike
work or not it is ok so just your normal
event handler that we just call some
function here and just because Steve and
I would like to do want one native so
that's like Java code but the Seco to be
exactly that same amount of the same
lines you just remove that OS here and
off you go and if you run that hopefully
doesn't crash hopefully doesn't crash
didn't crash so it's just whatever a
little text editor and I have a print
dialog and that the event handler is
going to run here and now this print
dialog is being brought up by the native
code so you're back that's not
the fax running anymore so and you saw
that dialogue came down as a sheet which
is a java mac OS feature type of window
right and you can and you're going to
have all the whatever features you need
the native dialogue and a mac OS can
flip back number 10 insurance so it you
know we just chose any native dialogue
but the idea is that you might have a
pile of native code that had a dialogue
so i guess felipe you want to talk a
little bit about prison oh why not now
I'm good anything uh Neela figure so
prism is DSD is a component inside of a
java facts that's responsible by the
rendering so it runs in we have two
threads as Steve mentioned before in a
prism easily the component that is
actually parsing that ng nodes in Tucson
thread and then calls into e open Jo or
d3d to do the actual rendering and it's
so it has API that is Java that's how
the how we develop on the top what's the
energy nodes are using and behind the
scenes it has a back-end that is native
code OpenGL or d3d and that's so it has
specific platform code to do that so
next is a lie so that's a little bit
what prism looks like on top of the
presume you would have the energy layer
which is like ng tags ng canvas and G
region they are calling prism a POS and
he has a graph context and has functions
such as draw texture and why not es-tu
is did we did opengl implementation that
is used for Mac Linux frame buffer there
is using embedded iOS etc we also have
the d3d obviously that runs on Windows
and we also have a software
implementation that is a bunch of stops
not hardly accelerated is C code mostly
and we also have implementation that is
on top
of java or JJ 2d and i think right now
we are only using it for printing so uh
you want to talk about this one or just
go okay oh so let's just talk about so
for now on or are we going to talk about
this integrative rope in jail and I
suppose that most of all so we are Java
developers are programming
object-oriented language so when you set
a state when you call a method that's
pretty obvious that you're set in that
state or call yet met that give an
object in jail you see that you're just
setting states and issuing commands to
thin air but it's not really what
happens so before we start training to
open jail guard created geo context and
then you bind that geo context to the
thread and whatever geo commend you on
that thread is whatever state you set is
being set to that your context and prism
by using OpenGL has its own context and
runs into on thread and things just work
so it's an important concept that you
can understand you have a context and
that context is the current context of a
given thread it's essentially like a
hidden first parameter to every call
right you think of the object that is
actually receiving all those calls and
has all that state set on it next yeah
and the context is platform-specific the
way you get a context on windows and my
mind keeps going on and off well well
I'll try just to be as loud as I can
which comes naturally to me so to create
a context on Mac also the first line
there I'm Craner contacts on the mac OS
the second line I cannot read is a cheer
windows and then is X 11 and next slide
show you how to create a context on the
embedded blood for using egl which is
the embedded version of jail alright
well that doesn't matter so the point
there is not to remember exactly what
all the calls are but to just know that
there's some platform specific stuff in
there
and when you get the slide deck you
later you'll see what the calls are sure
okay so we looked to call opengl from
JavaFX we used joggle which is a very
famous and very old library we wanted to
integrate with that lightweight Jeff
lightweight the java game library we
like that library we integrated with
that and we used also this applet
Eclipse platform generator just to do
some native code rather than writing a
bunch of C code to bind it together so
the problem is to draw opengl content
and we really could think of only two
possible ways to do it the first way is
to draw the opengl stuff in another
thread and you know slurp the bites out
of it turn it into a byte array and then
send those bytes over to prism and
actually send those bytes over to an
image and then let prism draw the the
image that like you normally would and
that has a tremendous advantage in that
there's no integration with any of the
guts or any of the low-lying stuff with
prison because you're not you know
making any operating system calls or any
GL calls within prism the other solution
was to draw as part of prism and draw
when prism draws and not involved using
a texture and we didn't draw directly
we'll talk about that later so as I said
the advantages of using a byte buffer is
that you don't have to have any of the
low-level you don't have to interact
with any of the low level level prism
stuff and those are some of the OpenGL
calls you might use to slurp the bites
back out of what you drew in another
threat not part of prison and that's the
kind of code that you might use to take
those bites and stuff them into a prism
image and then give that those bites off
to a prism to draw it's kind of the way
that the integration between swing and
swt and javafx is working there's kind
of getting those toolkits to
draw 2-2 essentially byte buffers and
send those over to FX to draw so it's a
kind of well known idea and anyway it
works we won't bother let's not bother
with that a more interesting way to do
thing is to draw when prism straws and
that has the advantage that well it's
easy to understand prism is wrong so I
can draw right and it has the potential
to be the fastest solution and of course
the disadvantages are that you have to
coordinate with prism or you will draw
wrong so back to at back to threading so
you've got to trap l'occasion code runs
and UI thread prism code runs in the
render thread and then the OpenGL
threatening reading rules are open gels
not thread-safe so you've got to run in
your thread Oh prisms gotta run its in
its thread and to make the OpenGL calls
there and you're never to call between
them or but you can share stuff between
them and we showed those platform
specific calls very quickly previously
those ones that Philippe was talking
about so the question is where should
you run your code so if you draw in the
render thread you you know you can
hammer prism you can break javafx and
that's not a very good thing to do if
you draw in another threat you've got to
do all it OpenGL set up stuff create the
platform specific context and follow the
apartment threading rules and then give
the best ways to give a texture to prism
to draw and as soon as you've got
threads interacting like that you've got
a lock around the texture because you
can't be destroying the texture in one
thread while prism is drawing a texture
in another thread etc and so you've got
to synchronize so what we ended up doing
was drawing in the render thread and
saving and restoring the state and if
you save and restore the state one of
the time OpenGL has ways to query the
state it's pretty slow right and then
the question is well you know we needed
to integrate with prism effects and the
previous slide you know why didn't we
draw directly well if you draw directly
first of all where do you draw and
you're just drawing directly on the
surface the prism is drawing to your
transformations don't work effects won't
work because you're not really
integrating with prism so this is why we
drew to a texture so yeah we drew in the
render thread and we drew to a texture
we let prism create the texture and let
prism draw the texture but we drew on
the texture and then passed it off I we
had to take part in the render thread
sink and what we ended up doing was
subclassing some FX classes and
re-implementing a bunch of internal
methods so it was not you know yeah we
got our job done but it wasn't you know
it's not API so weary implemented this
render content which takes this graphics
objects and you can see there's a bunch
of stuff that save and restore the that
saves the current prism platform
specific context creates a context for
you sets it the interesting part is the
lightweight OpenGL calls in the middle
so that stuff in the middle is just
OpenGL so the idea is to set all the
stuff up call any OpenGL call you want
and restore the stuff back so that you
won't break prism this is just an
example of saving up the prism texture
kareena texture creating a texture
saving it away we cash it and this is
code that that creates the contact
platform specific code to create a
context on the Mac OS and there's a
little bit of lightweight OpenGL and as
it Danny didn't has a bit a bit of user
geocode create the FB 0 and bind to the
texture that try-catch thing is all
crammed on one line just so that would
fit on the slide so we're not going to
go through every single movement line
but so it's important to follow the
threading rules when you do this so you
know you've got to do the sink you've
got to copy your state the same way that
prism does when you're running in the
render thread if you need say you know
string to draw somewhere or some data if
you call back if you call some methods
in the UI you know that are in the UI
thread you could potentially run code in
the UI the code that should in the
render thread that should be running in
the UI thread so you should copy the
minimum state you need to draw over to
your ng node and that's typically things
like integers typically typically
primitive data right right so let's
actually run this now on the run okay so
hit number two so what I have here is
just the very cool that we just show
like to slides ago I'm just going to run
that and islami is not very hot it's
just it is well in this case the entire
window is just the content of the jail
except what I dated I am a job effects
no that's the usual yog effects node yes
so the idea is not that that is the most
thrilling and exciting demo in the world
but we overlay a regular node on top of
a know that got the render using gel so
you can put anything you want in there
and you're integrating integrating
properly with prism effects work
everything works so what's the way
forward here the way forward here is to
say implement to GL note for javafx
instead of you know doing what we did
which was kind of reaching under the
covers the way forwards have a proper
API and the joggle and lightweight
opengl implement bindings for the
libraries that they interact with so
light weeked I think Java has three
bindings has 14 swing has 14 swt and has
a standalone kind of all it does is put
up a problem economy to run oh sorry it
would help if I went back to the slides
thank you so the idea would be to
implement a you know give enough API so
that the toolkit the opengl toolkit java
toolkit guys can implement their thing
and provide a proper binding there's
some gyro drawable thing that would not
be part of FX because it's joggle
specific and i guess to note that the
point is that this is just
on there's nuns as non windows platforms
essentially
I don't know what the question is I can
hear but I don't think I know the plan
so I would repeat the question if I knew
what it was so
we said that the right way to go forward
would be for those libraries to
implement integration in the same way
the same way that those libraries
implement integration to swing and SWT
though the right way to go forward would
be for those libraries to also implement
implement it so that and to do that they
need enough hooks into javafx right and
then they have a whole way of how you're
supposed to draw and what not that's not
appropriate to be part of javafx so we
did this we did you know a diamond
benchmark to show why you might want to
use opengl one of the reasons you know
why use natives and one of the reasons
you can use native code is to increase
performance so do you want to talk about
this going to go go go for the demo no
well do you want to just give some
background you want to talk about this
okay so yeah we are going just going to
get a test example of application to
might want to have things rendering
really fast and so we just have some
random problem to solve and we going to
try to go over this problem using Java
facts and options with Java facts and
then you're going to be going to open
gel but basically we want to draw some
group of elements super fast let's just
move on to the to the first demo so I
guess it would be sure lots of the idea
would be sea urchins or lots of the idea
is lots of little objects where
thousands of thousands of little objects
where there's a lot of drawing taking
place prism is very fast but this is an
area where we might do better so um so
we're going to have a know that I just
going to talk about the diamond and it's
just a small geometry and they might
represent something solving some problem
and are there going to be moving in this
scene and I think just best if we just
go you both showed it run the code sure
and ok Jessica number number two got it
ok so I need to render those diamonds
and they are going to be moving in my
stage and I will have thousands and tall
of those guys so for each one I will
have a node and that nodes going to have
a child which in this case is a path
which is a shape right so just line to
move to line two line to close the shape
and are going to run this guy here now
and this is a really awesome damn by the
way Jasper would never draw something
like this all there isn't that amazing
OpenGL but the important part the part
that we want to illustrate is at the top
at the top say that I'm rendering 4,500
notes so I'm rain during that geometry I
have thousands of those and the frames
per second that you have in there 32
frames per second right and that usually
not good enough usually what the hell
360 there anyway so do you think doesn't
jump it's not jumpy so I've been part of
the requirements were that we had to
have 60 frames per second was part of
the required so that you could imagine a
scenario where it was a missile defense
system and it must be 60 FPS right or
get blown you get blown ok so we switch
back so you guys proved it last year we
introduced a new node to the two javafx
called canvas so one of the problems
with your usual approach is that you
create a lot of java objects and for
each job obviously that you create in
this case that region we are going to
create the energy region and for a path
that will be at ng path in G shape on
the other side a lot of Java code
running so there's a lightweight option
for you to use in javafx called canvas
and so canvas you have a campus where
you just render to can just fish number
two back and solving the same problem
with canvas would look something like
this right you say drop cannibals you
get your grub context you feel your
background to be white and then you can
draw a few thousand of those
little geometries over and over and over
so let's run this guy here so now I
don't have all that that note that
weight to carry it before can draw a
little guy right I just draw the little
guy so how is so before what did we have
we had like about 30 frames per second
so I'm using all the same parameters
here number of nodes and the size of my
displays exactly the same and I'm brain
during the same and it didn't really
help me right now it's actually slower
and this case is a special case I want
you guys to know that usually using
canvas is a good solution and usually it
is faster so this one is kind of
educated in their bench case because
prism caches the drawing when you draw
the nodes the path it caches that and
draws that as an image but if you're
just drawing in canvas you could draw a
line you could draw anything and so
since there's no object behind what
you're drawing is just going essentially
to a bitmap and that bitmap being put to
the screen prism can't do any caching
and so that was why it got a bit slower
there we go back to one so next slide so
okay we try to solve the problem being
like being good and using Java facts
without any crazed hacks or create
integration that's not there yet so I'm
going to go in the helm of what's not
API and I'm going to have my own energy
OpenGL note and I'm going to implement
my own render content and I'm going to
render that to a texture and then I'm
going to say prism here's your text you
render that for me so next slide yeah
and there's a to do there which is
interesting which I after this talk I
have to do is to recode the lot and see
and that'll give me a comparison between
how fast light weight GL is and how fast
the C code sure ok so just goes number
two so I have so I show the first moment
Asia that's straight javed facts
straight up then using canvas then I
have another implementation that says
are lightweight OpenGL
and this is my energy node with my
implementation of render content so uh I
told you that the GL has a contacts in
the thread so that first line there is
like wow get me the context that you
have in your thread that in each is
going to do a whole bunch of code to
initialize the user context at this
point to say well user context is
raining to the thread now go there and
render that and put the prism back and
now prism render the texture right and
inside of render track render tracks so
so what's going to happen here so our
prism is a like general-purpose graphics
library right so every time you draw one
of those geometries it gets a mask and
then blitz a quad of that mask so for
each one you need to upload I don't know
about 12 to 16 floats in a vertex buffer
before it can bleed that quad you need
to put the location in the destination
at the location the texture the color
information and a lot of this data is
the same data over and over again right
and and you have the same mask tracks
times of 2500 in our case but if you
know the problem you're solving you can
try to use a different knowing Joey
knowing the problem you try to solve we
can use the GL approach that is more
appropriate for a given problem so my
problem here that I want to repeat the
same geometry in a different x and y and
possibly the different rotation so i can
preserve a lot of my data in the video
card so i put my daily up a new video
card one time it then i say well the
only thing that is going to change is
going to be my x and y which in this
case here is inside of a video which is
a vertex buffer objects so if you ever
cold gel you might not talk about but
basically the only data
change is a very instant minute is the
bare minimum amount of data that I need
to copy from the cpu GPU prism on the
other hand doesn't know that it cannot
take advantage of that information so it
cops every single float every single
bite every single time hear you say
here's your note a new array of x and
y's updates just that little bit of
memory and are going to use another jail
call that we do not use inside the prism
that some well is the extension but
right now is nowadays already standard
that is the draw instance that is the
coin open jollity we would use to repeat
the same geometry several times over so
i'm drawing all those four hundred and
forty five hundred elements in one shot
say just that repeat that 45 hundred
times and here is your air date is here
but the cool things like this did not
change this did change and that did not
change so I I can go a lot faster so
let's see if I am just lying or not but
I change the color just I don't know to
see the swimmers I get I guess I was
bored I don't know so so again take your
eyes off the awesome thing that I'm
rendering and pay attention to the
frames per second over there so people i
was doing between 30 frames per second
now i'm near to 400 frames per second
stick a one in front of them oh yeah and
i and i can go higher because right at
this point if i was running prism the
thing will not be running would be
crawling would not even be rain during
and here is like we're whatever 14,500
notes geometries for OpenGL that's
nothing alright so just just render you
want to try to do that in the other one
or even bother working so let's switch
back sure yep go back one so i guess
felipe already told you how prism draws
we don't need to go over it and he
described the faster way to draw which
is essentially put the geometry down on
the card leave it down there change only
the minimum part that you need ask the
card to do the drawing
and try and keep the interaction as as
little as possible and I guess he used a
vertex shader to do the transform prism
usually does it does to transform right
yeah so that was one little bit and so
we don't need to go over that and also I
guess this is the summary if you know
what you're drawing you can take
advantage of it you can do optimizations
that a general purpose drawing as an
engine like prison camp and you get
faster drawing but you know you lose
portability so I guess we need some API
to get the handles out of glass we need
some support for OpenGL and javafx
reaching around behind and subclassing
things and sneaking in and calling
things that aren't API is not good
enough and you can improve performance
by using OpenGL but you're not going to
be prism and it's in general and you
know you're going to win when you've got
a lot of stuff to draw a prism is very
fast and so you know when you know what
something about the problem you can take
advantage of it and you've got a lot of
stuff to draw then you can succeed or
then you can then you can win and that's
it any questions what time is it by the
way 1035 good we do in half hour awesome
