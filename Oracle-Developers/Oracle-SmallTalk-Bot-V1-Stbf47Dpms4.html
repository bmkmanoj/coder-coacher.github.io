to show you the small talk and
capabilities which are working on go
straight to the point what is a small
tow boat is a narrow general boat based
on an intelligent our internet without
environment we choose a focus on
specific topics very narrow topics kind
of a probably similar to the FAQ but
with the difference that we were not
dynamically generating knowledge right
now the knowledge is specified in JSON
dialogue tree models which additionally
work on top of a response by Jing which
we had to develop more about this a
little bit later
who can use it the smoke board is focus
on customers partners you know everyone
who wants to utilize motor capabilities
on top of that for this motorboat we
develop also small response engine which
kind of were help you to then define and
utilize decision trees and adjacent
models to make your pods look more
human-like and have more randomized
different type of answers and behaviors
and even user action this could be used
also outside of the small talk board we
don't utilize accept decision trees any
artificial intelligence right now
because of a bad experience with other
companies lately we want to be able and
our customers and partners to be able to
control what the bot is going to respond
depending on a customer behavior and we
want to be able to predefined us very
strictly even though on the end the body
is going to look kind of really more
human randomize like and so on we still
and home full control what the bot
actually answers are and behavior is
it's easy to integrate with existing
boats this is actually important topic
because you don't want if you want to
include smart or capabilities in your
existing box now you don't really want
to go and do major rework you want to be
easy to integrate probably copy paste
one line of code or something and then
you know go ahead high-level
capabilities which I'm going to
demonstrate yours one by one
currently you know it were not currently
but it works on top of the or
intelligent button will continue that
requires the intelligent bot intents and
entities to generate the response we
have at least 44 intense right now and
rapidly growing depending you know on
what capabilities additionally wanna add
the small response engine which I
mentioned
works between the NLP and the dialogue
engine in the bot it's currently it's
within a custom component the reason is
that we wanted to we integrate the
dialogue trees to allow more advanced
dialogue flows we don't want only to
have standardized dialogues but to be
able to in an easy way to define a
different dialogue trees and behaviors
depending on what the customer is asking
and what the customer is doing where
he's going what the previous intent was
and so on and so on if we start going
doing this in a dialogue throw in a
llamo for right now this is going to be
it could be a hard to define and at the
same time the current llamo flow doesn't
support dialogue three capabilities easy
to configure you know the dialogue does
dialog trees are actually based on JSON
files and for each entity you can
specify it specific capabilities inside
provides also very simple transparent
API if you want to programmatically add
additional capabilities if this is
required and of course multi-language
support as well some general questions
that the board can answer this is really
just the tip of the iceberg because
they're way more capabilities inside but
I found those slides somewhere were
sales pre-sales were requesting motor
capabilities and those are just some of
the questions so type of the questions
to imagine that the board should be able
to answer so if you go to the
demonstration and start let's try some
of those questions here so this is demo
is now on top of version 1 1 we test the
dysfunctional it also is 74 3 4 5 and 8
1 1 and so far work ok those versions
are not public yet of course but just
you know to make sure that it's working
so let's start and you know as some of
those questions
those are predefined dialogue trees
within our custom component which you
can customize so this is one potential
answer of that question made you you
know how much do you cost for example
now this is first interesting one
because here the but gave you an answer
but also ask a question if you want to
know more and yeah sure I want to know
more so tada you know this is a very
simple behavior but you know just to
demonstrate some some of the
capabilities so here you can see you
know we get answer now interesting is
because I'm still into that context I
can change also my mind and say no I
don't want you and then I still can get
out some you know reasonable answer now
I came up or try to came up with
something like demo script let's start
you know try it and see what what else
we could do so of course everyone
probably what I'd say you know hi hey
hey you know reading the but in my case
I predefined my name that's why it's
actually also answering hello to ludmil
you can also ask for how are you and oh
one second as you can see multi-language
support as well this is because I
predefined already here the German
language now let's go and try again
okay so English English back to English
you can also say to the boat for example
also how you feel I mean I feel good and
then good to hear please let me know and
so on and so on this is kind of basic
capabilities you specify now let's try
something else
let's try repeating questions for
example for us what do you leave we
start asking that question the boat is
house - well sorry then at certain point
realize okay you know
it's not funny to answer the same
question again because I continue asking
that question and here you will see
different type of responses you can
specify you can specify and is giving to
the user so there is a threshold here
you could utilize when you specify your
models and for example if you say ok you
can specify that it's a three so more
than three repeating answers then maybe
you want to even specific answer like
you know do you want me to connect her
with human assistance or something like
that but this is a general capability
you can utilize with a small strong you
can ask for example what else you could
do this is like asking for skills and
this is a simple general answered here
just to show you you know the
capabilities but let's imagine that you
are not happy with that answer so you
say well I'm not happy with that answer
so I say well sorry my skills don't
satisfy but I'm very flexible you can
teach me stuff blah blah blah and
actually even ask your question where
you can say yes I really want to
teaching your stuff so glad to hear and
can give you some bling or you know name
or telephone number whatsoever
now the interesting part here is that
actually here what we have we have an
answer of the second question of after
working with you for me when you say not
happy with that your answer the answer
you see here actually depends on what
previously has been asked so this is
additional capability where we utilize
decision tree where you can specify both
capabilities based on previous intense
and previous entities so if I asked and
if I was asking something else like for
example work will be weather today we
get some answer here if you say not
happy with the answer
and you know sorry to hear that so you
get something completely different now
because I didn't ask about skills so
this is something depending on any
intense here if the user was having
having unsatisfying experience bad
experience not happy whatsoever you can
actually specify what the answer in that
case could be depending on what the
previous intend user intent and entities
were unfortunately so far we don't have
the capability for sentiment analysis
within our intelligent environment but
once we having that this functionality
will be even more advanced for the
current capabilities
I'm having an intent which I call bad
experience were I'm going to try to
specify a number of intense utterances
were a thing that the user could you
know answer on on that experience you
can ask about feelings also you know
very simple one you can ask about
confidence also very interesting so for
example if you ask the question and then
after that you want you ask for
confirmation you can actually specify
the dialogue three to have a different
type of type of confirmation depending
on what previous question was for
example or previous answer was yes no or
date or whatsoever
another thing were interceptors are you
device so programmatic API is that even
though we have those days and files you
may want you introduced be able to do
some additional validation for example
in my case here it's already afternoon
but if I say good morning then the board
is going to answer in and it's not
morning right now it shows is afternoon
so this makes it's very simple checking
but basically will make the bottom or
smarter so if I say instead of morning
once afternoon then I'm going to get you
know the same is for example if I say
happy is nice for example
then the book is going to do this
validation again and I'm going to see
you know its most yet we still have 34
days to go if it was really Christmas
right now then you gonna get happy
Christmas sensor so let's try something
something else for example in a bad
experience here let me remove this one
here so I can show you what I mean so in
a bad experience this is a JSON file
where we specify our models for specific
intent so bad experience that name here
is exactly the same like the name that
have here they want one have to be
one-to-one because the response engine
used recognizer intent and entities from
the intelligent part to be able to
specify which way the sports model
should go I have a general answers like
sorry to hear that
if we remember this you can also the
print if if you were in a bad experience
intent so the user said something bad
and it's repeating this yes I do
whatsoever so sorry to hear that any yes
I do yes we do whatsoever you probably
would like to have a different answers
so the way the decision trees are
working decision trees are using those
properties here and depending on the
properties they can do one or many there
is no limitation you can nest a
different behaviors additionally to that
we have also actions actions are
additional properties which you want to
set up so that on the next user action
the decision tree will go in a different
direction for example if you ask for
skills let's try that what are your
skills so you get here response and this
response basically comes from the ask
skills capabilities the skills
capabilities are here within the
adjacent file so but if I say not happy
with the hands
what happens now is the intelligent boat
identified that actually I go to the bet
experienced intent and is going to go
through that model here that model
whoever within that model I have a
location where I specified for the
decision tree that if I know the last
hint and what a skills which I asked
already so you can have here a deep
those two answers so in my case here I'm
sorry to hear my skills brahbrah
so this is actually that answer here so
if you say if as you can see also it
asked me a question do you want to know
more so I can say now yes when I'm
getting response this responses if I
scroll scroll down here is going to be
that one so how this is actually working
is that when I specify this property
this property is going to be reused for
the next action and since I've been
asked question and I'm in a bad
experience intent when I answer with yes
and no that the last intent now is going
to be bad experience
I am already inside that however from
the previous answer I know also that our
set in particular action then yes and no
is the intelligent or entity in my case
our answer with yes so that I'm going to
get that answer here as you can see yes
and no that name here is exactly the
name you will find if you go to the
entities here yes and no so in the
current cases I am sure with yes but of
course I can also answer with no and
then I'm going to get that from that
response so let's say no then as you can
see I'm getting that response here now
for the purpose of the simplicity I
specify only one response however they
replace they could be more than one you
can actually you like this and now here
I another response
what you can also additionally us you
can specify more than one bubble for
example this here it's going to be
another bubble so the first is going to
be that bubble and then the second one
is going to appear as a second bubble
now this text property here is
completely flexible I'm using this only
to specify answers because this is a
small tour boat and I don't have
different capabilities so once the
decision tree decides that it's landing
here it's going to look into the replace
inside and it's going to take one of
those answers those answer is going to
be randomized and it's going after ones
randomized you get one by one without
repeating once they're no more you know
randomized and so if you take then it's
going to randomize them again it's going
to take them one by one again I'm killed
no one's worse available so that it's
very preferable that you specify high
amount answer see if you want to make
those two looks more human-like another
thing you will realize here is that for
example at the beginning of the sentence
I have something like well well right so
you may find out that there are actually
many works which are repeating again and
again and you don't want to you know you
don't want to have a several replace
here only because one word is changing
or only because specific wording in
changing well that purpose you can
specify some what I call features those
features basically give you the
capability to specify replace which a
single word or more than one or two
whatsoever or even two full sentences if
you see here on the end and you can
reuse them the way you reduce them is
for example if you go to our skills you
will see here I have a feature model so
la la which is you know funny way but
this is kind of an answer so la la so
well yeah so you don't want to have
three different replace here with well
and so on whatsoever
so I specify this one here so
every time the decision tree decides
that it's going to take that replay this
is going to be it's randomized and
select one randomize from all those
availabilities they have been a feature
and it's going to show it and then the
sentence itself another thing is that
you can use more than one in a single
sentence if you wish for example my
skills my capabilities my experience and
whatsoever you may want to change that
as well so you can actually have another
feature model here where you can say
skills wording or whatsoever and then
you can specify this wording here and
instead of supporting if you have a
skill wording and you can specify those
different different types of what you
want to have here this is going to be
randomized and it's going to be setup
here automatically for you so that even
though you have one replay you can have
a very lot of different variations of
the same sentence right so go back to
the high level capabilities this is
regarding their response engine and what
isn't doing together with the dialogue
trees another example for the dialogue
trees let's say for example a switch
what channels do you support so this is
the answer I'm getting right now and if
I say not happy with the answer and well
webhooks you can extend me and blah blah
blah blah blah
so this is a additional second here we
go alright I forget to remove that one
so I'm going to explain this directly so
when I say what channels do you support
I've got some response here from the
channel support JSON file
but then when I say I'm not happy with
the answer then I get additional answer
here and I'm not happy with the answer
if you remember it's going to go to the
buttock bad experience same time so if
you go to that far here bad experience
in tenth you will see here that let's
curl down oh here we go
this one here I just forgot to remove it
so here you have the last intent was
where I was asking for four channels
then additionally I have a variable here
which is going to be used as a property
action which is going to be used as a
property for the decision tree or next
time so well through the web hooks you
can extend me blah blah blah and then
there is as you can see the second
bubble here which is saying would you
like to learn more about me so you would
like to be able to add additionally the
capabilities for the decision tree to
know what you depending on it transfer
was yes or no so how to do that here we
go this one is repeating let me remove
that one so what you do is we know now
that we were already in bad experience
intent because we land up here though
this is this the decision tree is going
to go here only if I was in a bad
experience already another thing is that
for the decision tree is that
Jiri knows what last what the last
decision - what action is going to be so
I specified action here were answer on
channel support because I know that I
was going to asking something here and
if the answer is positive I want to say
okay great go to this and dad and let's
add another another model to the
decision tree where if this entity is no
I can say sorry to hear but if you want
to know more so go to this page so now
when I go back here and I and I start
from the
let's start again what your oh sorry
what channels do you support and I say
not happy with the answer then I get
this one I'm asking now something if I
want to know more and if I say yes then
okay great
go there if I want if I say no then
sorry to hear bla bla bla and
additionally as I said you can use
feature so for example okay for example
okay great is a repeating always and
always and maybe you want to have a
different stuff so maybe I can say
future model like we were having here
let me out one here and we can see here
in adjacent file let me see if you here
I'm happy to hear so let's get this one
here and put it here and so now we will
have a different every time we say yes
we have actually different beginnings so
this is just one example another thing
is go to that site for more information
for more info for whatsoever you can
change the other one as well if you wish
so you have a lot of flexibility you can
do the say also with sorry to hear you
can replace that so that if I say again
what channels do you support and not
happy with work and say yes then good to
hear to go to blah blah blah so we have
a capability here to define a different
something different now another thing
very important is that we were in a bad
experience now but from here since I
know that I'm here and I know the
deceased
that one here and if I go if I ask again
for for channel support now I can do
actually even something very complex I
can go back to my channel support here
as you can see this is pretty very you
know a simple answer but let another one
and now that I know that I was here and
I know that one
oops sorry let's go back and copy those
properties if I ask again and from
package bad experience and answer the
channel whatsoever even even by the
experience I just want this is just to
demonstrate you that actually you can
use chat you can use actions from
another look location into that decision
tree here then here you can say AHA this
is just example I see the experience was
alright so let's see what channels do
you support then you can say not happy
with the answer
now when I say not happy with the answer
I'm going to my definition here where I
see the channel support I see that
variable so the last thing ten is going
to be bad experience so if I ask again
what channels do support uh-huh I see
the experience was also bad this is a
little bit very simple more advanced
example for what else if you do between
a different intense using the properties
and actions to tell the decision tree
where you go
all right easy to configure I think this
is a very easy way to configure one
downside of course is that currently we
don't have a visual UI so everything we
do is in adjacent pass which is
something we need to change because
during time the models will get bigger
and bigger and this is going to be
harder to you know picture is everything
in your brain and because of the
flexibility here so we need a better way
to do that but it's configurable and you
don't have to modify any code anymore
provide transfer and API as I mentioned
we have the capabilities if you remember
if I say good morning or happy happy
this plus we have the capabilities to
check and you know those checking's and
additional logic this is of course very
hard to specify within the JSON file so
this is something you probably would
like to go and do some coding and the
way we do this is in the response edging
I have interceptors and those
interceptors are for intense currently I
want you to do is for example one a
day's date specific greeting like a
happy happy Christmas or happy
Valentine's Day or so ever I specify
additional interceptor and this
interceptor is going to be called before
the decision tree take a decision where
to go based on a JSON files so here is
you can change actually the behavior
when you change the properties and we
use so here I have what the current in
ten days I have the NLP this is from the
intelligent board here I can have access
to all the entities and everything else
that the API is giving me the properties
are the properties if you remember from
the first year so I still I don't have
access to the internal properties like
last intent but I have access to
everything else it and I can actually
also at my own properties on the fly if
I want you and if I think that I want to
change the behavior
of the decision tree additionally I have
also views views or variables which you
want to populate within the text so if
we go back here and you see in Smurfs
this is actually because I asked I said
already had in Smurfs and here I have 34
days this could be something else so I
do validation here where I get the
difference and I see okay if it's the
same that of course is his mas but if
it's the difference is higher and it's
positive it means that there are still
time at you hate Smurfs if it's after so
if it's a lower means that isthmus was a
few days ago months or whatsoever so
what I do here is an entity right I give
from the from the intelligent phone
entity date the original string
calculate the days and also I specify if
the date is wrong and if it's a positive
and negative so based on that if I open
now that model here I see those are the
default replace and basic you'll get one
of them if actually was really is must
today so again to you world and to you
as well whatsoever you can actually
specify also additionally like
additional text and you can say like
this happy entity but this is the ng
keyword this is the Christmas to you as
well so that this is going to be
utilized and it it's going to reuse it
so that it looks more human life now
here we have the properties where I have
the wrong day and the wrong day if you
go back to intent to the Interceptor
that's called over to the Interceptor it
here yeah oh sorry
here here we go
so in the properties where I additional
to specify my properties to be able to
change the behavior the decision and the
decision that the lock is going to the
response is going to take so this is
where I do that and here are my view
variables where I have the entity and I
have dates so if I go back here based on
what the value is is going to take
either this and this and here currently
I have only one answer but of course I
expect it by more than one answer that's
no problem
multi-language support of course when we
have all those capabilities here it will
be great if there is a easy way to reuse
all of this one other language without
really do much work so one way you could
do is now the way you do it is it's a
very simple one you copy the content of
what you have here and you create a copy
of the existing one and specify the
language on the end in current currently
what I do here is I specify for example
German and now you are completely
flexible of what you want to do here you
can just get the sentence as one by one
and translate them or depending on a
cultural behavior you probably would
like to use you know different model
because of different way how people
communicate it or whatsoever so it's
really up to you the easiest way is just
get up one and they use it here it
doesn't have to be in the same file you
can specify another directory or you can
spit you can just copy face the file and
just change the name of the file to have
de within so you know that it's for that
language additionally for the features
they're very easy to make multi-language
you also specify just de on the end so
if we go back to the to the feature JSON
file again it doesn't have to be only
one JSON file could be more than one so
you can have as much as you want three
for for that one you want to have
additional language you just specify de
and then you specify the language
you wanna have fun yeah so and then
everything is going to be use so very
easy way to do that and in that version
what we look forward to do next is to
have a visual interface to be able to
create the models so it's going to be
way easier because you can visualize and
see the dependencies between the intents
and the behavior in the decision tree
this is a little bit hard right now just
looking in adjacent forest but you know
still very flexible way another thing is
maybe additionally will be interesting
to implement behavior trees on top of
the decision trees to be able to kind of
give you a model a easier model where
you can define the behaviors because for
the behavior trees there is actually a
specification which gives you kind of a
model of how to do this and this could
be easily visualized as well maybe it's
nice to have picture but it's something
we will look for spons
additionally we want to extend the
amount of entities here to be able to
recognize more and more intense and make
this model smokes multiple smother I
will be interesting also to see if we
can a user fi q na within this motor box
so that the Q&amp;amp;A can learn from some
knowledge base and we can utilize
additionally those capabilities within
the small talk on top of that this is
also something interesting another thing
is that maybe we could you see like
utilize the resource bundles in one of
the next releases of the intelligent
both this is something which I don't
know for now because the resource
bundles does not allow us to specify
action and properties which is very
important for the decision trees but
maybe something to extend on one of the
next versions
another important thing is which I
didn't mention is about how to integrate
this motorboat within your your boat
so basically neon Yamba currently as you
can see the llamo is very simple here
because I'm just within the small talk
but in your boat you probably have your
own system intent where you recognize
specific actions specific intents so
what you do is and where it's will
resolve intent in an resort then you
specify your small talk intent and the
small talk intends basic is going to go
to the small talk boat
the reason is that the entities and the
intents from the small talk is something
you don't want to mix with your existing
but this is going to kind of a blurred
results from the machine learn
linguistic basing model so it's better
to keep them somewhere outside this also
helps us to constantly improving this
motor capabilities without asking do any
modification in your vault which is also
a big advantage this one here is going
to set up the I result variable and it's
going to pass to the Smalltalk component
that's one thing you have to do is you
have to integrate a small component
custom component within you have to
reuse it within your mo and it has to be
on in usually in one place you don't
need it on several places but this
really depends on how complicated your
mo logic right now is one thing you
realize here is that we have a confident
stress hole a minimum confident stress
hold the reason is that there is a small
limitation currently as you can see when
I ask question and intent is recognized
and I'm waiting for response I want to
be able to do you know to recognize what
the intents are again depending on the
response but also if you change the
intent and if I use the existing
capabilities to stay within within the
component until response then basically
I'm only getting the text response of
the user but is the
with something which could be recognized
from the entities this is not happening
for that reason I'm actually exiting
every time my component and waiting for
new response and then I'm checking the
confidence and the confidence there is a
gray area the gray area somewhere
between in my experience so far between
the zero six and zero zero four wait if
it's within that gray or it means that
the user actually asks something which
probably is new intent but I wasn't able
to recognize this with a good certainty
so I don't want actual answer from what
the decision trisko is to decide because
maybe it's going to look stupid so maybe
I just want to say okay Soria I can
recognize your intent can you repeat
your question again but level if it's a
below zero four four eight then for me
it means that I'm staying in the same
intent and I look for new entities so
this is the way how I am going to
recognize every time when you say yes or
no or today or whatever entity is for
the previous question if this is
required I probably will need to create
another video where I'm going to explain
how to use this response engine within a
custom components because as you can see
the logic it's the only one API call you
have to do here pass the properties
intent eventually variables like the
profile name in my case I just coded
this one here but it could be dynamic as
well and that's basically everything
that allows me to use all those models
here and for the decision tree to decide
where to go
additionally as you can see I have also
here some parsing of the entities which
I'm going to pass to my response type
model and that's everything thank you
very much and if you want to know more
go to that page here
I'm going to post traditionally links
where you can test a small talk book for
yourself by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
