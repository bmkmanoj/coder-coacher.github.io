host Javed Mohammed with Oracle
technology Network and I have as my
guest today Siddhartha a girl who is the
VP of Product Management and strategy
and he also gave the keynote speech this
morning
Siddhartha welcome thank you thank you
Javed so as we were talking a little bit
of off-camera said either the way we
kind of like to approach this is you
give them along with the a curve almost
like an hour-long keynote yeah it's hard
to encapsulate that I don't want you to
have to go to do that again so perhaps
we can treat this like a trailer just
touch upon some of the films that you
touched upon sure so if you were to kind
of just look at it from our overview
thing what are the kind of the keys the
keys themes from your keynote yeah the
key things that we focused in on was one
how do you do development really fast
using API first design paradigm second
how do you build micro services with a
very good continuous integration
continuous development pipeline so that
you can release fast third how can you
implement micro services and get them
into production easily and not have to
worry about orchestration scheduling etc
and finally how do you create an
engagement in a channel like chat bus
where instead of using mobile apps now
people are using their messaging
platform to engage with folks so how can
you use chat pots to consume that micro
service and those API that were defined
now is the overall for the scenario that
we were going through okay so from an
API first like what's the key I guess
messaging guys that you want to expect
that you again for the people who were
not able to attend or maybe to tune in
later what's the key thing you'd like to
get across I think the key thing is get
agreement on the contract on the API
contract and you know we just acquired a
company called apiary and gives you the
ability to who's who's actually hosted
live out of here yeah fraud yeah yes so
please Jacob is from a theory with the
CEO of hickory and
effectively what they did was they
created a platform where you could
define the API and define what the
return values etc would be if you call
the API and then would give it to
someone black person could actually test
it with a mock implementation that was
automatically created and then they
could say yeah that contract works or it
doesn't work so what it does is helps
you agree on the design and the contract
before you actually start implementing
the API so that reduces that improves
productivity quite significantly yeah so
that's the whole you know API design API
to invest more time in the API planning
of it before you start getting into the
implementation yes the design and the
contractor is great
second team I think you touched upon was
like what micro services is kind of the
in thing right now
what's like Oracle offering in the in
that space of what it was can do
messaging from the well I think the key
thing with Microsoft's is Microsoft
isn't easy if you think about it you
know your micro services are distributed
so they live and they die and you have
to use eventing based infrastructures to
be able to you know get the eventual
consistency on the data that is being
used by these micro services so what we
wanted to talk about is how we can make
Microsoft's is easy to implement one if
you think about docker containers we're
giving you a runtime where you don't
have to worry about how orchestration
happens how scheduling happens how load
balancing happens as a developer that's
taken care of for you
you just bring your micro services port
and get deployed in a runtime for you
and then the other pieces you know
monitoring the micro services not as
hard because you have a transaction that
might have multiple micro services
associate with it so we're not giving
you monitoring and management from the
cloud so you don't even have to install
a monitoring infrastructure on RAM and
it automatically learns you know what
micro sources that called based on
observing the transaction flow over time
if you understand the topology ourselves
and we're able to give you insight into
what the challenges might be by looking
at user experience data web app database
performance data and validating log
analytics all in the come
black forum community so yeah and I
think a Bruno touched upon it I think in
the introduction that a lot of our
products are a lot of articles products
are going to be available to through
darker is that kind of the future of
absolutely one of the churches the
channels for distribution yeah I think
that the you know we just recently did
an announcement with docker where docker
had something called docker hub docker
hub is a you know open platform where
anyone can publish a docker ID image so
when you think about enterprises or
companies looking at let's say deploying
Enterprise great software like Oracle
database Oracle WebLogic they want a
containerized image that is supported
docker hub didn't have that cuz there
were 80 different images for WebLogic or
database that someone has published down
docker stored they actually do the
certification we continue right Oracle
database Oracle WebLogic Oracle Corinth
not Java etc and made that available
through doctor store so now you can use
those on Prem elements and you can have
portability and ease of use of using the
Oracle database and WebLogic etc in your
container based environment you know I
mean it's definitely taking the on-prem
stack that we had and making that
available but then separately we have
all our cloud services that don't
necessarily need the the on Prem pieces
yeah great so the fourth area that you
talked about was relating to chat box
and you had a very nice demonstration of
yeah turtle by Golden State warrior
ticket yeah and I guess I get the thing
that struck me was it was much more than
just like a yes and no kind of a
dialogue there was a lot of depth and
intelligence in that one you want to
just talk a little bit about that and
again demonstration look the trend is
going towards people getting tired of
using mobile apps for example when you
want to check into a flight and if you
fly on different airline or 20 different
apps for each airline I feel the pain
firsthand it is coming here exactly
London Berlin and Prague yes yes so now
you know if you have a messaging
platform like facebook Messenger
and you can just friend the chat walk
for Delta or Lufthansa or British
Airways and say check in and you get
that taken care of for you just right
there you're done there's no and the
companies who release these apps don't
have to release the apps don't have to
maintain the applet cetera that's the
paradigm the people are moving towards
and what we're doing is we're making
sure that one we can connect with input
sources like Alexa Syria et cetera where
people are speaking and asking for
things right and so we're doing the
we're getting the speech-to-text from
Alexa and from that point forward would
be natural language processing and we
built an AI engine and a skate engine so
that the conversation can be learned
from over time so it becomes more and
more natural over time you know we're
giving you a platform for building
jackpot that works across different
messaging platforms that has AI built
into it that has natural language
processing built into it and most
importantly it's got the ability to
integrate with back-end platforms
because at the end of the day if you're
in the example that we showed you know
someone asked for what seats are
available but you got to go to the
inventory management system off the
stadium to understand what seats are
available and we make it very easy to
integrate into back-end systems so it's
very powerful but on a very personal
note use you actually share an example I
just have to say this that you imagine
you have a 15 year old or a 16 year old
daughter Vegas maybe it's your eldest I
don't know what the funny thing is it's
just interesting that you send emails
and email is like out of Vogue yeah it's
just not in yet so it just kind of
brings this point again but how
important the messaging apps are kind of
going forward in terms of kind of
consolidating I think you use the term
up fatigue yes
so absolutely I think a lot of exciting
things coming from Oracle and just in
the technology world
I mean final message you like to kind of
share with with the audience out there
now all I would say is you know come
give us a shot try out the Oracle cloud
it's open we're giving a choice of
programming languages Java PHP Ruby
we're giving a choice of databases
Oracle Mike
well Cassandra Hadoop we give you a
choice of shapes containers bare metal
VM serverless and very modern you know
we talked about microservices chat pots
etc so come give it a shot it's open
modern easy and give us feedback so we
can enhance that great last question
yeah is this your first time to Prague
of you've been here before oh this is my
first time to Prague you probably have
too much of a chance to look but what
are your impressions
well I landed last night at midnight
okay and I got here at 8 o'clock in the
morning so I think in the in the night
hours I didn't get much depression but
I'm really looking forward to maybe
spending some time today more in the
city learning a little bit more about
Prague and the Czech there's a lot of
history here and it's a little bit off
camera so we can't show it but there's a
great view from the venue yet so if
nothing else just come to the venue just
to check out the view yes and some of
the great demos and talks and everything
that are going on and in fact I mean it
is you have a record number of people
over 600 people here at the event so
it's wonderful ok thank you well thank
you and enjoy park and thanks everyone
for tuning in
