me as a matter of fact at 7p for me
because I'm from Germany I really like
jet like that makes a lot of sense to me
I'm going to take you on a little right
today right through the G Hara and I
have to apologize because I learned that
word means something in other languages
and I haven't thought about that you can
totally look that up I messed that up
fair enough I am working for red hat as
a so-called developer advocate this is
kind of guy who gets paid to talk at
conferences which is the good side the
downside is obviously traveling and
another good part of it is that I get
play with latest technologies so I
joined redhead more than a year ago and
before that I've been working as a
consultant in the field like for 14
years working with customers all across
the globe basically on java ee based
solutions and we've been doing all kinds
of things integration projects
multi-million dollar projects mostly
internal applications that just need to
support some business case i'm not
really digging into that but one thing
they all had in common they've been
heavily influenced by system integration
aspect so there's literally been no
shear java ee infrastructure it's always
been like host systems somewhere in the
basement like those scary boxes nobody
really wants to touch anymore nobody is
really able to power off and on again
because we don't know if it's still
running after that so those boxes we
really needed to get the data in there
and because we didn't know what exactly
it was we had to just integrate somehow
or databases like projects java projects
2 million lines of code no problem
looking at the host parts of it you have
eight million lines of peel sequel
buried in there well undocumented but
business is rest assured this stuff is
working okay fair enough I was a
responsible architect most of the time
so I had a bunch of guys helping me with
that solutions but one thing really
helped us all the way across all the
projects which was a patchy camel who
knows about apache camera already okay
fair who's using it in production super
so this is more like an entry-level kind
of presentation to give you a rough
overview but what the patchy camel is
and how to deploy it in production there
are various ways especially on java ee
application servers so this is the main
focus you see some wild flies here this
is obviously the right server to choose
if you're running around is anybody
using wildfly jboss EAP and production
Oh a couple of hands what else do we
have like weblogic oh thank god just a
few who has to run big blue oh my
apologies deepest apologies okay what
else we have like Tomcat based yeah
that's still the majority I guess it's a
very lightweight container anybody
running Tommy II okay at least your
tomcat guys you should really look into
Tommy II or maybe something else very
lightweight what flies as actually a
servlet distribution which is just 70
just 27 megabytes big so that might be a
feasible alternative for you okay how
does apache camel look like that's it a
box as a matter of fact the version
number should tell you that this is
really old logo because we're at 12 13
somewhere around that in the meantime so
this is literally the only picture of
apache camel i could find and believe me
it has never been in such a box so it's
never been shipped because it's all open
source
obviously it's software right it's a
framework kind of thingy um I was
looking for something to explain to
people who never got their hands on
Apache camel before and this is pretty
much the best picture I could come up
with so I like to think of it as a
toolbox for integration hmm okay it
doesn't work that much great integration
actually is something that puts together
various aspects of various systems into
a new system so in order to do that
people have spent a significant amount
of time doing those integration projects
and they came up with patterns and I
think this book is something that every
enterprise developer should have seen or
even read in the meantime even a German
guy was involved with that one so a
bunch of consultants put together their
knowledge about whatever millions of
integration projects they've been
running in their career and they came up
with a repeatable patterns how to really
integrate those systems and apache camel
actually is real implementation of this
so instead of having to draw powerpoint
slides with fancy boxes on them and tell
developers what to do as an architect
you could basically throw the complete
frame work at the developers and give
them a language because camel also has
reasonable java DSL so you could
implement integration patterns as a
java-based language and this is pretty
easy doesn't make any sense so far right
now we get to it I'm pretty sure so
white cow the y today actually every
Enterprise has something that we usually
know as those three-letter acronyms like
es bees like integration infrastructure
so why should I just throw in a
framework everywhere and make that
the integration back button seriously
it's a little bit more complicated than
that because we're not only talking
about those centralized infrastructure's
anymore they are insanely expensive most
of the time and very complex to develop
in usually my my most significant
significant example of that is like the
specialized edid that you need for those
kind of projects who is using jdeveloper
thank God I'll the download it alone is
like 4.5 gigabytes and it's not really
lightweight and agile which are still
the probably the best verb so I can
assign with that ide so instead of
building our ABS like we used to do
before with service buses connecting
some messages turning payload from one
format into the other doing some routing
and transformation on the way today's
infrastructures turn to look a little
bit different right now so even I can do
that talk without a reasonable bus word
which is microservices right so we are
splitting up our features and
functionalities a lot more these days
it's no longer the big business services
that we tend to integrate in years B's
it's more fine-grained and it goes
across the business and it should be
reusable and handle so as a matter of
fact those micro services are actually
produced by individual apps and those
apps actually are in full control of the
individual aspects so what we really
need to do is integrate something we
have a lot more services that we are
producing these days a lot more
lightweight so we can't just use a big
bloated ESB for everything so maybe we
just have a service that connects on the
back end as like a teensie application
to a lot of different resources and this
is where camel actually comes in because
we have different protocols and we have
different applications and standard
applications we need to actually have a
lot more late lightweight connectors to
make that happen and this is where where
camel really comes in because basically
all the integration problems have been
solved by the enterprise integration
patterns already so we don't have to
resolve those problems in every single
microservices plus we need a lot more
monitoring for example so we need a very
lightweight framework that easily plugs
into centralized monitoring and gives us
exactly what we need to build those
micro service based applications and
seriously what I still believe that the
real features and functionalities aren't
done by architects they are done by
developers and they don't need bacon
heavy and bloated stuff so what we
really really want we want it to be easy
and lightweight because we want to be
productive at the end of the day nobody
is really keen into looking XML files
and configuring routes and whatever so
this is my ultimate pitch for camel
because it's lightweight has a lot of
standard connectors that you can use out
of the box without even questioning and
you can use it like as a developer
because it supports the language we all
love just a double check is anybody
using anything else than Java and
production okay what Scala okay
okay as long as is not JavaScript I'm
fine Oh fair yeah congratulations you
need to give you a business card I
barely know anybody who can do that so
what is camel just coming back to it
it's an open-source integration library
you know Red Hat is all about open
source so camel is out there it has a
website you can download everything it's
ready for you to use right it's really
simple and lightweight and if you don't
want to use it on a Java EE application
server then you can even use it on a JVM
just bare metal you don't need to use an
application server but I know most of us
just have to if we tell productions to
just run a Fed jar somewhere on a JVM
operations is pretty unhappy about that
most of the time so anyway what else it
can be programmed and you don't have to
be an artist to draw some kind of fancy
features on a pain in an IDE which is a
big one and it really literally connects
to anything like databases like host
systems like it has no specialized
protocols SI ask providers whatever
thing you could come up with questions
yes by the way questions fire at will
right I'm here again I think kicks is
not part of it that's still a big IBM
thing but it should be easy to build
because camel is also extendable so you
could build your own connectors which is
something that you would have to pry it
in that case but shouldn't be a big
thing at all I haven't seen it so far
yes
yeah that's what we've what we've been
just discussing I don't know any
component but as I said yeah definitely
okay I forgot to bring goodies so
there's one promise i can make whoever
wants to have like my book which got
just released today it's kind of a mini
book like 80 pages just come to the
redhead booth i'll be there there are
plenty of copies so it's all about
integration in Java EE and modern design
patterns around that okay one thing I
definitely missed so far is tooling
because I said bloated ids is something
that I hate camel actually has a very
lightweight tulane that is easy to
handle and if you insist on drawings
things and I des you can still do that
so the jboss tools project is out there
it has a reasonable support for camel
unfortunately only XML files so you need
to be kind of a messages to really want
to use it I personally still in favor of
the java-based dsl sick of me talking
fair fair really fair so let's get to
some code even if it's not going to be
life coding I try to make something
happen so this is a simple example like
we have an incoming point and incoming
topic you whatever like the point where
messages enter our flow then we have
router and we decide on the payload if
it is a widget order in this case or if
it is some other order and in case of a
widget we really want that order to
proceed to the widget queue and jas
otherwise it just goes to the rest how
does that look like in Java EE like just
implement those kind of functionality
can't read it intentionally this is more
or less the code that you need to
implement to have like Lenny gb
connecting two different message queues
and just sending messages
round this is still Java e6 e7 will be a
little simpler at that point we might
even be able to read the code on that
slide but still the routing logic that
we really need to introspect the
messages is in there and you have to
code every little piece and we really
know how that payload looks like we
might even know an XPath expression to
figure out the exact point that we want
to know so implementing all that
seriously it doesn't make any sense why
not just have something like a language
maybe even something that looks like
Java let's say the only thing that we
really want to do is we want to look
into that order right we want to make a
choice if it's a widget or not and we
want to put that somewhere in another q
almost looks like Java what do we need
we are missing some parent a--this looks
better what else is missing hmm dots
right dot semicolons and almost there so
now we it would be best if we actually
know what you order widget and whatever
objects are so it's basically an
endpoint and the decision that we make
in that case like if it really is a
widget is an XPath expression so this is
all that we need to implement the
millions lines of code from java ee
plain java ee to make business decision
which is really straightforward don't
you think so looks easy to me and
actually it is that easy and camel in
the java DSL so this is what really got
me hooked up with camel back in the days
and i used that a lot in our integration
project because it just makes sense I
don't want developers to produce a lot
of infrastructure code around it and
just run it
an application server if a framework
could be that elegant I'm not lying so
this is the whole class code and I have
some examples of on my github / my fear
account if you really want to see some
of that code and life working examples
just get them from there there's a lot
of stuff up there so what we really did
here is we build a so-called route and
if you like a route is pretty much
everything that you need to implement a
certain business functionality it just
has a little bit finer granularity than
a service in this a way sense so this is
exactly what makes it really feasible as
a micro servers kind of alternative I
really like it I think it's cool don't
you okay it's almost new if you agree to
trying to entertain you but we'll see um
so you've seen the java dsl we're all
enterprise developers so what are we
missing next xml yes we can do xml too
so if you insist on using it just define
your camera routes and xml as i said the
tooling works best on that and i still
hate it what else groovy sure we can do
groovy I know nobody's using groovy but
might be a reasonable alternative
because it allows you to actually add
closures and use closures in camel this
isn't that important anymore with Java
as he ate but still maybe from time to
time so what else have we been missing
Scala right so we should do something
around Scala so actually there's a
scholar DSL so no matter what language
you're actually using to define your
business logic and very simple route
expressions I think we pretty much get
you covered what else you've seen
endpoints
simple ones what I admire about camel
second most actually is that you can
configure every existing endpoint every
existing component in camel via a URI so
there's no real magic there's no not a
lot of configuration and property files
and stuff like that so everything that
you have to do you can actually Express
as a URI which is comparable readable so
in that case we all feel obviously using
like a file component and we wanted to
read out of a folder which is in box /
orders and whenever we read something
out of it we actually want to delete
that file which makes sense right so as
soon somebody puts in an order in that
folder it's going to be processed by
camel and that makes sense it's not a
lot of Java code there's no property
file believe me we could just use that
class together with a camel framework
and camel will be doing the rest we had
n points / components to give you the
complete overview about camel this is
actually the closest we can get to in
terms of an architectural picture
everything is encapsulated by something
called a camel context so this is the
one thing that you have to launch and
the camel context can hold as many
routes as you would like them to hold
you can add the various components to
them and at the core like what makes
camel possible is the routing engine
that we have a bunch of different dsl's
for to actually implement the routing
logic if you want to see the full
component set which in the meantime is
more closer to 200 components than to
150 just go to the website I find a nice
picture of at least 150 components as
far as I know you can get a printed
version of that so there is a teeny
little
aight pixel you are all down there I
like it I actually would like to hang
that up in my office so I need to get it
anybody in the idea what that is doc
good point yeah that's actually a rest
and pointing camel so there's not a lot
of annotations and fancy application
configuration classes or other things
don't get me wrong jax-rs is cool i
really love it but camel can actually do
a lot more in a lot more compressed
sense and the one thing that I really
like is the description method here so
how do we document rest endpoints today
swagger right so and this is actually a
swagger integration for camel so you can
have a complete rest documentation
generated by camel out of the box
because there is a swagger component in
there and even the swagger is mostly
based on scholar you could easily make
that work even in java ee application
servers um ince my my daughter is
actually in school like she just became
6 last year i started to give homework
in my sessions so whenever you get hands
on that slides afterwards there's always
going to be like an eight-point URL down
there and if you want to know more about
an individual component or thing just
grab the slides afterwards go through
them and find all those eight pixel URLs
there's a lot of information varied in
that talks which I just barely can cover
and like an hour plus faq ok what else
is in camel we are missing data phones
so yes we need to not only route stuff
we also need to transform stuff right so
there's a bunch of data formats that
camel nose out of the box what is the
data format something like Jason right
Jason xml and if you really want to
convert something from one format to the
other with the java-based dsl it's just
a three line on most of the time you can
marshal Jason as easy as that or you can
read just ours as entries from somewhere
and generate JMS messages out of the
payload so whenever somebody writes a
new blog like I on my blog I solid on
that you can easily just grab that and
send yourself an email because there's
also an email component and it's a three
liner you don't have to mingle around
with the javamail API because it's all
covered in a component if you're not
excited by now I don't know what I
should do and i can tell you what I'm
not going to do so what else do we have
obviously there's a lot of soap involved
so we can all the apps right totally
that that's a lightweight framework
based understandable like for developer
understandable routing engine inside
your application that's exactly what
camel is I don't like to think of camel
as an ESB for various reasons I think
the biggest one is camo doesn't know
about scaling so it's a framework and
it's meant to be like your integration
tool box inside one teensy little
application you can do both with it it's
it's not a real crystal clear rule
engine by now there are other things out
there that can do that far better but if
you just don't need that much rules so
you can easily express them in code and
embed them in that language okay um are
we missing anything xml or shaoling
serialization string conversation yeah I
guess you got it what else do we have
we have support for at least 15
expression languages so who's been
playing around with the JavaScript on
the server nobody ok a few hands like
four to five so if you're brave enough
you could for example just integrate
groovy as a language maybe as an
expression in in your route or you could
just start to use some JavaScript I know
I know I I seriously I don't know reason
for that but anyway you could and
knowing that enterprises tend to really
restrict the solution space and just
don't offer you a lot of technology
features on the production side this
might be an easy way to just get
reasonable solvable new technology into
your technology stack Wow hey I'm
excited camel is really pretty and cool
and it combines a lot of technologies
and features that I never ever could use
in just a bare metal java ee server at
that point at least not with that less
code so teeny little recap at that point
we said it's an integration framework
that should be a little bit more clearer
now it has a bunch of pre-built
components and the real backbone of it
are the integration patterns at that
point we have various routing dsl's and
now we can define the endpoints at your
eyes XML we covered that no container
dependency so far so you could just
really run a bare metal ready-made
components expressions data for money
that's all we need isn't it so now on to
the hard part onto how to deploy it
inside a Java EE engine because actually
that's never been designed to run in a
Java EE container but it could and there
are various ways to do that anybody a
guess about how big camel is like in
megabytes download like as a core java
file only camel corps
come on make it guess wake up just shoot
it up five megabytes more or less 20
okay fair 2.8 you can easily package
that in a web application that's not a
big issue nobody would notice just throw
it in there and use it and I can tell
your operations will never find out so
it's really easy you have a bunch of
deployment options for camel in general
and they are all supported so you can
run stand alone you can even run it in
spring Java EE and I think it works best
in those GI based environments
containers just you name them even
weblogic even websphere unbelievable I
think one of Europeans not the biggest
but one of the bigger European
broadcasting stations actually use camel
on top of weblogic for all their
streaming and routing demands so it can
be done camel and Java is just a love
story that starts to shape up for most
people so what options do you have
actually there is a way to boost strap
camel so you need to start the camel
context that's the biggest thing that
you need to kind of hook everything into
your java application server the easiest
way to actually is do that we are the
camel CDI extension so again there's a
little blog post down here how to get
that done on top of Wild fly in that
case but its sheer java ee 7 you don't
have to do a lot you just inject the
camel CDI context start the route you
can do that in any bootstrap java ee our
artifact that you know of like servlet
initialization class or whatever what
you definitely should keep in mind if
you go down that route not all of camels
components are probably working like you
expect them to do for example one of my
favorite
is actually the camel jpa component it
heavily relies on spring technology
internally and also uses hibernate as a
GP am implementation if you just
randomly throw that in some other
container like from the big vendors that
might bring you into trouble because
they don't know each other and they
don't understand each other very well
plus the deployments get tend to get
really large like only camel corps is
two point eight megabytes big that adds
all the modules that you potentially
need and it's also pretty easy knowing
that there's a lot of spring and caramel
underneath to get a web application that
gets bigger than 30 megabytes and i'm
not sure we really want that plus you
get some issues with class loading why
do I still have that solution on my
slides because it might be a solution if
you just need one particular feature
from let's say two or three different
endpoints i would say that still
reasonable to use that deployment
version if you want to be sure you can
actually create separate modules this is
very well fly specific so you can
encapsulate everything that you need
from camel including the modules as a
wild fly server module and just have
that as a server level so you could
easily use it that's fares you a bunch
of issues around class loading I know
that for other vendors they put
everything in the server class pass
approach might work too looking
especially at that European TV vendor so
they found a working solution this is
not supported this is comparable ii-era
thrown because the module definitions
aren't out there so you really have to
dig through your modules and see which
dependencies are really in there so it's
kind of manual process just as reference
down there
you can do it
okay question about spring versions
versus embedded camel spring version
honestly I don't know I expect them to
collide at some place sooner or later
just because of the class loading issues
and web applications and the same is
pretty much the answer for the jpa
question you can just switch
implementations underneath that's not
working so even if you go down the
server classpath module around you you
pretty much have to mingle around a bit
and see if you can make it work the blog
posts out there from the community are
kind of helpful but might be a solution
to your problem if you need a little
more modules than via the CDI sub
approach the really correct way of using
it in one java ee server is actually to
use the complete subsystem so the camel
community and especially we guys from
Red Hat JBoss have been working on on a
complete subsystem for a wild fly that
also encapsulate sand integrates all the
various java ee features so they're kind
of bridges between for example the JPA
component in camel and the JPA features
and wild fly and you could more or less
easily use that without running into any
class past issues so this is probably
the number one way to go assuming that
you're already using what fly and I have
a feeling that some sort of support is
coming soonish so if you don't want to
run community solutions and production I
totally feel you so maybe EAP is the
right thing for you to watch out for how
does that look like pretty much the same
you also have to inject kind of contacts
the camel context and you can directly
map resources internally and configure
your components which are all available
like you
the JMS component you don't have to
configure it via XML front up you can
all do that in code and just work with
camel and all the Java EE related
specifications even if you go down that
road the camel subsystem doesn't really
contain all components by now they are
catching up and with every release I
think we're at 3.0 right now there are
more and more camel components added to
the mix so I think we're striving for
100 percentage but we're not there yet
it's still under heavy development so
you really need to do some some cycles
on that and the component base is still
growing bottom line for me camel and
Java EE are awesome and it works and you
could easily sit back and relax and just
right into the Sun down at that point
and honestly users are really telling us
that we're doing it right at that point
camel rocks and development I've told
you you can run it on the JVM so unit
tests with camel just spin them up on
the JVM bootstrap camel yourself it's
easy as that no application server
startup and even if one fly is lightning
fast I know others aren't and we don't
want to wait 15 minutes for us of a
restart right so that's easy it's
comparable easy to get started because
there's a lot of documentation out there
and you can really start with very small
projects and brush up your knowledge and
get into the whole component and
ecosystem of camel people want more
tooling which is something I don't get
but okay fair enough the tooling that we
have works and might be enough of you
already own on eclipse just because I'm
curious personally who's using netbeans
two three four or five great funny the
rest this is bound to eclipse okay fifty
percent so what's left jetbrains right
uh huh what what else now I'm curious
emacs okay fair enough okay I don't have
to leave where you maximum sorry people
actually also want to scale those micro
services / routes to thousands of
instances and they might also want to
have a reasonable way of pushing
everything into production like fully
automated so honestly can't this is
where camel can't deliver at that point
where something really is missing and a
lot of cloudy requirements are in there
right so the question was how to make a
camel cares a cloud well actually we
have something something I really like
it's called fabric eight and the fabric
aids it's another open source project it
doesn't really as any to anything to do
with camel it's more about putting
things into production and managing your
middleware infrastructures in general so
instead of an integration framework
fabric eight actually is an integration
platform and its really designed to make
the complete deployment manageable even
if you scale up to millions of instances
let's say thousands I don't want to
overestimate that and it also helps you
staging your applications through the
various environments that you might have
and it goes far beyond that because we
all know that it requires a lot to
actually configure like Java EE
application server you need a bunch of
server-side configuration files you need
to configure your gem ask use and
whatnot so to really provision configure
and manage everything that has to do
with your java ee middleware
applications discover those services
probably load balance them and have a
good way to scale them out to various
instances
this is what fabric aid can do for you
and camel fits nicely into all that at
the very moment we you have two basic
and major branches of fabricate out
there one is the v1 version which is no
longer actively developed at the very
moment it uses a lot of well-known
community technologies like zookeeper
and geared and was basically initially
designed to scale out Apache craft-based
JVM based solutions so it actually
orchestrates your complete middleware
implementation it delivers registry
profiles so you're not only packaging
like your application via maven and have
it described in a pom file but you're
taking that even further like your
packaging your complete stack including
the application server plus your
application plus the configuration in a
profile I think that's the best picture
I could come up with at that point so as
a developer on the left side you define
not only your application but the
complete configuration of it and fabric
aid allows you to distribute that to
various instances I'm not going to show
you a demo this is something that you
just need to keep in mind if you have
issues around that yeah this is actually
the new version so the fabricate v2
which is actively developed at the very
moment shifted focus a little bit so if
i told you about profiles this is
comparable with what we know of images
right now in the darker world so I mean
they are pretty much the same right we
want to package our complete application
plus the stack that we need to run it so
this is what fabric aid really really
have seen the complete team decided to
move into the direction of doctoring
benitez at that point and they integrate
exactly with open shift at that point so
they have a lot of developer tooling
that can talk to open shift based
instances and roll out your defined
images fabricate defined images into
those infrastructures it's actually yeah
it's a it's a mixture it's using the
open shift api's it's also using the
communities AP is directly and it can
even run on google container engine so
there's no one on one relationship open
shift is one target platform for
fabricate at that point there are many
others it still states will support it
actually does support if you put them
next to each other and compare them a
little bit so it's more or less profiles
versus images plus all the nice little
buzz words that we know around darker
and communities how to get your hands on
it it's easy download and get started
because it's open source it's free it's
out there get your hands on it and while
you're at it if you have anything that
you want as a feature in there please
contribute open source communities are
really growing by sharing and not only
solutions but also problems so every
project has issue trackers has a
community to talk to like IRC channels
mailing lists you name them whenever you
have a chance to look at the button
labeled community on the websites just
click it and you see how to reach out to
the complete development teams and
please just contribute the tooling is
this intentionally also screenshot easy
to use give it a give it a try what to
do if you want to know more there's a
bunch of examples out there on the camel
website the only drawback so far I'm
heavily evangelizing the java-based dsl
most of the examples rely on spring and
blueprint so if you really want to find
example
it's probably the best to just come up
with your own at that point for the java
dsl especially so they're a bunch of
books camel in action is actually
revamped at the very moment as we are
speaking so close if ssin is building a
second edition of that it's available in
early access at the very moment what
else do we have as I said mailing list
Stack Overflow IOC rooms wherever you
want to go just reach out to the
community that's what they live for like
your feedback what works what doesn't
work please take that time what else if
you need support around camel this is
where you have what you have to look out
for this is red at javas fuse and red at
JB's few service works there's a website
up on camel data work to learn more
about that in general just a heads up
for everybody who is interested in the
broader gaybies ecosystem we are running
a virtual jae bok we have a bunch of
interesting sessions like at least once
a month which you could just join for
free mil européen times seven pm-ish i
guess so should be around early noon for
you always good for coffee to educate
yourself about new technologies just go
to the VJ bug where we are there and
actually as a matter of fact redhead is
running some mini theatre booth sessions
at javaone so whenever you get a chance
to drop by the schedule is also
published I think of my blog plus I said
if you're interested in how to evolve
java ee applications in general like
into the microservices space this is
what i have for you like the mini book
like we're talking about 80 pages it's
not like Bible it's something to get you
started to get your lot more pointers
about your next steps with Java EE and
where to look at in terms of outer
architecture like fabric a door features
like that so we have some print out
copies at the booth and you're very
welcome to join
for everything like stickers and
t-shirts and whatever you can think of
thank you if you have questions fired
well I'm here no it's not there's also a
lot of mq stuff IBM mq that you could
use um I don't think it's heavily tied
to activemq I've seen many solutions and
that's bad yeah acta function you can
plug in almost everything as far as i
know but the white plays subsystem
actually is using active and q in terms
of what transactions is a complex topic
camel supports that but i can't exactly
give you a two-sentence pitch about it
right now so you're very welcome to
discuss that it integrates with JTA as a
spec with a java ee server so that's
what the subsystem at least does if you
are using one of the other two options
you're not integrated and you're not
running inside the JTA contacts about
exception handling and monitoring
yes it's their monitoring is the easy
answer because camel supports a project
which is called jolokia which exposes
jmx metrics to Jason and there's another
like you I which is also bundled and
fuse fuse which is called hot I oh so
you could basically get all the runtime
information about routes into your
consoles so monitoring is easy exception
handling is like compensating
transaction stuff like that compensating
actions that you have to explicitly
model but it's there is something around
that questions here
no no it's not that spring transaction
idling right internally
yeah I did not like is like it's pretty
it's pretty much not the right
description I think camel is no es be I
think it just don't scale the way annie
is be usually should so camel is a
framework does that answer your question
that's another story I'm talking about
camel just as a framework here not about
fuse and everything we add to the mix
totally different story and exactly the
solution what you're looking for I'm
sorry ok speak up a lipid I barely hear
you
with
I can belly he can we do that in a
one-on-one afterwards okay thanks yeah
clustering support by camel zero camel
framework 0 okay I'm here for a while so
let's just stop the recording year let
free the room for the next speaker
thanks for being here was my pleasure
