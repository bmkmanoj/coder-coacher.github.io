session first of all if anyone tried to
go to a couple of my sessions before and
failed because I wasn't there I'm very
very sorry I've been having sleep
deprivation for the last few days and if
anyone's head that had that it's really
not nice but hey I'm here and I'll
hopefully be here for an hour
mostly vertical as well so we're good at
the minute but I will give this full
talk for those of you who probably
misread the title before this is the to
productivity tips for Java EE spring
developers so no I'm joking of course
this is the ten the ten tips for Java
developers we're gonna be talking about
Java EE a little bit I'm gonna be
talking about spring a little bit as
well I did actually originally I've
given this presentation a couple of
times over the last few years and I did
actually mean this week to turn it into
a full live coding demo but it's only
actually I could have a part live coding
demo because I because I've been poorly
I haven't had the time to do that so I
apologize in advance
but there's plenty of live coding in it
so don't worry about that
okay a little bit about myself so far so
I'm a developer advocate zero turnaround
I'm coming up to around four years at
zero turn around now before that I was a
developer on WebSphere application
server for about twelve years
any WebSphere users I've got a really
good productivity tip for you know I'm
also I'm also big into my community
community so I'm the founder of the
virtual jug anyone heard of the virtual
jug before few people we actually won we
actually won a Juke Choice Award
yesterday which is super cool and the
virtual jug is an entirely online java
user group and we're actually doing a
reading called v jug 24 next week which
is a 24 hour solid conference which that
minute given I'm not sleeping is
actually probably kind of a good thing
to do actually make make use of all my
hours of the day but that's what we're
doing next week
other things job champion job one rock
star and I do a lot of a lot of pieces
for rebel labs as well which is a
technology blog that we have on this
area turnaround site one of the reports
that we did
rapport is 10 kick-ass technologies
modern developers love and for some some
of these options were around
productivity other options were just
because they're great tools that
developers love and we're going to be
looking at some of these some which
weren't in this report but we're going
to have a mix as I say this is a free
report so do feel free to download that
as well ok so first of all we talk about
productivity as as a word first of all
who thinks they're productive right now
as a developer a few some people may be
too modest some people may be not we
need to understand what productivity is
is it just about making a slow thing
fast or are there actually more things
intimate I produced a couple of a couple
of ideas as to what productivity
actually is first of all removing
non-essential tasks tasks that we do day
in day out that we might not even
realize are necessary in our jobs who's
heard of this great story about the
monkeys and the banana and just only a
couple of people any few people right
I'll tell this for the rest of you then
but there was this supposed study I'm
not sure if it actually happened or not
but this is the supposed study they put
five monkeys in a room they put a ladder
with a Widow's with a bunch of bananas
at the top of the ladder and had this
hose which they'd spray the monkeys but
they'd only spray them when when a
monkey tried to go up the ladder and get
the bananas and the horse they sprayed
all the monkeys when one monkey tried to
go up to get the bananas and so they
caught on to this and they realized we
don't go up the we don't go up the
ladder because all we do is get sprayed
we don't get the bananas then what they
did was they took one of these
conditioned monkeys out of the bunch and
put a fresh monkey who didn't know these
rules into them into this group of
monkeys of course this monkey goes
straight up the ladder but before he can
get to the bananas all the other monkeys
go up to him and they start beating the
crap out of this poor monkey but not you
know and the monkey doesn't understand
why he's thinking there's bananas there
and they keep doing that they keep
removing a conditioned monkey and
putting a fresh monkey in until all the
monkeys have never been sprayed but
they're stopping other monkey they're
stopping new monkeys from going up the
ladder to get the bananas
so what they're doing is they're
applying that there they're actually
being very sensible they've created a
rule they're following that rule but
they have no idea why they're doing it
and what the purpose is they don't know
what the consequence is of a monkey
going up to get the bananas but they
will not do it and this is very very
similar to us in our lives we know we do
things because that's the way they're
done but we we need to step back and ask
do we need to do this is this actually a
reasonable step in our development or in
our lives that we need to do this
anymore
and that questioning is much much easier
when we when we come to a new job or a
new task and we look at things with a
fresh mind and we ask ourselves why am I
doing this
but so it's very very important to
understand and in our current work is
this still necessary what is the
reasoning behind me doing this another
thing that we you know that we need to
do is optimize existing tasks where
we're doing tasks that we absolutely
need to do can we optimize them down for
example in the last 10 years or so I've
increased my productivity on my Smiley's
by 33% I'm very proud of them retaining
awesome tasked and this is very very key
as well because when we talk about
productivity
if we turn productivity into our goal we
can very actually easily lose sight of
our real goal and our goal isn't to be
as productive as possible as as quick as
possible it's to actually is to actually
satisfy our requirements being
productive in doing that is very
important but that's not our goal so
speed is not our goal speed is just a
measure of how fast we reach our goal so
by trying to do things faster we need to
make sure we don't actually damage what
we're actually trying to do ok so Before
we jump into some code one thing I wanna
talk about very very quickly is is how
we communicate in teams I work for a
companies they're a turnaround where we
have a Boston team a prog team couple of
teams in Estonia but no London team and
as you possibly guessed from my accent I
live just outside London so I work for
my home office so it's very very
important for me to be able to
communicate very easily with all the
different teams around the world not
just picking up the phone or or talking
to someone over Skype
but also in the way I work with my with
my tasks with my jurors with whatever
tools you use who works with someone
whose remote all works remote themselves
a very reasonable number of the
population so this is very very
important so we want to share the noise
very very quickly
and it isn't just about it isn't just
about technology it's about the way we
go about you know things like meetings a
scrum meetings and things like that
depending on how we work finding
something that works for us as a team
that we all agree on that's the most
important thing there is no golden
bullet or silver bullet or any other
color bullet well there are colors of
bullets but but you know there is no
one-size-fits-all it's what matters for
your team we find slack is very very
useful and the three reasons or that's
the main reason I'll say that we find
slack very very useful is the open door
chat policy because if you as to imagine
something a little bit like slack no not
slack like Skype you have to be invited
into a group in Skype and that that
turns something into very something that
is very exclusive if you're not in that
group you won't hear about whatever I
can't just join a group in in Skype like
I can slack whereas what I do now is I'm
only members of a group in slack if I'm
call to that group if there's anything
else that I actually want I'll drop into
a slack group type a few messages get
the answer and then drop out of that and
it makes it a very very productive
meaningful communication there's also a
bunch of other things like smart
integrations I'm pretty much sure I'd
say 90% of people would use Atlassian
tolling who uses Atlassian tolling here
a very very large number of people I did
this session in day focus where I asked
in the end I actually switched the
conversation the question round I asked
who wasn't using Atlassian tooling I
think seven people out of 700 in the
room didn't use Atlassian tooling of
some sort and one of the great things
about Atlassian tolling is the
integrations with many other products
like we have integrations into our slack
channels so that when we're mentioned
for example on a comment or in a
description we automatically get a ping
straight up on slack to tell me what
what was said about me or about one of
my tasks in that in that slack sure
also their interactions between their
products are very very key but I want to
start coding and get my hands dirty in
some code so let's talk about something
first around Java EE and well doesn't
have to be about Java EE but in this
case we're gonna be using Forge for a
Java EE application who's used Forge
before JBoss Forge
not many people who's heard of forge a
few more okay Forge has actually become
very very well-known recently probably
be more out of their minecraft modding
which has you know a lot of a lot of
kids are getting into now and you can
use Forge in order to do that but if
you're a Java EE developer one of the
things that is very very useful is to is
to actually scaffold your application
very very quickly because as we know
Java EE applications aren't the lightest
of beasts there is a lot of artifacts
there is a lot of boilerplate that needs
to be written so if we can do something
if we can use a terminal or a console
that can automatically generate that for
us then we're laughing so what I'm going
to do for you in the next however many
minutes is I'm going to create a Java EE
application which is going to use some
bean validation maybe some JPA and we're
going to deploy that onto wildfly and
i'm gonna duel that with maybe some JSF
as my front end and we'll do all that
deploy it and run some tests without
writing a single line of code who
believes me a couple of people put me
the same people with forged experience
right okay so we it's also plug in base
which I which I'll talk about in a
little in a little sec but what I'm
gonna do is I've got this is that big
enough font at the back yeah good okay
so what I'm going to do initially is is
run Forge and you can download Forge in
a number of different ways you can do it
for your IDs you can do it for your for
just that the main main terminal here
and we know this is going to be an
amazing product straight away because it
has ASCII art and ASCII art is a very
understated thing in products not many
products
have them but as we'll see later very
very class products happens they Forge
here we are we're in the forge terminal
so what do we have
well we're in the workspace directory if
I was to see where we are
wow it's a little bit slow we can we
have our file system we can see our file
system where a terminal within a
terminal as it were one of the other
things we can do is we can see the files
where we're in this is these are
actually although all the projects in my
Eclipse workspace I could also hit tab
and it will tell me all the operations
that I can run in forge so it's it's a
it's a really nice easy to use terminal
where we can see our command we've got
tab completion on our commands and it's
actually kind of very linux e very nice
and easy to use
so the first thing I want to do is I
want to create a new project so I can
see all the commands that I could
potentially run here I'm gonna use
project new so I start typing project
new if I hit tab then we can see the
list of we can see the list of options
in four words that we can use the
colored options there the green one is
the mandatory option this is the option
that I have to use I have to pass in in
my in my command so I'm going to I'm
going to type in named and let's let's
be really original we're a Java one demo
how about that anything else I don't
think I'll one of the thing where we
could mention here is we can add a build
system in here I tab and it
automatically tab completes to maven if
I did want to add other things in like
Gradle for example I would need to add I
need to install the add-on and then I
could use Gradle two to create that as
well but if I just remove this that'll
create me my my project so there we go
Java one demo has been created you'll
notice I actually change where I am from
workspace into Java one demo if I type
ls' we can see I've got a classic maven
tree so pom.xml and a source I can cat
my upon XML and what do we see well
we're using Java 1.7 we're going to be
packaging a wall we that's pretty much
it we've got some some usual naming but
it's a pretty standard maven build
how many people are using maven here
today how many people using Gradle for
there for their main apps Wow
interesting and just for lulz how many
people are using SBT one person that's
very high hand that you've heard they're
very proud of SPG's say again
oh you love maven okay okay so let's
talk about let's talk about Bill
twosomes actually very briefly let's
talk about Gradle them before we move on
and that let's talk about Gradle Gradle
we actually did a very very recent study
about how many people are using Gradle
compared to maven and while we were
expecting Gradle usage to be very very
high what actually turned out was maven
it's actually increasing its lead over
over Gradle we actually wrote a build
tool report which talks about how you
can get about using Gradle if you wanted
to start learning that as well as maven
and things like that but I think mostly
people know maven already and want to
maybe learn a little bit more about
Gradle here are some here are some
interesting results that we got from our
time runs so we're actually using I
think this was I think this was building
Jenkins I think or something like that
and what we essentially did was we timed
five runs across each of the each the
build systems Gradle I think was using a
da Gradle is using a demon here and what
the Gradle daemon does it's quite
interesting is it's that it's
effectively running this process in the
background it's a daemon process
obviously and when when you require to
do a Gradle build what you can do is you
can put you're effectively passing the
build over to this existing process so
you lose a lot of the initialization
time that maven perhaps might take in
starting up getting everything getting
everything loaded so we see there's not
actually much of a difference really
great old Gradle is a little bit faster
Anton IV is pretty much at the ballpark
here with 135 seconds but that's really
down to IV being poor it's dependency
management in terms of support
putting the different build environments
they're actually not that different not
that much different particularly now
Gradle has actually become a first-class
citizen among a lot of its support one
of the bigger things I think that really
you would need to understand when you're
picking your build system is a couple of
things really about the experience
within your team so what is your team
more experienced in is it maven is it
Gradle is there enough in Gradle future
for you to need to go for that one of
the other things with Gradle is it uses
a groovy DSL rather than a typical XML
style config which some people may not
be too happy about some people may be a
little bit scared of groovy but you know
grebes is actually a very simple
language to learn beyond Java there's
not actually that much it's not like a
kind of Scala where it's a lot higher
shelf to learn okay so let's go back to
here then this is so we've got AB we're
sticking with maven and what I want to
do is I want to hit tab now we've got
123 possibilities and when I hit yes
let's see them all we've got a whole
bunch and it's it's very sensitive to
where we are in our directory structure
to what options Forge will give us so
for example now we're in a group now
we're in a Java project it's offering us
things like JPA for example so JPA
let's create a new entity so let's go
ahead and do that so let's go JPA oops
new entity oops my typing today new
entity and we can see we're going to
have and named what should we call it
I'm used to sitting aiming someone shout
something out person that's that's
rubbish I don't want person I don't want
book session mmm anything else better
food anything else monkey there we go
now we're talking right monkey what else
can we choose well I could choose
provider if I wanted to whoops provider
and if I hit tab on that we can see all
the JPA providers that we might want to
use
hibernate would be the default but if we
were using maybe Tommy for example we
could use open JPA for example I'm just
going to use the default which is which
is going to be hibernate a couple of
other things we could do we could
actually pick JP a version if we wanted
to and see which version we want to zero
or two one so it gives us all the
options it's really really nice in terms
of us not making mistakes because
everything's in front of us so I just
create a new entity called monkey we're
now in monkey Java I don't know why I'm
pointing to my screen but there we go
monkey Java at the bottom if I was to
tab there we get a lot of the same
options but now we can actually do
things with that so for example let's
create a new field actually now before I
go any further let's actually show you
what's happening I'm going to import in
Eclipse I'm going to import an existing
maven project in my documents workspace
and deselect all what did I call it Java
one demo there we go so let's actually
see what what's being created now under
the covers so we have a maven build
system all the usuals our main Java or
our tests Java we have or Java one demo
model and in there we have our monkey
entity in a monkey entity it's created
us an ID in fact we can actually see now
we're in monkey Java if I type ls' we
can see the class definition in forge as
well so I can see okay I've got I've got
an ID which is in a column called ID I
have a version which is in a column
called version and we get some nice
getters and setters we get a very nice
two string as well so it adds us these
nice things that we can print out
objects nicely and so forth equals hash
code that kind of thing so if I want oh
one other thing I want to show you as
well here is a persistence XML because
we created JP entity what we also
created was persistence XML so here's
our positions XML using hibernate
hibernate persistence is our provider
and it does it all for us we didn't need
to touch anything
I still haven't written a single line of
code so what are we gonna do now let's
let's create a new and no let's create a
new field new field and let's go named
which we call it but now of course
banana let's add a column name so we can
say we're going to map this to fruit we
could do some other things if we want we
could say R - I don't we say why don't
we say bananas whoops I say bananas and
then we'll make this of type int and if
I tab you can see that all the different
types and I make that have type int so
now we've got bananas how many bananas
does the monkey have and we can you know
pass that in as an integer we can see we
have a setter we can see we have a
getter in if I go back to my my monkey
dot Java we'll also see we have bananas
here and it'll it's also it also will
have been added to my string my - string
field so it's adding a lot of the nice
code for me and all I'm doing is just
typing in some some consoles so get
bananas is going to be an INT one of the
things that we could do if we wanted to
is we could say no that's just we could
say constraint - add what is it going to
do is going to add a constraint on a
specific field so we could say
on-property bananas and you'll notice it
actually tab completed that prop that
property as well I can see all the
properties that on my on my monkey Java
entity so I'll say on bananas and I'll
add the constraint and you know here we
can do whatever but in this case I'll
just say I've know something nice and
simple not null and we can add our
constraints and do whatever we want with
our constraints here so you can actually
add your own constraint files
coming back here you'll now see that
we've added bean validation so we've got
validation on our entity so we're doing
some bean validation if I come back up
to the top you can also see we have
added not null and while that was
actually a lot of text to create a a
constraint which was actually quicker to
type into the source code myself if it
was a more complex constraint I know
I'll be following the right pattern from
from forge so this is all very nice and
good what else can we do let's now
scaffold this up so what I'm going to
type is what is it scaffold scaffold
generate and from here I'm gonna add a
target and this is going to be my my
entities this is the monkey entity so I
scaffold generate and when you actually
do scape what I should have shown you
actually when I actually do that you can
add a provider and the provider in this
case is just going to be faces so just
some plain JSF but if you added add-ons
you could do angularjs or whatever you
whatever you wanted to do as long as you
just plug it into a forge to allow you
to do that so coming back now to let's
refresh this so now will hopefully see
some view and in monkey being we've got
some interesting things here so we've
got some EJB like stuff and this should
hopefully this should hopefully be
enough to actually be able to build my
app and actually use my app but we're in
2016 and we love rest
so let's generate some some rest
endpoints from the entities that we have
from here all I need is just to target
my endpoint and my endpoint is
huh that's interesting oh yes sorry
thank you there we go thank you very
much
point my endpoint and all of a sudden
we're gonna have some rest now so that's
refresh here and we have some rest and
if I go in here look at my monkey end
points we have monkeys as my as my path
from my endpoint so we've done enough
now I don't want it I don't want to and
also one thing you'll notice is we're
actually using our existing persistence
unit here as well so we're actually
using everything that we're generating
is there's good integrations between
each of the components so let's now
build this up we want to actually create
our Wharf our I won't actually run any
maven commands straightaway because this
is actually being covered by Forge so I
wouldn't directly run maven from Forge
what I'm going to do is just type build
and this is actually going to run maven
under the covers obviously because this
is a maven project and there we have
build success so if I was to let's come
out a few source
one more here we go in here if I was to
CD into target and do LS we can see our
java one demo dot war files to copy that
to a location which is going to be in my
downloads i did this this morning so i
should know where it is wildfly ten
final stand-alone deployments let's pop
it there you'll notice this little thing
turning at the top here hopefully that's
going to deploy it looks good so this is
my running my running server so let's
come over here and type HTTP localhost
8080 and my project was called java one
demo and welcome to forge and there's
our entity monkey so I can click on my
entity and all of a sudden we can see
bananas and I can actually say let's
create some entities so all let's create
some entries in that so let's have one
two
oops what happened then to create new
three and now we're here testing our
application so another thing we could do
if I wanted to test it was to show show
you some rest my rest endpoint was
monkeys I think or monkeys oh that hurts
me not see IES but let's do that anyway
and here we can see Jason representation
of the information and of course if I
wanted to I can go into one of those
individually and see all my Jason so I
created an application for you they're
deployed onto wildfly showing you some
JSF some JPA some bean validation there
would have been some ejv annotations
there as well and I didn't write a
single line of code so not only did I
not make any mistakes and I'm glad I
didn't now having having said that
because Forge was actually doing it all
for me one other thing that you could do
if you wanted to from Forge is I could
create I can create add-ons both wildfly
and arquillian which i'll talk to you in
a second about and that would allow me
to actually do my deployments from
within forge to my application server
let's go quickly back to how am i doing
for time badly okay let's get back to
tooling and talk about some of the tools
that we could also use I talked about
application service application servers
are one of those things that we love to
hate why because they're typically slow
let's have a call of hands then who's
the Tomcat users here the lorda Tomcat
users jetty a few jetty users wildfly or
JBoss websphere we did WebSphere before
WebLogic a few more web logics what did
i miss GlassFish few GlassFish fast to
ask that could just out of interest but
as to ask that question four years ago
GlassFish not too many other okay so one
thing we did actually in this report
which is also on rebel labs was we
compared and contrasted application
servers based on a number of
requirements which we had as developers
and this includes how easy it is to
download and install tooling support
Thaksin community so in other words how
easy is it to just you know throw a
tomcat installation up on your on your
on your laptop and actually start
playing around with it compared to
websphere weird logic called JBoss or
whatever and we rant them each out of
five and tomcat did very very well one
of the interesting ones that we weren't
expecting to do as well was JBoss JBoss
actually topped over all topped across
the although categories but one of the
key things here is about how what what
people want we just chose arbitrary
categories but what do people want I'd
ran a session in Jay focus back in 2015
about application servers whereby what
we did was we weighted these categories
based on the audience's needs
requirements as a developer and one of
the things that we noticed is Tomcat and
this I've done this session with
application servers a number of times
Tomcat would always come out top pretty
much or at the very worst drawing with
JBoss so Tomcat is is certainly you know
as we saw with the raise of hands the
leading application server out there but
one of the things that we really want to
understand is are ye are people using
Tomcat because it's light because it's
quick or are you actually using Tomcat
because it has all the features you need
and by all the features you need I mean
are you using Tomcat and then adding
open EJB to it or something like that
one of the interesting new servers I say
new it was new when I was at IBM four
years ago it's probably not so new now
is the IBM Liberty profile who's heard
of the IBM Liberty profile server it's
an interesting server actually it's a
very very cut-down server which is very
very pluggable it uses OSGi at the core
to make it pluggable in terms of not
just components but services so that you
can add and remove components on the fly
and services will be made available or
not available and this is very very
critical because you can then break up
WebSphere application server traditional
and actually have much much smaller
deployments of your environment based on
your application who's heard of Tommy
okay goodness guess I get more hands
every time I give this session which is
great
Tommy is based on Tomcat so it tries to
keep the speed of Tomcat the look and
feel of Tomcat the usability of Tomcat
but it does it a java ee standard so
what we're saying is it provides web
profile for example on Java EE 6 or
whatever it allows you it provides all
the glue with Apache elements like open
ejb open JPA and so forth
it adds it on top of Tomcat for you so
that if you wanted a Tomcat with other
components it's easier just to grab
Tommy and use that out of the box
because all the hard work has already
been done for you so sometimes this is
like almost like retaining awesome tasks
in an awesome process let's not drop to
Tommy because it's quick and then try
and add things to it and make our jobs
harder just because it's more performant
to you so Tommy's an interesting one to
look at
ok I'll kill you I'll kill Ian you can
also use in Forge and there is actually
a very very good add-on with between
Forge and arquillian and that's because
they're both JBoss projects and what are
Cillian will do is it will take your
it'll take your tests to the Container
and their unit tests tile tests but
they're actually driven on top of an
application server which you would
connect up and you would get your
results in a very Ju knit style so how
would you actually use our Killian well
first of all in your test you need to
make sure that you have the annotation
that says you're going to be using our
Killian then you actually need to create
in your code you need to create your
artifact this is you this is your
deployable artifacts so here what we're
saying is we're going to create this war
we're going to use shrink wrap to create
this test demo war I want to add these
projects and I want to add these files
these artifacts these Java EE artifacts
that then creates us our application
because we can use this in a real world
environment a real world container we
can still get away with our and yet
because CDI will exist in our in our in
the environment that were going to drop
into we don't need to do any mocking
everything's going to be real-world we
write our tests in a very similar way to
as we would with the j-unit style with
an art test would make sure what we do
within our test is we build up our tests
we run our tests we check all our
assertions and then we destroy our tests
one thing we don't need to do but it is
optional is we don't need to keep
restarting our container you can leave
your container up the remote our key and
we'll just connect to it deploy your app
run your test and then and then come
away again so it's very very powerful in
that it runs those unit tests style
environments it does against a container
and it gives you very very good feedback
okay so let's talk about spring quickly
I've talked about spring boot which I'm
sure many of you have heard of and a
couple of things I'm going to say then
spring boot just run applications what
you can do with spring boot is you can
effectively with very little code write
an application that you can exit there
is self-executing so it's effectively a
an embedded an embedded server which
which self bootstraps and runs it's your
application so you write very little
code and spin it up and all of a sudden
you have your application they call it
production ready which basically means
there's a couple of end points where you
I think it's metrics and health or
something where you can see you can see
how long your applications been up for
but they're very very minimal so let's
let's show
let's show spring boot and the first
place I'm gonna go is start spring dot
IO and there is actually an equivalent
of this for Java EE I was looking this
morning I couldn't find it but it's it's
it's very very similar now it will
generate you a zip file with a whole
bunch of artifacts in there and I can
show you how to do that here we can say
from this spring nish eliezer I'm gonna
create myself a maven project with yes
bring one for once fine and basically
whatever I type in here it's gonna is
going to a package up in my spring boot
application so I'm gonna say I want
somewhere I'm gonna grab some security
grab some JPA
let's grab some Vardhan what else might
we add this let's maybe this is Zipkin
no let's let's leave it as that you can
see our dependencies have been created
and here I can generate my project I can
click on the full version as well which
just allows me to see you know more
information so I can add useful things
like you know name rather than call it
something like demo I could make it
really really intuitive like Jarboe one
demo and things like that so you can you
can effectively generate whatever you
want as soon as I click generate project
it downloads it straightaway to my to my
file system and in there I can see all
my code and all my information in fact
what I did was I've already imported
this into Eclipse and here is in demo
and here we go we've got a demo
application it's a very very
straightforward application we've got an
annotation which is spring boot
application and that is effectively all
you need in order to compile that then
to be built up the spring framework
we'll build it up as a boot application
which means it will embed your your
Tomcat environment or whatever let's
let's add a few things here so we can
actually see something running I'm gonna
add a rest controller I'm gonna add a
let's say a method which is going to say
hello and let's say that I'm gonna have
a string name nice and boring and in
here I'm going to return a string which
is just going to say hello name what I'm
going to do is I'm going to make this a
request mapping I'm going to say hi and
use this this is actually quite
interesting this is this is a basically
set I'm gonna take everything after the
slash of high from the URL and I'm
actually going to use it as a path
variable here
and variable okay so it's something nice
and simple so we're gonna just let you
just run this and deploy it so from from
here demo here we go here's my poem XML
so I'm going to in fact let's count my
pom.xml very very quickly just so you
can see a whole bunch of the plugins you
can see we've got the we've got boot
this is the artifacts at the start of
parent this is that this is the main
dependency which actually builds our
Spring View application and a whole
bunch of other and it's basically
whatever you whatever you will add in
your in your starter initializer web
page it'll add the dependencies directly
into this into this pump so let's move
and install that and oh look what we've
got we've got some ASCII art it's got to
be good so from here if I was to list
the target we have our demo snapshot so
let's go into that how would I run how
would I run this jar Java - Java that
would actually work any other ways so
one thing we can do I show you if I was
to just - less demo one jar you'll see
it's actually a bash scripts as well and
from here if I was actually to run this
this is actually going to kind of
effectively Java - jar under the covers
so all I would need to do is actually
dot star demo and this will run a spring
boot environment what this is actually
doing now it's isn't a this is this jar
is an embedded spring embedded tomcat
server running that application on so if
I was to go over to my runtime and HTTP
localhost
let's go hi Simon there we go there we
go hello Simon
it's a very very quick spring
application with you can you can you can
still generate a war if you choose
rather than a rather than a jar but if
you just generate a jar it builds
everything into it
what about if we wanted to make changes
cuz that was quite quick just you know
actually get that running an actually
CRM point but if we wanted to make
changes we'd still need to do a full
redeploy would still need to do a full
build and so forth but one thing we
could do let's quickly come out of this
one thing we could do is if I was to go
into my running environment here and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to Jarrell and add Jeroboam nature to
this project what I'm effectively doing
is now if I run this within my concept
within my Eclipse IDE what we're
effectively doing is running J rebel
within that so we're running a durable
enabled embedded jar now what J rebel
allows you to do is hot reload your
application classes and your app and
your resources resource files live
without any restarts without any full
builds or any full compilations so for
example let's go back here let's say
hello Java one just to show you
whoops hello Java one just to show you
where we're running live if I want to
actually make a change now let's make a
reasonable change by saying let's change
the request request mapping to hello
let's change hello to say what let's do
something a little bit breaking by just
saying
greeting and here we can actually change
this to say hello name how are you doing
question mark hit save come straight
back here
actually refresh this now we're going to
get effectively a 404 because we've
changed our request mapping but if I was
now to change this to hello we're not
just gonna get a request mapping updated
but we're actually going to get our new
code which is actually a schema change
under the covers with that class as well
because we've added that new method so
this is actually a number of things
which happened
we've reloaded the Java class but
because we've also added changed the
annotations
bring annotation will actually had to
reinitialize a lot of the Spring
Framework as well we don't reinitialize
the whole Spring Framework but we do
just enough so that it's it's very very
performant yes so the dev tools which
spring boot provide this is
spring-loaded spring-loaded spring have
actually said that they're not actually
going beyond going fooled with the with
the development of spring-loaded anyway
so it's kind of like a dead dying
project the other thing is durable works
which spring-loaded doesn't work as well
kind of all the time so in a spring
environment
I think gyro board is more fully
functional than than spring-loaded the
other thing I would say is if you are
using other things as well as spring
durable has beyond 8090 different
integrations with other with other
frameworks where as spring-loaded is
very very limited to just spring any
other questions okay so let me show you
one other thing actually when we doing
let's go here let's stop this server
well I think I wanted to show you is
I'll start this server so I showed you
then a Java class change I'm also going
to show you a Java resource change as it
started so I'm going to go to a beloved
pet clinic application which is the
spring sample
my server starts whoops
there we go so this is the pet clinic
application what I'm also going to show
you now is a quick resource change so
I'm going to change this welcome message
so if I go to my Eclipse and I just add
messages whoops you know if I go to my
messages dot properties file in my pet
clinic application and I say welcome to
Java one hit save come straight back and
hit refresh we get we get those messages
we get the resource changes live as well
and that isn't just Joe Jay rebel isn't
just for spring you can use it with Java
EE you can use it with our Killian you
can use it with spring and a whole bunch
of other stuff as well so that's that's
J rebel one other thing I want to show
you here actually is X rebel X rebel is
a kind of development time profiler and
one of the things that X rebel does is
it allows you to test for performance
while you're developing your code so for
example let me go over to let's bless
pretend we're developing this
application right now and there's this
find owner's button that we've just
developed if I was to click find owners
that's a bit a little bit slow let's
just go past the initialization there's
two click find owners that came back
pretty quick we have about ten eleven
rows come back from the database here
but we're getting a notification from X
trouble at development time saying that
this small amount of data has caused 37
SQL or 37 io requests as a result I can
click on that and we can see the HTTP
GET request here and we can see not just
the not just where you're traveling
through in your application but the
actual SQL that is being driven at the
data source level and if you're using
JPA or hibernate or whatever you will
still see the actual SQL going through
the backend rather than any like JPA
statements or anything like that so
let's see what's actually happening here
we have a select statement which is
grabbing information from the owners
table a whole bunch of information and
that returns us ten rows back next here
I can see that we've got ten SQL
statements
if I open that up X rebel will group
them for me and I can see that we're
going to the pets table and we're
grabbing a whole load of information
based on the owner ID so what we're
doing is we grab ten rows back from our
first SQL statement and then we create
another ten SQL statements this is
called this is actually a classic
problem called an n plus one problem
very very common with things like JPA or
hibernate if you if you aren't certain
your your defaults correctly so that's
that's how you can use a tool like X
rebel in development to find potential
performance problems during your
production environments so let's jump
back to the let's jump back to the slide
thanks I'm sure I'm going to jump
through loads of slides now so this is
spring boot
I should pay homage to - Josh Long's
make jar not war great great quote which
he loves to use on every session he
gives who's an IntelliJ IDEA user this
is this is one of the interesting things
quite a lot any eclipse users the vast
majority any Apache NetBeans users we're
not quite apache NetBeans yet but will
be soon any vibin Emacs users hardcore
proper users one guy at the back awesome
so I'm an I'm an eclipse user myself why
am i in Eclipse user because I spent
twelve long years at IBM and Eclipse and
rad was driven into me lots of people
say eclipse is slow from my point of
view I used to use rad eclipse is
lightning fast for me so I've tried
using IntelliJ a few times it takes some
getting used to there are there are
significant differences where as soon as
I actually try IntelliJ I am not
productive at all and I think I've heard
from people you need to stick at it for
maybe two weeks to a month before you
actually really get productive with it
so I did a lazy tweet last year asking
what people's favorite features were
thinking there's got to be a killer
feature in IntelliJ I've got a bunch of
tweets back that's actually quite hard
to read but there are a bunch of tweets
back and not really anyone said the same
thing twice
and when I was talking to Hadi he gave
me this great analogy which is you
choose your IDE like you choose your car
if you if you say I prefer this car over
that car there are probably a number of
reasons why you prefer this car over
that car there's no one big killer
reason but it's this one fits me better
and that's very much what it is about
IDs luckily with IDs compared to build
tools the project doesn't decide it for
you you you yourself can choose which
IDE you well if your unless your company
decide to use a specific IDE
you yourself choose which IDE you would
like to choose so a lot of people do
choose IntelliJ for their productivity
but for me it's about my own
productivity and my I am most productive
with Eclipse to talk about any of that
ok that's the summary so in summary I
will say in summary I'll say take care
of your time your time is extremely
important and extremely precious and
it's very very important that when you
are developing code over a number of
months years you you're not just wasting
time every single day so choose a
development setup tool which is fit for
you but don't lose sight of your goals
and do try out productivity tools and do
try out new different approaches to your
tee or development I hope that's been
really really great for you I'm sorry
I'm sorry I was ill for this week and I
couldn't give you more live coding but I
hope there's enough in there one thing I
will say before everyone goes is please
do fill out the surveys they're very
very important to us as speakers and
thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
