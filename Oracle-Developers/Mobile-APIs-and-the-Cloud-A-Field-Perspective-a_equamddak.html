don't work for oracle I work for IBM and
Mama IBM distinguished engineer which is
an executive position in IBM I'm the CTO
for mobile first and websphere
foundation in software group lab
services which we're part of the labs
and software group we help with the
strategy of our products and help kind
of drive it but I also spend most of my
time working with customers helping them
implement our software and I kind of
teach you how to fish capacity I'd be
doing lots of Java for a long time and
Kevin who's in the back part of IBM who
kind of represents us on the specs as
can testify to kind of the legacy I have
from a java ee perspective and all the
things that I've done in the past 16
years right now my focus is around
mobility around api's around cloud and
so what I kind of wanted to talk about
is a few things here I wanted to focus a
little bit on the trends I don't want to
this is a developer conference right so
I'm not going to get to market e on you
folks or anything like that but just
kind of talk about really what what's
kind of the new stack and then talk
about some architectural patterns and
ships based on pretty much what I'm
seeing in the field with the customers
were working with etc and I want to kind
of go a little bit historical and kind
of talk about a couple things not too
much then I'm going to get specific
around you know development choices and
trends that we're seeing in development
I know it's a Java conference but it's
becoming a very very much a polyglot
world very much into using a bunch of
different languages and the same project
and and how do you deal with those type
of things a little bit on the importance
of DevOps and I'm going to spend very
little on you know what we're doing from
an IBM strategy mobile-first perspective
because is an oracle conference i'm not
going to come here and talk about IBM
stuff but i will show a couple slides
and then we have a booth that i'll be at
after this session downstairs if you
want to see some
things we're doing in the cloud with
bluemix or a mobile-first portfolio you
can come by we can show you live code
and things like that and even you know
people can sit down and write an
application and get a bluemix account
and build some things out so this is
kind of what I'm going to go through
hopefully this is okay most people here
are kind of developers like you very
hands-on developers right okay very good
I'm going to skip this because everyone
knows this right right where we are from
a mobile perspective I think the
interesting trend around wearables and
other types of things but one of the
things that I focus on is adoption of
these technologies in the enterprise and
so it'd be interesting to kind of see
from the audience I like interactive
sessions you know our enterprise
customers starting to look at wearables
and how to apply them in a banking
scenario insurance scenario etc etc
right there's one thing with the trends
and people buying them and using them
there's another thing around using them
in the enterprise and using them at
businesses and usually you know certain
things make sense and others don't you
know mobile one of the things I want to
talk a little bit about is mobile it is
very different from an experience
perspective and it's very important to
kind of understand that because I still
visit enterprises and i still sit down
with them and they're saying well i want
to take functionality from my website
and create a mobile app and that's
usually a very bad idea because websites
and enterprise websites are usually
built around the notion of showing you
every sits a map showing you everything
that you could do but from a mobile
perspective it's all about being
contextual finding out the road most
traveled as if you're in business right
if you're have an insurance app on your
phone and sometimes I ask do people
carry around an app that for their
insurance company I would say that's
that's probably very low right but if
you were to have one I'd expect it to do
something like at the site of an
accident take a quick picture start
claim and that's all about what I'm
going to do right and if I can't get it
done and one and two clicks you've kind
of failed from a mobility standpoint and
so being contextual
and it's a very different design
paradigm and so the more you you do from
a trying to replicate websites on to a
mobile screen the less comprehension
that a person has from reading text from
finding information you know people the
smaller the screen size have less
patience in finding informations and
that's important to understand a good
experience from a mobile perspective
right you quickly explore you know a
place where for example I need to find
information quickly find that and then
you know complete the transaction in
three steps right you want to be able to
have very quick contextual based
applications and so good mobile mobile
design uses paradigms like location
context notifications detection etc it's
very important that we focus on these
factors when building mobility you know
so it you know sometimes people with
their mobile experience start as with a
little check mark so I got to get a
mobile app out there the problem is you
get an instant feedback loop and so when
you put a mobile app out in the App
Store and it's not good you're going to
get very low ratings and sometimes with
some colorful language right it's going
to be this app stinks what are you doing
and it can hurt brand recognition we've
never kind of had this amount of instant
feedback around what we're doing and so
if you are a bank a major bank a major
insurance company a major retailer and
you put out an experience you almost and
and it's and it's bad you almost have to
kind of riad ver ties we have a new app
out there now check out our new
application etc because it really kind
of hurts in that capacity and so the
instant feedback loop but in the
enterprise you know one of the things i
also want to talk about is oftentimes we
overemphasize things like the mobile app
and how I built it and it's important to
have some architecture and some things
but my my son is in a second year of
college he can build an app right my
high school one of my high school kids
can build apps so you know one regard
it's not that hard
to build an app and from an enterprise
perspective right we spend a lot of time
on the bottom here around things how do
we drive user engagement how do i change
traditional IT and traditional
enterprise from very waterfall type
approaches to new innovative ways and
we've gone into scenarios where and then
the term is shadow IT we're marketing
right is gets frustrated with IT and
they're like okay I'm going to go around
them I'm going to hire my own IT and I'm
going to kick off mobile projects and
then usually IT has to respond after the
fact I got exposed services I got to
move faster I got to do things and I've
I've been in organizations where the CIO
reports to the CMO for example and so
we're seeing trends like that happen a
lot of developers don't like marketing
driving things at all right but because
of you know the bigger the enterprise
the more the more things you have to
worry about and then you know there's
reasons behind things like security and
you know integration and all the
operations I have in place and all the
measures that you know I all these
things that i've done what i do now but
you know the transformation around
mobility and cloud are very focused
around these things underneath i like to
show a kind of development lifecycle
from a mobility standpoint you're
worrying about things like you know
putting things in the app store i'm
waiting for Apple to accept my change
after two weeks or something like that
right your parts of your application
might be running no longer in your data
center but some parts might be things
you're getting from the cloud ap is that
you're consuming and so there's a lot
less control and then if there is a
design issue right that you need to
respond to people are if our kind of
complaining about the way your app works
and your methodology is around I do
design a higher design firm they throw a
bunch of wireframes over the wall and
then they tell like t go build it and
then the design is not good right what
do you do right in the design for
has gone away etc right and so from to
be successful right with the adoption of
these kind of technologies it's really
around becoming agile all the way from a
design perspective through integrate
develop instrument test right how do you
become agile enough to really be able to
change things right write code and I'm
day you know the next day you check it
in and it's it's in production right i
mean you know that that's scary but you
know some market you have to respond to
that right in different industries tend
to to kind of you know have different
speeds so the importance for for doing
devops and being able to put controls
and automate things become important but
you know you still want to do things
like scan code for security
vulnerabilities because you know you get
the target a poor you get the home depot
app they expose things out there right
there's a lot of risks out there so
there's still things you need to do so
you know when we think about agility
it's much more than a development thing
I think developers know how to write
code and be agile very fast right it's
it's all the things that go around it
that slow people down the the other
thing that that's a that's a parent is
you know ap is is kind of the new SOA
right api's are becoming the language of
the web the language of mobile there's
an explosion of experiences around api's
but even behind firewalls enterprises
among different groups want to start
emulating this experience right where I
expose I go to a website there's the API
to my back-end system let me do the
number one form of reuse which is copy
and paste programming put it in my
mobile app and use it right and so you
know API is kind of the new SOA and in
many ways api's were a counter-current
to all all the things that SOA and web
services gave you write it you know
wisdom files very constrained
environment the constrained environment
was a blocker to me so I'm just going to
write something simpler right that's the
way our industry moves and then that
simple thing gets bloated and there'll
be something else in three or four years
right I mean WebSockets is coming coming
along it's been coming along for a while
but
no it might be you know the next thing
and MQTT we see protocols like that like
facebook Messenger uses as new ways to
you know expose things so that's kind of
some of the trends that I they want to
go through now I'm going to start
talking about applications and how I've
seen them change over the past few years
somewhere back 2003-2004 2005 Ajax
became prevalent at the time people
looked at it for very little things but
has applications kind of evolved we've
seen an architectural shift into what's
called a single page architecture type
application and I think this is what
kind of one of the first things in the
Java world that led to a little bit more
polygons losing a little bit more
programming languages back in the early
j2ee days probably there was something
called Sun model 1 and sun model to from
an architectural perspective around how
you build applications and applications
were designed around you know page to
page refresh so you have you know an
application go in and talk to a servlet
and servlets tours things in HTTP
session which was always supposed to be
just a bookmark of where you're at we
have all these books with best practices
to say to scale the application store
very little data there but the truth is
applications and you probably have lots
of them in in your enterprise legacy
applications that treated HTTP session
like a database right and stored lots of
data there and you know it became an
issue of I got a pin every request to a
server once the initial user comes in I
got to do things and it created very
stateful applications and so this was a
very common architecture and it's still
an architecture you see but around 2005
many people started writing different
different types of applications and
making disturber a lot more stateless
right with web 20 where it was a hot
term some time back in Ajax single page
architecture whatever you want to call
it but the notion of building restful
based services talking to state
SPO Jose and doing model-view-controller
up in the client and I want to talk
about that because the people that kind
of made this shift over and I'll give an
example of a client I worked with are
the ones that have adopted to mobile
patterns a bit better because they
started resting you know rest became
api's etc right but usually moving
applications over from this paradigm
over to a mobile paradigm is a little
bit of a more difficult things usually
you're writing new apps you start
introducing this type of architecture
but this has kind of been the ship since
2005 and I today right mostly all new
applications in the field that my I work
with my customers are this is a pretty
standard app architecture and then they
get a little bit painful here and i'll
talk about that type of technology but
i'm sure you've heard of things like
angularjs and backbone Jas and and
frameworks up there but now we have
applications up here that are being
written in fully in JavaScript we have
applications may be a native
applications that are written in Swift
Objective C or Java for android etc and
down here this may still be Java but
we're also seeing an explosion of
different types of languages on the
server as well and I'll get into kind of
cloud from that perspective but i want
to say kind of the next evolution of
that is really talking about data design
in a modern architecture and i think
this is very important i've spent some
time with you know clients where we're
working really thinking about data from
an end-user perspective right and we
hear terms like system of engagement
system of Records and we kind of know
what that means sometimes they're
marketing terms for cloud sometimes
they're a little bit more but I like to
think of it very simply as you know how
does your end user view his data right
how does a person view his account how
does a person view his policy whatever
right there's a view of data that a
customer knows about and it might be
slightly different across channels but
there's a view of data that's that they
know and it's usually
flatter simple structure it's usually
following some type of restful
architecture and then we have the
enterprise's view of the data which is
usually driven off something very
different how do i monitor a user how do
I find out things so we built back-end
es B's right we probably hear of things
like domain models and canonical data
models right if you've built
applications with an ESB product out of
your backends you usually built out this
super uber goober object that has all
this data from different back-end
systems and things like correlation IDs
etc and then you know work with customer
can I just expose that and transform it
to JSON and give it to the client I'm
like that really right those things are
that have very rich object models
they're focused on how do I monitor a
user through a system that the customer
uses and then the agent uses and a back
office application uses it has all these
things about backends it has seven
levels nested deep of hierarchy with
bi-directional relationships whatever
right it is just a very different object
model and rather than just thinking
about that the people that have been
successful in building modern
applications are the ones that take both
views of data where I want to design the
data out that I see that my end user
sees and that's different and then
there's a mapping between that in
applications the implementations of rest
services etc but this is I think a key
fundamental transformation in the
enterprise's right when I'm building
born on cloud apps and outside the
enterprise they don't even know what
this this stuff is right they don't they
don't know that right modern developers
very quickly built out object models and
JSON stored in a no sequel database
that's available to them in the cloud
and access it from mobile apps or web
apps etc right but the goal here is
really getting enterprises to think
about data from the end-user perspective
consumable data and it might start from
a single application and it might get
some reuse across different channels but
the goal is to think about data in that
fashion and this is
to that an example of an insurance
company i worked with that went through
a transformation where we went through
the exercise of really thinking about
what the user how the user sees their
data how the user sees their policies
etc and they created a pis and this was
right before the mobile revolution came
out because they were thinking about a
better user experience on the desktop
they adopt a JavaScript frameworks etc
but then when mobile came along their
marketing department said I need a
mobile app they were able to stand it up
quickly because they had consumable data
consumable API so it just happened that
because they were on the forefront of
that transformation around Ajax web 20
modern web applications that they were
able to adapt to mobile fairly fairly
quickly and it was because they they had
a different view of data they they're
still importance around the canonical
model they're still importance around
that but it's a different reason why you
have it it's because you know they want
to monitor what's going on in the system
they want to find out where it is in the
system they want to be able to route the
request to a agent if a person abandons
a quote etc right so so very specific
reasons why you have back-end data
models and and you still need SOA
technology I mean it has an effect on
data i call this kind of the mobile
volcano right where i have an entire
data set but if it helps you view the
effect of data in the enterprise it
helps you kind of deal with solution so
down here if i have some performance
issue with the entire data set i know i
need to do enterprise caching here right
some type of caching technology if the
issue is here it might be the mobile
network i might need some edge caching
over here right but it really has this
effect around what happens to mobile
data it has an effect on infrastructure
this is when we're doing things on prem
and i'll get kind of into driving the
rationale behind cloud and being agile
and being very fast as even though i'm
building applications with new
technologies and new agile
development technologies to set up
certain things on Prem the right way you
need a lot of infrastructure sometimes
you need security gateway technology you
need to think about api's you need to
think how you secure those AP is and how
you implement them how you transform to
back-end systems right you usually have
things like a DMZ followed by kind of
this web application mobile application
server tier that does a bunch of stuff
content management when you're dealing
with b to e and mobile and i'll talk
about some of those additional concerns
you know where does all that type of
software live and then what kind of
hardware does it address things like
mobile device management etc and you
still have your back-end system so
there's there's an effect of in Long
gating the infrastructure and then this
is a very relevant and best practice
type thing on Prem so you know one of
the things that we're seeing from a
trend perspective is this tier over here
right you know what if we're able to
move some of that to the cloud because I
need to be able to spit out
infrastructure I need to be able to
quickly adapt to new mobile workloads
new mobile trends so before I kind of
get into moving to cloud I just like to
kind of show this picture just as a
level set to the audience on you know
what we mean by moving to cloud because
the depending on where you're at from a
maturity standpoint it can mean
different things and so what I like to
do is kind of show this because there's
different ways you can move traditional
on prem you pretty much worry about
everything all the way from networking
through the applications right
infrastructure as a service so you know
IBM has soft layer and there's amazon
there's all different types of clouds
right but really moving up to the next
level is taking traditional software
products that you might have in your
infrastructure running them on VMS or
running them on virtual software docker
whatever right and running them in the
cloud you still kind of own the
management of your middle where the
management of your software the tuning
of those things but there's that level
and then there's a next level of
adoption which is you know
platform-as-a-service paths and here
it's much more about doing things in the
cloud developing in the cloud you might
do development locally but the entry
point is I'm a developer building an
application and i'm using api's that are
in the cloud and i'm choosing a runtime
and i'm saying i'm building a java app
i'm just going to throw you a war file
or i'm building an oj s application i'm
going to give you a few javascript files
and you know i push it out and you know
all the stuff that happens at the
infrastructure the service level are
hidden from you a bit and so there's
different levels of cloud and then SAS
is you know I'm just using an app that
happens to be in the cloud right I look
to look at things from my end user
perspective and so I want to kind of
talk about that because you know if you
you know it might be easy to pick this
up replicate it as an infrastructure of
the service level and that's one level
of you know how to quickly move to cloud
and then you worry about things like VPN
or how do you access things etc but you
know what does it actually mean and so
you know I work with different clients
and there's different levels of cloud
maturity but the whole idea is to really
reduce the cost of spitting out this
layer very quickly as I introduce new
features new api's new mobile apps new
function very quickly right so I work
with clients where they start with
mobile adoption very small I might
expose a push notification service in
the cloud and usually people start with
something simple like push because push
already going out to different people
anyway right you're going to apns for
Apple Google Cloud messaging so why
don't I just go to one place that fans
that out for me right so they might
adopt something like that or a cashing
service but there's architectures that
are happening i like to call cloud
maturity or born on cloud applications
where
that whole tier now moves into the cloud
and you're building apps and your
enterprise gets into the business of
exposing api's and exposing services but
the fact is that they can very quickly
create environments in the cloud go
through their whole development process
and built out applications and you're
seeing that user model that I like to
call that data model that's relevant to
the end user being stored in databases
like no sequel and they're able to scale
that across country because it's jsun
it's flat formats and mobile has a lot
of interesting patterns right you don't
you want to do something you want to
tell the end-user I got your data I come
back right and things happen a lot more
asynchronous so I might want to say you
know I'm kicking off the claim I grab
the data and stick it in my cloud
database where I quickly come back
you're done and do a lot of background
asynchronous sinking of that and then
send a push notification when something
is ready right you you want to think
about when you're when you're the more
interactive you are which mobile apps
are very interactive and then one click
I come back and come back to another
click right the more asynchronous these
interactions have to be in scaling
asynchronous behavior sometimes it's
very different than scaling synchronous
workloads all right and so the you know
there's technologies in the cloud being
able to store that in a network that's
geographically closer to me and then
being able to come back and do things in
the background become very important so
I call this kind of born on cloud apps
or you've matured to a state where
you're able to move over to that I want
to you know also talk about a couple
other things that happen from a mobile
perspective you know security is is very
huge from from a mobile perspective you
know I've had a friend that left a
tablet in the front sleeve of the
airplane that they were on anyway that
ever happened to anyone here good people
my daughter we were driving down to
thing was Ocean City Maryland and we
stopped she went to the restroom and
left her phone like I don't know why the
kids the kids today do this a lot right
they they walk or they don't want to put
their phones in their pockets for some
reason it's not
cool it's and they go like this all how
you doing you know and and that happens
a lot uh no but mobile devices get lost
pretty frequently and depending on the
type of applications you're writing
right there is the apps you right for
your consumers but there's employee
facing apps and for employee facing apps
there's a lot more risks because you
usually have access to secured IP your
network etc and so how do you deal with
control owned assets or bring your own
device which is a big trend now people
you know don't like carrying around two
phones so often times you have to worry
about things like mobile device
management so your apps and the
application architectures you build have
to work in lieu of that right anything
from a device that has a corporate side
and a personal side which hurts
usability and in in one regard to a
propping and taking your application
through a process and that again that's
that whole that whole circle I gave this
is other steps that mobility introduces
to the lifecycle I might have to take a
BDE app go through a wrapping stage with
my MDM provider to provide extra hook
points and then from a b2c perspective
right you have a lot of you know there's
hacks where people get things off the
desktop and are able to do things like
account takeover on the device or steal
your account or steal your identity and
so how do you do secure transactions
these are all things so when we work
with with clients as part of developing
a mobile center of excellence in that
regard right you have to bring in all
these new mobility concerns as well and
and so net-net right what we're finding
over time is we're at a state where
you're building applications in the
enterprise that have some amount of
cloud and some amount of on-prem and
combining these things right and this is
you know this is the present time that
we're in because it causes additional
headings like how do you do single
sign-on across cloud things that you
provide an on-premise you just expose
your infrastructure via VPN or to create
api's that are secured
accessible and then have your mobile
apps or your partner's built that's a
mobile apps for some time to come right
will be a combination of cloud and
on-premise use the word hybrid I'm is a
hybrid cloud because when you're talking
about mobile development hybrid means
something else right it means html5 ish
type stuff and a mobile device is
checking the time but one of the things
that we have seen as an evolution is
right a standard set of what what I
would call a mobile backend their mobile
backend services that would be becoming
to become standardized when building
mobility right and so when you're
thinking about mobility from the from a
development standpoint and how you
enable your enterprise you want to think
about you know I need be able to build
apps and api's and wrap them in SDKs all
right I'll talk about that a moment I
need to build code I need to be able to
do that efficiently I need a set of
analytics and so very quickly it's not
just about what you build but standing
up analytic service I need to perhaps
have mobile data the ability to take
data from the device or the channel very
quickly grab it and store it and say
I've got it keep doing your stuff i need
workflow security push based services
and it's very set of primary services
there's more you know services that you
have but you want to think about saying
when i'm building a complete mobile
architecture i want to think about
mobile backends and api's that are
pretty standard when talking to my back
ends etc and you want to think about
being able to take that standard set of
mobile backend services and have
different ways to quickly deploy whether
it be in the cloud we have an IBM
bluemix and soft layer but we also have
the notion some people might not want to
live in a public cloud and there's
reasons for that if you work worldwide
like I do and I do some work in South
America right you can call them the
separated States of America or something
like that right there you know there's
no way someone in Chile is going to want
to store some types of
in a cloud in Mexico or and and things
like that there's just government rules
government issues and so you know the
notion of private cloud using bringing
giant boxes that facilitate virtual
images and facilitate that type of
behavior is still essential and there's
traditional on-prem you want to think
about a common set of just services and
things that are expected from a mobile
perspective to facilitate mobile and
really multi-channel development let's
let's get into it as a developer
conference I'm going to get a little bit
into the developer choices type of
things as well you know the new normal
from a mobile perspective I build apps I
use api's and I do sinking of data right
that's kind of summarizing what I just
kind of said but let's talk about you
know what mobile development and the
types of different architectures I'm
seeing from a mobile app so everyone
here has done some type of mobile
development yes or no I mean okay how
many people write native apps hybrid
just em sites okay and so when working
we like to show simplified pictures this
is a little bit more of what how I
really see it in the field when I go and
help clients we have pure native
applications and you know obviously you
know that's going to give you the best
experience all right native applications
and in some regards some platforms do a
better job and others from from
providing a good environment right I
work with clients where all they're
seeing is ios and android and you ask
yourself you know is the what's what's
more important the cost versus the
experience and even within the same
enterprise they're doing all of it right
there doing this app is very important
for my client is going to be the best
this other app does back channel app
this one here I don't need to spend that
much investment so i might do html5 but
within the hybrid world I've seen
everything from just putting out a
native shell and scraping stuff off my m
site and putting it in
that shell and sometimes if Apple Apple
catches that they'll reject your app
when you submit into the App Store I've
seen people package html5 using things
like Apache Cordova a phonegap type
style but I'm also seeing a big uptake
in kind of mixing native and html5 not
just calling native services like the
camera no typical things but actually
having native component tree living on
the same page as a web component tree or
having my navigation all native and
navigating to local web content and you
get into issue about how you share
tokens what if they both call the back
end with that same security and even
within that there are situations that
I've seen where clients where web is
like all the web is the bootstrapper the
king right and it brings in native
things on the page and I've seen where I
build a native app and the native app
uses different techniques to bring in a
web content than their the king so the
spectrum from mobile app development is
pretty large out you know I don't think
writing native is a bad thing right
native development that isn't that hard
apple I think does a pretty good job
from a developer experience right and
even android does as well the problem
around android has to do i think with
testing across lots of devices which is
very problematic and then I'll get into
that momentarily but you know you can't
have a multi-channel strategy and still
write native applications if you're
thinking about user data api's SDKs and
then the UI right and people get into
this conundrum around skills iowa i
asked lots of questions like what style
of applications are you building do you
have are you really thinking
multi-channel the more content-based you
are i'm just showing a catalog stuff you
can get away with things like responsive
design etc but the more transactional
you are the harder it gets right and
then you know what toolkits should i use
client-side architecture on the server
side right you know we have rest MQTT
web sockets and then we have the
polyglot arrow in java right you
been with in Java right most of the time
I was like should i use jax-rs or should
i use spring right that that comes up a
lot the Java EE stack versus the spring
stack people ask that all the time and
then no Jas when you move to the cloud
these choices expand and no Jas does a
very good job for i/o bound based
applications because it's complete
synchronous model so for applications
where I'm just quickly reading stuff
from the back end grabbing data from the
front end and storing right it's very
good from an asynchronous and what are
your integration this might be a little
bit you know controversial the Java
conference but the need for server
markup right I'm seeing less and less
need for that but we can talk about and
then app complexity targeting the mobile
platform I think if I if I want to
summarize what is the goal its achieve a
high level of reuse not just across
devices but form factors without
sacrificing usability and being having a
compelling you I that that's I think
summarizes what people are trying to
achieve now on the website all right and
the reason I say there there's something
to be said about a constrained native
environment right is the minute I get
into web some people have them and tell
that can repurpose a web developer for
mobile but you have to take them through
some best practices in training it just
doesn't happen I was on an engagement
where I was like well I got to do some
amount of offshore development and they
had some junior developers and one of
the screens i got the tablet it was a
hybrid application and i did a rotation
and I could it took like five six
seconds for things to move around and
I'm like you know the business person is
looking at this thing we got to go
native right I mean that's the instant
reaction this html5 doesn't stuff
doesn't work and it's because the
developer wasn't following the
architecture you know CSS media queries
are hardware accelerated you should be
using that that type of technique not
redoing things with JavaScript there is
no JavaScript event that's a zombeh for
rotation there's something like that
right and so you know
requires a lot of best practices I think
to get html5 right and usually you know
it's also a very religious space right
you know some people or you know I want
to use angular I'm a fan of angular
because it has a lot of stuff right but
I build applications with backbone and
usually with backbone I have to also use
you know handlebars for templating and
bring in require Jas and then so we're
in the age of the micro frameworks and
so you know I always ask how many
platforms justifies hybrid mobile right
if you just have to etc you know and
then if your design teams haven't
adopted paradigms around responsive and
how to do design the right way and agile
giving it to a mobile developer and
trying to make them optimize their
giving you pixel perfect images here's
the exact screen that wants you to look
at and they don't really understand
mobile then the burden goes on the
developer and it's a headache and so
I've seen that as well so I want to talk
about transformation and they're like
html5 like how do you do design and
they're like well designed they just
give us some wire frames and say go I'm
like don't do it right you have to
educate your design people and do design
right or else you're going to fail so to
be the successful hybrid projects I've
been involved in usually create a
standard application architecture all
right and so that's important to have
MVC best practices and enforce them and
mobile testing I'll get into that and
then I'll get a little bit more into
kind of the importance of DevOps all the
way from design to really and really the
trick is how do I enforce best practices
when I'm doing cross for cross shore
development etc right that that's a
challenge but from a testing perspective
you know I worked with a client who had
built an application for for both iOS
and Android and they had they tested it
on a particular version of Android and
they had some devices and there was a
bug on HTC and it was the same Android
bill that was exact but it did it like
an auto zoom on a form field than it
which gets stuck there
right is some weird hybrid behavior with
the way whatever they did with the
hardware and WebKit and the customer
went into production say well only 0.000
whatever percent used the phone of
course the CEO of the company had that
phone right so it became an emergency
you had to work and this was an html5
app so the testing issues you have
across the diversity of Android doesn't
go away with html5 it actually might
magnify so you still have to do the
testing the right way you have you knew
some level of testing in the browser
with you know chrome and safari you're
going to use web emulators you're going
to use the native simulator for iOS the
Android one's really bad right but you
use the iOS one you're going to plug
devices right into your laptop and test
certain things there your QA is going to
have a group of that and you know if you
really want to get to to the different
devices you might use things like device
anywhere perfecto mobile device clouds
later in the process but you really need
to do all of that and you run into
things like certificate hell when you're
dealing with iOS and getting the right
certificate down the build path you know
you have to account for the for the app
stores process I had to come to like we
want to be in production this day and
they were stuck in like did you put two
weeks in there for the Apple and they're
like oh you know so you know you really
have to think about that and then on the
server side we're seeing and once you
move to the cloud the choices magnify
right this is a typical
platform-as-a-service cloud-based
technology where I go in and say I want
to build an app you want to build a
websphere Java spring whatever app you
want to build no Jas ruby on rails right
so the choices on the server is starting
to magnify too and the ultimate
acceleration for developers and mobile
if you really want to get right in the
naval mobile developers from an
enterprise perspective is yeah I provide
rest api documentation and i do that
right but I also could wrap things in
the SDKs that of the well-known things
though download your iOS SDK and get
some of the security in autumn
syncing with you or the Android SDK
here's a JavaScript one Cordova people
are using dependency managers like mpm
and Bauer to download dependency so
being able to provide that kind of
acceleration from a DevOps perspective
the projects we get involved with really
you know the blueprint has been having
good solid mobile reference architecture
right and defining that upfront and
defining that is just not documentation
developers don't like to read large
amounts of architect documents that have
nice bubble pictures from page one to
200 right but this architecture should
be documented in the form of examples
and templates and i'll talk about
scaffolding tools but then scaffolding
is fairly popular so there's tools like
yell men right i don't know if people
have kind of used those type of but
there's other ones like jet in the
eclipse world etc right how can you blue
print your architecture create that
whole thing to give it to a set of
junior developers to follow a recipe and
so mobile scaffolding it should be key I
built in best practices Model View
controller etc integration to your back
end and then deployment right being able
to generate things out like build
scripts for them right so the leaders
elite architects the lead developers put
the scaffolding in place provide the
templates and the examples that they
should follow create the build scripts
needed for the artifacts that I have so
that then it becomes very systematic you
build controller you build view you
provide the CSS file don't go outside of
this etc it's very important to do that
and DevOps has to happen end-to-end
right a good sprint from from an agile
perspective will have a little bit of a
design test architect develop and push
out right at the end of the spring you
should have a minimal Viable Product
that you push out and so good good
kind of DevOps system does a little bit
of everything within Sprint's right
rather than all design all development
all deployment here are some examples of
if you go down to the booth and find the
IBM booth I'll be there I could show
examples of things we do where we get
very systematic around an architectural
workshop where we answer a set of
architecture questions we store it in a
JSON file we run that through a yeoman
generator and it comes out with your
angular or or native or whatever you
select as a paradigm with all the
controllers and the views that you have
all the invitations to the backend we
generate grunt scripts grunt is is the
equivalent of ant i think in java and
there's other ones like gulp and then
the that i've kind of exploded of being
able to create scripts so that you know
you're dictating how things are built
and I can plug those things in directly
into things like Jenkins to do
continuous integration and then
dependency management i think you know
in the JavaScript world right on the
Java world I always dealt with a lot of
lot third-party library hell in you know
JavaScript world I think things like mpm
with node and Bauer have have learned
lessons from that because they do a
fairly good job of being able to specify
scripts that have dependencies and
pulling in dependencies based on when I
need them and the specific version but
linking that whole tool chain together
can be very helpful from a from a mobile
dev up so you know when you start mobile
projects here's your reference
architecture here's the DevOps blueprint
here is the scaffolding okay and then
once all that is in place on day one you
should be able to push a button and say
I've scaffolded out the skeleton and I
can push it through my my DevOps pipe
chain their pipeline through up into a
particular environment before I even
start writing specific code for the
application right you should be able to
get to that to that place and then you
have a well-oiled machine the factor
is running and you can start you know
putting out things and so I'll talk a
little bit about what we at IBM are
doing right this is kind of the market
texture slide from a mobile perspective
but we have focus on building
applications and data mobile device
management security and analytics see
how I'm doing on time strategy around
cloud strategy around things that we do
around consulting depending on the type
of IBM we have industry and partners
that we're working with we have a mobile
first platform yet I've heard of things
like work light which is our IBM mobile
application platform which provides an
environment to build mobile applications
within their we have a server runtime
that is actually a java ee application
that can run on top of an app server
like websphere and provides a set of
features around you know adapters
javascript on the server automatic json
conversion security type features i can
go into the android marketplace or
google play store i can download your
app i can decompile it i can add my own
malicious little code Andrey Andrey
package it up and put it back up in the
app store it's not that hard and you
know if your enterprise com I can put it
out as enterprise com you might not
notice the M in the end and you might
download my version of the app it's a
real app that's calling your back-end
but i might be stealing application so
we have very mobile specific features
like app integrity where we have the
original apps on the server doing some
app version management someone launches
the app and says this is not the
original app it's been tampered with so
i'm not going to let you invoke any
back-end services i'm going to shut down
the things i can shut down in the app on
the device and i'm going to do things
like that so very mobile specific
services that whole box i showed you
with typical mobile services analytics
data syncing all these all these things
that you get from a mobile perspective
are provided on the server we have a
runtime that's on the device we actually
have committers to Apache Cordova
we take Apache Cordova we add features
on top of that we have an offline
encrypted JSON store we have policy
based geolocation we have a set of
different services there we have a
studio which is an eclipse plugin but we
also have a command line interface one
of the things that we do from a mobile
platform perspective is we provide our
features either as SDKs from mobile
developers or you know we you know
JavaScript API is native api's and so if
your native developer right you want to
bring your own tools right Apple
enforces your tool already i'm using
xcode on a mac right android and forces
your tools somewhat as well right you at
some point you have to use the android
thing they might be able to provide a
service in the cloud or do it for you
but someone is doing that right for you
and so we have command-line interfaces
that you can bring up bring in the SDKs
and plug it into Xcode or plug it into
Android studio we have an app center
which is a BTE app store for distributed
distribution and the console we have MQA
also available in the cloud really it's
it's a technology that allows you to
incorporate user feedback quickly I
shake the device and you know I'm able
to circle with my finger issues I'm
having with the app write some text and
push it down we we collect crash
analytics write apps crash all the time
we collect that be able to send what was
happening and we have code scanning all
out of the box and so this is kind of
our mobile platform we're able to run it
in the cloud via pattern so puresystems
is one of our infrastructure as a
service type cloud technology where we
can pattern eyes and push out into
either pure systems for private cloud or
public cloud as well IBM bluemix is our
platform as a service if you go to
bluemix you're able to build born on
cloud applications we're demoing it
downstairs in the expo if you come to
the IBM booth but you're able to pick
your runtime like node or Java you know
pick some of your services whether it be
mobile
cloud databases like Cloudant which is a
no sequel database based on couchdb IBM
acquired them earlier this year but it
provides very scalable no sequel
database in the cloud with geolocation
type searching that we were deployed on
amazon on softlayer all different types
of data centers around the world highly
scalable businesses are run on top of
Cloudant we have security technology
such as trustee r which is an sdk seven
out of the top ten banks in north
america use Trusteer basically has fraud
detection for account takeover and all
these types of things you get we have
maas360 from fiberlink which is our
mobile device management provider in the
cloud IBM when we acquired them we moved
about 70,000 employees in two weeks over
to our MDM provider and we have
technology that like data power and IBM
security access manager which provides
at you know acts you know front gateway
pattern to the enterprise patterns like
sam'l oo oo etc mobile detection
patterns integration with MDM and we
have technology around engagement our
Tea Leaf is our our analytics product
for end-user how an end consumer is
using an application where they went to
we have X 25 which is around campaign
management and being able to author that
campaign management and use things like
push notifications passbook all these
things to distribute that and we have
present zone which ibeacon like
technology that you deploying store and
banks and provide that so that's all I'm
going to kind of get into from from what
we're doing my team has these things
like we call quick wind mobile where we
help and come in and establish that
whole from design to production type of
pipeline and get you started and educate
people to build out those type of
applications and then get you
self-sufficient so that's the type of
stuff that we do come by our booth we
have you know different types of things
around analytics etc so come by booth
5511
and we can show you code and examples
and demo and get you coding bluemix we
have lots of different Java things with
going on bluemix we have an oj s kit for
IBM we have java developer kids we
obviously have Liberty as our Java EE
server here's a book recently i wrote
shameless self-promotion you know at the
end of the day you end up making two
cents a copy but basically writing a lot
of these best practice we talked about
very specific to java ee based
applications and mobile in that book all
people are on the author team are people
that work with customers every day out
of our labs and so from that i'll kind
of stop here and open up for questions i
think i have a few minutes but hopefully
like was kind of a whirlwind of a lot of
information but things to think about
end-to-end and some of the things we're
doing in IBM any questions all did you
raise your hand ok that's on the light
of this similar to what you guys are
experiencing out there are certain
things i like to hear your perspective
alright going once all right
you have to look at data information
from the data perspective mm-hmm is it
possible that you may end up having to
have two ways of presenting the data for
your external customer versus your yeah
so the question i'm repeating recording
when I'm talking about data and you're
talking about the user model is it
possible that i'm going to have a
consumer view of the data for external
based applications and internal based
application then the answer of that
could be yes absolutely that that's the
nature with consumer right here you
might have a different actor and that
actor views data differently usually
internal employees have more access to
things and it might be that BTE
applications usually get the short end
of the stick on the budget side right
oftentimes from what I've seen in
certain clients and and they might go at
directly at the canonical model and
things like that for certain types of
applications okay yes
do I see bluehost I don't know what
Bluehost is bluemix so when we talk
about bluemix right if you I showed kind
of that that slide earlier on cloud let
me see if I can get to it quickly this
one right and so today bluemix it's on
top of our our softlayer
infrastructure-as-a-service cloud and we
have patterns that when you manage the
the software stack in the middle where
we can push work light into the cloud
this way today in in bluemix the
adoption lever level for path seems to
be finer grained i'm building an app and
I'm just accessing push notifications
and so in a way functionality that we
have in our mobile platform is available
in bluemix but as individual services
that you consume at that time and pay
for it so you want to look at bluemix a
little differently as a higher level and
functionality being out there but you
could actually just adopt and use and
pay for the services that you need at
the time make sense ok the question
there was about pushing work light into
bluemix the answer is we push work light
into the cloud and software and we
expose certain features of our mobile
platform out as in a past fashion
through the individual services that you
might use any other questions going once
twice all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
