i am working at oracle mostly on jaleesa
roberson Oracle it means glassfish and
weblogic application servers and I am
also speculate of the jsr 373 okay this
is a specification in development in
process noted existing specification
which we plan to introduce in Java EE 8
which is the next java ee specification
and this is jay HR 373 is about the next
version of java ee management API okay
please take care about this slide which
is quite important okay i thought that
java ee management will have next
version so there must be some original
version which was defined in jsr 77
which is j2ee management's management
API so this is quite old it was created
in 200 2002 year and updated before nine
years so it is nine years old
specification of java ee management so i
am pretty sure that not all of you knows
even anything about about the GSR 77
what does it define i'm pretty sure that
some of you maybe knows but i think that
most of you are using the application
servers as is it means with the
management console monitoring which are
introduced in such application server
implementation but there is standard for
it okay what is Jace are 77 about this
spec has 200 200 pages ok 200 pages but
does not define too much ok so I am I
think that I am able to introduce you to
the main concept of concepts of jsr 77
first and then we will continue what
he will want to introduce in the next
version so the main block of jsr 77th
our manager objects okay many objects is
not that has nothing with managed beans
you know so everybody forgot about Jess
are 77 and CD I introduce the managed
beans which is quite similar war but it
is absolutely differencing managed
object is just object which contains
some operation and attribute yes of
course almost bean and you can manage
manage the some part of the application
server using the managed object and it
there is the set of such managed object
which is unclosed it means that any
server can define much more it is just
minimum what must be defined which is in
the defined in the GSR 77 so it is quite
open set of managed object and the
second thing is that this these objects
are hierarchical so this set is here
article and it is a hierarchic in two
ways first this inheritance it means
that I don't know jdbc resource is
resource what is managed object okay and
much more but more important for us is
that there is also defined aggregation
of most of these objects so it means
that the jdbc resource contains data
resources for example and is inside the
server so such kind of such kind of
hierarchical so aggregation is the
second kind of hierarchical but it does
not tell that all objects must be in the
hierarchical structure no object can
just fly in the interspace and it can be
still managed object okay so this was
the first construct the second construct
our support for events some objects can
support events so you can register the
listener into this object and you will
receive some events and the what what is
the event is pre defined by the spec
and most important are the source and
the type you know it means that this
managed bean was for example it is the
source what for example started or
create it or delete it this is the type
everything else is about some
identification of this event and such
stuff so these are two most important
parts of the event so this was the
second construct the event sir construct
is that any manager object can be can be
you can can have some state management
so it did means that this object has
predefined life cycle and what is the
life cycle of managed object is also
defined by this spec it means that it
has these five stages so starting
running stops stop paying failed and you
can just start and stop it so this is
what you can do is it and it can be in
any of these states and for not these
but last what was defined is monitoring
performance monitoring API any object
can provide some performance monitoring
informations and what kind of such
information it is also predefined but
this set is unclosed and it can provide
you objects in very very simple very
very simple information like count it
means how many times something happened
time it's almost duration but with the
beginning also for example what was the
lowest and based value of something so
this kind of objects are defined and you
should also know that for the managed
objects which are defined in standard
there are few of them which have to
provide such information so these are
the four main features it means that
there is something what you can somehow
configure or at least read the
configuration it is the managed object
you can read its configuration some of
them and tell you about changes some of
them you can use for monitoring and some
of the
you can start off stop and it is pretty
much everything okay and this together
is accessible using for api's by the way
the last one I must ask you common
information model this is the c IM who
ever heard about common information
model now nobody yeah you know so this
is introducing the spec and by the way
the common information model is quite
life this is the there is the standard
which provides the schema of the of all
objects which are defined by common
information model in the world and this
kima has new version three times or four
times per year today I even I never
never heard about anybody who knows
about it who knows about the distributed
management task force which is the
organization which crazy see I am but
yes it is introduced in all it is also
defined is the jsr 77 it means that all
these beans are part of this schema of
the common information model probably
the SNMP is well known by most of you
and JM x is IBD because it is java known
by most of you and maybe the map it
means management ajb older Oh Who older
from you not not so we hug people can
remember it that there is defined
management ajb it means that there is
session bean just session enterprise
Java Bean which is which is preferably
find API this API is very similar to the
jmx standard API so you can you can
Jerry's method for example get value and
you provide the name of the beam the
name of the attribute that it will give
you the values that's all and it defines
the original interoperability of jsr 77
all original interoperability bill was
done based on jmx and aj be so it wasn't
rough it was interoperable only inside
the java ee
war hmm so it was about jsrf 77 maybe it
is included in the information that it
is introduced using jmx but I want to
tell it separately each managed object
must be identified by object name object
name is structure of the domain and name
and then any amount of attributes with
value ok so this is kind of string which
identifies object in jmx world you know
as object name by the way this is the
source of the hierarchy if I call about
the header hey about aggregation you
know these attributes can define what is
the who is the parent of my being of
myself so it is using the objecting and
it is pretty much everything from James
J SR 70 son there is also jsr 88 which
which defines application deployment
actually this is the brother of jsr 77
it was created and update last updated
in the same year what's new on this is
that it has status proposed optional in
Java e7 so it's slowly disappearing from
our world and it defines the deployment
but not the deployment like how to
deploy application how to enterprise
application it define API for people who
want to create all deployment tool for
application servers and then you can of
course use your your tool to deployed
enterprise application so this is the
little bit different that you can expect
it but at least from my perspective and
from perspective most of the expert
group we should also know about the
deployment in next version of management
API actually but it was not in the
original original one so we will see
okay it was about history and now
something about future what we plan to
do
so the three things what we want to do
what we don't know oh I think that we
know but what we don't know what we
definitely don't want to do so the main
goal of our jsr is to define a REST API
some HTTP API for the java ee management
and this is the first goal because we
feel that the age of the
interoperability using a JB's and JM x
is over so we must somehow wrap so this
is the first thing and the second thing
is that it will extend the jsr 77 it
means that we want to provide the next
version of it but what we don't know to
do is to provide general JM general rest
support for gmx it is not the goal okay
it may become so maybe I expect that
there will be soon the rest adapter for
jmx generally start up there for Jerry
but it is not our goal our goal is to
refresh the jay the jet java ee
management API ok so and we don't want
to extend GSR 88 but we want to somehow
provide at least it is in the ?
something for application deployment so
we know more we want to talk about the
API to create your deployment tool but
maybe at least the simplest cases for
deployment or deployment and and
appointment of application we would like
to include into the API and what is
still other ? is that we want to
modernize the set of manage predefined
managed beans it is under ? but from my
personal perspective if we will not do
it it will be sick it will be wrong this
this this peg will be will be wrong and
complete and probably still not so
modern ok originally when I did not know
that I will use this room which has this
save some system
maybe will not vote this a some system
today I don't know I prepare the way how
to provide me feedback on several
question which i will open during this
presentation it is simple Google Form so
you can attend it okay you can use your
smart device to to to attend it and
answer a few questions I will open this
question and describe these questions
today and really you know this is the
JCP project it means that it is open
definition of the new standard and you
can be involved in it and you can be
involved in it in the heart Rea that you
join the mailing class and will read the
mail in conversation and write to the
mailing conversation you can do that no
problem you can you can enjoy dit by
your Java user group if you are in some
Java google group you can you can write
Mel to expert group directly it's no
issue but this provides you probably the
best way how to just tell your opinion
on the most current question so it's up
to okay I tell that the main goal is to
provide a REST API so management is so
we want to introduce management
resources of course resources are rest
so we want with risk management
resources and first thing is how it will
be organized in the past it will be very
we want to plan to organize it in a very
nature away using this pattern it means
that everything will be under domain
originally it was not in JM x 77 managed
objects are not theoretically all are
the domains there are several routes
domain server and others but we want to
introduce everything under the domain in
the GSR 373 and of course there will be
domain name of some domain and android
there will be always the type and name
it means for example here
the example it is server a name of the
cell 1a next application and application
fool you know and so so it means that we
recognize the resources which defines
kind of the type and the resources which
are name which define really something
what you can manage so you have always
the list of the resources which are
organized under some type and then list
of the objects which you can manage or
free sources of course not of the object
which you can manage so here is the
first question but unfortunately if I
understand correctly the guy who has the
was the tool did not come so there is no
laptop visual organized answers so this
is failure of the room but still this
was just the warm-up question then I
want to try to recognize if you care so
it is just kind of fun so maybe we will
try just by hands who of you just just
warm up ok this is the almost any
question who are you who of you would
prefer to use four types singulars and
who plurals ok it means server or
servers in them in the past different
rest interfaces has very different
pattern in this way so for example we
can we can use arise hands okay we don't
have to so who want to use the a it
means singles it is no different
patterns like I move on to use the
porous uh-huh I seen just teasing girls
are Maria this is also my feeling but ok
yeah exa it yeah I must accede we
realized to discuss about it in the
expert group what is the better way ok
ah and the name the name in the past is
not objecting ok I tell the jmx always
defined object names and we believe that
we still can be compatible and tells and
does not define a real way how to
transform name to the objecting of gmx
because the rest
p i will be compatible but will be
disconnected of the jmx structure it
means that you can find any resource as
a managed object in the jmx but does not
need to really transfer the pass to the
object name and it is because object
name is very complicated structure and
we want to be as simple as possible
already I've as simple as possible
actually because the name is just string
the particular implementations it means
sellers can can use the object name
structure because in the HTTP you can
use something what is known as matrix it
means that you provide the string
semicolon and then arguments names
equals something so it is like
objectname UK you can create object name
as well as the kind of pass element
using this matrix but generally it is
not not the case we want to be simple
okay operations management defined at
least lifecycle I talk about that so
lifecycle need something like operation
it means that you have always resource
and you want it to start or stop this
resource and this is not only case when
you want to do these operations so the
simple we want again as simple as
possible model for the rest
identification of the resource and we
want to tell that the operation is
always up resource it means in the
example that you have for example here
server 1 / stop and you will post to
this resource and it will just stop the
server one actually so as simple as
possible of course when we are talking
about rest there are two most important
parts would you have already defined the
path for the resources and mapping for
four methods for HTTP methods quite
natural at this for me get should return
the set of attributes
and also set of all sub resources of any
resource it means that if you get on
type you will probably see only set of
sub resources if you it means that you
do get on servers or server you will
receive the set of advanced server to
server three URLs for these sellers if
you do get on the server / one you will
receive the information about attributes
of this server and also about all sub
resources it means that on Survivor
there are all resources like jdbc ssgt a
resource whatever so list of such
resources will be included in form of
URL of course and one important thing is
that it also template will be provided
during and get I will talk about
template later next post and put method
poster update at put will create new
resource nature nature for most of you
and you can update attributes or
executor / a shin by post post on
operation will just executive update of
course and delete will remove remove the
resource actually not all the resources
are writable okay some resources can be
studied only or you cannot delete them
so it's it's only it will work only in
case that it is supported foot for such
resource okay question about put and
post currently we want to tell that Paul
put method will always be used for
create new resource for example you want
to create the JDBC resource you will put
but there are a lot of people who tells
if you want to use put it means that
whatever you sent there to the server
you must receive on your next get it
means that it is must be exactly the
same entity I don't agree for example
with it and it is not fit our case
because if you want to create some new
resource you don't want
definitely not to provide all attributes
because most of these attributes you
will use from default values if you want
to create a JDBC resource you will
provide just mandatory attributes and
the application server can support them
many many many fine grained information
and you don't want to put it but when
you get it you will receive it with all
possible information so it was not
exactly the same so currently we still
want to support just strictly put to
create post to not create or at least
balls that you can create by put or post
actually this kind of very open question
which you can vary i will really
appreciate your feedback no query
parameters just Jason data I am Not sure
that it will be in the final version
that we will really not support by
standard any query parameters but at
least it is the way how we want to do it
if we will not if we will support at the
end some query parameter there will be
not so many of them why because we want
to have open doors for add features from
application servers which can I don't
know gives you possibility for some
advanced filtering so there must be some
space where a particular implementation
can compete each other's and one away
how they can specify something extra let
you specify something extra and still be
compatible with vista standard is to is
our query parameters which we can next
live alone for use of the particular
implementation and everything what we
probably need will be in the JSON data
object which will be sent there and back
from the server okay
yeah we want to support just Jason and
everything else can be optional of
course anybody can add more more
information yep actually I never heard
this question it's great that you asked
XML is great because it has kima and
actually we need schema but we want also
the simplicity and a relatively low
profile of the Jason and the fact that
it is the currently mainly used for Matt
for data but his lack of schema which we
fight with it and I will tell you on the
next time I we file it with the XML we
will have no issue in the schema because
we will have it but still it's been so
so for example you will prefer xml forma
both okay hey youtube who will prefer
both formats in the standard who want to
stronger jason hondas and strongly xml
okay but yes lovely many people wants to
xml the boss format so it can yeah i
will really consider it so thank you for
this so what i want to show you is that
it will be a really simple format on the
bottom of this jason you see some
attributes of mail session for example
for on this slide and you see three
links always rulings first thing is to
the parent second is to myself and the
third link is to the help or template
help or template any implementation of
java II can have own structure for any
resource it is the way how these servers
are different because the resources of
each server are slightly different you
will configure it in different way you
can configure advanced features a
service can has
all resources which are for compete with
other servers so we cannot predefine
manage resources by the standard we can
redefine just some simple set it is the
way how it was done in 77 and I think
that we cannot leave it we must leave
the space for the for the particular
implementation but we must provide way
how to tell user what is the template
what if you want to create this result
what you can put there and maybe some
information if get the resource wats
attributes means so provide some space
for help this is the the question is not
here but this is the most discussed part
in this moment how will it be the format
of the help we were we have the several
several format and the most important
problem there is that we have no
standard which we can use for it there
is no JSON schema JSON schema is under
construction so from the standard you
cannot link something what is under
construction it must be against and are
so we fight between two possibilities to
create to define something similar to
the to the schema something simpler but
still see similar with the but we expect
that will be soon standard schema for
Jason or something super similar what
will be just for this this case so this
is just for this case but it will be at
least readable for people or readable
for machines and displayed on any
graphic you are you graphic interface or
whatever so this is the kind of question
and next one these are it was the
another game in the room these are lists
of many resources I'm sure that you
don't want to read it this this is list
from the 77 and this is next part which
we are introducing the new resources
because if you see there are no jpa
no no jax-rs related managed beans there
are no concurrency beans so which we
want to we would like to produce new
standard beans for this part of the
standard okay so we don't have this
voting machine but maybe do any of you
feel something some be in which you want
to see there for example I try to tell
about few of them yet for example of
course yes Sher Singh so you use it so
currently we have about the 12 new beans
video you should introduce that so it is
a disguise emerging okay so it was the
question about next one model for the
events as I tell previously jsr 77
supports events and we want to support
it also on the rest interface so
generally we can use three approaches
one is pulling second is long pulling
pulling means that you just get get get
get rock pulling that you get and wait
what will come and get again if
something will be sent and web sockets
are quite modern new standard which we
can use actually also web sockets are
not well fit for two reasons first is
this is full duplex and we don't need
for duplex so with this little bit too
heavy for us because we just want the
events in one direction so it does not
need to be full duplex and the second is
that web sockets are not supported by
general tools for example you cannot use
coral to call web sockets so you must
install
yeah we can use web focus generally okay
I just does it maybe it is too big
hammer yes we have this hammer this is
modern everybody loves it somehow but
you know if if you have hammer
everything looks like nails so it's
little bit discussing so and this there
is one more standard for the for the
long polling which is my favorite
currently this is server sent events sir
recent events are very simple we want to
be simple we won't really really really
to be simple you can use any tool like
Karl or whatever you want to use to see
it because it is general wrong polling
you just open the open the connection or
provide the request and you will wait
for the response and the server will
just send you just this kind of data
first event it is the type of the event
create start a very compatible with the
desert sand desert ID which was also
defined by j's are 77 and can be used to
if you lost the connection you can tell
ok please continue from the id-5 or
something like that and any data which
will be in the same format it means the
jason as we have so you can you can
receive it in a very simple way what is
the negative on it is that it is still
it has the json api des sorry it has the
JavaScript API but still not very
supported in all sellers it all browsers
so so this is the very negative for the
SS is that it is not widely supported at
least the JavaScript API but it i like
it most and i must also one more thing
with HTTP to https push so it is very
new thing HTTP to for us and it has push
so it can be also concur but this sse is
currently the most supported way how to
provide events so ok you can you can
still use my use my used my
questionnaire e to reactivate
application deployment
application deployment we want to
support some kind of very simple
application deployment you can will be
able to provide the provider artifact
which you want to deploy it together
with deployment plan which is quite
standard I so we can use these two to
attribute but generally it's not the
primary goal of this API so we will see
how it will end up so just we are neatly
near to the end of this and we can begin
discussion before we begin general
discussion I want to open the question
which I have for several months is yet
if I discuss with my colleagues from
other companies about it the trick is
the jsr 77 was never updated in the last
nine years and it must have some reason
it is not like it was forgotten the java
ee itself is very different from this
from the time we have a lot of new API
their lot of new resources which can be
managed and nobody won't stand up for
the management why for me the answer is
simple because the users generally don't
want to use the standard API they have
some server and use it use it you want
just to use the cell and each server has
solution okay a solution so maybe
generally so in I have the internal
fight currently there is the fact that
it was never updated for nine years
never ibly it's old and it is still
there so we must do something we must
track but do user needs to react and we
should be able to rat on user so at
least I will ask you for this question
in my question airy if you will tell me
if it will somehow help you so you can
use my google form
answer me so as I show you pretty simple
API pretty simple standard I will open
back the link to the questionnaire e
because the device here is not today
support it okay here is the link and I
want to ask you do you have any question
yeah
no you mean sorry they please vanagon
please replace what now jmx will be
there still we don't want to drop jmx 77
we must be compatible if you want to be
compatible it is just no api what we
don't plan currently to do is the
all-new beans all new managed beans we
don't want to introduce automatically to
the original JMS schema I expect that it
in particular solution it will be
somehow introduced by the way it is
somehow introduced but it will not have
for example first object name or
something like that it will be forced
only the rest on the rest interface
so we have kind of demo generally for
four so we of course do something so we
have kind of demo which can be executed
or almost any application server it will
try to make it bigger no so we have some
kind of demo which you can use and
particular application server force new
versions for example current glass which
are by the way glass which has it for
years but for example weblogic has
currently also rest interface and also
other server has some rest interface so
this is just spec currently
not know we want I sitel previously we
don't want to create general jmx
solution it is not our goal it is just
for the management API so if I think
that it can be that it can be developed
as a rapper but it can be developed in
much more efficient way to communicate
directly with the server so because the
using the rapper is usually a little bit
slower at least proof yes yes
yes you mean the internal implementation
internal implementation again era behind
the behind the API yes it will probably
use the it values not not properly it
will use the same objects of course same
objects will be used but not in the way
that from the rest interface we will go
to the jmx interface and from the gmx
interface to the beach I believe that
most implemented as will go through the
rest interface to the original javab
it's not through the agb or so Maebh
management a jib interface yes directly
but it will be probably possible to
implement it also through the management
AJ bees why not it is possible to map it
yes so no no no no it will not be part
of the specification also dries from
there that the head never want to
introduce it as a part of this
specification
no no standard way forces or the puppets
yes you can yes you can use chip or Papa
to communicate with distressed interface
yes it will be same in the way for
example in the names of the of the
resources but as I tell the content of
the resources and maybe there will be
much more resources which will be
defined by particular application server
this is this is one of the issue so we
cannot and probably we don't want to
tell what is the limit of the
application server application server
can provide much more than yeah there
will be coma yes I hope that it will be
enough to have at least standard basic
standard operation can be done probably
using the standard
okay and I think Alice
excellent so thank you very much I want
to please check your calendar today will
be also Java e bof will be today today
