notification that I should come to this
keynote so that was good planning thank
you so any rate the the name of this
talk is tales from the jar side it's a
little different than what I normally do
it's not a highly technical talk or
anything like that
it's actually much more personal I'm
gonna be talking more about my own
history with Java just as was mentioned
I've written a couple of books but in
case you want to get in touch with me or
anything there's my email address
homepage blog Twitter handle feel free
to contact me however you like my most
recent book is this one called modern
Java recipes from O'Reilly and I brought
a few copies to give away I also have
put together a nice little random number
generator to pick who to give them to
using J shell so I need an excuse to use
J shell and I found one so that's good
also if you have a safari account if you
have the Safari Books online account I
have a whole bunch of videos out there
and teach training classes and
everything ok that's about all the self
marketing I can stomach let's move on I
was a career changer I didn't do
anything in IT for a long time when I
first got in I liked many IT people I
came from another field I was in
engineering actually so this was a long
time ago this was back in the 80s and
90s so I was in mechanical engineering
and mathematics and then eventually went
to aerospace engineering and wound up
getting a PhD and everything in there so
that meant now I was never the sort of
person to take things apart and put them
together so it's always a running gag in
my family that I was in engineering at
all the the goal was always to do
something computer related so there's
gonna be lots of math and software
involved so eventually the plan was to
be a professor and unfortunately that
didn't work out or at least I thought at
the time unfortunately I know better now
because the academic market pretty much
collapsed if you know any postdocs if
you know any people in the academic
environment you know this
it's been very very difficult for them
but I my advisor was a an assistant
professor and he didn't get tenure and I
saw what that was like and I thought
well I don't want to do that so I went
to an industrial research lab in
Connecticut actually so I'm not exactly
local but relatively Connecticut of
course as you are well aware is
basically half Red Sox and half Yankees
you know half Patriots have joined I am
comfortably on the Red Sox side so
that's good it's easy to be a Red Sox
fan here everybody's a Red Sox fan I'm
on the front lines okay I mean I'll go
into a department store and there's a
table it's got half Red Sox shirts and
half Yankee shirts and how do you knock
over half the display it's not so easy
you know any rate so I went to United
Technologies and I was doing research at
the time UTC is the parent company at
the time it was this collection of
companies Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney aircraft
engines score scale copters that was the
aerospace stuff and then the Otis
elevators and carrier Air conditioners
were on the commercial side and there
were NASA contracts and things like that
and my area for a long time was the Aero
acoustics of jet engines which sounded
really cool no pun intended
actually that was a good one never mind
but that meant lots of math and
unfortunately my programming language at
the time was Fortran the nightmares have
ended but it took a while I used to
think off by one error was my middle
name any rate I actually went online and
I found an old paper I'd worked on or
NASA contractor report and I was tempted
to actually show you a piece of it and
then I looked at it and I can't read it
anymore I have no idea what's in there I
imagine I knew at one time but it's been
so long since any of that happen so at
any rate I tried to transition from
Fortran to Java this is when Java first
came out the mid-90s and I had to make
the object-oriented leap at that point
and Bruce Echols thinking in Java was
really the most helpful book for me at
the time so that was that was the first
edition of that book of course there's
been four editions and they could really
use a fit just makes me feel old
eventually at the
research center I joined an AI group
nowadays that would be really hot and I
would get this huge race and everything
would be very impressive we worked on
neural networks and genetic algorithms
at the time it was kind of an
afterthought neural networks hadn't
panned out genetic algorithms were just
another optimization mechanism so it's
not as cool as it was then but that's
what put me in the IT field and told me
that 10 to 15 years of coding and
Fortran hadn't really taught me anything
about software development so I had to
go back to school at that point to go
get a degree in computer science now one
of the things I worked on is I was
looking for excuses to use Java you know
I'd learned it but I didn't really have
a lot of experience with it and one of
the things that came up at the time was
this idea of doing elevator failure
predictions they the oldest people were
collecting lots and lots of statistics
on the behavior of elevators and there
were people who had a math background in
the research center who had done lots of
statistical algorithms and analyses and
I had this ridiculous idea of putting a
java swing GUI on top of a Fortran
program and it was an adventure just by
the way the files were considered huge
at the time there were six gigs of data
you know if you can imagine something so
massive three lessons from that project
don't do that I assume I'm the only
person here who's ever put a Java GUI on
top of a Fortran program now that I said
that is that true has anybody ever done
that if you have my condolences you know
so don't do that I mean it J&amp;amp;I turns out
to be a thing you know it did work but
it was the seed of Fortran bridge that
was the complicated one because they you
know they they viewed the order of
arrays differently and it was all the
little endian and big-endian stuff and I
could say this it did work on my machine
eventually I never was able to port it
anywhere but it did work I was able to
put buttons and knobs and sliders and
get everything to work so that was fun
but as I say I realized that spending
all that time it could in a related
field had not really taught me about
software development and in fact in
Fortran they often
educated as good practices things that
we now know would be really horrible
common blocks if you've ever heard of
them in Fortran the idea is to have
shared data that goes across many many
different files different procedures and
everything and this of course we now
know is the exact opposite of what we
should be doing you know and that was a
recommended practice I also realized
that when I worked in a field that they
called computational fluid dynamics I
worked on programs that had I don't know
50 60 thousand lines of Fortran and
looking back on it I don't remember ever
seeing anything that I could
legitimately call a test case we save
data and we look at it and we made lots
of pretty pictures but was there ever an
actual test to say let's prove this is
right and something automated and
something working and of course that
never happened so any rate I went back
to school and I got the master's in
computer science and of course I didn't
have a huge number of lines of code to
point to as experience so I went and got
the original son certified Java
developer certification taking a test
there and of course I have to give
credit to Kathy Sierra you know that
this is before she wrote the head first
Java book with Bert Bates she is one of
the cofounders of that Java ranch site
which is a certification prep site it's
still going still has a pretty good
forum for questions and everything and I
spent a lot of time there and got the
certification now this was the spring of
2000 so the the bubble had burst but we
didn't know it yet I mean Enron wasn't
gonna collapse until Oh probably another
six months and things were already
headed down but we didn't know so
suddenly I had options I'd never I
hadn't had options for my career for
many many years and this was really
enjoyable and I decided that instead of
becoming an active developer I would go
teach technical training classes which
was actually the part about being
professor that I had been attracted to
in the first place I had always wanted
to do that sort of thing was my what I
realised I wanted was to learn new
things and then tell everybody about it
you know I really enjoy that part of it
and that gave me a chance to do to
follow that passion there so at the
beginning I taught lots and lots of
intro Java classes and probably in
2000-2001 I probably taught an intro
Java class a month you know and learned
a lot in the process of course if you
really want to learn something try
teaching it and dealing with the
questions that come from that it's a
really hones in on exactly where the
gaps are in your knowledge and of course
again I was always looking for an excuse
to write code to support that effort so
one of the things I wrote at the time
was an applet you know it's it's still
bittersweet to me that applets are now
going away but I tried to recreate this
and that's so many hard drive crashes
ago I can't even tell you
but I'd managed to port the idea over to
a swing-u I so this is the code and
IntelliJ and I just want to show you
that I basically have a class here that
is gonna extend jpanel and I've got all
this and I'll just run it just to give
you an idea what this looks like so the
idea was is that at when it was an
applet the students would all load a
page that had the applet embedded in it
and it looks something like this and you
can see this would just pick from a
random list of terms because the hard
part in intro Java class was teaching
object-oriented programming and the
terminology was such a burden you know
such a barrier to understanding and each
time somebody heard a clattering class
they would click on it on their machine
and I also did this of course if you
think I actually googled the Windows 3.1
tada sound yes you're exactly right you
know I did and I even built in a little
restart and everything and honestly now
when I revisited it when I rebuilt it
just more or less prayer preparing for
this talk I have it in a github
repository now I'll show you a link to
that later if you like and it's got a
Gradle build file and in fact you can
run it from Gradle or you it also
generates an executable jar file so that
if you just want to double click on the
jar file that runs to so you're welcome
to well that or anything that I'm going
to show you you're more than welcome to
so that was just an excuse for me to
play around with a lot of these things I
get to there's a picture of it of course
I got to play with swing I got to work
with the Colet
Asians API loaded resources like that
WAV file you heard in everything and it
was a nice learning experience it was
something that the students could do in
class and of course I always told them
they'd win fabulous prizes though at the
time my fabulous prizes were wild cherry
lifesavers you know that seemed to be a
good approach so any rate that was one
thing I did back then but the one that I
used the most for many years was this
thing I called Jeff ergo II which was
desperately trying to avoid the
copyright infringement or is that
trademark infringement not exactly sure
which but either way it's a jeopardy
game obviously and at the time the build
tool of choice this is the late 90s
early 2000s we were still pretty much
using ant at this point and basically
I'd seen somebody put a game board in
front of the screen and just had people
raise their hands and I thought well
wait a minute Jabba's god are a my I
could build an app so that the students
could click on a button and have it take
control of the game board and just have
our am i operating inside a classroom
and use a database for the questions and
all that stuff and of course I was
operating on Windows at the time so the
database was a using Microsoft Access so
I could go into a classroom and just set
up the good old dreaded JDBC ODBC
connection that way if you remember all
that horror and the one cut the
concession I made to not embarrassing
people as I made it so the scores were
kept by team so it didn't matter who
answered the question as the scores went
up and down based on the group of people
you were in now to give me an idea what
this looked like let's see this is here
it is this is the Jeopardy game and I'm
gonna start it up here and then I'll I
actually I can't believe it I again this
was so many hard drive crashes ago but
it turned out I emailed the jar file to
a friend in the early 90s and when I did
that I found the jar file now this codes
not in my github repository because it's
it's far too embarrassing at this point
I really have to clean it up before it's
ready yet but I get the categories out
of a database it lists a bunch of
categories I'll just select four was
always a nice
number and create the game board this
way and that's what the game board
looked like and again I have a bunch of
questions here of various values and
then the fun part was that let's see let
me clear this is that I actually built a
jar file again that had the RMI stubs in
it so I could say let me make that
bigger I could say Java - jar and in the
distributions directory there was my jar
file or they could just double click on
it and this way I could create a player
and a team so let me put I don't know
how about Scott tiger for Oracle I need
a name you know and there's there and
see the player would get a little buzzer
there and no reason I can't make another
one let's put in a second one so this
was under documents Java Shepard go e
you know and then I'll say again Java
dash char distributions Jeb dot jar
let's put I don't know how about Bill G
at Microsoft that one's probably gonna
get questions wrong you know any rate so
just to give you an idea I'll put this
over with the game board just so you can
see them but these would be distributed
around the room and all that would
happen is is I would pick a question and
it would come up and then somebody would
click on the button and that would take
control of the game board C it would
come up with a title here and then I
could say they were right or wrong and I
could show the question if necessary and
you see the scores will go up and down
based on whatever the result was and you
can see them move up and down like that
now one thing unfortunately by running
it the way I ran it I don't know where
the Daily Double is I got to find that
real quick
of course there was a Daily Double where
the scores can really change you know so
I'm just gonna arbitrarily check I
always printed it out to the console
them there it is okay so let's let's
select that and you could bet up to your
total score and of course you always
want to bet at all right see got this
got this
song and everything so of course that's
right and that's basically how the game
ran and it was always fun to do because
as you know it's giving out the code and
talking about how you do the database
access and how you do the RMI stuff and
everything there's a lot of fun there
my most interesting story though that I
think about from that is one time we
were doing an open house for a new
training center that was opening up and
the game basically just operated off of
a table in the database so you could add
a table for anything you know I just
needed a some number of categories and
at least one question for each point
value all the way up so we put in
questions about the company or about in
other words had nothing to do with
technical stuff and we had a room full
of salespeople in there and I learned an
interesting thing about salespeople they
were just banging the heck out of the
the mouse because they didn't care
whether they got questions right or not
they just want to be first it was
amazing because I'd reset the board and
you're bang bang it's like look I
haven't even asked the question yet you
know and the scores would be - 500 - a
thousand where they didn't care it was
just very dramatic that way but any rate
this one was again a very good learning
experience and and once I clean up the
code I will make it available in my
github repository right now I had to
find a JDBC driver that let me access an
Access database where that's been a
while and various other things the fun
part is though I wrote this program
under Java 1.0 moving into 1.1 it's back
in that day maybe some 1.2 stuff in
there as well but that it's still
running
I mean it's running under Java I'm
currently running under 10 and it ran
just fine so the whole write once run
anywhere the whole backward
compatibility sub still paid off I
couldn't believe it
very impressive ok so there was a
picture of that so of course what
changed in my career hit everybody
pretty much at the same time in the Java
world I tended to think of it as the
Ruby on Rails meteor that hit the Java
Dinosaur World
and we all had to react to that it's
like oh my goodness suddenly they could
build a web app in a very short amount
of time that was very effective and
powerful and I already knew something
about servlets and jsps and things like
that but I tried to learn Ruby on Rails
and at the time I was too heavily
invested in the Java world I didn't have
the same background I wasn't really able
to figure that out so instead a year
later Grails came out now if you don't
know that story
basically the people in the groovy
community said how are we going to bring
this the Ruby on Rails productivity into
the Java space so they decided to use
groovy because it was another language
that could do meta programming it was
the language you could write code that
would write code much like Ruby and
therefore at first they called a groovy
on Rails and no less a person that then
DHH himself David Hannum our Hanson who
created Ruby on Rails said no no you
can't call it on Rails you know that's
that's my framework and and of course
he's right so they changed the name to
Grails and that's where that all started
as a another aside by the way calling it
Ruby on Rails is a decision that an
American never ever would have made
because he basically was saying Ruby is
powerful and let's do rapid powerful
development and was thinking of the high
speed European trains when he went on
rails can you imagine doing Java on
Amtrak I mean I was supposed to come
here on Amtrak yesterday and the trains
broke down had to go to it was a mess so
no any rape so I got involved in Grails
and then in groovy and of course it was
still built on Java and there was spring
and hibernate and all these other
open-source projects that tied into it
and I was basically the target audience
because I'd already been familiar with
Ruby on Rails and wanted to learn the
rest of this so around 2007 I really
started diving into groovy that was my
first exposure to a non Java language on
the JVM so again as an app just to try
something out I did this one called
groovy baseball now this is part of my
making Java groovy book and
these are the risks of course of dealing
with an open-source service that may go
away I was built this on top of box core
information that's provided by Major
League Baseball on a daily basis they
have a website where you can download
this stuff and I tried to access this
about a couple of months ago and
suddenly part of it was blocked you
couldn't get at it and again nothing I
did it's just they decided not to get
part of it away or something I have no
idea what but I was able to rewrite it
to get at it so to give you a quick idea
what this is like that's this one here
if I execute this now actually I'm going
to use a plug-in for Gradle called
Greddy
which basically allows you to deploy a
web app onto jetty or Tomcat or even a
cluster or what-have-you and this one
uses a an h2 database for the locations
of the stadiums for Major League
Baseball as well as well many other
options here so this will bring up the
data as you see from yesterday's
baseball games or at least the ones that
actually ran and of course we were
rained out yesterday right so but you
can even click on it and see actually
it's not showing the mouse over oh there
it is yeah it shows the score of the
individual games and it's all centered
on the home stadium so the idea here was
to use a Google geo coder to encode all
the latitudes and longitudes for the
baseball stadiums and save them in an h2
database I used h2 because this is part
of a github repository I don't want you
have to set anything up in order to be
able to run this so it's all
self-contained you just download it run
the Gradle build and it will go ahead
and create the database and it will go
get the scores and I can click on a
different date and it should go get the
scores for that as well and replace them
all although there's some lag involved
and I don't want to wait for it but any
rate that's the idea so that was that
was a lot of fun building something like
that I think I sometimes have to click
on a twice for reasons I don't
understand
yeah well it's code you know I did hear
a clever what a Twitter joke what did
they say a million monkeys on a million
typewriters will eventually type a Java
program and the rest will be Perl
programs yeah anyway I thought it was
funny okay so this is running on Greddy
well which is really running a jetty
server that's managed by Gradle so it's
a greddy plugin for Gradle and as I say
everything still works it's working just
fine I just had to clean up that code
this code is in the github repository of
course and you're welcome to that
whenever you like let me be sure to stop
that though there we go
okay so part of stacks you get XML or
JSON data whichever you prefer for the
box score information just pulling it
down yeah there's a picture of it when I
was writing the making job a groovy book
I wandered into Barnes &amp;amp; Noble remember
when we used to have bookstores you know
you could go around it and I was looking
around and I noticed that there was only
one shelf at the time called computer
whereas unfortunately there were three I
think labeled teen paranormal romance
and I was going to lament the state of
the world and everything and then I got
an inspiration I thought no actually
what this means is is in order to sell
my book what I needed was some groovy
vampires in the book so I decided to go
consume data from first I looked at IMDB
or whatever thing but they didn't have
an API so instead I went to Rotten
Tomatoes and it turned out they had a
public API with only get requests that's
all it's supported but I could do
queries on movie titles and topics and
everything and pull down massive amounts
of JSON data and then parse it now that
also gave me a chance to use a no sequel
database so I put all the movie
information inside a Mongo database
because that was the native data
structure you know in beasts on and
everything and I was still heavily in
the groovy community so I used rat-pack
which is a really nice what we would
today call a micro service frame
very simple framework for building a
restful web service and I was going to
show you that and unfortunately what
happened was
Fandango apparently acquired Rotten
Tomatoes and now you have to become a
quote partner to get access to the data
anymore and this was silly enough to
begin with so I haven't gone through
that nightmare yet but I've got the code
and everything and again it was fun it
was an opportunity to play with a lot of
these alternative technologies and do
something and I actually I went to my
local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble said hey I'm a
local author can you get a couple copies
of my book and I'll sign him and
everything and they went okay so they
saw they brought a couple in and I
signed him and they just kind of sat
there and sat there and sat there and so
eventually I took one of them and I
figured okay this why not and I put it
over in the teen paranormal romance
section you know figuring hey it's got
vampires in it you know I did actually
do that app in the book and everything
and then I went by about a month later
and it was gone and I thought oh my
goodness did somebody actually buy this
thing and I went by the info desk and of
course somebody just moved it it was
gone who knows you know
didn't sell I don't have very high
expectations on that stuff anymore but
it was it got a story out of it so that
was good now late in the in the 2000s
there I wound up on the the speaker tour
the no fluff just stuff speaker tour we
come to the Boston area a couple times a
year one up in Wakefield one out in
Framingham and I got on that tour and
the person who did Android talks was not
gonna be on anymore and the organizer
asked me if I'd like to pick that up and
I was already interested in Android just
because I was interested in mobile and
Android felt like Java I mean that was
the idea now whether it is Java or not
I'm not getting into that in here I'm
not an attorney you know and I don't
want to get into any of that part but
again it gave me an opportunity to dig
into a new area with Java as the
baseline knowledge section that I can
start from of course nowadays it also
supports Kotlin another chance to get
into it an alternative JVM language and
what I did is I access something called
ICN D
the Internet Chuck Norris database now
yeah you may not have heard of that one
that has a public API if I bring up my
Android studio app here then I can show
you that app and what it basically does
is it goes to this restful web service
and downloads JSON data and inside that
then it parses the joke out of it and
then renders it inside an application so
if I let me start up my emulator real
quick here let's pick the pixel - that
sounds like a good one and then I'll
just show you this working and this
again was an opportunity to learn how to
do asynchronous programming because you
didn't want to lock up the GUI and I
done swing programming before so I was
familiar with the idea you know how do
you get off the event dispatch thread
and all of that and then how to parse
JSON data using a Java API there's some
really nice libraries by the way some
really nice Java libraries that are
available in Android that you can also
use outside like there's one called
retrofit you may have heard of retrofit
is an excellent job a library for doing
accessing and parsing restful web
services you pass get potent post put
and delete requests you convert it to a
Java object etc so let me see if I can
run this guy access that and I'll just
say run and continue anyway and let's
see oh good the figures that I've got an
issue with it oh I think I changed my
apk or whatever all right well I'll it
works and it's actually in the Google
Play Store and I can point that out too
if you're interested but I have a
picture again that's the beauty of this
sort of thing I'll show you the code but
I always have a backup I use Brian gets
of course Brian gets can spawn threads
the complete before they're started
complete before they're started or can't
can't test for quality because he has no
equal that sort of thing so this little
app again allows me to access a restful
web service
convert the data to a java class and
then update a GUI with that and it's got
a little play button on it now and a
little plus button that will allow me to
share joke using SMS or whatever if I
find a good one all that kind of stuff
and it was all based on Android which
means eventually was all based on on
Java ultimately one quick story about
that by the way I wrote this app and in
fact well let me actually show you here
if I go to play.google.com and I go
inside the app section so let me let
that load up a section so here's the app
section and I search on well Chuck
Norris I think I'll do it then you
should see the app there actually I
think I need to change it let me try the
icy NDB one yeah there it is
and I put this there and I was giving
all these talks on the no fluff tour and
I called it the Internet Chuck Norris
database app because that's all I was
doing he's consuming data from a public
website and I put it in the Google Play
Store just to demonstrate how to deploy
and of course all the data is in my
github repository and about a week after
I deployed it I got an email from patent
Boggs LLP that's this name here the
attorneys for mr. Carlos Rey quote Chuck
Norris did you know Chuck Norris his
name is Carlos Ramos I had no idea you
know any rate he was they were upset
that I was infringing on their
intellectual property although they
couldn't exactly how I mean again I was
consuming data from a public website and
just rendering I'm giving the code away
I didn't charge anything for this on my
goodness like anybody pay anything for
this and they you know I ignored it and
a week later Google just you know
disabled my app they suspended it and
I'm like whoa and normally I'm much too
much of a coward to do anything about
that but in this case I got annoyed so
over a weekend I converted it to the
Internet Carlos Rey database as you see
here and uploaded that and I put you see
I put the attorneys
logo you know everything I gave it a
five-star review
you know but I did that there's a couple
of decent reviews actually at best
Carlos Rey app ever definitely unlike
any other Carlos Rey app you know so
it's been sitting there for a couple of
years now and it you know I have what
tens of users or something like that so
you're welcome to it whenever you like
of course I've made the one mistake you
can't make which is I lost the key you
know you you sign it using the Jar
signer and starting a key tool and
everything and I again it was a hard
drive crash I lost the key so I can't
update it anymore it would think it was
a new app but it's all in my my github
repository you're welcome to it at any
time so just mentioning that ok still
haven't heard anything from the
attorneys again so I think I'm okay now
at the time I was the only person on the
no fluff tour that was speaking on both
Gradle and Android so the people from
Gradle incorporated approached me about
writing a book for O'Reilly a recipes
book on Gradle for Android specifically
so I wrote that one in 2016 you know so
it's just a couple of years ago and
worked on that I it started a couple
years before that these things always
take way more time than you expected
the plan was just to give it to Gradle
and they would give it away and if by
some freak chance you are in fact
interested in that book I have a link
here if you just go to Gradle dot org
slash books and give them an email
address you could download the PDF for
free or whatever which tells you mostly
you don't want me negotiating your next
contract I agreed to a royalty on a book
I knew they were going to give away so
any rate but that's there if you're
interested in it so then I had this
thought it's like wow I just wrote a
recipes book for O'Reilly how hard could
it be to write another recipe book for
O'Reilly because after all that's when
Java eight came out and even though it
been out it really started to make an
impact a couple of years ago and a lot
of people needed to transition to using
streams and lambdas and method
references and even just the fact that
we've got the job at that time package
is awesome now you know and therefore I
thought I'll write a book
on that and that's how the modern Java
recipes book came about incidentally if
you're interested in the economics of
technical book publishing if you were to
buy my book I can buy a cup of coffee
but not at Starbucks
okay that's roughly the amount of money
we're talking about here if you divide
by the number of hours you spend writing
it it probably goes negative and
everything so but at any rate that's
what that gave me a chance to die back
into Java so after all these years of
being in groovy and and the associated
technologies and Android and and still
keeping touch with Java this was my
chance to get back in for real and dive
in that way and that was a lot of fun so
I got to get into this static and
default methods and interfaces I put
some stuff with completable futures in
there finally after all these years a
chance to really learn some of the
concurrency stuff that I should have
learned from Brian gets his book years
ago you know it's a chance to dig into
that the optional class etc and what I
did at the time is I created a
repository let me load that up let me
switch this to Java 8 recipes I loaded a
repository for the Java 8 part and I
made a separate repository for the job
of nine stuff because the idea was is
that the job of nine well the plan was
the book was gonna be out long before
job and I was released and you know
those how that worked out so I needed at
least a chapter on job at 9:00 and I
added that and there's only a couple
things I want to show you in here that
are amusing one is that let me mention
that Java dot time business here is I
think I have a picture over here let me
show you the picture first yeah you see
this picture they say you can tell a
developer if I whispering in their ear
the word time zones and watching a
shudder go right down their spine okay
this is the set of time zones in
Antarctica just to give you an idea I
mean how scary is that and and yet the
funny part doesn't even jump out at you
at first here's the funny part you see
the South Pole here is in a hashed
region this region is known as the Ross
dependency
and it follows the timezone rules for
New Zealand and basically more or less
but what this means is is that the South
Pole you know six months of darkness
followed by six months of daylight is on
daylight savings time believe it or not
and I wanted to prove that now there was
a nice little demo in actually a
separate one let me just show you here
here is my Antarctica time zones program
using streams and lambdas and Java
you know the Java time package so I make
a local date local date time actually
and then the zone ID class has that
great method called get available zone
IDs and when I turn that into a stream
that gives me a stream of strings those
are all region IDs like one of the
things I learned of course many of you
may already be aware there's no such
thing as Eastern Standard Time or
Eastern Daylight Time according to the
ISO 8601 spec instead we are in and I
hate to say it this way America / New
York I'd rather be in America / Boston
right I mean I again I'm in Connecticut
so New York to me is that's an illegal
state exception you know it's dark it's
dirty as fully Yankee fans you
understand you know any rate that get
available zone IDs method returns these
strings representing the region IDs from
all over the world that when I counted
when I did this in Java eight there were
like six hundred of them I'm sure there
are more now so I turned them into a
stream and I filtered them such that the
string contained the word Antarctica
because all the Antarctic ones had that
word in it and then the map method
allowed me to convert the strings into
zone IDs I'm using the of method on the
zone ID class has a method reference so
now I have a stream of zone IDs and then
by applying at zone on the current local
date/time I'm now putting it in that
particular time zone so there's a stream
of zone date times and the reason I did
that is because then I could get an
offset in total seconds and use the
sorted method with comparing intz this
is a static import in the comparator
class that allows me to sort the time
zones by their number of seconds offset
from GMT so I collected them all and
then I print out the offset the zone and
is daylight savings time or not nice
little method there and when I execute
this what I see make that bigger is yes
indeed oh the South Pole went off of
daylight savings time last time I ran
this they were on daylight savings time
so it's probably right about when we
went on they went off on that sort of
thing but you see how easy it is to do a
program like this once you have the Java
dot time package available to you so
there's there's lots of little neat
demos like that again I mostly it's well
partly at least it's an illustration of
my own sense of humour so sorry about
that but whatever okay there's that one
if you're interested now of course I
have to more or less finish on cat
pictures right I mean that's why the
internet was invented and there is a
restful web service available from
Flickr that is a Flickr photo search now
I say it's sort of a restful web service
because any rest advocate I know would
be appalled by this you know what those
rest advocates call themselves by the
way if you heard that term they call
themselves rest Afar Ian's I know that
shows way more sense of humor than those
people normally demonstrate you know I
mean they will argue you into the ground
over what is and is not a restful web
service in fact once I use soap just to
avoid that argument to say nobody's
going to tell me whether or not this is
so full you know but at any rate the
reason they wouldn't like Flickr's web
service is because it actually has the
verb in the name it's photos search as a
parameter you know and of course you're
not supposed to have anything other than
the HTTP verbs etc etc but if I didn't
want to you know log in or anything I
did have to go through the registration
at Yahoo so that was painful but if I
didn't want to log in then I could just
do a get request on the photos search
and download the JSON data and using
groovy I could use a swing builder to
build up the swing UI but I could use
Java 8 with parallel streams or nine or
ten and in fact that's what I want to
show you here this is my let's make this
fullscreen here I call concurrent
kitties but
it's parallel kitties here and groovy
I've got a file with my flicker key in
it and this is I'm gonna search the
Flickr photos search using that key get
back JSON data and I just want to see
six photos so this is groovy speak for
downloading the but taking these
parameters in this map here and
converting it into a query string see
this converts each key value pair into
key equals value and then joins them
with an ampersand and then this converts
it to a URL and then downloads the JSON
data so I write the JSON data to a file
if you know and then I pretty print it
you'll see it and then that groovy has
this class called a JSON slurper if you
will that lets you dig into the json
data without having to map it to classes
that's what you'd normally do in java so
you'd have to map it to classes so i
parse it and i dig into the photo
elements and here's where i go parallel
is that i convert to a parallel stream
this is using a groovy method but it's
using the underlying java eight streams
here and what happens is is in the
response you get back you get parameters
like farm and server and ID and secret
and you use those to build up the actual
link to the image because the top-level
jason doesn't have a link to the image
and it just has these pieces of it so i
synthesize the image and do the download
in parallel so i can download all six
pictures at the same time and then
render my little swing builder with the
cat pictures now i'm gonna run this but
i have to warn you i don't know what i'm
gonna get back
okay it's the latest six pictures at
flickr that are tagged with the word
kitties now I did cat once and I got
back tractors I'm like tractor Oh
caterpillar I get it you know but I've
gotten dogs I've gotten monkeys you know
I'll simply say if I get something
completely inappropriate I will close it
right away all right but just warning
you so let me run this and you'll see oh
by the way that illegal reflective
access that oh hey I got picked I got
cats okay I put that one in the win
column but you see how fast that was
because it downloaded all the cat
pictures in parallel you know I did this
before a job of one conference as a
groovy in Java eight talk there and you
see how that worked
again all the codes in a github
repository if you're interested in it
you know works just fine so that's the
cat pictures one or actually more
properly it was the parallel kitties one
if you're interested now the future of
course Java ten has come out and we've
got of course module is a ssin from Java
nine and above we've got the collection
factory methods of course the big hot
topic these days is reactive streams
Java nine has the interfaces in it but
not an implementation I've been playing
with the swing at spring-trap pardon me
the Spring Framework related one
reactive streams are the the project
reactor implementation of the reactive
stream spec etc also we have our local
variable type in for instant everything
and of course there's lots more so to do
one last thing I wanted to give away
those books as I mentioned and let's see
where's my picture here let's make this
bigger and this gives me as I mentioned
an excuse to use J shell so when I say J
shell here and I say open I made a class
called person Java and I can list it and
you'll see thank you and then here's my
class I really wanted to do put the VAR
type in there but of course as you know
right I'm assuming you know local
variable is serious you can only put var
on local variables and those are
attributes so I lost my opportunity to
put var in there even though this is
running our job at 10 but I'm going to
generate row column inside the side it's
like I'll make this side is 1 and that
side is 2 just arbitrarily and then the
rows start at the front and go back and
I think what did we say there were 10
rows is that right twelve rows thank you
and there were 10 seats on each side so
10 columns here so I just put it in the
two string method so if I just say new
person that gave me on the this side
over here and it got to make you walk so
it's way back in the 11th row and the
tenth column you can measure the columns
from either side whatever you like and
if there's an empty seat there just give
to somebody nearby you know I want to
reserve
one book for a woman in computer science
woman or unrepresented minority but I
know we've got the Women in Technology
luncheon coming up so make sure that we
give one book at least to somebody who's
going to go to the luncheon or something
actually we could just do that right off
hand if you're going to that luncheon
you just raise your hand or somebody and
feel free to pick somebody there thank
you okay so any rate there was one book
and then I've got two more right so okay
on this side five rows back nine seats
in whatever that is it gave me an excuse
to use J shell you know I'm still
looking for a reason to really use that
very much although I mentioned I'll use
it in tutorials and stuff last one
you're all set
giving her a chance to get her exercise
so the last one again is on this side
second row second person in or somebody
nearby there and there you go so that's
everything I just the conclusion I have
really is that Java has basically been
the soundtrack to my career change you
know it's the the thing in the
background that's been running the whole
time whenever I got into computer
science and even when I went off into
so-called affiliated technologies
alternative jvm languages groovy Kotlin
what-have-you Java has always been there
and everything I've done in that has
it's always been the friendly home to go
back to and when the functional
capabilities came out in Java eight that
gave me an excuse to really dive back in
and now I'm one thing I want to mention
about 10 by the way I don't know if
you're aware I have my Java eight
repository my job an EIN repository and
I can run a Gradle build on those the
biggest difference that happened when I
ran the Gradle build on Java 10 other
than the complaint about the illegal
reflective access and groovy which is
just a warning you ignore that is it ran
so fast I had to verify it ran at all I
couldn't believe how much faster the
Gradle build ran under job at ten it ran
a hundred and fifty tests and everything
in under two seconds I mean it's not a
huge repository certainly not by open
source standards
but it was fast to me and certainly a
lot faster than a twas and things like
that
so I'm looking forward to the new
changes I'm very happy to be here my
github repository is a github calm slash
my last name kou sen and then i have a
whole series of repos there if you need
any further information just send me an
email and i can i can reply or contact
me on Twitter and I'll just say enjoy
the conference thank you very much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
