for coming I know it's last day after
big concert but thank you all for
attending I hope you gained some good
stuff out of this first off let me
introduce myself my name is Trevor
Leishman aw i'm a lead software engineer
a small company called the platform
that's owned by a large company called
comcast and you know we've we've
implemented code review systems at at
both companies and it's worked really
well let me ask how many people here
have our d actively do code review Oh
awesome great so that's that's fantastic
when when I started doing a code review
I was on a team that did not do it at
all a company that didn't really believe
in it and a lot of my journey a lot of
what I talk about is is how we we change
that mentality of of saying this is my
code and I don't really want to show it
to someone else I'm sure we've all dealt
with that before a couple notes before
we start have two rules one uh how about
how many here have gone to an open
spaces event or no one open spaces event
is those are those guys if you haven't I
really encourage you to go one of these
they're fantastic and open spaces event
is a is a vent where people get together
and share ideas and the one cardinal
rule of hobart spaces event is that you
vote with your feet if this isn't the
talk for you feel free to leave i'm not
going to be offended and i want to make
that explicit at the very beginning a
lot of the presenters don't and just
want to make that clear and the other
thing i learned this at a national
conference i went to is holder questions
until you have them and then ask them I
one of the things that whenever wherever
I'm at a conference I have a question I
don't want to asset the to the presenter
I'm like okay okay I'm going to wait
till the end I forgot where my question
is so feel free to ask
questions this should be a conversation
and we'll all learn together so what I
want to talk about is is sort of the
psychology behind code review and really
what what drives that and one of the
things is this thing called the
dunning-kruger effect how many of you
guys have heard of this before so a
couple then cougar effects is this
concept and there was studied years and
years ago that that people who might be
less skilled at something whatever they
happen to be doing tens and this is not
always true but tends to think they're
better at what they do then they
actually are and that's called
illusionary superiority I'm sure we've
all encountered this maybe we have been
this person that that thinks they're hot
stuff after spending four days learning
a framework and I know everything about
that framework I definitely have been
there another interesting thing is
there's another side of that coin and
that's something called impostor
syndrome now how many of you have heard
of impostor syndrome so a few more this
is something that that we hear about a
lot well not a lot but often in computer
science especially related to women in
computer science if you've ever gone to
a CS and feminism workshop but you hear
about pasta syndrome a lot and that's
that concept that's it that gut feeling
that you have that someone your manager
while your peers are going to walk into
your office or walking through your cube
one day and point at you and say you
don't know what you're doing I've got
you I've got you you all you do is you
look on google or you look on sac
overflow and you copy and paste code and
you're out of here you're gone and like
we all have this gut feeling that that
that were were probably Impostors we're
faking it and
why mirrors say is that if you have that
feeling you're probably not faking it
because turns out we all do that and
this is a the flip side of that dank
Kruger affect people that are are better
at their jobs know more about what
they're doing tend to underestimate how
good they are what they do both of these
come to play when you're thinking about
reviewing code so I'm talking about
reviewing code what i mean by code
review so so large there's lots of
different types of code review but
there's one type of cobra to it code of
you in particular that I really like and
that's pre-commit or pre merged code
review that's a concept of having your
code be reviewed by another person or
multiple people before it even gets into
your master repository before it gets
pushed out on your consider singer
gracious service or gets anywhere it
it's good it gets looked at by another
person oftentimes when people think of
code review they think of writing code
having it checked in having it deployed
and then only after the fact gained to a
room with five other people and
scrutinizing their code that is the most
horrible thing that I've ever done and I
wish it upon nobody I think it's with
rare exception a crappy thing to do
there are obviously examples especially
if your government regulated to have
group code reviews then well too bad for
you but if you can get away with with
doing these pre-commit code readers
they're much more enjoyable so why why
should review code maybe you already
know this um that's dhh hero trails he
said something to the fact that testing
is not very valuable which I also
disagree with but code review is
valuable for a lot of reasons and it's
valuable for a lot of people and if
you've been regulated to do code review
at your job and you think it's annoying
I'm here to say is that it's actually
pretty awesome and
there are lots of good reasons to do it
one of the biggest ones is mentorship so
what I mean by mentorship if if you're a
new person team and you might you might
be an expert at Java you might be an
expert at whatever framework you're
using but I guarantee you're not expert
at the domain knowledge needed for
getting something done on new team so if
you get in there and you start doing
code reviews especially is pre-commit
one-on-one personal code reviews you're
going to learn the code faster and
you're going to be able to teach the
code faster and that teaching goes both
ways one of the things I found with code
reviews is and this is really pitching
code reviews to the more senior
developers that that have coded for ten
years without code review is as you say
hey this is a chance for you to teach
other people how how to better write
code but there's a flip side to that
because none of us are perfect someone
that's been doing job for 20 years is
going to make mistakes in Java and
someone that's younger might be able
catch things you know there's there's
that reciprocation another thing is the
bus factor how many of you guys have
heard of the bus factor all right so few
so the bus factor is a morose analogy
it's this concept of like you're the
you're the only developer writing this
one esoteric piece of the code you're
writing the boot loader for something in
its it's really difficult code you get
hit by a bus oh no Timmy got hit by a
bus it's horrible we're all very sad we
really mourned to me you know there's a
there's a wake forum it's wonderful
everyone cries a couple weeks later I
guy right let's go back to Timmy's go
Timmy's codes horrible no one
understands TVs code turns out God rest
his soul here's a really bad developer
and no one understands how the
bootloader works so what you do either
have like a team of people invest a lot
of time to learn the bootloader or you
throw it out and rewrite it one of the
things code review helps mitigate is
stopping that single single person that
single point of failure which is the
less
Rosa way of saying the buses of factor
you know you have other people looking
at your code give other people looking
at all the parts of the system so assume
you gets hit by a bus after the wake you
can go back and and Joey can be a cure
I'm going to work in this code because
I've already looked it before that's a
big hope another thing is you find bugs
early so this is something that might be
obvious but I'll say it anyway when
someone's looking at the code that
you're writing or you're looking at
someone else's code before it gets
merged into your master repository
before it gets checked by by your
testers before it get pushed out to
production you're going to find stuff
you might find a typo this is true
yesterday morning I get a call from from
work and they say oh my god there's
something wrong with our with our
production boxes and it turns out
there's a typo when the word
dependencies they spell dependencies
wrong this this typo got missed by
everybody it's somehow passed everything
got to production so I spent all of
yesterday morning fixing the type over
the word dependencies that's something
that if if there's code review in this
system head that the system has worked
on that it was old there is no code
review enabled except for some old
archaic type of in a room code review
like this code got been cotton caught a
long long time before it became an issue
and why is that matter so it turns out
there's some computer science research
done a long long time ago that says that
it does matter if you catch bugs earlier
and it matters monetarily and when you
think about that that sort of makes
sense so like if you have a bug and that
bug is caught when when you have a code
review okay you've you've now spent the
time of the person that wrote the bug
and the person that caught the bug
before it gets it gets pushed out
anywhere and then the time of the person
fixing the bug alright so that's that's
two people sign all right so now let's
say it gets it gets blessed it gets
pushed through and you don't have code
review now it gets pushed off to
to your testers the testers right chest
plan takes a little bit of time they had
some tests around it they find a test
the test breaks good job they file a bug
that's taking time they take money from
the testers they go back to the
developers developers have to verify the
bug they've already there all right off
doing something else they switch context
ends and that's costing more money more
time all right so let's say the testers
miss something I mean we all miss stuff
and gets to production so something goes
wrong in production one of your valuable
customers says oh my gosh something's
wrong so that's the time of your support
team in the support team is working to
the customer you might lose the customer
that's something that's worrisome you
have your support team you have your QA
team and the UAV coders and all of a
sudden this tiny bug that could have
been caught a long long time ago if
someone just took a look at the code
that you're writing gets gets propagated
and you have a whole lot more people
working on this bug and that's that's
why I mean by you know catching bugs
earlier is better so I put the slide
here because one time I did this talk
and someone said you need to have graphs
everyone likes graph so I was like okay
I'll find some graphs so this is the
first two teams that implement a code
review at our division of Comcast's that
this is their their first year from of
sprints going going from the time they
implemented pre-commit code review so
the end if you notice that it's it gets
it just grow your velocity grows and
that seems really counterintuitive that
your get faster if you have people
looking at your code one of the number
one things I would argue with the number
one thing people tell me when they're
resistant to a code review is that it's
going to take a lot of time it's going
to take me on my flow and it's going to
make me slower it's gonna make the team
slore and you're right it will make the
team slow in the beginning you're going
to have code reviews going too slow
people down because it's something
you but anything new is going to slow
you down the beginning what code review
does in the long run in the long term is
it gets your code quality up it makes
your your code better in long run you
spend more time in the beginning to have
less time being up at night because
something went wrong in production right
so how you code of you how how does one
do this thing you write some tests
because we all right our tests first
right some of some of us do some of us
don't we should that'd be that'd be an
ideal world if you wrote your test first
then you write some code and then you
show you test your code to someone else
you take their constructive criticism
because the chrism is always
constructive and never makes you mad and
then you keep on doing that and then
everything's great and you merge your
code and you'll have a beer or cranberry
juice if you don't drink easy right no
no it's not it turns out that it's not
that easy that was like my only how to
slide in this and then someone came up
to me and said you know it's it's harder
than that I'm like that's true that's a
good point like the quarter view is is
much more than than just the like
looking at someone else's code it's you
have to know you have to think about
what to look for how many of you guys
are familiar with the concept of bike
shedding or know what that term means
bike shedding very few this this is a
term that came out of the US military
the US Navy I think and a there there's
a group of high high up muckety-mucks
like really high hire people and they're
building a new military base and the
high is a very like your your CEO levels
where they had this tiny bike shed in
the military base and they're all
obsessing over the color of this bike
shed all should be blue no no it should
be kind of flaws like like meaning after
mean about this bike shed and you're
thinking oh my god we have so many other
bigger things to worry about bigger more
complicated more
important thing is worried about why do
you care about that bike shed it turns
out that there's a reason for that when
faced with a very large complicated
difficult thing our brains are girl
won't think about that oh look at that
thing over there it's simple I can
understand that I can comment on that so
so bike Shane comes about when there's
like stuff that's so complicated that
you can't deal with it so you fixate on
something that you can understand that
you can wrap your brain around even if
it's unimportant you dig into that and
that's something that we really want to
discourage when we were doing code
reviews we don't want to look at the the
cruft around we want to look at at what
really matters and what really matters
in code I would argue what really
matters in code is logic the the logic
of your code is what really makes your
code work you why when you're looking at
someone else's code you you want to look
this code and try to understand what
what is logically happening if this then
that what does this loop really do when
you when your bike Shane you're looking
at stuff that doesn't really matter
speaking of stuff that doesn't really
matter one of the things almost count
ensure that it does matter is naming so
I just talked about you should look at
the logic but but naming isn't logic it
doesn't does it really matter if you
name your variables XY and z as opposed
to something more complex and I would
say yes I want to be able to reduce
complexity when you're reviewing a piece
of code when you're writing code the
main goal of that code is to have
another human being understand that code
and writing variable names ryan function
is Ryan class names that say what they
do is very important I've stopped me
code reviews because I'm like I don't
understand what this code does because
like the names are funky and change the
names i think the logic looks sound i
think but i can't understand it you know
you want to be able to write code that
you in the future will look at in back
oh I get what that does
I know about you but me from six months
ago is the worst developer I've ever met
and you really want to mitigate that and
the code review helps that because
someone else is looking at your code and
catching those things that we've been
slipped through the cracks and you want
to call out the wtf's the why the faces
so that means right and so so what I
mean I we we all have code we look at
our code rewrite that's messy and ugly
and it like maybe you wrote at three in
the morning and you're like oz you get
this out but we have code review you
have someone that's taking a look at and
if they don't understand what the hell
it's going on you should say something
should say something and saying can you
please explain this a little bit better
because again code is for humans to read
so if if you're writing code that
another human can't read or you in six
months from now looked at and can't read
this is true when you're writing Perl
code for example I remember when I wrote
my first Perl program I was so proud of
my one-liner that was like this long and
three days later I came back I'm like I
don't know what I just did yeah you
don't want that right code review helps
with that all right so let's say you're
like me and you're trying to implement
this new style of of code review this
this code review we're literally every
piece of code is going to be looked at
by another human being that can give
actual constructive criticism all right
this is argue like something that
doesn't happen as often as it should in
in software engineering but there are
things that happen you have met this
let's say you pick a tool and I'll talk
about the tools we use later on but you
pick a tool that that does this
automatically to doing it by hand one of
the first things is going to happen is
people going to freak out people totally
freaked out because all of a sudden
you're looking at your code and one of
the things we think about when you write
code
I read you think okay okay i'm writing
this code for this corporation i'm
writing this code for a client and it's
not it's not a big deal it says it's
it's their code it's fine like that's
what we we say to ourselves and that's
what like a reality that's how it
happens but when you write code it's
like writing a novel your party you're
putting a piece of yourself I know it
sounds cheesy but you're putting a piece
of yourself on paper something that that
hopefully you're proud of I I hope
everyone here is proud of what they do
is proud of like the code they write you
should be you should love your job I can
talk more about loving your job I think
it's very important but you know when
you're when you're writing stuff you're
putting a piece of yourself on the page
now all of a sudden you're exposing that
piece of yourself to someone else
someone else that might criticize that
that's exposing your vulnerabilities and
that's really scary to almost every
person in the world you're exposing
yourself and if you don't have a web of
trust if you don't have a team that you
trust if you don't have people that you
trust that's not going to work very well
because exposing your vulnerabilities
and and building that trust is the only
way you can get to higher quality code
as a team so don't panic you're going to
expose yourself to someone else
hopefully not inappropriately but you're
going to suppose your code to someone
else it's okay another thing that I see
a lot and this is true when you are
using a code review tool especially a
code review tool with written reviews is
you really want to think tries to before
commenting because it's really easy to
be passive aggressive in a code review
comment reg why are the world to do this
or only an idiot do it this way like we
are we tend to be assholes when we write
stuff down especially on the Internet
and you know if you're going through a
web browser you might be thinking you're
on 4chan accidentally and you go be a
dick so don't do that think before you
comment because you're again you're your
comments someone else's personal thing
like you're affecting someone else like
what you say matters what you do matters
and you think about that before you
write a comment I code review another
thing so this is another and that this
is something that like people don't
think about when they start doing code
reviews what other things and every
single team ever this is this true every
single team I've implemented a code
review on her I've helped been the one
of the team folks that implemented Cory
beyond they run into this next problem
and it it's it's always there and we
always have to deal with it and that's
the main problem of tabs versus spaces
so I know that that UV and can we all
agree that that other guy he should be
beaten yeah I don't care if you're what
side you're on but like that guy he's a
he's a jerk so now that that's agreed
upon like this is like oh my god since
we did just like you you say okay we're
going to do code review when we
implement code review and the first
thing people start coming on is like we
should use tabs know we should use
spaces I the first scene we ever did
this on we had we had like an hour-long
meeting on this which is Delmas poop
that's bike shedding right there that's
the definition of bike Shane that's the
the computer science equivalent of bike
Shane The Times versus praises problem
how do we solve it um actually I think
that this is a really good problem to
have it's a really good first problem
for a team doing code of you and why is
that because it's it's a problem that is
easily solvable you know you have a
coding standard that's it that's how you
solve this problem but it's nice because
you implement this on a team and you
don't give them any rules like you just
say go we're going to do code reviews
this comes up you get together and this
could be like your first me
mean as a team where you're agreeing
upon something maybe you work on a
crappy team where no one agrees with
each other well this could be the one
time where you can get together and make
a decision as a as a group now some
teams were better than others and you
might not have this issue you might
already have codes coding standards and
if you do that's great but if you don't
like this is a good way to get that team
together so one of the other big things
that that we run into is can convincing
resistors people that horribly horribly
are opposed and fight tooth and nail
against code review my codes good enough
I don't want to do this like I'm a bear
coder no one can tell me that I'm doing
this bear because I'm the expert i wrote
the domain I get it I see this a lot we
we've dealt with this again on almost
not all but almost every team we've
converted over to code review you have
and this is especially prevalent with
with the older time coders that have
been a team for a long time might be the
person that wrote the service that
you're that you're maintaining for
example convince your sisters is tough
and why would say if you're in this
situation is is pick one person if you
so you you're you're the guy you're the
guy gallery want to be that agent of
change pick one person and pick the
person that that hates it the most and
convince them because if you convince
that one person hates the most you get
your get everybody we did this the first
scene we're on there's this guy who
totally hated totally hated the idea to
totally post it but we got him on our
side by by just you know like we really
gentle it was a gentle easin and one of
the keys was we said all right you're
going to be a mentor you're like your
job it we empowered his ego and he liked
that a lot and then once his ego was
empowered and he was the person that was
giving the good advice people sometimes
gave
vice a little bit here there and you
back okay okay I guess that makes sense
oh that made my code better oh that fix
a mistake oh this is amazing and now we
have a guy that hates it becoming one of
your best advocates but it's all about
using I really want to concentrate on
those those folks that are our big time
resistors because there are the people
the people i hate the most are the
people that can flip and love the most
as well it's pretty surprising all right
so let's talk about tools for a second
this is our tool chain all of these well
the first two pieces of this are free
the second costs a lot money you can use
that owe you something else so we used
get how many folks here that use get
something like something like that great
there is a there is a tool that was
developed on top of get by the Google
Android team totally open source and
free for real called Garrett and what
this is is a it's a code review tool
that sits on top of get so you have get
here you have garrett on top of it and
when you commit your code to get Garrett
stops it says nope and and puts it
somewhere else and sends out
notifications to your team or whoever's
listening and says hey there's a piece
of code that that wants to be code
reviewed and then we have we have that
code reviewed and we have our continuous
integration server we're using a total
pro for continuous integration there are
lots of continuous integration service
out there jenkins is one of the most
popular and is free that you can use and
so we tie garrett into not only having
other people review that code but we
have at hill pro or continuous
integration server listening to garrett
so someone checks in a patch set right
into Garrett Garrett sense out
notification to everybody including the
CI services hey there's a patch set and
the CI server says up there's a pad set
I'm going to take my master branch I'm
going to take this patch set and apply
to the master branch run on
I run all my unit tests on my CI test
make sure it passes and so on top of
your code being curve you'd is being
verified that all your tests pass even
before it gets merged into your master
branch even before it goes anywhere you
have this taken care of which is really
nice it was wonderful a lot of times we
would be okay in the code review and
then a ant hill pro would complain and
say oh but it doesn't file so so we had
to fix that and that was before we we
got into the master branch so you're not
breaking the build for anybody else
except you that's the nice part about
having this pre-commit verification step
as opposed to a post commit verification
step where you've you've committed your
codes the master branch then you run
your CI we still do that as well but if
you do that and it breaks the build not
all of a sudden you've broken the bill
for everyone else is pulled down that
code and you don't really want that
that's the break in the build that's bad
what I'm talking about is breaking the
build that's good before I even gets
there so this is how it works like I
explained you have garrett that wraps
get and it has your authoritative
repository i was calling master and your
pending changes which is like nebulous
place out out in the world like you
explain the details of how it works for
really doesn't matter i just know that
goes someplace else developers push into
Garrett reviewers get notified and your
continuous integration server also grabs
from Garrett to do this this hype nice
integration with pre-commit code reviews
it's a pretty fun system to work with
I've I've really enjoyed it this is what
the UI looks like this is an older you I
they have a more updated one but as you
can see this is the the Qt team working
I there's lots of open source projects
that utilize Garrett
I really like it that's not to say there
are other tools out there there are lots
of other tools out there a github is a
github pull request system is really
fantastic if you've ever used github
there are a couple different ways to use
github one is used have a repository you
give everyone your team access that
repository that really i don't i don't
like that system at all because there's
no way to quality control the code that
goes in there but a nicer way of doing
it is having a github repository that
only a robot Oh only a script can
actually commit to and then having
everyone your team fork that code so
each person on the team has their own
Fork that they're working on and when
they're ready to push in the master they
do a pull request in the master the
script says ah someone's done pull
requests in the master i'm going to send
out notifications everybody to review
the code you can use github 'he's code
review system which is actually rather
nice to check it out you have ups or
downs and then once it's okay bye enough
people it gets pushed into the master
branch automatically that's a really
nice way of going about it continuous
integration servers I think are maybe
not essential but really helpful with
this Jenkins like I said is a great open
source tool to do continuous integration
it's relatively inexpensive to to learn
I mean inexpensive in the mental
capacity sense to learn Travis CI is a
great tool that integrates with with
github really where I'll use to put a
file in your code repository and Travis
hooks into it they have servers in the
cloud that that will run automated tests
for you yeah and you also you need you
don't need technology to do code reviews
you really don't I there's one team at
comcast that they had this figured out a
long time ago for people they sit in in
an area and religiously they will not
check code in at all until they call
someone else over to walk through the
code
my line and give Corrections it's a very
disciplined approach but you could you
can start code review tomorrow with no
tooling by agreeing with your team that
we're going to do this all you need is a
social orient and that's what code
review is all about is the social
agreement you can have all the truly in
the world but if you don't have the
social agreement then you just gonna
have people like like pushing sup
through without looking at it anyway
we're talking about a mental change not
not a tooling change so I've been doing
this for a few years and I found that
there are some some nice side effects to
to doing code review so one is you have
smaller code commits so there's two
questions here one yr smaller kokum it's
better and to how is house has happen
with a code review so one smaller code
reviews coconuts are better because
they're easier to understand I can
understand this much code a lot easier
than I can understand this much code it
just fits my brain better and the reason
code review helps with this is that if
you're asking someone to review this
much code it's going to hurt their brain
and they'll just ignore it they lie that
it goes back to the bike Shane thing
right you're you have this big
complicated thing and you're I don't
really deal with that big complicated
thing but I have these other tiny code
reviews I'll just review those and then
going to go lunch then we will go home
and then we'll just looking for that big
one for tomorrow that really annoys the
person that wrote the big long one and
then you get nasty grams and complaints
and and eventually your team realizes oh
you know if we write these smaller co
commits they get through better they're
also easier to to pull out if you have a
coke commit that's very large changes 19
different files does fixes three
different bugs because you just did the
check in at the end of the day
and then something goes wrong you have
to revert that entire thing whereas if
you had the smaller co commit and
something goes wrong in the Dozen co
commits you did that day and you just
have to pull out that one it's the
entire modularity concept there it also
and this is by far the most important in
my opinion it humanizes your coworkers
so what I mean by that when you look at
a piece of code arbitrarily without
contacts you can be Ike who's the idiot
that did this this way they must be the
dumbest person in the entire universe
and you throw something I definitely
have been there people have been there
looking at my code in fact there is a 11
teen Mars working on I left that team
and what my buddies came over and he
described his horrible piece of code
he's like yeah man who would do that I
just sit there in silence and I say I
did that didn't I he's like yes you did
and then I feel horrible the this this
is something where I like again you're
exposing your vulnerability you're
exposing a part of yourself to someone
else and they're exposing a part of
themselves you that makes them more
human that makes it's not someone that's
writing code but someone and that
matters because we have to work we have
to live together these people the people
you work with this is crazy the people
you work with our that you spend a third
of your life at least probably more with
them you should probably know them as
humans you should probably care about
them a bit more I don't know that's what
I think at least it also gives more
trust for your team now how does do that
so if you're catching bugs earlier on
that means you have less problems in
production that means that your code is
going out there and your piece of the of
the system never breaks down why isn't
your the piece of your system ever break
down well it's because we we we are up
front we spent more time up front so
there's more trust there that's a good
thing we
want that and of course less bugs make
it to your customers because there are
more eyes on the code makes a lot of
sense right and again developers learn
from each other the first time I was
introduced to this entire concept I it
was at a code retreat have it have any
of you guys been to a code retreat or no
it is not very mean if you get a chance
to do this it's fantastic do it go to
whatever say you you you're in find out
if they do code retreats they're amazing
the concept behind a code retreat is
that you get in the room with a bunch of
other people at the beginning of the day
and then you you pair up and you work on
a very simple that not too simple
problem and the problem is the game of
life which is Conway's Game of Life you
can look it up on Wikipedia it's a
relatively simple game that you can
implement if you have about day you
could probably implement but you pair up
and you have two people working together
a piece of code for 40 minutes 40
minutes and and then at the end of it
you delete your code you delete your
code you have to lose your code at then
and you get back into a circle and you
learnt discuss about what you learned
and then you do it again and you do that
about six times in a day and when I did
that I learned more I learned more about
the programming language I was working
in at the time those ruby in six hours
they had in the last six months like
knowledge exchange is so powerful and
something that when we're our day-to-day
jobs we kind of forget about if you're
Ike seen and your coding you're not
communicating with people you looking
stuff up on Google you looking at stuff
up on sock overflow you forget the power
of learning from the people around you
and that is transformative in my opinion
all right so what about pair programming
how many people here actively do pair
programming that's great I think you're
fantastic
I love the concept pair programming pair
crow rhyming is code of yarn steroids
when I way got to comcast many years ago
I was a huge fan of pair programming I
came in to this big corporation he said
all right we're going to pair
programming we're going to do TDD
test-driven development it's we're going
to do it it's gonna be awesome I got
people in a room we talked about we need
a little bit of training we did for one
sprint and that was it because it turns
out that if you don't do prayer
programming or if you're not button to
the idea like you've been doing your
nine to five job for ten years the way
you've been doing it that it's really
hard to convince people just like that
to do a new thing so that's where i dial
the back back and say okay so so pair
programming there's two radical change
what's the less radical change code
review code review is is your gateway
drug into pair programming it's a it's
your starter it's what you try out first
ones free man it's it's a pair
programming is this great way if you
don't know what it is it's a concept of
just like I talked about in the code
code retreat where two people are saying
the computer their work on the same
problem together it turns out that when
you have two brains working on the same
problem you become much much much more
efficient like unimaginably so and code
view is a baby step there because again
you have more than one brain looking at
a problem with code review its after the
fact that someone's already written it
but to start I definitely recommend
experimenting with pair programming even
if you don't do it professionally even
if you think it's kind of skeevy to work
with someone else try it out for a day
go to a code retreat you know expand
your mind a little bit it's totally
worth it so in the end the more of my
story is that you should review your
code just have other user your code
makes team stronger your code cleaner
and make sure if a better developer
thank you very much
yes
that's a great question so the question
was do I have any advice on who reviews
your code and how many people review
your code and and so what what I
generally do when we when we start out a
introducing code review on team is we
try to have as little rules as possible
and the reason being is that I want the
team to figure out I want the people on
the team to figure out how they want to
do code review how they want to do
anything new because then they get
buy-in in general why found works is you
have two people two people on the team
is matter if they're the senior people
of junior people or somewhere in the
middle that's good enough for for a code
review to pass as far as who does it I
would say start out with everyone
everyone reviews code don't assign
people unless you you hit a pain point
where where the coach is not being
reviewed and then experiment with with
trying different things like assigning
people I wouldn't assign people the very
beginning though hope that helps yes
so the question was am i advocating
offline versus in person code review and
to be clear I'm advocating reviewing
your code period in an ideal scenario in
person is fantastic I I think that in
person communication is much much better
but if you can't always do that then
having a tool or having a system where
you can at least do offline code review
I think is good so yeah cool yeah
oh yeah so so the question is the
question is what's harder to introduce
TDD or pair programming that is a good
question because because they're both
very hard to introduce in my opinion in
my experience I should say it depends on
like the type of developers you're
working with if you have a development
team that tends to be a little bit more
social than anti-social I think that
pair programming is a bit easier test
certain developments very hard if you're
coming from developers that don't test
to start with so I've worked at
developers that that honestly believe
that coders and testers should be two
different people and if you go from that
to let's write our test first then you
know yeah you need a baby step into TDD
I think and that path goes right tests
and then try right test first and then
only then have your test drive the
design of your code that's a you know
when when we hear about buzzards I teeny
and be needy we think oh you can just
get there but things take longer than
that so yeah hope that helps yes
so the the question if you mighty
paraphrasing is oftentimes we we inherit
other people's code we inherit legacy
code for lack of a better term do do you
think you should do a code review on
just what you modify in that code base
and that legacy code base or should you
do code reviews for the entire thing I
would start if you if you in the
Heritage this big behemoth thing start
with with these personal code reviews of
what you've changed and as you as you
change pieces of your system you're
going to have more more code review
through their like code reviewing a
system that you haven't written is
really difficult in the first place
because especially if the person that
wrote the system is not there anymore
are there on another team that just
becomes challenging and you get into
this the serve big room after the fact
code review in which I don't think is
all that beneficial yeah oh yeah so I'm
that's great yes sonar is a great great
tool for for doing static code analysis
and I I'm big fan of static code
analysis in general to to sort of ferret
out some of the bad things in your code
that's that's a great other step that
you can go you can do you can use but I
still think that there's benefit to
another human being looking at your code
as well static code analysis can only
get you so far there's the you get to a
point where where the you need another
person to understand what you're doing
especially for the bus factor that I was
talking about earlier yes
so that's a good question so I the
question was i oftentimes you have you
have people that have varying opinions
about how a piece of code should work
and they might be too totally valid
varying opinions how do you arbitrate
the the arguments that can have that can
ensue about a code design through code
review and this happens a lot those of
you that do code review and with the
passionate team will see this a lot one
of the things that I've found especially
if you're using a tool for offline code
review is when you get into one of these
arguments where you have a comment war
as i like to call it where someone says
we should do it this way and another
person gives a totally valid argument
that they should do another way and is
there you have this back and forth going
down is to you have to pull the plug the
if you're the net team you have to cut
that off or even if you're not Yesi we
have to pull this plug and get in a room
and talk because at some point you're
talking about design and not logical
fallacies so I think the best approach
to that is to get those people in the
room and have them have them discuss
face-to-face because if you're if you
just communicating through a tool you're
going to have this disconnect yes
um well that's a really good point in
that and to paraphrase what you're
saying that sometimes you're even even
with code review you have some code that
that there's a Saturday or what seems to
be a standard way of doing things in the
code ends then you might have some code
that deviates from that and and do you
want to use code review two to get
people in line or the standard way of
doing things or sometimes is it better
to say no there might be a better way
actually that it's and I'm glad you
mentioned that is dealt with that
recently at my job where we had this
system that was designed a certain way
and it was designed poorly it was a poor
design and we had one developer that
followed the design to the T and we got
into a code review and people people
said why would you why would you do it
this way and the the coders argument was
I've already this is the way it's done I
think code review is a really good time
to to call out and challenge that sort
of systematic but maybe wrong way of
thinking about how your systems work so
what does it say one more time
ah yes that's that's a great point I
wait he just said it wouldn't be better
to refactor the old stuff as part of
that commit I'm debt yes I definitely
want one rule of thumb that I think we
should all have is always leave your
code better off then then it started as
a Boy Scout rule of development so if
there's some code that you look at hey
like that looks like crappy code I
encourage you to fix it you know do what
you think is best yes
a lot of the so the question was what
kind of approaches do we use to weed out
bikes train when it comes up the number
one thing that is become valuable for us
is is gain people to talk to each other
in person because the bikes shedding we
use a tool for better for worse to do
our code reviews and I when when the
people are removed and just text on a
screen the bikes chain issues come up
much much more frequently so just like I
was saying to this gentleman's question
over here yeah get people a room and
talk it out because at that point you're
going to have a much more meaningful
conversation and also be aware of be
aware of that your bike Shane once the
second you realize it call it out that's
something that we forget to do the the
bike Shane scenario in the original case
stopped because people said oh what are
we doing when you point something to
make that out everyone kind of realizes
it so I encourage encourage that well
cool thank you all very much for
attending and enjoy the last hours of
the conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
