virtualization aware JVM and how to make
the most of a virtualized environment
the goals of the doc are so i'll be just
discussing about the impact of
virtualization on the JVM and what are
the benefits of thinking the JVM
virtualization aware and will also look
at a few techniques and some beans that
we have to optimize the JVM for
virtualization so if you look at the
system environment and how it has
changed in the recent past what you have
on your on your right is the way the
things used to be earlier on so it was a
fixed hardware it you you know once you
have the operating system installed
pretty much everything was fixed you all
the resources including the CPU memory
we're all known and fixed and when the
JVM came up it would just query the
operating system would get that
information and pretty much run with it
for the rest of the running of the JVM
but if you look at what we have today
it's a pretty complicated setup and it
really depends on the kind of workload
that you have so you you know normally
you have a hypervisor that's running on
the hardware you have virtual machines
that's being shared that's actually
sharing the resources underneath and
there are containers within the
operating system so you know not every
system environment would look like this
and you know depending on the kind of
workloads that you might have you might
want to continue to run on bare metal or
you might want to run in a virtualized
environment or you you know you might
try and back in as many JVMs as you can
and maybe run containers and so on so if
you look at what's really happening it's
essentially you know we are adding
virtualization layer set every at every
level so we started off the hardware
virtualization mostly because of the
number of course increased number of
course and the fact that most of them
were sitting idle most of the times of
you know we had this whole server
consolidation and hardware
virtualization was a good way to
actually pack in more applications and
it also provided a pretty good isolation
but if you look at OS virtualization or
containers as they are called you know
we have lots of them these days docker
and Wharton and on on IBM power systems
we have w bar so these would essentially
help to put a lot more JVMs but
essentially have lesser isolation than a
you know what virtual hardware
virtualization would provide and again
these have two different use cases so
the hardware virtualization is something
that you probably use when you have
multi tenant kind of situation where you
have multiple customers that you like to
host but if you look at OS
virtualization it's probably where you
have a signal customer and you're
sharing maybe running several instances
of the same application you also have
something like a multi-tenant Java where
it can actually help you to share lots
more including for example the classes
and that helps you to you know pack in a
lot more applications on a given piece
of hardware so what does all of this
mean to the JVM so as I said you know in
the earlier case it was all fixed
resources the JVM resources itself did
not change from start to finish you
would specify a lot of these parameters
at the JVM in it time and essentially
that's when the JVM configured itself it
would probably ask the operating system
you know what other kind of resources
that it had and then it would
essentially assume that the avail you
know these would be continue to be
available for its entire run but if you
look at what happens now resources are
elastic if you see you know there are
techniques like ballooning that are used
by hypervisors to reassign resources and
so
things are being taken away from you and
being given to you know some other
virtual machines where probably it's
needed a lot more the resource views are
unreliable so what do I mean by that you
know when the JVM comes up it asks the
operating system how many CPUs to a have
the question here is does the operating
system itself know how many CPUs does it
have or is it lying most of in most
cases as you will see it is actually
lying the resources are shared if you
look at container you know if you are
running several containers on the same
operating system you're essentially
sharing all these resources across all
these containers and you know no one
container can assume that it has all of
the resources for itself so the quantum
can actually change pretty dynamically
so the first question that the JVM would
need to ask itself is you know whether
is it something that's real or virtual
so if you look at the physical view and
the logical view it just gives you a
sense of what I was talking about
earlier so in on your left you have a
hardware box that has two cores and
there are three virtual machines running
on top of that so if you see the first
one has the operating system thinks it
has two V CPUs but actually you can set
up the CPU entitlement to say that it
has just one core a lot of the
hypervisors can do that in fact if you
look at the power for example it can
even say something like a point to
physical CPU you can actually assign
point2 or point one physical CPU to a
particular el power but the operating
system still thinks that it has to be
CPUs on the other side you have
something that's a little bit more
traditional in the sense that you have a
static partitioning of two you know
virtual machines that are essentially
sharing four cores across and and
they're pretty much pinned so so that I
think that that's a simpler architecture
is what you see here is what you find in
the cloud a lot these days
so so what do we do in this context so
as soon as the jvm comes up it really
needs to know is it running on real
hardware or is it running in a virtual
machine or essentially what is the
system environment underneath that so
what does this mean that every java
application out there needs to start
worrying about what kind of system that
they're running on and is this
applicable to all java programmers so
absolutely not the whole point of this
exercise is to try and push all of this
down the complexity into the JVM and so
the JVM will try and hide the complexity
it'll and it will try and adapt to the
system environment that is there
underneath that and you know make sure
that the Java programmers really don't
have to worry about that however there
are a small class of applications that
do benefit from you know getting to know
about this particular information so for
example orchestrators and load balancers
so they do really need to know how much
real physical CPU and how much real
physical RAM do you have or you know
assigned to that particular virtual
machine so that they can you know
accordingly utilize the resources
similarly monitoring tools and even
debuggers and Rascals you really want
your debuggers to know what kind of you
know environment you're running in so
that if you want to try and recreate the
problems you know that can help so the
other question is does the jvm itself
need to know if it's running inside of a
guest operating system you know there's
absolutely no doubt there you know there
are a number of things that the JVM can
do to tune itself for example in a lot
of the time I mean in fact if you look
at any of the JV aims the first thing
that they do is to spawn the GC threads
so and usually what you know what the M
in the algorithm that's used is that you
just query the operating system find out
the number of you know CPUs that are
there and then spawn an equal number of
GC threats and similarly with jit as
well so you really want to do this based
on real physical processors and not what
the operating system is seen
and similarly you can also provide this
information into the Java core is a said
earlier it will probably help you to do
debugging yes
yeah absolutely that that's another use
case the in fact I was going to talk
about that as one as well so so what are
the benefits I think it's it should be
pretty clear that it really makes a lot
of sense to get to know the real
physical resources to make the most of
the virtualized environment you don't
want to be sitting on top of resources
that you don't need and at the same time
you want to make sure that the the
resources are given to the right entity
which you know which needs it at that
point in time the other thing is that
you know as you were just mentioning you
want to propagate that knowledge up the
stack to things like websphere for
example and you know make sure that your
spawning the right number of threads in
your thread pool and things like that so
now what is really happening is that a
lot of these middleware products are
figuring out that you know they do need
this kind of information at this point
in time and so every middleware is
trying to go and write their own native
code that tries and figures out you know
what kind of environment they are
running in and and that's not a lot of
native code and ideally you know that
should really be down into the JVM and
you know pushing it down into the JVM
would make sure that you can provide an
unified interface I mean there are a
number of hypervisors out there and each
and every one of them has their own way
of providing this information so you
really don't want to have you know
duplicate all of this stuff into the
higher layers and you know the JVM would
probably be the best place to make use
of this information so so what do we
have you know given all of this
background so what we have right now is
a set of beans that we've introduced in
the IBM JVM so the three of them that
you see here the operating system MX
bean hypervisor mxp and the guest OS MX
bean I'll just be talking about that in
a little bit essentially help you to
figure out what kind of environment
you're on and take action accordingly
so if you look at the operating system
XP I'm sure you're already aware of this
is something that's been there for a
while what we have done is to extend
that and provide individual processor
and statistics as well as a lot more
detailed statistics in terms of memory
the hypervisor MX bean is the one that
will detect if you're running on a
hypervisor and then give you a I mean
right now it just provides a vendor name
string in terms of the actual hypervisor
that you're running on the guest OS MX
bean gives you the physical view what we
saw earlier on so if you so this is the
one that actually queries the hypervisor
to figure out how much real processor
that you have and how much real memory
that you have and you know provide that
information the current set of supported
combinations are listed down there so ax
and linux on powervm linux and windows
on vmware z/os and z linux on comm so
these are the only three ones that are
supported right now so essentially this
is just a pictorial view of the same
thing the operating system MX beam would
query the operating system it would be
the same as before except that it gives
you a lot more detailed statistics and
ideally you want to use this when you're
running on bare metal and you know the
way to figure that out would be to query
the hypervisor MX bean which will tell
you if you're running on a virtual I
system or not and then you know if you
are running on a virtualized system you
use the guest OS MX bean which talks to
the hypervisor and gives you the real
physical usage physical usage
information so if you look at it a
little bit more deeper so these are the
extensions of the APS that we have so we
have added three api's the retrieve
memory usage retrieve processor usage
and retrieve total processor usage so
the retreat memory usage actually
returns a memory usage ops object I'll
just tell you about what that object has
the retreat processor usage
actually gives you an array of processor
usage objects one per CPU as seen by the
operating system of course and retrieve
total processor usage gives you the
average across all the CPUs in the
system so if you look at the processor
usage object essentially it has it gives
you the busy time the idle time and a in
the case of individual processor and
whether it's online or not the busy time
is in actually further divided into
system user and weight and you get a
timestamp to go along with it so if you
repeatedly query this information you
should be able to get a you get you need
to be able to get a quantum of change
that has happened since the last
interval if you look at the memory usage
object you see it has buffered cashed
the total free swap free swap total and
in the total memory itself along with a
time stamp so some of these might not
make sense in all operating systems for
example on Windows you want I mean the
buffered and cash might not really make
sense so you just get a minus one in
that case so the next one is the
hypervisor MX bean also this it just has
two methods is environment virtual
that's one that tells you whether you're
running in a virtualized environment or
not the other one is the one it gives
you the information of the virtualized
environment itself the last one is the
the guest OS MX beam which Giga you know
we have two methods there retrieve a
memory usage and retrieve processor
usage they both return types guest OS
memories eh and guest OS processor usage
so if you look at what guest OS
processor usage has it gives you the CPU
entitlement as seen by the hypervisor
the CPU time the total cpu time of
across all the CPUs of the particular
virtual machine as seen by the
hypervisor the get host CPU clock speed
so you'd need to get a sense of if
you're running on different hosts they
might be having different kinds of
processors so the guests get host CPU
clock speed gives you an idea of what
what is the kind of processor that
you're running on and the of course our
time stamp that goes along with that if
you look at the guest OS memory usage
this has get max mem limit so this is a
limit that has been imposed by the
hypervisor on the particular virtual
machine and the mem used is the current
the total actually is the current mem
used by the virtual machine as seen by
the hypervisor and along with the time
stamp again so you know this is just the
same point that we were talking about
earlier the I mean you can use this
information to tune the GC engine
parameters and also you know determine
things like the thread pool and so on
and and the operating system amex being
this is something that as I said you'd
probably use the hypervisor mxp into
query whether you're running on a hyper
you know virtual I system or not if
you're not then you'd use the operating
system MX bean to get more detailed
information at the operating system
layer and then maybe you know use it to
you know ramp up or ramp down your jvms
so there are a few implementation nodes
on this these are actually available
from jvm 7 dot 1 onwards and all of this
information is actually available in the
user guide as well so some of these
require some level of software to be
installed as part of the guest operating
system for example in the VMware case
you need the vm guest lib on zee linux
you need hyperfest to be mounted and
there are some older inter processors
where
this is known to fail I mean the
hypervisor detection does not seem to
work so we have a workaround by setting
an environment variable in that case and
the other thing to note here is that if
there are several layers of hypervisors
which is pretty common in the mainframe
case where you have you know several
layers of ZB z OS sitting on top of a
CVM and so on we only return the
top-level hypervisor information at this
point in time and we do have this
information in the Java core java code
is the the code that you get when you I
mean you can induce a core if you want
by you know sending a signal and I mean
essentially that contains the debug
information of all the yeah it's it's
it's a text file it's a text file that
has the state information at that point
in time essentially sorry I'm not sure
about that one ok ok so the we have
another issue that we face in the cloud
which is that you don't want to be
holding on to memory when you're
essentially Idol so you know this this
was a problem earlier on when you I mean
we normally started up with the JVM with
a dash x MX parameter and that would
essentially determine how much heap was
being used by the application and that
would essentially not change throughout
and what the root end up doing is that
you know even when the application is
sitting idle you still have that heap
and essentially that cannot be you know
given out to anybody else or you know
for some other process or whatever it
might be so what we have now is a
parameter called dash X soft MX that can
be dynamically set through jmaxxx
and essentially what what the soft MX
does is to you know once you set it
either using the jmx or otherwise to
actually you know make the garbage
collector to shrink the size of the heap
down to that particular value or over a
period of time so and and and once you
are at that particular target you know
it would not really expand beyond that
of course you could again use the soft
mx2 you know inflate your heap when you
need that heat but this allows you to
essentially shrink the heap when you
don't I mean when you're sitting idle
and you're you know you have lots of
unused memory the other use cases of
course that you can actually cap cap it
pretty early using softer max and only
grow as and when you need so the other
problem that we see in the cloud pretty
often is idle detection so the question
is why do we need that at all a lot of
the times the customers are actually
paying for CP usage costs based on I
mean CPU cost based on usage and if the
application is sitting idle but
continues to use cpu you're essentially
having to pay for that so and not only
that you know in it also causes
inefficient CP usage because you know
the CPU that the application is using
when it's sitting idle could essentially
be given out to other VMS or JVMs so
when i say bad job idle behavior what
I'm really mean is that you know you
could have an application that's doing a
lot of polling for example even when it
is idle or it could be you know make
maybe looking at a work queue or
something like that from time to time
and that really causes a lot of CPU burn
the issue that we have here is that we
have no tool today that will tell you
exactly what is the idol behavior of an
application and you do want to be able
to profile that information and get a
sense of what the application what a
particular applications idol behavior is
to be able to determine how good it
would be in the club so again what we
have here is a MX bean this is not I
mean is it's not been released as yet as
you can see it's a draft but we do have
a set of api's methods that we provide
within this beam that allows you to
categorize the CP information so what we
have here is get thread CP usage which
gives you a categorization of the CP
usage of all of the thread so for
example it categorizes the threads into
application threads monitor threads and
system JVM threads so within the system
JVM we it is further classified into GC
jit and other systems avian threads so
when I when I was talking about monitor
threads it's essentially it's just any
other application thread that the map
lakay Shin has set as a monitor so
ideally the monitor thread is the one
that is constantly polling for this
particular information and I you know
you don't want the cpu usage of that
thread itself to affect the idle
calculations so we set it aside as a
different category and and so
essentially you're left with two
different categories you have the
application threads and you have all of
the system JVM threads so you know if
you keep pulling for this information
from you know people you know on a
periodic basis you get an idea of what
your application threads are doing and
what your system jvm threads are doing
and then you can also figure out if the
system JVM threads are really active
even when your application continues I
mean
is idle for example it does happen a lot
where for example we continue to do jit
profiling even when the application is
idle and maybe you don't want that kind
of a behavior and the cloud so so that
these are the kind of profiling that you
could do with this kind of information
the other two are the get thread
category and the set thread category
essentially right now all we do is to
set the thread category to monitor and
back again to application so so if you
look at these cpu monitor info i think i
already talked about that so it has at
it splits the categories into
application GC chit monitor cpu and
system cpu time along with the time
stamp so so going forward actually there
is I mean you know continuing along the
same paths we also have something called
as a xt and virtualized so this is
needed because I mean as I was talking
about jit actually as n sub consuming
CPU even when the application is idle
and so if you use this particular tuning
parameter so dash X tune a virtualized
which is available from Java 7 sr4
onwards this actually choirs the JIT
this of course needs a large share class
cash at this point in time and it would
also need for the AOSP space in the
share class cash not to be capped so
essentially what's happening here is
that when the JIT is active it tries to
populate the share class cash as much as
possible to
you know to be able to make use of the
class cache data later when you want G
to be quest so that's essentially the
set of two Nobles that we have and if
you look at what we just saw today
virtualization layers really hide the
real resource information and you do
want the you don't want to DJ vm to be
able to figure out the real resource
information and the JVM will need to
actually periodically look for changes
in the system architecture or the
underlying architecture even after in it
and ensure that it adapts to any changes
that are happening and we have a few
sort of beans that help you to optimize
for the current you know environment
that you're in and you only the other
thing that you really need to make sure
is that you need to use only as much
memory that you would need and you could
use the soft MX to essentially change
the heap dynamically according to the
current sort of usage and lastly idle
detection arm really helps to cut costs
and you could use the JVM cpu monitor
info which should be available shortly
enough to monitor idle behavior and tune
the JVM so that's pretty much all i had
today there are any questions
save her
actually that depends a lot on the kind
of workloads that are running so there
are a few benchmarks around the x tune
which lies for example and we see
something like five to seven percent
decrease in CPU usage but when it comes
to soft MX I think that it's completely
workload dependent so you would really
you know need to be able to in a monitor
your application figure out what what is
the you know the profile of your
application and the memory usage and
then I you know accordingly apply soft
MX to be able to tune that so one thing
that you need to keep in mind this that
if you you know reduce the heat
drastically using softer max it might
actually affect it when you need it back
again so that's something that you would
need to tune based on your application
any other questions yeah
sorry
yeah this is a I mean right now it's an
IBM only feature and i think i just
mentioned the there are different
versions but mostly they are available
from java 7 onwards now it's supported
across
I didn't get that question sorry can you
repeat them
right yeah if you so I think the
question is if I use the IBM JVM would i
get the on Windows and Intel would i get
these features right yeah so if you so
if you're just running java 7 on Windows
and Intel it you can for example and if
you are running on vmware it you know it
will tell you just by using I mean you
don't have to turn on any specific
tuning or anything like that just
running the JVM would give you this
information so you just need to query
that particular MX bean and it will tell
you whether you're running in a
virtualized environment or not ok any
other questions
sure
yeah we are working with the health
center I mean this this should
eventually show up in health center
right now it does not but that's the
goal okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
