developer community here at Oracle
OpenWorld 2017 I'm here with good friend
Gerald Wenzel Gerald how're you doing
Thank You Laura good it is a big week
for you oh yes a lot of exciting
announcements that happen at open world
this year
tell me start the top let's start with
Sunday night shall we yes I think we
should okay well if people out there
haven't heard yet we announced the first
world's first autonomous database
autonomous database yep that is so cool
that is really really awesome so we're
really a gigantic leap forward to
everybody else when it comes to data
management so we're really proud of the
team and everybody why is it a leap
forward when it comes to data management
because think about it as you you think
towards the clouds Wireless clouds are
successful because things have been
offered as a service right people wanted
to actually provide value to the
business and not necessarily getting
hooked up on you know spending weeks or
months to set something up right so
cloud took this first step where was
like you know you don't worry about
infrastructure right the service is
there you click a button you get it you
don't worry about scale you know it you
just click a button we scale it for you
we secure it etc but the next step of
this was like well you still have a
database there or databases there or
other things you know sometimes just bit
buckets really where you store all this
data and you know as we have just
recently seen with with the unfortunate
security breaches over the last couple
of weeks it's like it's not just enough
to get a database or something up and
running and you know it's like you don't
worry about scale it's about making sure
it's always on the latest patches making
sure this is secure making sure that it
always runs fast etc and with the
autonomous database we essentially now
incorporate this all automatically
autonomously in the database we have a
lot many many smart features since a
long long time and I always argue it
goes back to the cost-based optimizer
today you don't worry about anymore what
do you have to get to an index or
whatever right exactly optimizer figures
it out and you know for 99.9999% of the
time it gets it right and
a really good job there that's exactly
where we strive next it's like why do we
have to occupy all our users out there
with you know hideous tasks to some
extent of patching and you know
migrating etc let's take this all away
and enable our users to actually provide
value to the business provide value to
the IT out there right so you can now
focus on what day to do a store how do
you store it whom do I give access to
right how do you manage this you know
data is stored for 30-plus years
sometimes I read ADA basis that go back
since the 70s data is stored in there
right so there's a long long journey and
you cannot just always focus on oh yeah
now I'm ready nice to make sure we patch
it every three months and we are too
busy patching the system to actually do
something else you know that the
business actually would ask us to do
exactly well good
so that's Sunday and that is Sunday and
it's it makes sense
autonomous database makes sense because
we're so far ahead with what we're doing
with our technology so good so next
let's talk about Emily Emily so that
will take us fast forward to yesterday
right say uh Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday
right uh where we launch the public beta
of the new Oracle database multilingual
engine multi-link ml e so our database
can now speak many many languages okay
well that means is well first and
foremost it's a beta right it's on OTN
to be downloaded so if you just Google
for database multilingual engine you
will come to this beta website on OTN
you can download virtualbox image the
document is 12 gigs it is pretty big
because if it just gives you everything
that's there right - it's like you just
download them and play we don't want
people to get stuck on testing new
functionality with you know getting it
installed or set up and right 12 gigs
these days you know when you stream a
movie of a Netflix &amp;amp; Co anyway so what
does it mean multilingual right
well the new way of thinking that we
have is so we talked about autonomous
database isn't making it easier to
manage data but another side angle to
this or another angle to this is well
how do we make it easier to use your
data and process your data and there's
many different areas where are we
advancing what it's on the analytic side
of things in sequel but another angle to
this is we said well you should be able
to run any piece of code as closest to
your data as possible so this goes back
to the thinking is nothing new the
thinking got revived and you know when
we talked about Hadoop clusters is like
don't bring the data to the processing
bring the processing to the data hey you
know kind of forget this before we store
procedures people these days don't like
store procedures but it was exactly the
same thing you know don't bring the data
from the database to your processing but
actually bring the processing to the
data wherever it makes sense and yet
today we see a proliferation of many
many programming languages good or bad
but the fact is you know if you're a
developer of programming language aid
and you're a really good developer of
programming language hey and if you have
develop a programming language speed and
you're really good in that and usually
you do get people that write multiple
programming languages just fine and
that's great but there's also many many
people out there that you know stick to
their programming language of choice
they like it they used it for years and
years so we said okay we should be able
to actually allow people to write a
piece of code in their programming
language of choice and if you want so if
you think that it makes sense for the
execution to run in close to the data
inside the database then you can put it
in there and the first iteration of what
you will see with the multilingual
engine that we launched yesterday is
essentially you can think of it as
JavaScript store procedures so I can now
write JavaScript code to interact with
my data and run this inside the Oracle
databases a stored procedure and you
know it's either because you want to
make sure that you don't pull the data
all out to your client side or to your
server to application server side nodejs
and so and put it back in or it could
also just be that what we have seen as a
lot of times code is repetitive in a
Java Script landscape it's the the
obvious one will be for example a credit
card check that
numbers valid right or a date of birth
that it's not in the future as a fourth
so you have to check on the browser side
in JavaScript you know you have to have
the sixteen digits of a credit card
number right you have to have an
expiration date that's in the future and
so forth and then you would repeat this
piece of code somewhere in the mid tier
when the data comes in while I checked
at this very credit card is valid and
then you will potentially repeat this
check yet again on the data layer on the
database where you say well I only store
valid credit card numbers because as
soon as I store garbage you get garbage
out
so now let's imagine you have this piece
all written in JavaScript on the browser
and now you run this already today on no
GS and have the same piece of JavaScript
written on no GS on the back end well
what you can actually now do is you can
stick the same piece of code into your
database and really the benefit here is
that you essentially just maintain one
piece of code across any layer of your
processing of your system from the
presentation to the current logic to the
database layer so we give people the
choice you know it doesn't mean rewrite
everything hit the JavaScript and stick
it into the database of course not
but you know it should never ever be a
hindrance any more than when somebody
comes to us and say hey I want to write
programming language a ok JavaScript
that we say oh yeah you have to learn PL
sequel for example right right no I mean
if you do and if you can write PL sequel
that's great you know and if you just
want to stick to JavaScript is great as
well seems to me there might be a really
cool driver that they're gonna
incorporate there so that you can use
this in order to migrate legacy apps
instead of having to rewrite them yeah
the it's not so much of migrating the
apps altogether but it becomes really
interesting when you think now so when
we stick with JavaScript and just one
more time the engine is called
multilingual so the engine is capable of
running essentially any programming
language okay but we are starting with
JavaScript as a prototype Estes Peters
going ahead but when you think about it
so you know you have an OGS application
it uses an Oracle noches driver for the
Oracle database I'm not as drive or the
database or both of them become
intelligent enough to say hey you know
what this piece of code that you just
executed would run so much faster if you
would run it in the database or hey you
know what this piece of code that he
just executed a database would scale so
much better if you run it on the on the
mid-tier no so
there's a lot of year there's a lot of
possibilities is not emulation at all
actually we use a really cool technology
underneath called the growl just-in-time
compiler the growl vm so that's really
cool that allows you essentially to
construct languages into bytecode or
LLVM bits code and leverage it on that
and then we also limitations just in
time like we just done for a long long
time in the Java or JVM withdrawal for a
while oh yeah yeah yeah certainly and
the many teams are looking into this and
a lot of people are excited about it
good
oh that's really cool okay so we have
autonomous database yep
we have ml we yes is very very cool what
else anything
well how confuse tell you about a new
version numbers well I don't know gerald
let's see we're going from 12 C to 18
that's correct there well you know I
just think that we should just like bag
the whole thing and go by stardates
yeah that would be cool actually for the
future that's like at least us not only
are we taking a gigantic leap into the
future by skipping essentially for four
numbers for major release numbers but
actually yeah let's just go start a two
to three hundred years actually we have
no problem we could like yeah talking
about you know everybody knows started
well no so what are we done there just
for the listeners to explain briefly
it's like for a long long time and
actually not that long at always since
Oracle existed but I think it started
with seven or maybe started with eight
I'm not quite sure we introduced this
major release number this minor release
number then actually just zero and there
was always the application or a few
applications so you're right or the late
on Fusion Middleware about release
number and then a patch set on top so 12
- oh one major release 12 really minor
release to zero because we are not
middleware your database right and then
warm for the first patch set for the
first iteration and we actually you know
we go into the into the well that the
2020s kind of let's say in the future
direction we see that you know decisions
that made a lot of sense in the past you
know we I think we did it with 8:1 I
believe maybe it was nine all right it
made a lot of sense back then maybe it
doesn't make so much sense now anymore
so the fundamental change should we're
proposing is a change of the release
model all together so the release mole
of the Oracle database always used to be
five years long yeah that's one release
minor release one and then you would
have two to three years I believe and
then we would have a dot to version and
then we would have another five years
yep Wow
that is exactly right so obviously in
two days the world or let's back up and
yes sir this world in the late 90s in
the early 2000s five years was okay yeah
stable release you didn't want to feel
like you were ever on release one you
always wanted yeah but also things
didn't move so fast
all right everybody wants to be in a
stable release but we actually got into
this as the world got far more for moved
faster along we ended up with like well
a lot of new features in the dot one
release and then a tour to release was
always meant to be the stability release
not so many new features
well you quickly end up in a time frame
where you say okay you have five years
you whatever feature you put into the
release today you better be sure that in
five years time it's still relevant and
for a lot of features we always hit the
nail and we were actually always very
much ahead of the time as we just proved
me yet again with autonomous but what we
said well actually we should actually
move from a five here Elise cycle to one
year to a yearly release cycles it is
really what's happening and ever we said
well now let's go ahead and actually
change the release numbers to change the
thinking of our customers and the people
out there and from now going forward we
only rely on oracle 18 and oracle 19 and
oracle 20 there may or may still see on
it the year based on the you don't
release it and in all of those years you
will get new features now in the
beginning a lot of people were like oh
my god now i get new features every year
not every five years this is a major
effort for me to keep your up to you
know up-to-date or to
upgrade and it's actually no when you
think about it what we have done is
rather than cramping many many many many
features into five years
I mean sometimes we've releases with
over 500 features so like a hundred
features per year yeah some of them
bigger some of them smaller yeah we
would usually always see 300 features or
so rather than cramping that all in and
one big shebang release we can all say
hey you know what you only get like 50
new features in year one that may be new
you get ten new features in year two
because the others are not done yet then
maybe you will get 100 or 70 features in
2020 so it actually gets more stable
because we made the releases at the
amount of for the what a single release
contains when you don't have any
features you can just like change the UI
from gray to red and then just like push
it out there that could be an option to
just kind of lipstick it but frankly I
tell you so far there hasn't been a
single year where we got bored so and
for the next five to ten years what we
have on our plans
that's so cool well thanks for coming by
Joe yeah yeah certainly the same here
thanks for having me Laura all right
we'll be talking soon we'll be seeing
you on the road at Oracle code yes
absolutely did we have to do we have to
city's announced well we don't have
coming they will be coming soon
well yeah it was great here yeah
yesterday as well Oracle code that was
also thank you very much for having me
all right thanks y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
