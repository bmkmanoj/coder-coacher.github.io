and David Haven we're all in the Java
deployment group and we're going to be
talking about how to deploy your
application securely well skip that so
what we're going to do today is there's
really two main components of this talk
one is talking about a new feature in
seven to forty the deployment rule set
and also best practices before we do
that I'm going to give a bit of an
overview and talk about what happened in
the last year so we've been in the news
quite a bit some of it unpleasant boat
security if you haven't heard of like a
zero-day exploit or tack what that means
is that it's an attack that happens on
software that's currently deployed and
it finds a vulnerability that's being
exploited that's happened to us a couple
times in the last year and a half maybe
the most famous one is where Homeland
Security suggested everybody turn off
java in the browser so um what that did
though is the good news from that is
that it really focused our group
especially but also the entire Java org
on on security for the last year and you
can even see in this conference there's
a security track now it shows you the
focus that it's taken one of the things
that's happened because of that is or
one aspect of syrah curettage we need to
make sure the user knows when
something's running in is browser so
there's a lot more dialogues which can
be an annoying the other problem is that
older apps may not even run they may be
blocked based on if they're not keeping
up to date with what best practices in
what we require now but there is hope
for the enterprise there's the
deployment rule set which we're going to
talk about in detail
and what that is is for the enterprise
and it's going to make life within the
enterprise a lot simpler and then the
other main topic is best practices which
is what if you're a developer that
delivers through the browser or through
java web start these are things that you
can do to make your users experience a
lot better and also to keep your app
secure so what happened in the last year
basically our group has just been doing
nothing but security it's both there's
there's sort of two components to that
there's one where you fix actual
vulnerabilities and the other is where
what the process is for presenting to
the user and getting the user to trust
applications that are downloaded through
the web one definition that I want to
just make before I start is what a
security baseline is and basically
that's what our lat lowest version that
we consider secure and that can change
at any time and I'll explain a little
bit and about what happened in seven you
six with that but the other thing to
note is that JRE six so I need anyone
got six or 6 update is now considered
below the security baseline and there's
not going to be any more public updates
for six so the messages there that you
you need to be developing for JRE 7 and
so now i'm going to go just through the
main points that happen in the last year
in seven you six we added dynamic
security baseline so before that the
security baseline when we released a
version of the JRE it just had it baked
in what the most what that baseline was
so what was the the known secure version
of java but with the advent of things
like
zero-day attacks we needed to be more
responsive to that and so we added
dynamic bass lines so that if
vulnerabilities are detected in a
version then the Java that's running on
the client can detect that and let the
user know whether the version that's
requested is insecure or maybe the
current version that's running is
insecure in seven you ten was kind of a
major change because we really did a lot
with security one of the main things
that we added was security level and you
can originally there was there was five
levels that we had I think there was
very high high medium low and a custom
one that's now become medium high and
very high-end but you can kind of
consider it as medium is really a
backward compatibility mode hi is the
default mode and very high is what it
says but it's also where new features
and restrictions are coming in and you
can kind of see what's happening is that
it's kind of a moving window like if you
consider the medium it's if this is most
secure and this is least secure that
window is gradually moving in becoming
more secure so it's not like we give you
backward compatibility for anything it's
it's a limited window of backward
compatibility and so this is a way for
us to introduce new new features and
restrictions and give some some relief
to catch up with that and so if you look
if you look at what's in very high just
assume that at some point that's going
to become the default and so you need to
get on board figuring out what those
things are and update your your apps to
support that another thing that we did
was as part of these response to
zero-day attacks is to allow the user to
disable java in the browser doesn't
disable Java on the machine so that
means that applications that are just
running from the machine or fine it's
only things that are down
and run basically through the plug-in in
the browser and so that just gives them
a quick way of disabling it say if their
version becomes insecure or there's some
kind of attack then they can wait until
there is a secure version to download we
also have we expire the eight the JRE
that we release so there's a date baked
into it that says this is going to be
expired and then what that means is that
there's going to be more dialogue saying
oh you're trying to run and expired JRE
so the the best thing is to try to
target to what the latest or current
version is and we talk about that more
in the talk another thing that was
happened is that we removed auto
downloading except for this case where
you're the most secure version and on
Windows and you're using DT or the
deployment toolkit which is a JavaScript
library and you can use that for a
variety of things one of the things is
to be able to auto update if that's
required but the other platforms we
don't support that and we've taken it
right out of jail J&amp;amp;L p entirely and the
other thing that happened is that at the
default security level local applets
won't runs seven you 21 one of the the
big changes there is to do with adding
the ability to say that an application
the see a trusted application can be
sandboxed before that when you if you
signed your application it just became
all permissions effectively which just
gave it in absolute access to the to the
computer whereas if you left it unsigned
it with sandboxed and so kind of the
recommendation was at that point well if
you don't need all permissions don't
sign it so that your you're running in a
sandbox but we're changing that so that
you can actually sign it to create trust
with the user but also keep it if you
don't need all permissions then you can
have just the sandbox running
the other thing we did some things to do
a certificate so one of them was
associating the location with the
certificate so if you've signed a jar
and you get it from one site and you
approve it as a user it gets associated
with that one site know if it comes from
another site the user is going to have
to approve that again whereas before it
it wouldn't matter where it came from
and that was one part of that as part of
stopping repurposing plus we also added
dynamic blacklisting of certificates so
that the the GRE running can can test to
see if the certificate has been
blacklisted and then in that case it can
block it another response to things like
zero-day attacks we also added some
changes to live connect part of the the
policy is that we want to tell the user
whenever something runs and one of the
problems is that if you're making
JavaScript calls and that's what live
connect is is talking from JavaScript
Java and vice versa if you make calls
from JavaScript it's it's insecure it's
not or it's not trusted you don't know
what that where it came from exactly so
if it's calling in to all permissions
code we're going to bring up a dialog
saying that you're now doing something
we call mixed code where it's untrusted
is calling into trusted so that's
something to be aware of and there's
things you can do about that and we'll
we'll talk more about that as well 7u 25
we added a certificate checking by
default or revocation checking by
default sorry and what that means is
that the user can still disabled that if
they want but but now we're going to
check those make sure that nothing's
being revoked and you can set it as well
you can set it to just the certificate
that that's associated with that jar or
the whole chain of certificates
obviously that takes a bit longer and
you'll notice in 7u40 we made
improvements to for that checking
the other thing at seven year 25 with
adding manifest entries for permissions
and code base and so we can you can say
what permissions whether you want all
permissions are sandbox plus you can say
where things are from in the code base
and the code base is optional that's
important to know except was worrying
people and the the major the other major
thing was in 7u40 was as the deployment
real set and that's going to really help
enterprise and we're actually Andy's
going to talk about that right now and
give you a lot of detail on that thank
you Mark ok my name is Andy Herrick I'm
going to tell you a little bit about the
first feature that we have to alleviate
the pain that was brought about by
putting up all these dialogues and the
additional security restrictions that we
put into all these previous versions and
so the first feature that we have is
deployment will set a deployment rule
set is for an enterprise the lousy
enterprise to configure particular
client machines so it only applies in
the cases where the enterprise has
control over the client machines I know
there's a lot of mixed cases where you
have an enterprise application that may
be employees of running at home or
something what it might not apply to but
in the case where the enterprise has
full control over the client machine he
can use the deployment rule set to
prevent all dialogues for the apps that
he wants to specify all might be going a
little far we'll talk about that in a
minute and he can use it to avoid the
current restrictions that would cause an
application to park such as the
application itself has a self-signed
certificate
and it could also cover cases in the
future where we will prevent an
application for money such as new
permissions attribute becomes mandatory
or something whatever rule that we may
come up with in the future so what is
this deployment will set it basically
one jar file properly signed in
containing one xml file that defines
what applications are allowed to run
what applications aren't allowed to run
and which applications are supposed to
just follow the rules that we have for
cases where there's no deployment will
set install so the xml file is included
in the jar and the jar is put on the
client machine at a particular location
by the administrator now every time that
deployment code runs that's a plug-in
applet or a web start application we're
going to go look and see if there's a
deployment will set that jar and we're
going to verify that jar must be signed
by a proper CA we're not going to show
any dialogue there but if there is a jar
who we can verify it signed it's not
revoked it's not invalid it's not
blacklisted none of this stuff then
we'll proceed with the rules that come
from that you are if it is invalid
self-signed revoked any of those bad
things and will block everything for
money so it's the enterprise's
responsibility to only put in a proper
deployment ruleset jar now that the jar
contains one xml file and the xml file
is really quite simple it contains an
ordered set of rules and each rule
contains an ID and an action and that
allows you to identify through the ID
what applications you want to take
special action on and what the action is
so before I go through the items inside
of the xml file i'll show you an example
when we can refer back to that as i talk
about it this example is a fairly simple
app
we'll set that xml file it contains four
rules this paycheck only has the first
to the the first rule is a certificate
based rule and basically says anything
signed by this certificate is good to
run with no dialogues the second rule
basically says that anything else that
comes from my company and is using HTTPS
it's okay to run as long as it's on a
secure version of Java now we have two
more rules here and the third one says
anything else that comes to my company
such as if it comes from HTTP off of my
company com just an example then we'll
use the default rules and that means
that will show whatever dialogues that
we would show and allow whatever we
would allow if there was no deployment
will set installed and then the final
rule here is basically just block
everything this will set will prevent
you from running anything that didn't
come from my company com except for if
it was signed by that certificate in the
first rule so this is just an example
and we'll go into detail about what each
of these XML items mean
okay so as I said each rule is made up
of identification than an action and the
identification comes in four forms it's
really just too the first one is the
title the title is meant to be used in
conjunction with one of the next two
items and in most cases can't be used by
itself it might be useful to combine
with a certificate base rule for example
to to give us particular rule to some of
the things signed by this certificate
and not some of the others it also could
be useful if you have a very long will
set to eliminate a rule quickly so that
you don't have to check the certificate
of nine different rules to find it your
particular application doesn't apply so
the next one is a location the location
attribute is one of the two main ways of
defining an application it's used to
match against the jnlp file in the case
of Jay nopee applets and Jay nopee
applications or the HTML file in the
case of non jnlp applets this is the
starting point basically for the
application or applet and we'll show in
a minute what what that matching is
because the location attribute can be a
URL or it can be any combination of
protocol domain port and path that don't
necessarily make up a legal URL so the
location-based attribute the location
attribute can have a protocol import if
so they must match if it doesn't contain
those it matches anything it can have a
path and if none is provided it matches
everything if if none is provided it
matches everything on that domain and if
one is provided it matches everything
equal to or greater than which is to say
that it can be a directory and then it
matches everything in that directory on
the server
so the main object is the host what we
call the host fields really domain you
can use a wild card here web star dot to
get subdomains so that you could say
it's oracle com well you could say it's
star oracle com if you said star dot
oracle.com it would match any of the
servers you know us oracle com or some
other server named oracle com if it
didn't have the star dot it only matches
exactly you oracle com now the second
primary way of defining an ID for for a
rule is the certificate you can put the
hash code of a certificate into the rule
set the first example we showed have
that in it the first example didn't have
an algorithm attribute you can have a
hash in an algorithm attribute but if
you don't have an algorithm attribute it
will default to sha-256 in that case
that's what that hash code was a sha-256
so it wasn't necessary to include the
algorithm attributed so what happens is
only jars that assigned by that
certificate will match that rule and
this is clearly the most secure way of
identifying and application now we had
plan to check some element that we left
out of the first release mainly to do
the same thing as certificates do except
for unsigned case we may add that in the
future release before i go into anything
else let's talk about what the rules are
because now you can identify your
application what can you do with it it's
pretty simple you can block it you can
run it or you can let it use the default
if you block it you prevents it from
running you can put in a localized
message so that when the pop-up comes it
says you're not allowed to run this you
can control that you can run it and if
you want it you can specify the version
that it's allowed to run on or specific
range of versions or you can specify
that it runs on
particular families secure version or
any secure version and default it's just
what it says it does whatever you would
do if you didn't have a real set
installed so what's the scope of a rule
what does it mean it's sort of different
with the location versus a certificate
rule because if you have a location rule
it now applies to the whole applet in
the case of a jnlp it replies it applies
to everything in that Jane LP file it
doesn't apply to an extension jnlp file
which might have its own rule now in the
case of java web start it's possible to
have no href in the JLP file and
therefore java web start normally
doesn't know where the file came from so
in this case we consider the location
unknown and it won't match relocation
rule so if you want to use a location
rule you need to put an href in your
Daniel P file now in the case of
certificate it's important that we match
this every time for every job that we
load because in the case of in
particular in a non general p applet you
can have multiple jars signed by
different certificates you can have some
guards that are signed and some not it's
important that when we won we check that
the jar is actually signed by that
certificate if you have a series of
applicants Erie's of jars that are
signed by different certificates and you
want to use certificate rule you would
have to include them all so every time
we go to resource we see if the resource
is signed by rule and if not we move to
the next rule the rules of process in
order so that as you saw in the example
we had four rules eventually you get
down on the last one there that parked
everything a lot of cases you'll just
fall off the end and not match anything
in which case you'll use the default
so there's one other thing that's a
little different we started talking
about a live connect earlier in the case
of live connect you can have a rule that
applies to your application but you
don't know if your application is
invoked from your website and if it's a
if it's a applet and it's invoked from
somebody else's website then it's
possible that they could have JavaScript
on their website that did live connect
calls into your applet in ways that you
didn't plan so when javascript is
calling into Java you need a rule that
allows the JavaScript and since
javascript is unsigned you can't have a
rule based on a signature so you need a
rule based on location so the simple
thing is if you want to have a DRS with
a allows you appleton one and you want
to use javascript then you need to also
put in a rule that allows the JavaScript
to one and that's pretty much it for
deployment will set we're going to move
on to the next section of our talk and
I'll turn it back to mark briefly
thanks Andy okay so what we're going to
do I'm just going to give a brief
introduction to this and then David's
going to get into the details of what
those best practices are but so
understanding how you can deploy your
application ISM is important to
understanding what you can do with the
best practices so there's basically
three kinds of things that we support
one is java web start browser applet and
self-contained applications so java web
start is a way of downloading an
application say through a link on a web
page being able to run that application
on your computer having a cash so that
it's there the next time that you want
to run it it requires that there's a JRE
on that client computer the same with
the applet it's a plug-in in the browser
so it requires that Jo is already being
installed but then you can just download
your app it's very simple way of getting
a nap and and fairly quick the browser
additionally you can if you're running
your your app in the plug-in in the
browser then you can communicate with
live Connect which gives you some more
interactive capability with the web page
that your own self-contained
applications are what all they are is
basically like a native application it
just appears that way to the user is
just downloaded like any other
application would be so if you're on
Windows it might you might download an
exe or a Mac as a dmg or pkg the same
with whatever the on the Linux for
instance that we support we're not going
to talk too much about that because
that's not really with web security but
it is an option you can avoid some of
the problems with deploying through the
by using that since you can control your
JRE you don't have to worry about
multiple versions which of course you do
with when you deploy through an app
litter the other thing I wanted to
mention is to one or two little things
about self-contained applications is
that we gave a talk about it last year
and it was a lot of the features that we
were talking about were in an early
access release and then the security
mandate came along and the packager just
had to take a backseat and some of those
were bug fixes and features didn't
actually get in until 7u40 and now
they're finally in as long as well as
some other critical bug fixes that we
needed to do with it and so it didn't
get much attention in the last year and
I suspect a few people are upset about
that maybe including me um but there is
a future for it and it is something
that's important and we will be
continuing with it now that we've done
the bulk of our security stuff and
there's a link on this page where you
can get the slides later and it'll take
you where the talk about self-contained
applications now this is just a list of
deployment considerations things to
think about so that you can make the
right choices that you need to make so
if who talks about permissions do you
need do you need all accessory can you
get away with restricted access live
connect we've talked a little bit about
it being that it's untrusted and it can
be calling in to trusted so that creates
certain issues and there's ways around
that and we'll talk more about that as
well Plus what parameters you can take
in some there's certain certain
parameters that are okay to go in if
your application isn't signed if it is
signed then you get access to a lot more
capability and the other big thing is
you can have on the larger application
you can have artifacts from all over the
place and so knowing where that's all
coming from how you're going to assign
all those things what kind of
certificates you have affects your
decisions the other thing is about sign
jars now signing a jar doesn't make it
secure but what it does do
is create a level of trust because it
can be revoked blacklisted and so when
somebody sees that it also allows us to
give much friendlier dialogues things
that don't scare the user and some of
our dialogues are getting kind of scary
there's a another talk on Wednesday that
shows a lot of that so the more you
follow the best practices your dialogues
going to be a lot more friendly the last
thing I'm going to say before giving it
today is this is just a link to Oracle's
secure coding guidelines and it's got a
lot of good material it's not really
that easy to read but I guess that's
what you'd expect it talks about things
like do privilege blocks so how to set
you know the level of access that you
want and what's the best way to do that
so I'm going to give this over to Dave
who's going to talk all about the actual
best practices and what you can do to
make your users experience a lot better
thanks mark
that's scary
so once you've decided how to deploy we
have a bunch of recommendations on what
you should do when you deploy first I'm
going to go over sine Jane LP because it
comes up again in future sign jnlp is
basically it's including the jnlp file
that you would use to deploy your
application inside your signed jar file
properly signs your file we have two
types of sign jnlp we have the normal
Jane LP that you would deploy to your
web server and we also have a template
jnlp and the template jnlp allows you to
specify what parameters arguments or
whatever can be changed by the
application itself so if you have
different apps that have different
requirements you can change those
properties or or arguments in the
applications jnlp file and it won't
violate the matching rules that the
normal jnlp file has to match the jnlp
file that's on the web server exactly or
the application won't run so we'll go
over system properties and JVM options
obviously different applications of
different requirements you need to set
things like memory settings garbage
collection settings and sometimes
graphics controls so options and
properties are split up into two
categories we have secure and insecure
the secure properties are generally safe
they can't do much harm to your system
and they're available to all
applications currently whether signed or
unsigned whether sandbox or not and we
also have prefixes such as J&amp;amp;L p star
and java WS star that your application
can use these are these are application
to find properties so you have free
reign over those any properties that
start with those names
and those are those are treated as
secure properties so there's no
restrictions on that insecure properties
is basically everything else so to use
insecure properties you have to use sign
jlp which means you can't be restricted
to jnlp deployment either and if you're
using a plug-in you can't use a HTML
applet tag to launch that we have a list
of secure properties it's in the JLP
syntax guide there's a link at the
bottom so later when you get get the
slides you can click on the link and and
take a look there and basically anything
that's not listed in there is considered
insecure another thing you may need to
do is specify what version of the JRE
you need to run with and you do that
through either the JLP java or j2se
element or if you're using HTML you have
a java version applet parameter and they
both take basically the same type of
string here we have a jnlp an example
that this example will run in java 197
or above so if you have one dot seven or
eight it'll choose the latest secure
version and if you have different
arguments or properties depending on
which JRE gets selected then you need to
split it up into separate Java elements
each one specifies its own arguments or
properties or arguments in the HTML
example here shows we're using one dot
seven star this will run in java 7 only
so it won't run in java 6 or 8
and finally the third option is you can
use this our deployment toolkit which is
this DT java dot JS file that we've
deployed on our our Java calm and to use
it you just specify that you you just
specify the JVM element and and send it
basically the same version string in
this case is the same as the applet tag
will run with Java 7 and not eight or
six you can also specify specific
versions we don't recommend using
specific versions because those versions
can get become insecure and they won't
run and it's better specify a minimum
version or there's magic tricks you can
do to do ranges and finally you can you
can chain them together like this last
example runs in either java 6 or 7 but
not eight so one of the big topics is
repurposing repurposing is when someone
takes your jar file or jnlp and uses it
in a way that you didn't intend usually
sometimes maliciously and we have some
recommendations and how you can avoid
that and how to protect yourself and you
know your company's public image so the
first feature was introduced in 7025
it's the code base manifest attribute
this specifies where that jar file is
allowed to be executed from you can
specify one location you can specify
multiple locations you can use patterns
basically this prevents somebody from
taking your jar file moving it to a
different web server and using it
separately
and of course modifying the manifest
after you've deployed it will invalidate
it so you lose the signing so just an
example the first example shows a code
base at oracle com this allows any any
URL at that hostname or oracle com the
second one allows any sub domain of
oracle com over https or any subdomain
of java net over HTTP or https if you
don't specify the protocol it defaults
to either HTTP or https the second
feature we introduced in 7025 is the
permissions manifest attribute and this
basically says I want either run in all
permissions or in the sandbox and this
must match exactly what is specified in
jnlp or in the applet tag so that that
will prevent your say if you if you if
you release an applet that runs in
sandbox that'll prevent something from
being able to run it in in a privileged
environment and finally we have a mixed
code which is mixing both sandbox and
all permissions in the same applet or
application we highly recommend you do
not use HTML applet tag to be able to do
to do this there's too many problems
that you use we recommend that you use
one jnlp file for each permissions level
so if you have but whatever jars are
running in sandbox you specified in one
jnlp file whatever jars are running in
all permissions you're specifying a
separate one and then you use an
extension jnlp to load the jars that are
running in the separate privilege level
if you can you should sign all jars with
the same certificate that will make
deployment a lot easier and things go a
lot smoother for your
users extension jars or extension jnlp s
can be signed with different certificate
which will allow you to use third-party
libraries without having to resign and
repackage things using your own
certificate so the possibility is still
there to use third-party libraries
so back to sign jnlp we discussed a
little bit how it can prevent
repurposing basically it it locks down
what properties and arguments can be
specified for the application so those
those can't be changed by an attacker it
also protects the jars and other
resources that you have for your
application because they can't change
the location you can't they can't
reference a different third parties are
within your jnlp file and it also
protects you from being used in just
some random HTML applet tag because yeah
it requires a jnlp deployment we
recommend using HTTPS over HTTP just to
prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and we
have documentation online about how to
protect yourself from being how protect
your resources from being repurposed at
that link
so Jar signing is a kind of a big thing
we're moving to a model where we will
require all jar files to be signed in
the near future essentially right now it
just it just creates a much better user
experience so it's right now it's highly
recommended just to get a head start on
it it'll make things a lot nicer for the
user you should always sign with the
valid CA certificate whether it's
sandboxed or all permissions if you have
the option use a time-stamped
certificate that allows you to revoke
the certificate without having to read
redeploy your applications the
applications will be time stamped
they'll continue to run until the the
natural expiration date of the of the
certificate and of course if you're if
you find out you're to fix been
certificate has been expired and it's
your onus is on you to revoke it and
that allowed anything using that
certificate to to be blocked or if it's
time stamp they'll still run but any
future applet signed by that will not
run this creates some issues with during
development but there's a few things you
can do to make it easy of course you can
create a self-signed certificate to run
locally as long as the certificate is in
your local keystore it will be treated
as a trusted see a signed certificate
you can also do this with safety avah
enterprise-wide or a company-wide see a
server import the ca certificate into
your local key store it'll be able to
validate whatever certificates are
signed by that CA
and for managing certificates we have
basically two options we have the key
tool which is the command line utility
so the first example here shows how to
create a self-signed certificate use the
self-serve argument you pass in an alias
which the keystore uses to identify the
certificate and optionally you can you
can pass in the distinguished name
parameters if you don't pass in the D
name parameters and it'll it'll prompt
you on the command line but this allows
you to use it an automated environment
to create self-signed certificates
without having someone to intervene the
second command line shows you how to
import a certificate this is created
either by someone else to run an applet
that they've created as you need to test
or if you need to import a CA
certificate use the same option and then
finally to export a certificate that's
in your key store use the last option
use the export option and tell what file
to save to and then you can distribute
that to whoever needs it and finally the
Java control panel has a limited feature
set but allows kind of a graphical way
of doing things you can use it to import
and delete certificates in the key store
directly
and finally we highly encourage you to
keep keep apprised of the environment
you know how security is going and the
Java platform we have various resources
online with we've got blogs and news
from the pn staff in most of this is
focused on a developer and IT
departments but some of its for users as
well so we highly encourage you to go
check these out when you get the slides
you can click on the link so I'll take
you there and now end it back to mark to
wrap up
alright thanks David so just a little
bit of looking forward can't tell you
specific details but a focus is going to
remain on improving javis security and
we sort of touched on that one of the
problems initially with this is that
there's a lot of dialogues and some are
unfriendly and some are friendly and but
we're going to be working hard to
improve that make it a better user
experience and there's it's a really
interesting talk on Wednesday was given
by our UI guy and it shows a lot of how
the decisions are made when an applet is
running like the the path of is that
expired what happens then what dialogues
will come up and plus what's happening
in the future and how we're trying to to
make that a better user experience
probably the most important thing is
that today's recommendations are
probably tomorrow's requirements so it's
kind of your responsibility as a
developer to keep abreast of what those
changes are and to make sure that you're
running on the latest JRE or that you
can run and test on all the different
versions and keep up with that so in
summary the the deployment rule set was
one large effort to make it to sort of
mitigate all these dialogues and
problems in the in an enterprise and it
can make it very smooth for the
enterprise so that applets can just run
and and nobody even has to click on
dialogues plus you need to follow best
practices and David was all the things
that David was talking about like
manifest attributes you really need to
pay attention to them and figure out
which ones are optional which ones are
coming and if you one way of doing that
is looking at the very high security
level and think well okay that's going
to become the default at some point so
you're quicker you get onto that the
better plus you have to sign all your
jars that's the one thing I can tell you
for sure that it's happening and will
happen in 2014 so there is no choice
there plus follow the secure coding
coding lion lines and just try to keep
up with the evolving security practices
and go to those blogs I know there's one
of the blogs I think it's the PM's blog
is is or is specifically about the next
security release and already has some
information so that's a good one to look
at so finally here's some links to more
talks this week that are related the
first one is it's sort of a history of
this year in review of what happened in
the security and goes more in depth and
at the actual changes and you can kind
of see the thought process and how
things evolved through the year the
second one is the user experience that's
on Wednesday i highly recommend that one
too it's a very visual as opposed two or
more textual in here there's also a buff
that's we are team so it'll be us plus
some more members from our team tomorrow
at four thirty and we're going to it'll
be much more interactive and hopefully
you can give us feedback and you know
tell us what you like don't like or what
you'd like to see and we can take that
and make plans based on some suggestions
we get plus there's a unfortunately the
same time there's a hands-on lab for
Java code signing and these are just
links to our doc you some of the
documentation on the web and that's
pretty much it and I think we've got a
few minutes for Q&amp;amp;A so anybody like to
ask some questions
why
Oh
I would agree with the lawyers that you
shouldn't sign their code
upon them to sign
the case of because
open software
I'm not sure yeah that's a tough
yeah generally I think the best behavior
in such a case is to get them to sign
their third-party components that's it
is something that we we're talking about
internally we realize it's a problem and
we don't have a good solution right now
but is something we're looking at
hopefully we'll have some other
solutions by the time that we mandate
the signing
in the form of a jar jar like I'm not
sure how that would work I mean
obviously you can sign their jaws it's
it's just not a good legal practice but
in the case of Jar Jar just Thomas my
number and I don't think that will give
the inner joy that the same signing
level as I'm not sure I know that we
have that capability but it's been part
of plug-in for a long time and not
frequently used
yes
yeah I mean but but then it wouldn't be
secure the only answer really if you
have properties that you need to be set
is to set some secure property and then
use that in your main part of your
applet to read that you know we Jane LP
your property and then to light your
proper you know whatever whatever the
insecure property is X if you said Jane
lp-tx into Jannah p file and then you
read all the Jan LP texts and write out
X to the same value in your sign code
you know you can basically translate a
secure to an insecure but I mean that
that that proves that your code intended
to do that otherwise you know if it's a
property that is effects Java starting
up for example then that's not gonna do
any good because you know then it's an
insect it's an insecure property there's
there's really no way that unless you
specify it inside of the sign jnlp that
we know that the JLP that's mentioning
that property isn't some hacker
eration change
to change
well as i said if its internal to your
application then you can either a just
switch to using secure properties to
begin with with the Sun prefix like
janiel p dot or be just have a little
routine in your main that reads jaynell
pux and writes jana p the whites food
out X you know
riesling
yeah I mean as I said if you're doing it
in order to set a property that's
internal to your application you can do
it by translating the secure to the
insecure property and your maid having
nothing to do with sign jnlp but it's
definite limit ation of sign jnlp
template is that the only template items
that you're allowed to change are the
ones that changing doesn't have any
security impact you know you can change
the title or the codebase you know but
you can't change it an insecure property
and that's it one more go ahead
I work with
Janelle and push that is
terrific soon we need to give a
scientist
every job
well yeah in essence our team and the
code that we're describing has nothing
to do with that scenario so nothing yeah
unfortunately you know that we put out
three or four security releases each
year and there's hundreds of changes in
them and they cover some stuff that
could could affect your server you know
and some of them and I don't think we
ever put out except for when would you
know we didn't release one time this
year i think it was seven you 11 that
you know we heard about the bug on
thursday and releasing on java calm on
sunday except for the case like that
where we have a regular release it's
going to have bugs that affect both the
server and a client anyway well I plenty
of time to answer more questions at the
bottom are afternoon and I'm sorry that
we time here but thank you all for
