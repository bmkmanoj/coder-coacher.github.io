as the cloud evangelist and today I'm
gonna talk to you about servlet
specifically about request and response
management using servlets
okay so servlet it's a very popular API
for Java EE
it exists even before Java EE being
every evening before j2ee do you
remember
so I will going to show you how to
example so how you are going to use it
for the whip
management for your requests and
responses okay just so just a quick demo
here and first one is a very simple
servlet example and servlet implements
all the methods methods for HTTP so here
we have the do get method okay we just
need it it for now as I said is a very
simple one we get wider instance from
the response so we're gonna use it for
write a output anything that you wanna
run here okay so it's an example servlet
hello let me build and then run it so
I'm using that means you can use
whatever ID you like that's okay so
let's run so we have here two links I
will use the first one there you go we
use the response instance to write any
output for our our servlets like a know
a web page it's so on so let's go back
to the NetBeans and the second one is a
push server servlet the Porsche server
is a new feature for Hawaii and just a
few months ago Java 8 it come come in
release it so we have here the same
method they do get so we have in the
request reference a new new object that
is the new push Builder that I instance
for using for producing some things
through the browser
so we get an instance and we check if
it's not new because if you are not
using HTTP 2 if your browser is not
compatible or if your browser is
compatible but you're not using HTTPS
that is required for using MotionBuilder
it will eat will you be know so you have
to check it saying what's this shacket
you have the path method should you get
a path for your resource that you wanna
push and you also inform the reader and
then you push ok it will save a lot of
time because your browser doesn't need
to send a lot of requests to guests to
get those resources ok you can send
image CSS files JavaScript files and so
on ok so once it's done here we have
another another feature for for servlet
that is forwarded like request with
dispatcher here we get an instance for
pointing to this web page and then we
have here a forward method ok so here's
a very beautiful at me the quiz and here
we had the doc ok that's it for now
thanks for watching see you next time
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
