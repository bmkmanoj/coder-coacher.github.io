management at Oracle I deal mostly with
tools for developers and both
development tools and infrastructure
tools for developers and this session is
going to share some of the lessons we
learned when we build our own - so that
those are lessons actually form our own
development tools that are building
product and specifically those are
lessons around how to do agile team
development and a little bit of DevOps
as well and using a cloud environment so
at Oracle just like you we have a bunch
of software developers that are building
products and several years ago we made a
transition of our products to become
cloud product and this brought along a
bunch of changes in the way that we
needed to develop software ok and one
key aspect is released frequently when
we did in confirm its products most of
our products would have a big release
once a year maybe some patrialis as we
have to use something like that and then
people would actually pick it up on
their own time like you would release
something and then you would still find
people using the release that you
produced four years ago on filling in
clothes everything moves much faster and
we are able to release software
basically once a month we have a time
frame where we can up with the cloud and
then all our customers get this new
version of the product right one other
thing that changed for us is the level
of quality that we needed from our
folder so we need to have high quality
of the software before as well but in a
cloud environment and real hosting
everything and we are multi tenant so we
have one product serving multiple
customers if you have a bug it's going
to impact a lot of people ok so the
software needs to be very stable very
secure because multiple people are using
the same instance
in a lot of aspects of the quality of
the software have been increased in
terms of the demand format and the speed
of meetings to be able to find about and
fix it again we needed to increase this
and we also changed a lot of our
development technologies when we used to
do on thermos products we used to do a
lot of things like in C and C++ and Java
and stuff like that we still do a lot of
Java in the cloud but we're also seeing
a lot of product that are now doing
stuff with nodejs at the back end with a
lot of our product in terms of the front
end there now based on JavaScript html5
type of in new eyes and again various
types of backends whether it's no gesso
Java or sometimes it's directly against
the database so the development
technologies like this the variety of
them inside oculus increased and the
development process is also something
that's changed for us and we move to
adopt an agile development methodology
and the reason we move to a gel is
because it allows us to address a lot of
the requirements in the previous slide
the agile does a lot of books that you
can read about it there's a lot of
websites that give you deeper
understanding of agile I usually try to
summarize it in four main points of what
we're trying to achieve with Asia
okay if we want to have show delivery
cycles and build the product in in
incremental mode so rather than building
the whole product which is what we used
to do we would go out build the product
like all the features that we could
think about and then we would ship it in
the cloud and in agile we actually start
with what we call the MVP the minimal
Viable Product and we put it out there
and then based on the feedback that we
get from customers who are actually
using it we then add more features and
we add more features in a very frequent
ok so every couple of month you're going
to see new features appearing in the
product rather than once a year
something like
and the other thing that a gel gives us
is the ability to change our focus on
which features and which again fixes and
stuff like that we'll targeting very
dynamically okay so based again we put a
product out there and people are using
it we get feedback in sometimes it
completely changes what we thought would
be our focus for the next release we see
a lot of people demanding a specific
feature we're going to focus on that one
so there's constant shift okay and
adoption on our side in terms of the
product that we're delivering and what
it does in the next release okay so we
listen to more frequent features are
changing all the time
this is agile to some degree introduces
a lot of time uncertainty and sort of
mess into your development process okay
some people like the old approach where
you would go out and at the beginning of
the project you would plan everything
for the next two years and then you
would go for two years and you write
everything then you deliver the project
and the product but in today's world if
you start a project and then deliver
yield after that everything is changed
during this field in terms of what
people need what they expect given the
technologies so this is what agile gave
us now something that is not very agile
but related to agile is the concept of
Devils so I did the lazy thing and I
copy the definition of whatever kids
from Wikipedia okay and I it's a long
sentence and you can read it but I
highlighted a few thing the first thing
is that a lot of people when they talk
about DevOps and also when they talk
about HR they talk about a cultural
shift in how you do stuff and yet there
is this aspect of cultural aspects and
changing goals in the organization and
the way that you conduct meetings and
stuff like that
near the technical guy unless the
interested in those aspects I'm more
interested in the actual software that
is needed to achieve this and if you
actually look at the definition of their
books at the end they also talk about it
the cultural end in
moment the environment is actually the
important part for me which is I need a
platform that allows you to do building
and testing and releasing of software
okay very rapidly very frequently and in
a more reliable way now if you look at
the adjective at the end there's things
like rapidly frequently reliably those
are the same adjective that agile is
trying to achieve
and this is kind of the connection
between the two we see their box as the
way to achieve a jar or as a mandatory
thing that you need to have in order to
actually be able to do agile development
in matter it DevOps talks about this
circle of starting from planning your
product coding it building it testing it
releasing deploying operating monitoring
and based on the operation and monitor
and feedback that you get you continue
to develop ahead and stuff like that so
those are kind of the goals we have and
what I wanted to share in this session
is to talk about how we actually do this
okay how we do agile in there and I'm
going to talk about one of our teams so
O'Kelly's basically you can think about
it is a lot of smaller companies which
product is a company okay and I'm going
to talk about one product or one company
that is called the Oracle developer
cloud service so this is the team that
right now has about 170 members in this
thing okay so the members in the team
some of them of course are the actual
developers but members in the team of
also the curia engineers they dock like
the product manager the development
managers the vice-president trial things
like that so other words as the hundred
and seventy people that are involved in
building this product this is quite a
large product in terms of scope
thousands of lines of code and I'll talk
about what the product does in the next
life and we're working in a two-week
sprint approach where we basically build
the products in two weeks spent okay
away to it we define what we are going
to do in the next two weeks focus on
those tasks and
so what is this developer cloud service
and we tied the nicely into the rest of
the session
because developer cloud service is
actually the product that Oracle uses to
do agile and DevOps
okay so developer cloud service focuses
on code management and continuous
integration so what it does it basically
gives you a code repository based on
gift it gives you build automation
utilities with a bunch of frameworks
like maven and anthem Gradle which are
used by projects which go Java
development at Oracle's it gives you
things like a NPM and galton bowel okay
for projects that are based on nodejs
and JavaScript it gives you utilities
for testing like j-unit and selenium
generators back in testing selenium is a
UI testing it gives you find bad for
code review and so all of those
utilities together gives us a platform
for managing our code and all of them
are integrated into a single product and
this is used by multiple teams inside
the hotel to build the software by the
way the same platform that we use
internally this is what we also for
customer so you can get developer cloud
service and use it to build your own and
manage your own code the other stuff
that we're doing in developer cloud
service is managing the team in the
development process so in there there's
a task tracking system or an issue
tracking system there's a a bunch of
utilities to manage agile development
process so let's click prioritizing
stuff and managing sprints and getting
repos and things like that there's a
platform for doing online peel code
review
so multiple people can collaborate in
the comment on code pieces and there's a
wiki for sharing things like design
documents or documenting use cases stuff
like that and there's also something
called activity stream which is kind of
like your Twitter or Facebook page of
what's going on today in the project
and again all of this is integrated into
a single offering and then beyond that
we built integration with various
development tools and I'm going to show
you some of those today so this is what
the product that we are building that
and again this is all done as a single
project all of those features are in one
product but what we did then is we
branched into 40 separate git
repositories which git repository deals
with one aspect of the product ok so you
would have a git repository for issue 13
gonna git repository for doing the build
framework or git repository for the
continuous integration engine okay and
then we manage all of those again
because it's a single project with a one
central place where we track tasks and
issues so let's start by talking about
how we do em version management of our
code okay and what we did well is we use
a process called git flow which is a
very popular approach to working with a
git repository and the idea that is that
when a developer works on a new bug that
is fixing or when a new feature that is
working on he is going to branch the
code and create a local copy of the code
that he's working on okay then this
great situation where you've escaped a
lot of those branches managed and but it
also allows you to have a situation
where if suddenly the priority changes
and you need this developer to go and
work on something else
he can just leave this branch on the
side with the work that he didn't branch
to another focus area and more content
so the developer works on the code and
once he's comfortable with the code he
thinks he finished the work on a
specific feature that is working on he
can actually create a merge request
basically asking to melt the code from
the branch into the main line but before
we actually do the merge does the
process of code review so the manager
for this feature will reveal the code
see the changes
we can also bring other people into the
review not just the manager and they do
a kind of iterating the interaction
between the developers and his bills to
get the code into the best best state
basically once the code is approved we
learn a bunch of automated builds that
actually take the code and make sure
that it passes tests and things like
that and then we merge it back into the
master okay so this is kind of what we
do when in terms of managing the code
for features and again if you look at
our team we have about 200 commits of
the codes than the week okay so this is
quite a lot for this thing
one special situation is when we're
getting close to a relief okay when
we're getting close to a release we're
actually branching from the master line
of code and creating a separate release
branch okay and this release branch is
protected so you can't just marriage
things into there okay only specific
people are allowed to say okay now we
can melt something in there and this is
in order to create a most table release
version okay so what we basically do in
terms of changes in this release branch
our only critical bug fixes okay so this
is usually done like a week or something
like that before a major release or
something like that and then again all
the automated builds work that once
we're done and we have a stable release
we release it and then merge all the
changes all the bug fixes back into me
so that kind of our process for doing
this by the way am just so you know what
to expect I'm going to talk with slides
about what we are doing for a while and
then I'm going to actually show you how
we're actually doing it so I'm going to
actually do the development process then
so some kids from outside on code
management one aspect is that it's okay
to have more than one repository for
your code okay as I said we have 40 of
those and the reason is that if your
project is big and your time to manage
everything in one place it's going to
create a lot of overhead in terms of
looking at all the code and browsing
through it and stuff like that it's
easier to modular lives stuff and then
let your build system do the integration
of the various models into the product
that you deliver okay so don't be afraid
to have multiple git repositories for
one project and we highly recommend it
git flow process and for that it
provides a lot of agility in the way
that we build a product disability to
say of a hoops there's a critical bug
that we need to fix we're waiting for a
second one branch will branch into
another thing we're working on this very
quickly finishing this melting it and
then go back to what we were working on
before so this is again you can Google
get flow see a lot of tutorials on how
to do it a lot of documents and we
recommended to use it works for us
pretty good and one key thing for us is
the code review process code review the
angel is to create a situation where we
have better code not just in terms of
readability or stuff like that but also
in terms of the code quality to invent
arrows stuff like that pill programming
and we automate code review okay it's a
required step for you when you're going
to do before you actually melt something
and one nice thing that we are also
automating is we have a default code
reviewer okay for each area so the
manager for a specific part of the
product has to do a code review before
the code get approved beyond him the
developer can ask to another peel of him
to also review the code so we do all of
this online very easy to communicate and
I'll show you how we do it later on and
then this best practice of branching
main into a release before it helps you
achieve in this world of agility and
everything moving a little bit most page
stabilisation before you actually
release them okay so do this and if you
want to actually create a little bit
stability before you release your
products
so this was how we manage our codes and
coding process then does the build
process the build process as I said
before there are automated commits so an
automated bills that are filed based on
commits so when a developer committees
code we require him to have a build
process for his code that includes
things like test and then beyond those
bills that are fired based on commits
and merged into the main line we also
have twice a day and over raphaÃ«l
change built the takes all the
components of the product all the faulty
git repositories and build the product
all of them
bunch them together into the single
product and then deploys this product
into virtual machines which are
basically running the version of our
product and when the version is running
death we're able to run additional
builds that run automated tests on our
product UI test things like that in
addition when we have it over there QA
can do manual tests okay so the QA guys
can actually go there and do that so
Dotel twice a day scheduled bills that
we're doing usually one of them is at
night one of them is sometime in the
morning and one thing to highlight here
is detect that our development team
they're those hundred and seventy people
they are spread all over the world okay
we have some of them sitting here in the
alkylate SKU some of them are sitting in
the Czech Republic some of them are in
the UK some of them are in India okay
and some of them just work from home in
various places so all of them are
collaborating checking in code and stuff
like that and then the bill basically
creates this unified product out of it
also and every two weeks we take the
master branch and we do a build on it
that basically creates the product
deploys it okay
run automated tests and also allows our
QA guys to do a manual testing on this
and this is kind of our big two-week
sprints and of
end of sprint build which basically is
supposed to create our candidate for
product killings not that way two weeks
really listening okay sometimes it's
it's no like once a month or something
like that but this is how we actually
produce the product at the end of the
day you'll get access to to our club so
some clips from our experience about
being okay
and you want to notification going out
from your build okay and it's kind of
like you know like the the question of
this tree falls in the forest and nobody
hill did it actually happen if the build
fails and nobody knows about it it
doesn't mean anything so when a build
fails we send notification to all the
team to know okay this happened and it
also prevents the ideal of all I didn't
know it was broken on things like that
situation and you need to require a test
like we require a test as part of the
build so every feature that is being
built we're big believers in test-driven
development and when a developer
produces the new feature it builds the
test into it and we automate it and
include it as part of the build for this
feature and the fact that we do regular
builds help us to mostly like faster
realizes there are problems okay it is
twice a day build across the product
helps us identify problems much sooner
and when you identify a problem sooner
in the development cycle it's usually
easier to detect what went wrong because
it's something that's happened in the
last like half days okay and it is deal
usually to fix it that's another thing
and there is no such thing as build
overloads
okay what you need to remember here is
the build is automated there's no person
that actually works and does something
okay
so you shouldn't be worried about having
the computer do a lot of work for you
okay
so doing those two builds a day or doing
those little builds on every commit
don't worry about the fact that you're
overloading the system this is going to
help you at the end of the day I know
that some people say okay we'll do one
build a day that
it's not the solution like when you need
it to run a build in our case for
example and we actually have a situation
where there's almost no part of the day
where our build servers are not doing
something we are not afraid to over you
M another thing by the way that we are
doing with build automation it's not
just part of the release of the product
we're actually using build automation to
monitor their live application so we
have watchdog build that basically do
things like check the performance and
pink they you the URLs and make sure
that everything works okay and those are
against out of power automation so this
was a little bit about how we do agile
and how we do continuous integration and
delivery I want to take you through the
typical day of the various roles in our
organization so again I'll do it with
slides and then I'll actually show you
how it looks so I'm going to talk about
one person who's the developer okay so
what the developer usually do the way
that they start is that they get an
email about the new a task or a feature
that they are required to build or that
they need to fix and this is how they
know what to do okay
it's not every day that they get an
email but it's usually when it something
is assigned to them by the way if
there's a situation where nothing is
assigned to you today it doesn't mean
that you can go home what it means is
that we have a list of open issues with
no assignment you go over there and you
pick one that you know that you were
able to work with and this is the one
that you're going to work with so you
know the tasks that you're supposed to
do today then you branch the code and
you start working on your code and by
the way working on the code the total
you can use any idea you want okay so
okay Liam for example has an ID called J
developers some of our developers use
this some people use Eclipse some people
use NetBeans some people use IntelliJ
some people actually call directly in
the cloud so if you beam at the keynote
in the morning they showed you the
screen we actually have a code base a
coding environment in the cloud so
formulas or you can call
each one whatever suits him okay at the
end of the day all of those coding
environments are connected to our git
repository so once you're done coding in
your abilitie environment you can
actually commit and push the changes
into the digital poster and this files a
build on your specific branch okay and
if everything goes perfectly fine and
you're ready with your code it past your
yo test you go and you do a merge
request merge request initiate also a
code with your cycle and you do kind of
iterative reviewing of the code you get
comments every comment gets you you get
an email about it again you modify your
code again run the build automatically
when everything is done and your code is
the pool you merge it into the math
cells and then you close the task but it
has resolved okay and then you start all
from the beginning pick up the next task
and do this so this is what a developer
does the dev Ops guys we actually don't
have a lot of them okay because DevOps
all they do is like most of our DevOps
is automated right so Mel struggle a
build a unit tests are executed
automatically hours build produce a
binaries that go into a maven repository
where we manage all our binaries if a
build fails you get a notification and
the scheduled builds that run every like
a couple of times a day and when a build
is successful we notify a QA
automatically a QA then goes in and can
verify the things that will master's
touch that will close and actually close
the updates any bugs that they are now
closed but like that we run selenium UI
testing automatically and I will develop
guys what mostly what they do is okay
they define the initial build files okay
all the build processes but then what
most of the time is spent on is actually
monitoring the running the environment
so they'll ops is instead of focusing on
kind of the wasteful pal
trying to take the code and move it
along the chain it's actually they're
focused on monitoring the towers on time
platform is performing well in stable
stuff like that which is what we want
your ox guys to do you want to make sure
that your Lantern platform your finished
product is actually successful let's
talk about the development manager and
what his day looks like so
one thing the development manager
usually do in the morning is look at the
activity stream basically look at what
has happened during the night because
again as I said there are team all over
the world working on it in different
time zones so he looks at what has been
happening and what new issues were
reported stuff like that
and then he goes over than he does is
shoe management so he looks at the
issues he prioritized them he assigns
them to people he can click the status
of issues stuff like that
the next thing that he might be doing is
look at males requests which also code
review cycles some of our managers are
also acting as the sprint manager so
they actually track the progress of the
sprint look at various repos and how are
we matching our goals stuff like that
and at the end of the day they are also
the ones who are working on this release
branch that is the protected branch that
will go over and become our product they
are the only ones who are approved to
approve actually merges into that one so
they also do that okay so this was kind
of a quick example of how we do things
conceptually conceptually what I wanted
to do is actually show you physically
how we do things so I'm going to well to
head here I'm going to start is elect
the admin okay and I used to growl also
Safari is Alex the admin and acorn would
be the developer like so we're working
on a product called Oracle code up I can
show you
em I can show you our will code because
its proprietary we're not allowed to
share it to top ticket so I'm going to
show you the same tool but using some
other program that
some sample application so when you go
into the product management section this
is the home page another here you can
see exactly what happens in your project
over the last couple of days okay and
this is kind of a live stream update of
what's going on you can see that they
build was executed database build at any
finish successfully that some issues
will assign stuff like that and other
things that you can do here as a manager
is you can go over here and say I need
to have another team member
added to our repository okay so I can
add for example clever decoder and then
clever decoder get access to something
okay get access to the project and they
can start working on it okay all right
so as a manager one of the things I do
is I manage issues I can go over here
middle if I explain this you will see
the different things so we have one
dashboard from which you can look at
your code your maven repository code
snippet ml request issues build edge
deploy wiki everything is accessible
from one central repository so now I'm
looking at issues so those are all our
issues you can see various indication of
the priority and the status of each
issue and which are resolved which are
closed and you can of course filter this
and create all sorts of advanced
searches you can see all the issues that
are high priority and I'll still not
assigned for example and go over then
assign them and you can also go into a
specific issue and look at it so you can
actually click on it get all the
information about this issue see how
complex it is stuffable so let's say we
have a situation that was reported to us
and we look and we say ok I look at the
application and I see something that is
wrong so as a manager I can go in and I
can create a new issue so my issue right
now is the dashboard title is wrong ok
and then the description needs to say
our old and not my goal ok it's a small
issue because I need to be able to fix
it best for you guys and and by the way
over here in lot of cases you would say
things like look at the speck on the
wiki and there would be a link to our
wiki which is also part of this
environment where you can go over and
look at what should be done then you can
decide whether it's a task or a defect
or feature this is actually a bad so we
call it a defect
what's the priority and you can set
priorities and one nice thing is that
you have which part of the product it is
in ok so this is an MVC type of product
we have respondent back-end database
security stuff like that and one thing
to note is that for example if I assign
something and I say this is the database
issue automatically the owner would be
one guy if I go and I assign it to
someone to another area of the product
this would be another life so this is a
nice thing that we are doing well when
an issue is reported it's not just left
there without anyone looking at this we
assign it to the manager of that area
and then this manager knows that he
needs like between his field now ok he
needs to either fix this or give it to
someone else in his team by the way all
of those lists that you can see here are
things that you can change like the
values in here things that you can
tailor to your warning and we also do
agile development and one of the ways to
evaluate a child complexity or the
complexity of the task is to give in
numbers so this is a very simple task
we're going to give it one story point
again I'm not going to explain what
story points out this is a common thing
in nature but this is how we do it so
this is the web dashboard then once I
actually assign the new like once I
created the new item it goes into my
list then the other thing I can do as a
manager here is I can look at my agile
process ok actually want to look at my
backlog ok so this is the currently
running sprint as another week to go on
it and I can see all the issues again
what the status is all I can see those
two issues well resolved differently and
this is my backlog those are the issues
that are still open ok then I can say ok
you know what this dashboard title is on
it
small ratio in terms of complexity we
can probably still fit it in here so I
can just drag and drop it and edit to
the splint or maybe this is an issue
that our manager told us about and it's
very important to satisfy the manager
the VP or whatever so it's coming into
this current screen so that's all I
needed to do I put it into the sprint
and it is now part of the things that we
are targeting for the next release so
this is a little bit of how the manager
work looks like now let's switch other
to the developer and so I'm actually
going to start not from the web
dashboard but from an ID okay so this
developer for example uses the clips we
have by the way the same type of
integration built into a NetBeans and
JDeveloper and in terms of git
integration you can do anything else but
inside the Eclipse environment there's
this area here and can exhume because
the way to to zoom them so there's this
area over here that is called the Oracle
cloud stub and this is the tab we added
for eclipse or NetBeans over Delta and
in there I can look into my developer
cloud service ok I can also look into
other cloud services like the database
and stuff like that go out of this room
and I'm actually accessing and I can see
all the projects I'm working on and
right now I'm working on the Oracle code
application ok so when I expand this
again I'm going against the cloud and
I'm fetching information and one of the
things I can look here is the list of
issues and I can look at all the open
issues of all the issues that are
assigned to me so I'm right now logged
in here as shy who's one of the
developers and I can see all the issues
that are assigned to shut over here ok
and one of those issues should be this
new issue hill ok that is vegetable
title is long and I can double click on
it and look at the full set of
information about this issue inside the
clip so I can see exactly what was
written here and I can see the
description of what I need to do and I
can also comment so I can tell my team
example I'm working on this today
okay so just send an update to my team
about this issue so from inside the IDE
I can actually look at my to-do list
okay and then I actually have my code
here so this is my project code and this
is the check out of the master branch so
before I actually go and I fix an issue
I'm going to blanch it so I'm going to
do Tim and I'm going to do switch to a
new branch and we usually name our
branches based on the tasks that we're
trying to fix so this is task 12 this is
the branch for tasked work so now I can
go over and actually change my code and
we should be down here there should be a
dashboard though and this is by the way
I'm just a project like the dashboard is
just an HTML here is where it says my
team and we say the pixels we need to
say I will instead of like okay like
small code change I can do save and then
just go to the normal and get
interaction okay so I add the file to
the index and then I can go over and say
let's push let's commit this code oh one
thing before I do the coin one thing I
can also do in Eclipse is I can
associate a file with the tasks that I'm
working on so if I'm working on this
task I can activate this okay and then
this is using Milan so when I open this
task in the future this file would
automatically be associated and will be
opened with it okay the other thing it
does is that when I go over now and I
say that I want to commit my code okay
and with this team commit
into my commit message we injected a
pointer to the task okay so I can write
in the committee what I did get so
changed the title but there's also a
reference to the task I was working on
and this gives us and let me click
commit and push and this is going to
push this into the cloud and it will
execute a new branch in the cloud okay
and this gives us flexibility of each
code change with the tasks that relate
to it so we know what's the source of
this code change so now I pushed it into
the cloud if I go back to as Alex the
admin and Alex goes back into the home
page okay into the kid he can see
everything that happened lately
for example she basically says that he's
working on this today and he actually
did a commit let's look at it for a
second from the perspective of again
Shai the developer which is what I am
here and when he goes in here after he
did the committee would see the paint
dashboard so everyone sees exactly
what's going on in the project you can
also go into his git repository and he
can look for example at his later at his
branches okay and he can look at for
example the master branch and the tags
and he can see a graph of the master
branch and things like that but what he
actually wants to do right now is he
thinks he's finished with his code
changes okay so he's going to create a
new merge request he is going to ask to
merge into the master the changes he
didn't ask well okay and note that into
this smells request we again inject the
specific commits that we were working on
then we can say this is related to task
12 no defect 12 okay and who do I want
to review it I want Alex to review it
and maybe I want clutter or anyone else
to review this code I can give them some
message so this is the issue that I'm
solving now says I will oak
and then to create a code with code
reveal request okay this actually sends
an email to Alex the admin Alex the
admin would get an email but even if he
doesn't get an email one part of his day
is going over to his a code review tab
and look at the things that are assigned
to him okay all assigned to me in this
case and over here we can see this
request to do a code review he clicks on
it and he can actually see what I just
told him okay and then it can click on
changed files and it can actually
visually see the exact changes that were
made in the code okay and he can maybe
say maybe as a comment here looks okay
okay or maybe maybe the comment is it
doesn't look okay maybe you need to
change something so he can actually do a
comment on a specific line of code and
then of course this would send an email
back to shy and shy when he goes in and
looks at the yield code review now would
see the comment italics gave them okay
into someone and correct and then when I
when Alex is okay with all the changes
he can click approve says ready for meld
okay like that and then again Shai would
get a message saying you'll call you the
pool and he can go over and click the
mail dragon melt would take this branch
that we did okay and merge it back into
main and I can actually delete the brain
shall keep the branch wherever I feel
comfortable with and then I click merge
and that's it this is how we manage our
code okay everything from a task that
was associated to us all the way to
checking in and merging back into into
the main now the nice thing is one part
here is our build system okay and if you
now go into our build system you would
see they'll the bill that has been
queued for us okay right now and this is
the automation sound I told you when we
do a code mail chain to main wheel
to matically fire a build that needs to
be executed okay and this would be
picked up by our build engine and gets
executed let me show you what's going on
inside the build so let's go into the
build configuration okay and you can
specify which JDK for example on this
build does build kilometers if you need
to one thing here is this build is
associated with our source control so it
is connected to our git repository and
specifically to the master branch and
then in terms of what triggered this
build it is triggered every time that
someone puts something in our source
control we every kind of the commit into
the master branch this bit is going to
fight other builds by the way might be
built that we do on a schedule so there
are ways that run away to every day at
midnight some bills are trigger well
when other builds are finished so when
there's a build for example that
finishes the packaging and the deploying
does another bill that would be run that
does automated testing after we do the
deploy and in the build step this bill
specifically uses maven and it does
clean install and deploy those are the
creators that it does but a build can
have multiple steps and again you can
use various types of a build frameworks
whether it's an - maven or Gradle or no
Jaso and PM basically you can also once
equal CL by the way equal to L is a way
to run in command against the ocular
database like for example if part of
your build is creating tables and
populating them you can use the same
thing and then you can streamline
together multiple steps so you can have
one step for example that lands your
database creation script one script that
does your build of the application in
one part that does in the actual
deployment for example and then in the
post build you can say what to do for
example here we are taking all the
architects and packaging them together
and you can also run unit tests and
things like that so this is how we build
and we can actually see I will build
just now finished successfully okay and
this files the next step in our chain
and the next step is actually taking
place right now you can see deployment
is in progress
it actually takes the application that
was built and pushes it into our runtime
platform okay so I forgot to show you
the application before the change not
nice URL so you would only see the
application after the change when the
deployment is granted but again this is
how everything is automated end to end
okay that without the deployment
finished so I can click over here and go
and see my application now after the
change so remember it said my org and
now it says our org or our team overview
okay so this is by the way this is our
hotel jet base Java test application
responsive stuff like that and that's
how I do everything automatically so
finish with a couple of slides and just
to recap some of the stuff that we
showed you today this concept of having
the agile pal the managing of the
process of development with DevOps
together is what gives us the power okay
having those two things separately or
just one of them doesn't is not going to
work for you just having them together
is something that is very powerful it
depended everything is in the cloud is
so much simpler for us it used to take
us months to get an environment for
building okay because you needed to buy
the various the servers and the software
and install everything and connect
everything now a team a circle can get
this full environment in a matter of two
minutes they put in a request
everything is provisioned for them in
the cloud and they can start working and
by the way you can do the same thing
right and and then team collaboration is
key for us so successful this is some
statistics about what we do again 40 git
repositories 170 project members 50 of
them are actual coders a 200 commits
awakes 50 builds a day
is over 20k of issues that are
documented in our system and 250 wiki
pages that we use to share information
among the levels what it gives us is
full size ability we can collect
something form the issue being reported
to looking at how long it takes us to
fix it all the way to seeing the source
code changes the bill that will tile the
deploy everything is traceable ok and it
gives us a faster feedback on our code
commits because we get the immediate
build and build success and test results
it improves our collaboration you saw
how easy it is to request the code
review from someone sharing the
knowledge of the experts with the
beginner stuff like that and we have
one-stop shop and so agile and DevOps
accessibility its cloud-based you can go
anywhere like I'm feeling the D Hotel
doing the same stuff that people in the
office do then if you're on a vacation
and you have a you checked in something
that worked the bills
there's no excuse you can still access
the code and fix it to our cloud right
so even if you don't have your laptop
with you and and again is the
provisioning and scaling so if you want
to target on your own and you got a
allocation forgetting price
environmental replicating the cloud
environment for the orchid cloud we
actually provision this product what you
saw today this whole thing is available
for you for free with almost every other
pad service that you'll get if you are
getting the Java cloud service of our
application container cloud all our
database cloud service so our container
docker container cloud service all of
them come with an instance of developer
cloud service for free and you can use
it and try it out and see how it can
help you manage your own project doing
the same thing I just did you everything
I showed you by the way is on our
current production version noting future
everything is been out of for a while so
you can just try it on your own we also
have a bunch of tutorials and videos and
blogs and forum for questions if you go
to this website
and all the information is there and
that's all the time I had for today if
you have any questions because I need to
let everyone go I'll be here just come
back and ask your questions and I'll be
happy to answer them thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
