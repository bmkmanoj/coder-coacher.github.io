there are in the right session this is
that we change the title a little bit we
thought it will be more interesting to
show you how you can use nasaan to write
server-side applications yeah sorry I
speak a little softly so you in case
you're wondering what avatar is avatar
is a new project that we announced on
sunday it's it's an open source project
that that's been in the works for a
while and it was I'll show you the
Avatar website
so there is this project called avatar
java.net and one of its components is
avatar jas and you can find the link to
avatar ojs in related projects and this
is our website
and it has a list of modules that are
currently working by the way before
before I get into it how many people
here have no what no jess is just ugly
you're in the right place so essentially
avatar jess is an implementation of
node.js for the JVM you can you can run
node.js apps on the JVM while being able
to call into other Java API ice from
your JavaScript app from your node app
and i'll come back to the website later
on
note that this is a project in progress
it's not a product yet it's not finished
yet so I'll talk about what it is avatar
js what if its features ha and why would
you want to use it and give show you a
demo at the end so like I said it's an
open source project on java.net it was
just open sourced on Sunday it's a
server-side framework for the JVM which
can run not existing node applications
and it uses nasaan to power your app
basically run the JavaScript using
nasaan and it has some native code it
uses some libraries called Libya via
HTTP parser which node.js also uses and
we built Java bindings for those
libraries and this project uses them to
give you very compatible framework and
it since it's running on the JVM you
have the flexibility to call into any
Java API
the goal of project avatar avatar dajah
specifically is very simple to be able
to write enterprise applications in
JavaScript and the goal is to be
compatible with the node programming
model so that existing node applications
should run with little or no
modification so there is a caveat for
that that applications that use native
code will not run here because those
apps tend to have code that is specific
to Viet what we have done is we've taken
nodejs and remove VA and instead of viet
we use nasaan to run the JavaScript and
then another goal is to be able to use
existing Java EE API is in your avatar
applications so for example I'll show
you an example later on where we rebuild
a JavaScript wrapper for the JDBC API
and as you know the JDBC API it blocks
when when you when you call certain
methods on it and in the node
programming model it's not ok to ever
block the main thread so to show you how
we made it asynchronous so that you you
the longer the blocking method is called
in an asynchronously and when it
completes it calls a call back
some features some major features are
half a dodgers so the primary feature is
that should be able to run node
applications on the JVM and while doing
that you can call any Java API from your
JavaScript application that we get for
free by using NASA on another
interesting feature is that we can
support large heaps there is no
limitation on the size of your heap it's
whatever the JVM can do your application
can use all of it your JavaScript
application can use of all of it now
this multiple event loops this is an
interesting feature no Jess if you've
programmed with node.js you know that it
has any vent loop there is one single
event loop if you ever happen to block
that then your entire app grinds to a
halt here we have an interesting feature
where we support multiple event loops so
I'll talk about the next slide is is
goes into a little bit more detail about
that and not only multiple event loops
you can have multiple Java threads so
your your app if it has like background
things that it needs to do which are
computationally intensive it can fork
off java threads instead of in node you
will have to focus a process to do
computationally intensive tasks here you
can just do it in your in a thread which
is much simpler the thing to remember is
that multiple threads are for the Java
portion of your application your
JavaScript still remain single threaded
to keep the programming model very
simple so the application programmer
does not have to worry about
threads so multiple event loops what
happens here each each event loop will
runs in its own JavaScript context so it
has its own Global's essentially it
behaves as if it's independent of the
other threads and each event loop has a
global reference in the in the
JavaScript context so like a JavaScript
application can can look up its global
and find its event loop and post events
when it wants to post asynchronous tasks
or callbacks so this this has some
advantages because it improves your CPU
utilization you are you are using your
hardware and more efficiently you can
run multiple applications on the same
jvm multi-tenancy which improves density
which means you use less of RAM for
running the same amount of applications
multiple Java threads so as you know no
Jas is single threaded most applications
run in a single thread there except for
finals file i/o at this time but clear
since we are running on the JVM we can
can run CPU intensive tasks in
background threads making up we can also
use this feature to adapt synchronous
api's like the JDBC API and make them
asynchronous by putting them in a in a
background thread and when it finishes
then you post a call back to the event
you and I'll show you examples of how
that is done in the application again
the main point is that doing this in a
in a in a background thread is much
simpler than forking of child processes
and then communicating with them on on
pipes and passing Jason back and forth
so we have a demo that we that shows how
simple this is
so why would you use our audience and
not notice so would you would you
sabotage us if you have existing
investments in Java libraries and
middleware that you want to use in your
node application where or if you want to
take advantage of multiple cores or if
you were concerned about security so you
can apply the Java security model to
your node application say you want to
restrict access to some some feature
like say you want to access limit access
to the file system while the application
is running you you can easily do that
using a policy file and then if you're
comfortable with using Java tools like
visual vm and fight recorder and Mission
Control you can use these tools as is
with with these node applications which
are running on the JVM so what what
happens is your JavaScript application
gets converted to bytecode by NASA on
and then it's running on the JVM as any
other java application and so you can
observe it using these tools you can
manage it and then by if you are running
on the on the Java platform you have
access to a much richer set of API is
then node currently offers I just put
down some things that node does not have
at this time by running on the JVM you
get access to all of these features and
then there is
this interesting thing that it's our
implementation is very small it's right
now it's less than two Emmys and it can
run very nicely in an embedded
environment if you once you have it only
runs on jay decade so once you have java
SE eight embedded on in on a embedded
platform then you can run this thing
with an additional in an additional two
Meg's of sadak footprint and that's
pretty cool because then you can have
server-side applications / script
applications running on embedded
hardware I I did a demo last year of
this running on the Raspberry Pi runs
very nicely this is a slide on the
implementation how avatar jess is
implemented essentially what we did was
we created Java bindings for lib UV I'll
talk about lib UV in the next slide and
and nodes HTTP parser and then nodejs is
implemented as to JavaScript modules
each each module is implemented in two
parts there is a there is the module
itself and then there is a corresponding
underscore wrap that up is what calls
into platform and another javascript
engine specific API is so what we did
was we reimplemented the wrap and and
that now calls into libya V and HTTP
parser bindings and and other Java
platform api is so the approach has been
to use node modules unmad unmodified as
much as possible so that so that we can
easily upgrade to future drafts as as
they are released no jess is a very
questions at the end no jess is a very
dynamic project moves very fast so to
keep up with changes coming in
we try to minimize the changes that we
make to node sources and then we test
our implementation with node unit tests
oh I have a slide on status later on
with that I'll talk about how many tests
we pass and there are some cases where
some small patches unavoidable so what
is liberally loop UV is is a
cross-platform asynchronous i/o library
that node.js itself is built upon so
this it's a library regnancy and it it's
the porting layer for node.js this is
what enables node.js to run on multiple
platforms and this it features very low
level platform level things like sockets
pipes UDP DNS all of this for child
processes for work exact so what what we
did was we created a java api for libya
we using jni and we are calling this
libya vita dash java and this is the
binding used by avatar jeaious to call
into so whenever it needs a socket it
calls into la bewbies socket API and
this the source code for Libya v dash
Java is also in the git repo on Avatar
j/s and i'll show you the link on the
website later same thing there's another
library used by nodejs it's called HTTP
parser it's a synchronous HTTP parser
that's very fast very efficient you give
it
a buffer which contains the raw bytes
from the network and then as it passes
that it it will call you back and we
created bindings in Java for this API
and we use this to parse HTTP content
same as same as node so any savvy be so
we essentially we become bug for bug
compatible another feature we have is
the third package manager which is which
is based on NPM the node package manager
and it offers the same functionality
that NPM does you can download install
search and publish modules it interacts
with NPM Jay has taught at this time
later on we might enhance it to interact
with other module registries as they
come so this is the saddest light as of
September this month we are compatible
with the latest node stable release
which is 1018 and you saw the list of
modules that are working on the honor
project home page most of the modules
are using javascript sources from nodejs
and as is unmodified but some have been
modified to use java api ice buffer for
example is rewritten to use java niño
byte buffer because we thought that
would be more efficient and it does job
is better it does show better benchmarks
similarly file system is using the java
niño file system API at this time
crypto is using Java security dns
using java.net and Java X not naming
timers is using the scheduled executor
which is actually very fast it's very
precise much better than the node timer
and z lab is using Java X dot zip
package at this time we might we might
change the implementation to be more
compatible if necessary so the bottom
line is that as of this release there
are 584 unit tests in node.js and we
pass eighty percent of those at this
time and some tests are patched slightly
to work with without because like I said
our timers are more precise so they fire
with with low latency and that then some
tests are very sensitive to timing so we
have to add just timings a little bit
you can go to the website and see what
the patches are and another interesting
thing is that the JVM has the startup is
a little bit slow because hotspot first
observes where the applications
bottlenecks are and then it tries to
optimize them so some tests initially I
we have to increase the timeout i
expanded status on the status of modules
here is a list of modules that we have
tested and some of the popular ones I
mean they'll be a lot more that way that
we haven't tested that we don't know if
we were if they work or not but these
these are the popular ones that we
tested and we know that they work some
of them require a small patch because of
some differences some small differences
the patches are on
right actually so you can see what the
changes i'll show you in a minute and
some modules are not yet working when
popular one is like CoffeeScript it
doesn't work yet so here is some work
that we plan to do after java one and
when it was highlight that contributions
are very welcome here because you saw
our status is still eighty percent
complete we need we need to get two
hundred percent and and help is welcome
so you want to improve compatibility in
for file system so file system is
interesting because it behaves the java
file system API is behave differently on
on windows as compared to the other
unisys and so we end up failing some
tests on Windows then we have to miss we
have to implement some missing features
we haven't implemented domains for
example and some modules have not been
implemented some of some of this work is
very easy if you want to jump in and
implement Drupal for example just go
ahead you the sources out there and then
there are big changes coming as node.js
prepares for their bonded or release and
we will need to sync with them as as
they release
look before the demo let me go back to
the website so see here this is our
website and we have the list of modules
that are known to work here and the
patches as as you can see some of them
the patches are really trivial like NASA
on doesn't support const yet so in this
module you just have to replace cons to
it where and this module uses you have
to just increase the timeout a little
bit okay if you go to the contribute
page you there are several ways you can
contribute we have our sources in git
repo and there are three different
Reapers one for libel UV java one for
HTTP parser java and 14 of da Jas itself
and there are milling guests so users if
you if you are a user of avatari you
want to subscribe to users list and you
can file issues by either emailing or
going to our issue tracker it directly
and you can go here and and file a bug
if find one
sorry
okay the demo so some of our team
members wrote wrote a very nice demo
that is a photo uploader to show
capabilities of avatar guess it uses
some of the more popular node modules
Express socket i/o gene and it combines
them with some Java api's jdbc to store
the images in the database and the image
i owe a pi/2 to downscale the image into
a thumbnail now rescaling this the
scaling is very CPU intensive so if you
were to write this application using
pure node.js that recommendation is to
do the rescaling in a in a subprocess
because you don't want to block the
thread while when the cpu is crunching
the image and making it smaller and to
this I'll show you the source this this
is an example of how you can use a
background thread to do this so let me
show you the demo first and then I'll
show you some snippets of the source
code sorry
okay so this is an image uploaded this
is where you can download upload your
friends I have some images I just drag
and drop them I don't want to talk like
sorry I'm not that comfortable I don't
have a mouse that's the problem okay
here c-can i can drop here this this
interface is you've done using a nice
library called rob zone and when we
click upload you'll see all of these
images being rescaled and being stored
in a database so here is another client
which which is connected to the
thumbnails page and and socket i/o is
used to notify the thumbnails page as
images get uploaded so I see each image
shows you it's progress and then there
is an overall progress and images show
up as they get uploaded okay
and then you can add tags we also show
up here so that is that is the demo of a
very simple demo what we just took a few
days to write this demo just to show
what is possible because we are platform
engineers we don't get to write apps we
don't get to have any fun
this is the JavaScript Apple for jdbc
API if you are familiar with the JDBC
API you'll see it's really easy to call
into it purely from JavaScript there is
no java code in this application so an
object called connection was created
which has create statement and then
which returns the statement and then
statement has methods to execute your
sequel and then there is a utility
method which converts the results at one
once that is available so execute has
this callback so when when result
execute is is actually the blocking call
so execute is called and when when
results arrive then this callback is
called with your results and this two
were a method converts the the Java
result set into a into an array of
JavaScript objects whose keys are taken
from the metadata so here is one how you
would use it like this just finds all
images so you create statement and
execute that sequel and passing in a
call back the callback simply converts
it to a JavaScript array
it is another example of using that API
this is the API this is a method to save
the images to database so it takes a
prepared statement and then sets its
first variable to the file name of the
image and the second one to the image
bytes itself and then it simply sticks
them in the database and this this this
this pain callback is is the application
called back
this is
um
this is the this is how the image is
downscaled in a in a background thread
so you create a runnable and this is I
don't know if you've attended one of the
NASA on sessions this is how you
implement interfaces Java interfaces in
Java Script using this kind of syntax so
essentially this is a runnable that's
that's written in JavaScript but it then
gets past this event loop dot submit is
a is a java method so you pass some
javascript to java method that expects
an interface and when and then it
executes sit in a in a thread loop in in
in an executor and in then we scale your
image in the background and I didn't
have space in the slide for for calling
the callback itself when when when this
run function completes it it then calls
the callback that's how you know that
the image resizing is coupled and this
is all I have this is the project URL
and location of the mailing list and our
issue tracker and our source repo
but once if you remember after dot
java.net this is all accessible from
that page thank you it can we can take
questions yes
motion
yes yes yes yeah yeah thanks for
pointing that out yes you can simply put
take this function let me show you I can
do it in real time so essentially this
becomes like this
okay any other question yeah
on what kind of the no-nos on is our
scripting engine which is replacing
ryndam in jdk 8 into a fight so in java
6 and 7 you so far you've had Rhino as
as a JavaScript engine for scripting
Java in eight it's being replaced with
NASA on and Nassau and is much faster
than 90 sorry I can't difference between
rhino and a sauna gym is here he is the
project lead for NASA on do you wanna
come up in knots
it was lazy
teacher
and
a lot of features
if people are interested I can show some
more demos yeah
is it something that
debug debugging is not it's not there
yet but when one's nasaan supports
debugging we we will also it'll just
work with with avatar JS also because
it's all java code so essentially you
should be able to use it's not
implemented yet but once it is you
should be able to use your existing ide
to step through javascript
again that's a question for Jim how is
the performers
so the big thing to see here is the fact
that
for
still single
it's the same as Nigeria you just start
multiple JVMs like for example the
cluster module works like that it just
folks multiple processors and it works
the same here it will folk multiple JVMs
if you use the cluster module that's in
node.js you to work on arm you need a
special build of the JDK so you need
java SE embedded forearm yes and then
since we also have some native code you
will need to compile that forearm you
need to cross compile it the Java code
obviously both will work asses
any other question do you want to see
some more demos so like like you know
with you done I have this this is the
node hello app and you run a bit node
and the app itself with with avocado
Jess you run it with your like any other
job application you run it with a pass
it in the jar and
so now you have it running
and there you have it
so one thing is like you have to also
set your path to include the native
libraries or put them somewhere in your
path
coming back to hear this is
so that's that's all I have I'm on a
question sorry will the script container
be part of glassfish I don't know we
have our p.m. here John you can answer
that
right on works
best application so it's up to you
whatever you like if you have a hybrid
application that that needs to call into
Java API is but you want to write most
of the application in JavaScript then
this is a great platform there is I
think nothing else like it but if your
application is written one hundred
percent in JavaScript and it does not
call into any Java API then you might as
well stick to node.js there's no need to
justice unless you want the
manageability features on the security
or some other feature of the Java
platform
ok
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
