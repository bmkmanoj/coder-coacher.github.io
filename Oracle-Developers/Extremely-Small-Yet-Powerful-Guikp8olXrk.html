is Arturo pilipenko i am from IOT
organization at oracle and i am working
on cldc virtual machine that's a vm for
Java ME embedded platform and today I am
going to tell you about one of the
features of our platform and our vm
which helps us to be extremely small but
yet powerful what is a Java ME embedded
in a few words that's a Java platform
for small embedded devices and typical
devices for our platform where those
models smart sensors smart meters and
other small embedded devices and in this
market footprint matters usually
customers have a high volume of devices
and one dollar saved on each device give
them a lot of my that is why they want
these devices to be as cheap as possible
and as small as possible and we are
doing a pretty good job here to run full
standard configuration of our platform
we need about 700 case of ram and two
Meg's or from our platform is highly
modular and we can exclude some optional
or unnecessary parts to get smaller and
we do this for example for embeds k 64
we've just released an early access of
me8 dot one for this board and on this
board we have only 256 case of ram and
one meg of Rome that is good but there
are a lot of devices which are smaller
than that for example there is an embed
board with 32 case of ram and one half
max of Rome the question is can we bring
Java to these platforms and the simple
answer is yes and I'm going to tell you
how we are going to do this and there
are two interesting things about extra
small devices which will help us
first thing is that usually there is no
need to execute arbitrary application on
such a small device it's either one
single application for a single use case
or few applications for a few modes of
operation and another thing is that
typical application barely makes use all
the functionality of a software platform
we can use these two things to address
extra small devices we can deploy
predefined applications and strip all
and use functionality the idea is quite
simple standard Java platform is an open
world platform it means that you can
execute arbitrary application and that
requires to keep all the API according
to public specification present on the
device and there is another approach the
opposite approach closed world model
when we when we know our target
application in advance at Build time and
no other applications can be deployed
dynamically you can still change your
field where but you can load it
dynamically and in this case there is no
need to keep all the api's on the device
we can only keep api's and functionality
which is required for our target
applications and we use this closed
world model for our closed water
dripping feature which we use to address
extra small devices and this feature
looks as follows you write your
application using all the api's and
functionality you need after that use
special tool which bundles your
application with full specification
compliant runtime after that this tool
eliminates all unnecessary parts of the
runtime and application and the
resulting binary is deployed to the
device and used parts of the
binary includes unused Java code of
application and used Java and native
code of system libraries and even parts
of the vm for example we can eliminate
some bytecode support we eliminate claus
lauter we eliminate class verifier and
dynamic compiler and implementation of
our closed world stripping is based on
rome ization functionality or anization
is a well-known technique to embed
glasses into the vm at Build time and
we've been using this feature for years
to optimize and to embed system classes
to our binaries and we can simply add
application classes and we will get a
single binary which contains all you
need it works as follows reminder
converts classes into rome image CPP
this file is compiled then and linked
with the vm promisor is a special host
version of the virtual machine mizer is
built from the same sources as a target
virtual machine and it loads classes on
a host performs various optimizations
for speed and size and after that it
saves heap States saves heap image as a
bunch of C erase it separates mutable
and immutable data so immutable data
including including code goes to Rome
and mutable data is copied to vm heap at
startup it helps us to save ram because
when we Lord classes dynamically we need
to keep all the code and metadata in RAM
and in this case immutable parts are
stored in a room that is good
that's a diagram of our stripping
process it goes from left to right and
it starts with your application which is
past 20 mizer along with system classes
or mother miser produces wrong image CPP
for these classes after that we compile
this rom HTTP and we compile runtime
native sources and get some library we
link this binary with other platform or
runtime libraries and get the resulting
binary and two main steps here our room
is a shin and linking atomization stage
we eliminate all unused Java parts we
eliminate classes methods fields and so
on and we rely on linker to eliminate
unused native things so it's kind of two
step process that's the list of major
optimizations we perform during Roma's
ation and we do these optimizations in
both open and world mode open worlds
models but closed world model provides
more opportunities for these
optimizations and these three
optimizations are most beneficial for
footprint reduction in closed world
model and we will discuss them later
there are three ways to control our
miser optimizations we can use common
line options to include or exclude to
enable or disable optimizations globally
we can use configuration files to select
optimizations for specific objects and
we can use Java annotations for the same
purpose essentially they are converted
to configuration files at Build time but
jam annotations are more convenient in
most cases but less flexible for example
no but imagine for object selection in
Java notations but it's supported in
configuration files well that's the core
optimization in closed waters dripping
unreachable method elimination here we
need to figure out which methods can be
actually executed during program
execution and we need to eliminate
remaining methods to understand which
methods can be executed we built method
invocation closure we do this
recursively starting from application
entry points and some other methods
required for application lifecycle and
for each method with scan byte codes and
look for invoke byte codes and all
methods which can be invoked using these
byte codes are included to closure and
scanned again once finished we can
simply remove methods which are not
enclosure so it sounds simple but there
is interesting thing what should we do
with indirect in locations there are two
byte codes invoke visual and invoke
interface which uses receiver type in
runtime to determine which methods will
be invoked but during static analysis we
have no information about runtime
objects and we need to to do something
with this ok we can conservatively
estimate set of possible types at each
call side and include corresponding
methods there are several ways to do
this one of the simplest ways is class
araki analysis using this approach we
assume that every subtype of declared
type can appear at a call side for
example
if you have invocation of two string
method on the variable of object type
class hierarchy analysis will assume
that any two string methods can be
involved it will assume that any class
in object era he can appear at this call
side so any two string method will be
included we can we can notice that if
some object is never instantiated there
are no new byte codes for for the class
objects of this type could not be used
for method invocation there is the
approach called rapid type analysis and
it's narrows down class araki analysis
to instantiate a subset of reachable
classes and we use this approach I need
to see that there are more precise
approaches for example we need we can do
a dataflow analysis to determine types
for each variable for each call side it
will be more precise but it won't give
it won't increase it won't reduce the
amount of reachable methods actually
it's shown in various research papers
that it's it's not that it's not very
good for reducing sighs it's good for
another things well when we when we
analyze methods we not only scan for
invoke byte codes we actually scan for
new byte codes and we keep two sets one
set is a set of indirect invitations and
another set is a set of instantiate
classes and when we notice that some
class became instable we add all
corresponding
lots of this class which can be executed
via executions of methods from indirect
and locations it is it clear or need to
add something well that is this
algorithm is continued until a fixed
point is reached and actually it's quite
fast and precise algorithm to build
method invocation closure and this is a
comparison of class hierarchy analysis
and rapid type analysis it's quite a
good style to use some general type or
interface so you can simply add you
change your implementation without
changing your code here for example we
have a variable of type list of
interface type instead of a specific
ArrayList type that's good for
flexibility but it complicates our
analysis for example class alert energy
analysis in this case will include all
the implementations of add methods from
all the leads it will include ad from
linked list from arraylist and so on but
rapid type analysis is more smart it
will notice that we created we
instantiate only array list and it will
include only array list add method once
we know which methods can be actually
executed during program execution we can
understand which fields are used by
these methods we scan byte codes of
reachable methods for byte codes which
access fields we mark fields which I
used and once finished we can remove
unmarked fields there is a special
handling of unreadable fields of
primitive types that's quite common
scenario when we have
some field initialized at constructor or
static initializer but this field is
never read after that usually it happens
because we eliminated some method which
uses this field but we still have write
access for this field and actually it's
safe to eliminate this field as well and
that is why for primitive types we mark
fields only by readings so if we see put
field bytecode we don't mark this field
one may ask why can't we do the same for
object fields and that's a tricky thing
object field may contain reference to
finalize objected writing this reference
to a field may prevent a garbage
collector from elimination of this
object and if we remove this field
object may become unreachable and will
be collected finalized finalizar will be
executed and will change application
behavior we want to do we won't do this
and once again we know methods which can
be actually executed and we can
understand which classes are used by
these methods there are a lot of usages
for classes that static usages
instantiation instance of different
castes and code exception classes and so
on we mark all the classes by this
usages and we remove classes which are
not marked well at this point we have
eliminated and used methods classes and
fields what cat want what else can we do
and also we can rename this this classes
methoden fields because we don't need
names anymore needs symbolic names are
used by GBM for
or runtime linking when you load some
class and this class has a reference to
some methods you need to keep symbolic
names for classes and fields to to be
able to link it in runtime but enclosed
waddle configuration everything is
already in place and we don't need this
symbolic information well there are some
exceptions for example class.forname
goals requires names but in general we
don't need this and we can just rename
all methods fields and classes and
eliminate and used symbols there is one
consequence it may complicate debugging
that's a stack trace where exception was
renamed you can see only class ID for
exception where methods and classes were
renamed as well it's not very useful
stack trace what can you do you can turn
this optimization of by command line
option and you also can use distributed
dueling architecture there is a session
I guess it's 3pm about this architecture
and in a few words we have proxy which
contains all the buggin information and
when you want some debug information
about the device you don't connect to
the device you connect to the proxy and
get information there so we then there
is no need to keep debug information on
the device it also helps us to save some
some space well what if some native
methods or part became unreachable in
this case visor will eliminate all
references to this method and we hope
that our of limb killer will remove
unreachable native parts and linker must
be smart enough to do the
probably need to pass some arguments to
the linker for example for GCC you need
to ask your compiler to put your
functions and data into separate
sections and after that you need to ask
your linker to remove unused sections as
I mentioned before we also can remove
some parts of the GBM and we use static
modularity to manually exclude things
like dynamic compiler class loader class
verifier actually we can turn dynamic
compilation on but usually on an extra
small device there is no need to do this
and aut compilation is still possible we
can recompile some methods but it also
affects your footprint because compiled
methods are usually bigger than Java
methods so we usually don't need to do
this when you are wrestles constrained
we also can eliminate unused byte codes
automatically for example if your
application doesn't use flood pointer of
maddox corresponding byte codes will be
eliminated and corresponding native
functions can be eliminated by smart
linker as well unfortunately there are
some limitations of the analysis we
can't analyze all the dependences
automatically for example reflexive
goals like class.forname cannot be
analyzed automatically access from
native to Java cannot be analyzed but we
still need to have this dependencies we
still need to know about these
dependences and the question is how we
can do this
some of the dependences are already
built in 20 miser for example it knows
that the vm looks up main methods by
name and sarah miser never names main
methods with corresponding signature but
other dependencies have to be declared
manually using either by configuration
file or Java code annotations I
mentioned at the beginning and that's an
example of annotations and corresponding
directive in a configuration file we
have two types of annotations don't
remove and don't rename don't rename
annotation also prevents a removal of a
class field a method and we can apply
this annotations to classes fields and
methods so we have six types of
annotations or directives in
configuration file well that is good but
usually we don't want to remove method
field or class because some other method
uses this field method or class but all
what if this method becomes unreachable
we no longer need to keep dependencies
probably it's not so important for
application code because usually you
don't have a lot of unreachable methods
and classes in your application but it's
very important for our system classes
because we have a lot of dependencies
and we want to analyze them precisely so
if we will apply unconditional
annotations or directives to our classes
all the glasses mentioned in
configuration file will be included even
in a simplest application even a hello
world will have dozens of unnecessary
classes
that is why we need some some way to
specify local dependency for a method
and we do have to have a mean to do this
that is an example of annotation for
local dependences this annotations have
arguments which is a array of strings
array of full qualified names of fields
methods or classes and these annotations
are converted to the following syntax in
configuration file we have blocks which
start with method and name of the method
and end with n methods inside of this
blog we contain our standards directives
we won when you are converting your
application you want to know what what
happens which optimizations were applied
why they were applied and and so on and
reminder also produces rom log txt file
that's a human readable file containing
useful statistics and detailed logs for
optimizations and now I'm going to show
you a demo on how analysis works how can
you read a rom log.txt so let's let's
try
let's start with simplest application
that's a hello world hello closed world
save it and try compiling and building a
closed world binary for this
successfully compiled remise and now
linked into a binary and look at this
line that's a total size of your Rome
image it contains your java parts and it
doesn't include native parts it doesn't
include native parts of system classes
and the vm and for hello world
application we have about 11 kilobytes
in rome image let's add something in our
application and see what we will get for
example let's add just instantiation of
hash map
compile and build it again and see the
total size it's one about one kilobyte
bigger above 12 kilobytes we can also
check that it actually works example we
can run this binary test is the name of
our class with main method yeah it works
now we want to understand which makes
what makes the difference and to do this
let's look at our lumber arum log files
what nurse
here we have our Rome log files on the
left side we have hello world Rome log
on the right side we have real world
plus map Rome log and at the beginning
we have the table with statistics about
how many classes we have how many
methods and other objects you can see
that in a hello world application we
have only 38 classes and in hello world
plus map application we have 43 classes
so five more classes were included
during our analysis let's go to class
hierarchy section to see which classes
were actually added that is class
hierarchy section we have object string
and a couple of more classes you can see
what's what we actually need for for our
hello world application you can see that
most of them were renamed or we also
have a hello world class here and you
can see in another room log that's
instantiation of hashmap requires random
class for some reason abstract map hash
map map simple entry hash map entry
quite reasonable well let's try to to do
something with this map for example
let's try to put something inside this
map
save it compile this is a difference now
it takes 18 kilobytes one single line
makes fifty percent increase of your
Rome image size let's check Rome logs to
see what was changed again on a left
side we have hello world plus map on the
right side we have hello world plus map
plus put and we can see that hello world
plus map has 43 classes and one single
line makes it 60 classes let's go to
classes here RQ section to see this is a
difference and our analysis decides that
invocation of boot methods requires
several exceptions it also adds abstract
collection abstract set and entry set
that's part of hash map implementation
it also adds a race and iterator for for
the hash map you can see that more
interfaces have implementation here and
now i am going to to add one more line
i'm going to get value I don't care
about returns value but just add
invocation and guess what we will get
here
okay let's try
well and you can see that it's almost
the same let's go to Rome logs and see
what what happened you can see that
total class file size changed well we
added one line we added several byte
codes that's okay and in a statistics
you can see that the only difference
between put and put gas versions is size
of methods the it's easy to understand
we just added several byte codes but
let's let's look at another section of
Rome log file section with discovered
reachable methods in this section we
have information about our analysis
starts here and it contains information
about analyzed methods it contains
information about our method invocation
closure so you can see that analysis
start twist thread init method and this
method object in it was called thread in
it was called and so on and so on we
also have information about field
accesses here it is and as I mentioned
before we need special handling for in
directing locations for invoke interface
and invoke virtual and we have this
information but you can see that we
don't just continue our analysis here
for unrunnable run method we add this
method to indirect and location set
after that this method will be promoted
when some instance able classes appear
well we can see that hashmap get in a
second case was promoted using virtual
invocation but in the first on the other
side we also have hashmap get method but
it was promote promoted via interface in
location let's figure out why why do we
need a hashmap get in application where
we don't call yet you can look at
another method you can look at abstract
map equals method and you can see that
it has in invoke interface bytecode for
map yet and actually abstract map equals
just compares two maps by iterating all
those elements and comparing that they
are equal so it's compares elements that
is why it need get method here but why
do we need equals method let's go to our
test main method and here we have our
hash map Putin location here we also can
see that hashmap put has virtual
invocation of object equals method its
uses object equals to determine that key
is already in map and it calls equals
this invocation was promoted for all
instance able classes including hashmap
class so our analysis realized that we
can try to use hash map as a key that
will require
equal skull on a hashmap and this equals
call on a hashmap will require two to
iterate over map elements and will
require to call get on our hash map so
sub 10 sometimes and it's hard to
predict the resulting binary sighs it's
hard to predict what will will be
included or or not and rome log actually
helps to to understand what's going on
let's get back to slides here we have
here we have a slide with some numbers
we have three applications three cldc
applications and I measured footprint in
open-world model and enclosed world of
model an open-world model static
footprint is the size of the run time
required to execute application and size
of the jar file of the application so
it's compressed size first application
is a hello world second is en bici
benchmark that's a suit of benchmarks
for cldc implementations contains a lot
of code and the third one is simple
tracked robot demo I guess we showed
this demo on last jello one here and for
hello world size of the runtime is about
210 kilobytes that includes application
which is tiny in this case and we need
about twenty five kilobytes of RAM to
execute this smallest application you
can imagine when we build it in a closed
world model it is 55 kilobytes of RAM
and it requires only six kilobytes of
fifty four kilobytes are from and six
kilobytes of RAM that's an example of
how we can save RAM footprint converting
and play linking classes at Build time
so 25 kilobytes is memory required to
load application classes to store all
the internal representation and metadata
in RAM to execute this closed world all
sizes are about one quarter of an open
world in NBC case numbers are not so
impressing closed world static size is
sixty percent sixty percent and dynamic
is seventy-six percent and in simple
tracked robots we have sixty eight
percent of static footprint reduction
and sixty-six percent of dynamic
footprint reduction to remember and bad
bored I mentioned on one of the first
slides actually this demo runs on the
board with 32 case of RAM and half
maxell from this functionality was
released at me8 and in first release you
have some limitations first of all
stripping is supported for cldc
applications only for now it's not
possible to strip full stack
applications unfortunately but we are
working on it and another important
thing is that for now this functionality
is available for OGP I customers only
these customers have access to our
native sources they know how to build
our stack they usually port our stat to
their platform and they can also get a
closed world binary the reason for this
limitation
is that we now we need to recompile our
native sources to get a closed world
binary and another reason is that when
you build your application for a
specific target you need specific tool
chain I mean some parts of some
libraries are built with specific tool
chain and you need other parts to be
built with the tool chain and it's hard
to to make sure that and user will use
the same tool chain the same version
will use the same build flags that's
that is why we need to to have this
limitation and as a conclusion closed
ward stripping is a powerful mechanism
to reduce static and dynamic footprint
it's an extreme case of static
modularity when your granularity is
single field method or class and in some
cases it may require assistance from
application developer for example when
you use some reflexive calls you need to
annotate your code correspondingly
otherwise it won't work and it's also
difficult to predict the resulting
binary as I shout in a demo and this can
be important for example you have some
application you use closed world
stripping to get a binary and you want
to add something to your application you
already have your hardware platform and
you add few lines to your application
and you no longer fit to your hardware
and that's that is hard to predict and
another
thing about this dripping that's may
complicate the bugging but actually it's
similar to high optimization level in
compilers when you compile your native
application with the highest level of
preemies ations you can debug it you the
only thing you can do is trust your
compiler that it has no box and that
your application works as expected here
we here we have some controls to turn on
and off optimizations but in general
it's you need to trust it our tool works
well that's it and I'm ready to answer
your questions
yeah d all rights your hash map in in
your class files one-half information
about generic types that is why our
analysis one won't get benefit from from
generic but data flow analysis can help
here in the first well actually we have
we have we have time and we can try
tries application without without
printing for example well i'm going to
ask several questions and if that i can
show showing as a demo and I mean social
and as a another example if youÃ­ve some
you want it there wasn't another
question
well it's helps to save save footprints
we don't need separate names we just
need only one symbol and we well you're
right we're it's it's a way to do this
but actually we are we have the same
code for open and closed world models
and actually we can have an open world
model we also rename some symbols in
this case we have some classes i renamed
some classes are not and we have just
internal structure of classes are the
same so they have linked to a symbol and
too it's easy to set this link to one
symbol for renamed classes feels so on
yep
for se well in theory we can use this
approach but actually remise er is is
me2 lat and it cannot be used with se
because remise er is a vm itself its vm
with some additional native code so to
do the same for se you need to write
special amaizing for hotspot to do this
but algorithms are applicable for sure
but as far as I know they have no use
cases for closed world and they are not
going to do this more questions yep well
actually native methods tend to be
bigger than Java methods because in java
bytecodes you do a lot of work in a
single byte code and when you compile
for example your compiled method is
usually bigger so i'm not sure that
writing something in native will will
give some benefits my map
single instance of that okay ultima is
away a lot of the complexity that you
need in order to stay all the variants
of that in our because you hold direct
your classes and invitations it still
don't really need
in most cases in two
and what's the proposal well what are
you proposed
another compilation it is a combination
well I yeah I see a yes yeah it's it can
be used but we need to to try and
measure whether it will give good
results or not I can say that we have
CLD c 1 1 dot 1 and we have CL dc-8
updated specification and in sale dc-8
we have more abstract classes I mean
abstract math abstract collection and so
on and hello world application and other
applications are bigger in CL dc-8 just
because we have more as super classes
actually we don't need them but they are
in spec and our analysis can't eliminate
them so it maybe it's a good idea to to
have some optimized class hierarchy to
start from because complexity of class
hierarchy some complexity could not
cannot be eliminated by this analysis
yes we we do this we it's called
bytecode quickening when we have virtual
invocation and we know that there is
only one implementer of all the method
we will change invoke virtual to a
static invoke and you can see it i will
i will show you can see it in a rom log
for example here we have a lot of static
in vacations without without invoke
virtual or invoke interface actually
they invoke virtuals and invoke
interfaces but in this class are our key
we realized that there is only one
implementer for each method we replaced
virtual invocation to a static
invocation and have have this we have
four or five or six minutes I can try to
to convert another one I ok application
for example where we can try and do
something like this
well here we have 11 tool bites let's
compare roblox well for some reason we
don't have less classes here we have and
I know why do I mention that we have
hello world class in a image and this
hello world calls system.out.println
actually this one so like I can't
eliminate it because it's in it's part
of system classes actually I can't do
