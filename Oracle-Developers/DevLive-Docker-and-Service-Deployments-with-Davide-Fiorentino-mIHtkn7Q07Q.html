Oracle code London think we're getting
the bell here to say dinner's over
our lunch is over too early for dinner
but I just want to welcome everyone back
I've got your host Javed Mohammed and I
have with us David Sloan keynote David
you want to give us a little money savvy
yeah
please give us a little of background
about yourself oh that's a memory all
your life in 30 seconds I'm gonna add a
little bit more
I'm leaving in Cameron jam waiting for
the third Keith I don't know if it's
either boy or girl
Oh congratulations thank you ha ha so
where you from Italy from Italy my wife
is from Mexico oh wow okay so I'm
speaking two languages for a nice oh
yeah I'm moved
UK going to give them better Rockets
yeah so there we go we are here I'm
working now for companies remaining for
a company that is working for
intellectual property to fight
intellectual for crostini arrangement so
we're going to get into the main theme
of you so you're giving a presentation
today at the article code yeah what's
the theme of that it was about docker
and micro services so how to avoid the
common mistakes some paints how to
improve the way to this dr. Tom story
about oh definit okay so can you give us
a little kind of a preview to what are
some of the common mistakes to avoid
when implementing darker one of the
micro services the worse thing is that
before trying to do to be damaging in
the containers or it's that if that
container should be the image we just
something that it brings the little
piece of wood you want but it's very
specialized but people try to put
everything in the container an image so
actually they're just replicating what
you used to do with this validation is
not the same thing so you are going out
of the scope of so it's not a catch-all
is easier to keep it keep it specific
for
whatever yeah functional service you
trying to do exactly many if you want to
add something more you just start that
on top of that image that's benefit all
using the images uh-huh so you can get a
lot of specialized con images and then
you can put it all together in a hormone
not writing as services so you have to
do to be a bit pay some attention but
then you can have a very strong service
and you can reuse everything so you're
not save wasting space as well but then
I can be an image can be a wool
application can be 10 K kilobytes and
having everything that you really need
so I nearly nowadays supership an
application large application on a
floppy disk on a on a floppy disk or the
flesh there's nobody I don't know I
don't know if any of our viewers
especially the young developers will
know what a floppy disk is but well
let's suffice it for it to say that if
you can get it very small at a darker
image can be you know if you hundred
kilobytes or a megabyte or whatever okay
I also know this and if this is
something really relating to your topic
if your your topic title or your
presentation related to you UN doing a
practical guide to doctor and service
development UN against poverty and
hunger and I thought whoa yeah well how
does that factor into it it's well
actually I working on a couple projects
one was to provide to give someone with
the info gave or banks to give some
money to work countries for our project
so actually to let them be in the sunset
sucker for the support plate systems
like them to it is their way of living
but also avoiding the corruption or
people stealing money so the application
was dealing or there'll be stuff for
people got money they had need to
provide report so how they spend money
and then they improved actually in their
life and there were some checks in the
application of the check that you are
not feeling or I earn money somewhere
so this is a software that checks checks
just get some checks and balances in
there not a lot of stuff
I've done of that window if you're Food
and Agriculture Organization United
Nations uh-huh so actually something yet
not a lot of stuff roughly is just the
hosting for the loans that you get ok so
just making sure that if if the UN is
giving loans out they being used
properly and not being you know put into
people's pockets whether well whether
they don't belong yeah exactly
and uh for some projects for another if
you project that's fine
come on ok so uh what do you think of
London for a person from Italy woody
what do you like about London because I
heard in Italy the food is very good the
weather is very good so there must be
something you like about London - what
actually says something that is like
that it's political about the Italian
government so it's not something
someplace where you can feel confident
that you will earn enough money and hurt
people to be honest an Italian will not
have plans we have three kids and while
here I think that I can grow them did
you like any British food ok I think I
think you answer that question right
there Asian ships yeah ok but we you
know the official I heard the national
food for England is chicken tikka masala
DeHaven oh I don't know so either way
fish and chips or chicken tikka masala
check it out ok ok
and you've done your presentation or is
it upcoming in two thousand island you'd
already done ok then so I think some of
them are recorded so hopefully you can
check it out and thank you for once
again for joining us Daniel okay thank
you and tune in for another
articles of life which will be coming
your way shortly okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
