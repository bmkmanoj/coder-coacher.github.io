4 jun 1 2014 how many people have been
in the script before you know the drill
okay meet you yeah well original this
Caleb we have racks as the moderator
unfortunately he couldn't make it my
name is Andrew song i am a java champion
bella is not important what is important
are this one uses right here on stage
these guys their job today is to
showcase their particular language they
want the language they are championing
and finally move you into trying one of
these languages at the end of the
session we'll have time for questions we
will go for when I first round three
minutes each they would show what the
language can do and you go for the
second round six minutes when they will
do the best they can to showcase why
their language is the best one then we
work out for questions and finally we do
the boating so how many claps we get
will determine the winner of this
crippled for this year clear perfect so
let's get it started we will begin with
groovy then we switch to jruby closure
and scar so please gentlemen introduce
yourselves and then we will go so hello
everybody I'm guiana phones I'm the
leader of the group project I've been
working on three for more than 10 years
now hold introductions yeah yep I'm our
Tyler croix I'm part of the JRuby
community we've been using JRuby where I
work for about three or four years
migrating from Ruby to a higher
performance vm so pretty happy to be
here I am Priya Tom and I have been a
Java developer for 12 years now fairly
near the closure and I've been doing it
for less than two years closer and
closer script and I'm an independent
consultant I'm Ryan Knight I've been
doing Java development for 15 years and
Scala for two years I now work for
typesafe which is the company behind
Scala so I do a training and consulting
for them around Scala all right so let's
begin with proving a young
five minutes okay thank you so you know
giri's are pretty agile language you see
the kind of stuff you can do with a
using grooving right so for this first
round I'd like to excuse me I'd like to
cover two new things that are here in
greet 23 the recent release and 2 dot
for the upcoming race so that the
android support coming in 24 and traits
in a groovy 23 so few words about the
android support so it's pretty new and
there are some very interesting links
there if you want to learn more about it
because i'm not going to dive too deep
into it but i'd like to mention that
just this summer that the the New York
Times which announced that they are
switching to groovy and RX Java for
creating reactive applications and so
this is the the blog post where they
talk about it and they were showing some
examples like with Android you've got
tons of anonymous inner classes
everywhere oh sorry just for doing
something simple as written returning
some value in this example from their
blog post and when you go to groovy with
the fact that it's called closures you
can write much more concise code and can
get rid of tons of anonymous anonymous
in our classes so it's just one little
aspect of it all but they were really
selling their choice of groovy by saying
that it made the code much more concise
more readable and gory can be asked type
safe and us so no pun intended and as
fast as needed thanks to the new chance
of the recent transformations like type
checked and compiled static and well we
can find some examples of that with a an
open source application and the other
feature i wanted to mention that's
traits so it's a bit like interfaces but
with method bodies it's close to Java 8
interface default methods but they are
not supposed to be used for traits it's
a nice way of composing behavior and our
traits are also stateful and it works
very well with our static features and
just to show you some examples here I've
got a trait representing the flying
ability so something that can file it
looks like an interface but with a
method body a bird can implement that
trade you can create the bird and then
the bird inherits from that behavior
from the trade okay but you can also
have inheritance between trades no
that's not what I was yeah you can sew
up influence I mean you can mix stuff
like named arguments and the other one I
wanted to mention is this one even in
the case you got the same method in two
trades so here you can hear you can see
that I'm extending a class and
implementing two trades so I can really
get behavior orthogonal behavior
potentially from different trades and
there are some rules here that's the
last which wins but you can also make it
make it explicit by overriding surf in
your realm in your own class so that's
basically it and if you want to dive
more into the new features in groovy
i'll be doing another toolkit for 30
about all those cool features you have
more one more minute one more minute
okay I was afraid of going too fast what
else could I say so guru is great and
has always been grateful I wait wait
wait it's not just it's great I'm
justifying why it's great for the
interoperability story with the Java
language so you can really mix and match
both languages together and also I mean
how close it looks to July itself
because of the the grammar which is
really deriving from the
a grammar so that that's been one of the
key selling point for the gooery project
that's it all right so now is the time
for a day movie so I'm a fool and I'm
going to do live demos and live code for
you guys so we'll see how this goes
unlike some of my predecessors before me
I am going to try not to lose as bad to
groovy this year so we'll see what I can
present sup to you guys so I'm using
this rebel called pry which is a really
great tool in the Ruby community this is
all running on top of the JVM and I've
defined a class here and Ruby is an
extremely versatile and flexible
language so I can obviously just call
greet and get my little greeting but
Ruby also supports dynamic method
invocation which means i can send a
message to the class greet and get the
same behavior now this is extremely
extremely powerful in some cases it can
be used for evil only is it for good if
you want to know some tools that are
using it for evil you can come ask me
afterwards um but what I really wanted
to talk about here was some of the the
interop with the Java ecosystem which is
where I think JRuby really really shines
so I wanted to print an ascii table for
my demo and so i searched the internet
and of course i downloaded the first jar
file that i could find and i'm going to
go ahead and load that into my prior
eppel here and JRuby has this great
support for treating java code very much
like Ruby code so it's very familiar so
your your language in your interfaces
look the same whether you're talking to
java code or Ruby code so I'm requiring
this jar that pulls it in then we've got
a Java import method which will pull the
ASCII table class into my current scope
and this is all coming out of this jar
I'm defining some Ruby arrays with some
information I've defined this nice
helpful little method and one of the
things that this little method is doing
is it's calling ASCII table instance get
underscore table what jruby provides
for us is it treats Java conventions
like and it will proxy Ruby conventions
over to Java conventions so ASCII table
defines the get instance method instance
which will return you know as an
instance of that class but JRuby will
proxy automatically instance which is
the more idiomatic Ruby way of access
accessing that same method the same
forget underscore table all these
camelcase methods in Java come over into
Ruby land looking very much like Ruby so
that's just a very very simple quick
demo of how we can pull in Java code
from random sites on the internet and
execute it and treat it just like it
were Ruby code one of the other really
great features of JRuby specifically and
I'm flattered there some JRuby people
here I'm flattered that Oracle decided
to copy some features from JRuby for
java 8 for the longest time jruby has
proxied blocks which are a ruby
construct into anonymous classes when
invoking Java code so I've got this
invocation of java.lang.thread.run which
you can pass an anonymous class that
implements a runnable interface and with
JRuby I can just pass a ruby block
directly into that into that constructor
and JRuby will handle the management of
that and I can use any anonymous class
interface in Java just like I would in
Ruby by just passing blocks around one
of the most impressive features to me of
JRuby however is its embed ability the
way that JRuby operates is in this
runtime in in this pride environment
right now I've got a JRuby run time and
that JRuby runtime is something that I
can further use within my code let's see
if I can remember what file unloading
here so I've got this turtle er Ruby
script which creates a new JRuby runtime
execute some Ruby code into it
and then also execute outside of it so
outside in the outer runtime I've got a
constant defined which is version 1 and
inside the runtime I've got a constant
define which is ver on mizzou which
means I can provide full environment
separation between JRuby runtime
environments in tomcat or jetty or or
another different kind of another JVM
server and i'll talk more about that in
the second component we're just to show
you what this code actually looks like
it's a very very simple API we can
import the Ruby class and we can create
a runtime and an evaluator and you can
start evaluating Ruby code in your jvm
based projects whether it's groovy Scala
closure etc you can use JRuby in any one
of them that's it yeah we're done so
let's fish to closure now I just want to
say that I'm a mediocre engineer I fail
to give the right estimates I failed the
ship code without bugs I fail to do the
right thing when the manager says just
do it just fix it right now I've been a
lead java engineer for over a decade and
I've been doing JavaScript Python groovy
on the side as well and I've been pretty
good at it or so they say frankly I'm
not that good today I want to show you
my journey into closure I would change
my life and I hope it will change yours
as well my first demo is a single page
reactive app with closer and closer
script my second demo will be part 2 but
we'll get to that later so I just
created this as of yesterday we use Lin
again which is similar to maven it's
it's the starter kits a bill to so we
just say lonegan new ringgold script
ball and it just created a project i
just want to show you what a project
structure looks like because if you're
coming from grails or scala using play
or even know Jas you will see a
structure there's an API everything is
built in this is obviously an example we
can change this there are routes built
in
this is the router don't worry about the
braces now we can talk it after after
the discussion but basically the the out
of the box comes with routes it comes
with a acing HTTP server out of the box
it has a design with the less bootstrap
workflow it has resources with an index
HTML which comes with h 5v five
bootstrap as well and there is closer
script code which is client components
you toes and we'll see that later but
for now since we're running out of time
i actually created a demo for you guys
so let's just switch right into that
it's created with the same workflow so
this is what it this is running all you
do is Lane Ringo and then it shows up so
this is what the page looks like and I
want to show you one thing what reactive
means enclosure land so this is a simple
page which has a sign in or Twitter
button and has a graph right it has a
graph which has some data and is showing
up well that's all good you can put that
in any app but look at how things change
right now so what if i want to change
the data and I don't want to reload
anything right so let's say I want to
change something like well let's just
change the numbers this is just a dummy
database but you get the idea I just
saved it and now since it's a backend I
just have to refresh the browser
normally if it's a front and it doesn't
have see the graph this changed I didn't
do anything what is happening behind the
scenes is Ringo as in this is just a
name I created it it's just leaning in
plug in it is compiling assets front-end
assets it is compiling the routes it's
compiling closure it is compiling close
a script all behind the scenes you don't
have to worry about that you just keep
it running so that's obviously a basic
example of a data change and how things
change life I also want to check i'll
show you how close your script can be
even more reactive so let's say i want
to put something
below this guy let's just put a hello
world how does that work so my index
this is an HTML of this page you looking
so you see that close your bills on the
strength so let's just put a counter so
I have an ID I have to inject that so if
you use the angular this is kind of
concept right so i will just create I'll
go to my components I have to
there you go so I added up with which
one minutes it's called diff hollow wall
right I'll just evaluate it and i added
forget both the code for now all that's
doing is like jquery dollar hello
injected you want to see that's it
imagine building components like this
life right so that's just one that's
just a few things you can now what I'm
using is and i have to mention this
because this is possible because of ohm
which you might have heard it's a rapid
on react yes which is the biggest thing
out there at this point if you want to
build user interfaces small and build on
top of it that is the way to go and oh
makes things even better because it's
built out of immutable data structures
etc etc but those are just the details
that make things possible and i want to
show you one last thing is you've seen
life you seen the structure you've seen
the database so what about adding the
rear we switch this color will do that
in part okay thanks I went to K take a
little bit of a different approach I
want to just end step back a little bit
and talk about how the rules of the game
have fundamentally changed if we look at
applications that were written from the
60s in the 90s versus apps they're
written today what they run on is
completely different right we went from
single machines to clusters machines
you're right single core to multi-core
and all this is enabled in an entirely
new class of applications and what's
really different is that you know into
the year 2000 there was approximately
350 million people on the internet today
Twitter alone handles approximately 200
they say they have 250 million active
users on a monthly basis and that's all
being run off a scholar so the amount of
users that we have to have them tight
the application you have to build is so
fundamentally different I think it
requires a completely different way of
thinking about how we building
architecture applications and so I think
what you should really think about is
choosing your language on what it
enables not on specific you know
features and functionalities and what's
cool and need but what kind of
applications is this a language enable
you to build I think that's why skull is
so fundamental
ruffles and enables an entirely new type
of application to be built and the
fundamental thing with Scala is that it
makes you easy to scale your application
so and there's a lot of the lot that
goes into making an application scale
but at the core of fundamental
architectural principles skull it makes
it really easy to scale for a number of
reasons I'm going to talk about those
really quickly the first is I just let
me say one thing Scala is fully types it
fits compile-time checked it's fully
interoperable Java its object it blends
in object orientation of model so it's
very easy to work with the you know any
kind of you know existing jar files java
classes anything that's out there makes
it really easy but on top of that it
adds a lot of neat features the first
set I want to talk about is immutable
data so one of the killers of being able
to scale your applications to dealing
with mutable data if you want to do you
know scales with very large number of
users the highly concurrent application
you need to have your data you don't
want to deal with shared mutable state
trying to share it between threads you
want your day to be completely immutable
so Scala has a built-in data type the
valve means about value is immutable it
will never change that means i can share
between multiple threads i never have to
worry about who is going to be changing
it it also has immutable data structures
so this is one example in immutable
index ink prints so i create this index
sequence it's never going to change I
know the values and it won't change and
so I can share that data structure
between multiple threads the other thing
is functions is first-class citizens
this is key to building a you know at
this entirely new class of applications
that are event-driven and scalable
because what functions enable me to do
is to build small blocks of code that I
can schedule and run in an asynchronous
contacts the next part of it is
expression oriented so everything in
Scala pretty much returns a value so and
you combine this with things like
pattern matching is because really
powerful so it with Scala pattern
matching actually returns a value so
here we're doing a match on the POS
we're sitting POS match and depending on
what kind of position we have we want to
return a different value so here if its
user position we want to create an
object based on the timestamp
if it's a cluster position we do i do it
based on the timestamp and the count and
we're going to take the value returned
from that pattern match and set it to
the val properties so Bell properties is
this immutable value that's getting the
results that from the pattern match
what's really nice about this is it
makes it easy to reason about because
there aren't side effects I don't have
to use a temporary value to store my
values in the the last part is for
expressions with the for expression
what's really nice with this for
expression is here and create two
futures I'm doing two web service calls
those web service calls are making a
future return your future and I want to
combine those results together compose
them together and return the result to
the end user right so I'm saying you
know I get the future that's the type
safe website the future of the Twitter
website combine those results the bodies
of those results returned to the end
user again this makes it the really new
think about this for expression is it
makes it really easy to work with and
reason about futures that's the that's
why the most challenging things about a
highly concurrent application is how do
you deal with you know reasoning about
you know your logic in your program here
this future minute makes it really easy
to see the control flow and how things
flow so I had to give you an example of
one example of an application and then
I'll do another one on the next so here
is one type of application that's really
enabled by skull and that's a very much
of a push based event based model that
pushes the data in real time out to the
client this is simulating a stock flow
this so can happen with the beta with
saying the other screen oh all right
well well show it on the next next round
I'll be sure in the next demo will show
it so schol enables very much of these
reactive event driven applications
because you can use these functional
concepts to create callback code so when
if invent happens and fires off it says
let's call this function and the
function can be a value that gets you
turned up the client it makes you really
easy to reason about to because those
functions use in mutable data so you
don't have to worry about global state
shared state between different functions
so okay so that concludes the first
stage and just immature okay so now that
you have seen what all these four
languages are about and so the initial
feature
now it's time for the big leagues now
it's time for these guys to woo you and
get into their language so without any
further ado let's get ready to rumble
beyond take it away so this is well
formula that's what I usually call a
community around in the sense that it's
not just about the long wait but the
community and what other folks are doing
etc and also as I run a bit too quick in
the first round I would really wanted to
show you a bit more of the android
support so i have this lil demo here i
I've got a six year old who's learning
how to read and I wanted to create a
small application for her to help her
you know read words so I obviously did
it in groovy and on Android and this is
a so it's showing up some words and you
can so i don't know if i put the sound
up be a bit using the mic I know if you
do you hear that or not yeah well so
it's using you know text to speech etc
using different you know phones for
handwritten versus script kind of stuff
you can add if I click there you can add
new words and uncheck it cetera works so
chic Emily's you know try new whoops so
the emulator is never responds here it's
coming Wow and yeah I should be using
genymotion but well and well I can
really things etcetera and I just wanted
to show you the the code so they are
just like a handful of classes and some
things that goo remake think make
simpler for for instance where you want
to repeat the same method on a same
object all the time you can use with so
it's a bit for those who remember Pascal
you know such languages we've got that
construct it takes a closer as per meter
or what school we've got the Elvis
operator here because it looks like you
know now this smiley and so if the the
list is nominal non-empty etc is going
to return that stuff on the left or
otherwise a default value what else also
things like for running steps of all
those who know android a little bit
things like that or can be a bit painful
to do for running stuff in the
background you just call the run on UI
thread and past quarter and that's just
working out of the box with that
particular magic and I think there was
another real thing i want to show you
what was that yeah well now my dad that
so that's about yeah that's for reading
the the files where is that I'm lost
although there's not much code yeah here
for instance I can read a an asset which
is in the form of a file pretty easily
with just okay I open a strain over the
file and with the stream a crib reader
on top of the input stream and read the
content etc to load the list of words if
you do it the you know the Java way or
the Android way it would be much much
more focus so that's the first do demo I
actually wanted to showing the first
round but I'm showing it now and the
other thing so where is it it's here I
would like to mention that particular
community project it's called drew
script any modern long wage now should
we be able to compile into JavaScript
code that's the new you know bytecode
the modern age and it so it's called
grew script you can go to grew script
org and it's got lots of great tutorials
demos etc with things like a node.js
meteor or react etc so I really invite
you to have a look at that and it's nice
because you can also use groovy in the
front in the back and you know it's all
down tunnels all the way down and I've
a little demo which is actually first of
all a question who knows who's painted
that yes and the quarter like closure
colleague might remember it because
there's been a cool closure demo about
that and the guy who did the the GRU
script project so let me show you the
the Guru script website here in the list
of demos there's this Jackson Pollock
demo here which is actually inspired by
the existing closure demo site like you
know give to kaiser can see Kaiser right
so it's building it's a painting Jackson
Pollock painting and with just a couple
of so is the theme you see that yeah so
it's just a couple of classes drawer
groovy and functions groovy and although
it's groovy code is going to be compiled
into JavaScript code and it's going to
run in the browser and you can also so
the the syntax highlighting in vm is a
bit weird because it's out there ok and
so this is going to be converted into
javascript and what I also wanted to
show you is that you can also a bit like
what GWT or with whatever it's
pronounced was doing you can also define
native stuff is so you can even embed
some javascript in in in the middle
somewhere and well that's so basically
that chose a cuckoo legal demo but there
are many podemos on that website for a
gross script so that's a nice community
project among the many cool projects
like Gretel Grails jeepers and so on
thank you for and Griffin sorry all four
got referred hahaha should have negative
80 brutal okay so that concludes groovy
and now we go with care will be one of
the things I wanted to make sure that I
said while I was up here is how how
honored I am that JRuby is is sort of
I considered among the echelons of Scala
and closure and groovy and all these
great scripting languages and there's a
lot of members of the group or the Ruby
community about the groovy community
that are definitely taking notes on some
of the cool things that are being done
in these other scripting languages so I
wanted to call out one gem in particular
called concurrent Ruby which has very
good support on JRuby backing a lot of
the task pools with Native javathread
pools that implements a lot of concepts
from closure and Scala and akka and
brings those into the into the Ruby
environment and so I just wanted to say
thank you to everyone in the respective
communities because they the presence of
all these other communities have made
Ruby better for me and at the end of the
day that's what's most important to me
so I mentioned earlier that I wanted to
talk more about how Java and Ruby can
get along well together and why that
makes JRuby a very compelling choice
this is Ruby gems or gets sort of the
main home of a lot of the the community
source code for the Ruby the Ruby
community and if I'm to take their their
statistics by their worth there's 89,000
gems available and so that's eighty nine
thousand different pieces of software
that are available for you as a ruby
developer or is it a ruby developer and
then maven central allegedly has 87 some
1,000 artifacts available that you can
also consume and use within the JRuby
project or within a Jay Ruby project and
there's some really great tools that are
starting to come with age in the Ruby
community after after rebelling against
Papa Java for so long we're starting to
realize that some of the tools that are
available in the java community are
actually really useful and maybe not so
awful after all one of those one of
those tools is the is the maven
repository concept and how Java
developers generally declare
dependencies one of the JRuby community
members a guy named Christian Meier
working with the torque box project
created this server called ruby gem
servlets which will take any any
rubygems RuPaul's
tori and present it as a maven
repository and what that means is i can
use maven or Gradle to start to resolve
both my java based dependencies but also
my Ruby based dependencies with this
useful little servlet taking that a step
further there's a there's another
project which full disclosure I am
involved in called the JRuby Gradle
project I've been I've been enamored
with with Gradle it's a fantastic tool
and I really really want us to have that
too in the Ruby community and so there's
a couple folks in the in the Ruby and in
the Gradle communities that have been
participating with this and because we
can now pull in rubygems just the same
way we would pull in maven dependencies
all of a sudden Gradle is opened up for
me in the JRuby environments to where I
can take all of the great tooling from
Java without necessarily needing to to
use Java itself I wanted to show a quick
demo of what this means there's a member
of the ASCII doctor community which is a
great tool that uses Ruby and Jay Ruby
ASCII dr. J actually embeds JRuby inside
of it one of the members of that
community a guy named skulk at all Shulk
shulk that's how I'm told it's
pronounced I guess built the JRuby
Gradle jar plugin and so this is a jar
that is pulling in JRuby as a dependency
it's a fat executable jar and what's
happening here is this line is being
puts so using the Ruby put statement and
the colorized gem to create anti color
sequences and executing that all from
within a jar that was built by Gradle
and so the Gradle file for that is is
very straightforward we've pulled in a
couple of greats Gradle plugins that the
Gradle community has developed like
there's the basic Java plugin and then
there's this shadow jar plugin which
makes Exeter fat jars very efficient we
can also specify our Java dependencies
like the JRuby complete jar which is you
know here and we can also specify gem
dependencies which means I can slurp
both of those into a build
at the same time I can start my init
script which is see if I can find it
resources which is just a ruby script
that's all that's running in this fat
executable jar and then we're relying on
shadow jar to actually build the jar for
us with a little custom groovy scripting
on top of that to pull in Java and Ruby
into this one executable jar and so this
this JRuby Gradle project I'm very
excited about I think it means that you
guys and and the Ruby community will be
working together a lot more in what
manner there's some other work that
makes this even more useful there's a
gem called jar dependencies which means
i can build a ruby gem right now that
specifies dependencies on jar on jars
from maven central or somewhere else and
that can be pulled into these projects
as well all of my demos I just want to
point this out are on github under
javaone JRuby demo so all of the scripts
that I've been running here today are
using that and I also wanted to say that
I don't think anyone else up here can
say this Ruby will be at falls dem which
is a great conference in Europe next
year we got our acceptance for a Ruby
language devrim next year and january
thirty first and februari first in fall
stem so if you want to vote for the most
well represented at mazda next year and
great a scripting language on the JVM
ever then JRuby is clearly the scripting
language on the JVM for you thank you
when I add a small comment just very
briefly just one sentence and the glory
project is a very happy user of Jerry be
because we use JRuby through ask a
doctor for our documentation that's it
okay so now we go with clutch hope
yeah that's what EMA yeah well I I
forgot but I wanted to thank Stuart
Holloway who's supposed to be here but I
guess schedules change so he thanks for
trusting me I don't want to show a
couple things one is where the community
is today because a lot of you might want
to see this and a couple other demos if
we have time with macros and dsl's so we
all know this it's it's been a while
it's been a rough edge early adoptees
mostly less Packers a very tiny
ecosystem and it was hard for other
people to come in including myself I was
a Java Python guy as you said but is
that all what happens when you bring
power what happens when you bring
something that says like I don't know
what this is but it seems to make you
10x productive people start coming
together seriously closure cub just
finished yesterday they were about 170
teams and you should see what they've
done these are the real facts 12,000
repos on github not repost report
searches my there's a difference as you
know hundreds of repose as of today 500
curated libraries what I mean by that is
these are libraries that have been out
there for a few years at least
battle-tested perhaps in production in
140 categories take that groovy yeah but
it a whirl is not web the world is how
it's why libraries for empowering thesis
I'm just I'm fun me too the closure
docks just launched two days ago it is
one of the best Doc's you can ever see
go to it right now you can search look
for examples close it in production this
is just three years
there are more than two dozen dozen
books I myself i'm working on open
source book like don't know when i will
finish i write like an august so it'll
take forever I guess training a closure
bridge is this dedicated training for
women closure for women there is a whole
group and it's amazing you should go
check it out cognate a closure kind
local meetups ecosystem now I want to
mention that when you say community it's
not just a wall community when I believe
that community should be open and not
closed saying that this is the only way
to build things and I found in closer
and closer script that there are lots of
categories you have your database
template in languages the web NLP the
classic web enterprise stuff and you
also have the bill to the distributed
computing research real type and there
is where I'm interested in this it's a
generative art literature linguistics
there are packages for all of these
today and I forgot to mention light
table if you're not sure of Emacs or
then go with light table it might help
you to begin and my easier development
with closure and also there is i do want
to mention this since we are in java
conference and i have a lot of
experience in the enterprise stuff i was
fascinated and surprised by how many
things that are in the enterprise world
including business rules jboss just
released their server on a s Evan you
should see it's a couple of lines you
just run the entire server in a couple
of flights from landing and from the
command line now
I do want to show up a couple of demos
one will be a showcase from one of the
community members I mentioned about
generative art what that means anyone
worked in html5 canvas yes do you know
what it can do British shapes well never
know it ought to so I'm running a
project by Michael Lau I have the link
for this later on but it's a community
project on clojurescript he has built a
small frame work on html5 canvas
including script and he did not know
closure at all he did this in two weeks
this is what power means this is how
people are inspired and you want to see
how that looks this is less than a few
hundred lines of code and now let's not
look at this as if it's just some fun
playing tool d there is a sower running
behind this serving this as a static
page with routes you can inject data
into this
I show this as an example of how people
are adopting closure to solve their own
problems he was a graphic designer he
came from processing.js and he saw this
and he said wha this is awesome the
repple based live development is so much
more productive you start creating not
running build tools that is what is
different in toilet and I want to end
with this I love Java I it's it's helped
me for like more than 12 years and I
still work on it and I'm mostly doing
Java 8 these days the the tone of the
session is make the future right I
believe it I think Java as a platform is
the future but is the feature of JVM in
one language don't you think great
answer don't you think it must know the
past to build a feature let's look at
our feature our future started with Java
C C++ in the 90s clearly in the East
Coast and then this is this is how
things look like and I haven't included
rupee and node.js simply because we are
speaking of JDM languages this is all my
friends here I am a part of this I am a
part of this my question to you
where disclosure guesses okay so we're
done thank you and we switched our last
contestant I'm not as religious about
Scala I don't have that passion religion
that's impressive I give it bad so we
have a conference that's well we have
several conferences I can claim that ask
Allah has more conferences in any other
language of this table probably so we're
going to have to scala days next year
and there's react on in this Nepal here
in San Francisco which is a lot around
reactive applications that no one else
at the table is going to be ad so I
wanted to point one thing out so I'm
going to show you a demo that's
available out on the types of activator
template site this type of actuator
templates has a lot of demos in sample
applications help you get sorry with
Scala we put a lot of resources and
helping people get started we think that
it's one of the fundamental hurdles to
help for developers adopting the
language is having good samples and
making it easy for him to just install
and run those samples and for that
reason we created activator and these
templates these are tutorials that walk
through how you build these applications
and we think that would really help the
adoption by making the the Buried entry
much lower for people coming to the
application so I want to talk so I said
that Scala enables a new type of
application I want to talk just really a
little bit more about that if you think
about the type of applications we need
to build today right there in a data
center the right you've got cluster
computers and a sign the clusters with
machines machines with JPM's jpmc note
inside the JVM so you've got nodes
threads CPUs sockets cores cash right to
you but you think of this layer of it
we're building on top of and to be able
to fully leverage and you know maximize
the scale on the performance on this
stack of we're Billy on requires this
new kind of architecture so you can
scale up leverage all the cores in your
CPU leverage all the memory available
and scale out leverage to the data
center and all viet you
the different you know servers in a data
center and we want to do this with the
same kind of application i'll be able to
scale up and out with our same
application model so to do this we've
create the aqha toolkit and the aqha
toolkit really shows what's possible
scala i think this really is you know
these new class of applications that are
enabled with the language like Scala
alcázar very powerful concept it's
fully message based event driven with
acha you basically the fundamental
building block is actors they're like a
Java object that adds in communication
you only communicate with them via
messages message send and because you're
only communicating via messages these
actors have a very much of an isolated
state this makes it very easy to scale
very easy deal with concurrency because
you never think about this these actors
are just matched by the Aqua system for
you so Hawkins can imagine your threads
for you it's going to manage the
concurrency for you as you do is you
create an after you add it to the
actress system and it's going to scale
for you so you never deal with low level
concepts like threads mutexes block and
synchronization any of that so this is a
much more sane concurrent model
concurrency model it's a very much of a
different model for building
applications this is not a traditional
request response model this is a message
driven model where I'm sending a message
to my actor and it's giving me a
response back in a message I isolated
failure handling these actors can be
isolated and run you know as underneath
like as a child so we can deal with
supervision as a first class citizen
side used in traditional try-catch throw
exception kind of model and then on top
of actors actors are created you just
get a reference to and after and what
really is powerful about this is I don't
care that actor lives it can be running
anywhere in my aqua cluster and I can
call it so it could be writing on a
different server and I can call it on a
different server so it could be you know
writing locally can we be writing a
different server so this makes it really
easy to scale up and out meaning that
now I can leverage you know all the
servers in my data center really easily
because I don't care where those actors
are living I can sentiment message
anywhere in that data center and akhter
clustering is a very powerful concept
for a couple of reasons why did spilled
on the gospel at all there's no single
point failure no single point of origin
you know no master
it makes it very easy a very resilient
type of application that can deal with
failures group really easily I'm going
to show you a demo of an application so
I mentioned I'm activator with its
tutorials this is in the sample on
activator called reactive maps there's a
whole tutorial that walks through how
this application is built it walks
through all the code it makes it really
easy to see how things work and how
things are put together I'm going to
fire this up this is I'm going to fire
it up with the three nodes there's going
to be a primary play server and it's
going to have to back-end clustered
notes run yanaka so here at my local
machine I've got a three node cluster
you can imagine if it's this you should
create a three node cluster on my local
machine you what I can create you know
on a large data center how easy it is to
create this on a data center well I may
not one minute it's hope that it starts
in that one minute time frame so it yeah
everyone loves build tools but SPT gets
you know plus and minuses we're going to
be about that a little bit but the build
tool for Scala it's very lightweight you
just declare what you know the name the
tendencies and that's all that's needed
for your build let's hope that
everything is up and running and we can
go to our application so what this does
is it basically shows us on the map all
the nodes that are available of course
it's not going to start up from the
other goes so you can imagine how this
map we're approaching our position down
to the server the service de streaming
across this cluster and it's aggregating
the database on regions and then when
new people come in to want to listen to
our data it knows what cluster node to
go on based on regions and it's going to
push that data backup so what's
happening is right this is very much of
this push-based event based model we're
pushing our location down and then it's
disturbing across the cluster and the
cluster is figuring out what region you
know we're listening on to pushing that
data backup based on our region so this
is a very much with event based model
just to show some code and we're out of
Awesome code look at that so
live in there it is so I'm surprised
that you guys have been behaving like
real gentleman because there were only a
few potshots within the languages
usually the script ball we have blood
and sweat and stuff flying around but
now you shut up of things flying around
I like for you guys to ask questions to
our panelists panelists please repeat
the question so there's a be a be on the
recording so we'll be first yes so blow
the scarlet oak was the echo which is
great I wondered for the other members
of the panel have they seen any evidence
that they can use their languages with
the actor framework I mean from groovy
can use any framework without any
problem because it's the language which
offers the best interpret
interoperability with between Java Bates
frameworks libraries etc and we also
have a library called jeepers which
offers not just actors but dataflow
concurrency software transactional
memory to drive got tons of use useful
stuff and they also recently added
remoting support for when you have
remote nodes on you know older machines
so we've got that kind of stuff as well
on the groovy side and we can use act as
well there i've seen some rare Bob blog
posts about that but that that can be
done to ya for jruby there's actually a
post this morning on on our mailing list
about using acha directly concurrent
Ruby implement some of the concepts from
acha but there is another gem that's
been developed by a member of the
community which I would consider just
past prototype stage called mica and
mike AKA and that's a JRuby binding to
akka directly i haven't worked much on
acha but technically it is possible to
you know binding to akka from closure
but i do know that close your ecosystem
as a whole or part they have better
alternatives and akka is not the way to
do there is simpler alternative
called caressing STM and other things if
you have questions I'm happy to answer
it after the talk I just want to add
that there is an initiative from a team
inside typesafe the skyvan is called
react programming it there have an API
and they are looking for other projects
are using reactive programming they are
openly contributing to the community and
have reached out to both groovy and
generally people that I know of so that
it can also implement this interface so
will be much easier for frameworks that
are completely d spread with different
languages to share the same reactor
street yeah yes a while reactive streams
yeah for the groovy community we have
different conferences across different
continents so there's the great conf
series which happens in Europe and in
the US every year so in Minneapolis
actually for the u.s. variant and in
Denmark for the one in Europe there's
greet also in Spain we have gris-gris
altec change in London and again in the
USA as spring 12 Jack's so it's spring
stuff plus groovy grails gradle stuff
and we've had some other stuff elsewhere
in Australia Japan but not as frequent
as the this all the ones that I
mentioned several times a year I so on
the Ruby side in case anyone's curious
that's Charles Nutter one of the core
contributors to JRuby controlling from
the back I you probably have a better
idea of the conference's than I do
because red hat will send you but
there's a ruby coggy which just happened
last week i believe which was a lot of
the sort of core members of the Ruby
community getting together in Japan
Japan over the summer we had guru camp
in Berlin which was also a very good
event the Ruby community is is I would
say good Joe Ruby come as well jruby
come for you that's that's the shirt i'm
wearing right now actually um the Ruby
community is is sort of very vocal and
very tight-knit there's regional
conferences you know just about
everywhere at least once a year here in
the San Francisco area we have guru co
which is a google ruko which is the
golden day ruby conference which may
have just passed I don't remember but
Ruby conferences are very widespread if
you wanted to find them so for closure
closure conch is the biggest it happens
in DC in November second or third week
this time it said november 22nd I heard
you should go it's affordable it's it's
a lot of fun I went there last year and
I had a blast in fact someone taught me
macros after a beer and I was just blown
away
and there is also close your risk that
happens or in the spring in the west
coast and apart from that there is euro
closure a couple of smaller ones in
Spain i think but i think it's picking
up its i would say relatively lesser
than java strange loop has a lot of
closure two strands of strange loop
that's our jam more on the bleeding edge
stuff muscala days next year we have
scarred days in march in san francisco
and june and amsterdam and then just
weird about every conference there it is
so it's a strange loop jungle and all
the main conference also NF j s this is
probably for all of us yes yes the tour
is happened mostly in east coast and
also midwest they have a lot of java
groovy as well and a closure and scholar
picking up so we have time for one more
question and then we decide the winner
yes
languages do what you needed bill
it's a pretty a white question but in
the I'd say in the Greek community we've
got a few options so the traditional
solution would have been to use ground
the ground web framework which built
atop spring and other interesting
components for reactive kind of
applications there's the Rat Pack
toolkit and framework which is built
atop Nettie and which supports the
reactive stream solution that we
mentioned earlier and we've got some
other smaller things or dedicated things
for example Gallic for applications on
google app engine etc we have different
options but the question is quite wide
so there are options depending on what
you want to do or which platform you
want to give oil I in on the JRuby side
of things I probably wouldn't start with
rails the way that a lot of the world
seems to be moving is with more thicker
richer JavaScript applications so I view
a web server much more as an an API
server to where Sinatra would be my my
go-to I've also heard really great
things about what finagle can can do and
what some of the guys at Twitter are
doing to build these API servers as well
but Sinatra deployed on jetty with JRuby
is is kind of my go-to gig right now for
building back-end API servers to power
these JavaScript web applications so
what close your arm there is a core
library called ring and composure which
is like Sinatra it's been out for a few
years four years now actually it's
perfect it just works out of the box for
services and for code for the web
front-end side there is close your
script there are Ajax libraries there
are react own libraries there are
templating languages and I can tell you
that none of my colleagues here can
speak about that because they don't have
Claudia script you still have to use
JavaScript we've got loose grid but no
one uses it so
what closer closer scrip you it's like
nodejs but with the power and simplicity
of what closer can potentially offer its
better watch scale but we just we did
will show will have a battle after this
okay but it is happening on my next
slide was a future architecture slide so
in really quickly a basically a place
server completely stateless you can
scale it horizontally this is becca just
like yeah going into a back in dhaka
clustered so this is this is kind of the
future we vision in the plate play as
needed WebSockets show us a nap okay
well so before we decide the winner
please let's give a big round of
applause to our panelists I hope you
have enjoyed the session so now you will
clap and the one that is the language
the derivative side there receives the
most noise will be declared the winner
this is totally scientific okay in the
person if I hear from the left right
here from the right okay so let's hear
it for the first ones Ruby
jruby
okay let's try it again there will be
pressure okay so it sounds to me that is
between groovy and closure right dad the
street who likes book okay I like one
final round and I'm going to do the
other way closer to me it sounds to me
that it's a tie it's really sure show of
hands maybe house also have you we need
something to calculate all right a
function right now minute haha okay my
scientific research determines that this
year will be right between groovy and
closure thank you very much for
participating we have another station
similar to this in one hour is called
the emerging languages a script ball if
you're interested to know in other
languages that in the future might be
here on the big stage just come in the
next hour in the same room thank you
very much that's a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
