to our assess on Oracle cloud technical
implementation with docker containers
and pardon me I woke up this morning
with the 8 o'clock or 8 day on the road
flu so if I call if I do apologize
basically what we're going to do today
and I'll get that other ways you can
read who we are what we're going to do
today is present to you the methodology
in which we are providing a SAS
analytics Pro software solution to you
in Oracle's docker cloud there Oracle
cloud service for that now the reason
why we decided to present this was for a
number of reasons and the reason why it
showed up in Java one was for those of
you that may be considering using docker
as part of your DevOps and environment
we're actually going to walk through and
show you the process needed to set up a
baseline docker environment so obviously
you could replicate this at your place
of employ you can also replicate it or
pretty much anywhere you've got a couple
of free computers to use so that's why
it was wrapped in a Java one so we're
going to work through that please
forgive me some of the slides are going
to be very basic like how to create a
tarball the reason why we did that was
going to walk anyone from start to
finish throughout so that way in the
event that they want to replicate this
when they download the slide deck
because they didn't attend today that we
were complete in all of these steps that
were required to do that
so basically myself I'm the CTO for call
your IT were an oracle Platinum Partner
we're also a SAS partner and we're
working very very close with both of
those entities to provide this solution
to the world if you will basically we
are what is called a Oracle cloud MSP
which is a managed service provider so
in this particular solution for those
that acquire the solution the
infrastructure is no longer your place
to administer you're going to find here
in about 30 minutes when our data
scientist Frank Daniel shows up actually
utilizing
product that all you have to do is have
access to the web browser any web
browser so it makes a solution quite
portable as well
no we've selected sass given our
partnership but this solution can pretty
much be any number of independent
software vendor solutions as well so
we're not limited to just using sass as
a sole solution okay
so pardon me that's me that's Frank the
agenda we got the introduction out of
the way we're going to talk a little bit
about why are we even going through this
talk about the business cases the value
propositions will do a very basic
architectural overview so everyone knows
the pieces that are required to perform
this I'll then walk you through the
steps of actually building and deploying
the container at that point I'll shift
it over to Frank and Frank will come up
and walk through a quick demonstration
about 15 minutes of actually using the
Analects Pro application that is
currently hosted and running up in
Oracle's darker cloud now a couple of
things first of all we've got about 21
environments available so if any of you
are interested after this and
demonstrating it head up to our website
the one in the middle
elastic analytics procom and you can
sign up for a free 30-day trial and
because all of you showed up today
you're invited for a free lunch who
feels like going to Fogo de Chao after
this and having a real lunch instead of
something in a plastic container okay so
all of you are invited we'll put that
information up on the last slide it's
going to be the same people in the group
talk and we've invited a number of other
people that could not attend we have a
table size of up to 60 so if you want to
go to challenge just right across the
street it's 5 minute walk from here so
if you'd like to join us please do so
it's going to get started with that
piece so basically the business case why
did we and SAS and this was a big SAS
and when I say SAS I'm talking about SAS
right not SAS when I'm talking about
software as a service we're talking
about SAS the analytics company
right so why did we consider one of our
very first MSP offerings to be SAS and
in our opinion given the necessity of
being able to contact your data to run
analytics against it if I had my data up
in Oracle's cloud but I had my analytics
engine sitting on desktops down at my
workplace there's a great deal of
latency that's involved in doing the
analytics so of the opinion that we
should be moving our data and our
analytics engine closer together cells
one of our primary reasons the ability
here allows us to do analytics in near
real-time our solution allows for any
number of connectors that you need so I
can connect to the Oracle database db2
Hadoop Big Data any of your connectors
that are available to us and we've got
the ability because we're also a Equinix
partner and cross connecting with any of
the other cloud environments that you
may be working with so if you're also a
Amazon cloud user you're also a
Microsoft cloud user nothing prevents
you if you're also an Oracle database in
the cloud user for acquiring this
solution and still have your application
to your interact because they're all
stored in the same Equinix data center
or actually equi next data center is
plural so don't allow that to be a
hindrance if you will when I look at the
solution I'm trying to overcome
objections and I think between the
partnership with Oracle's cloud with the
SAS software stack pardon me in Equinix
we can overcome a lot of the objections
that your perhaps encompassing apart me
encompassing as part of this particular
solution that kind of walks through the
second bullet as well performance and
scalability suffer for performance and
scalability issues again the ability to
have the totality of the analytics
engine writing up in the actual cloud
should overcome a lot of those issues
collaboration collaborations a top
driver as it relates to cloud adoption I
was in a meeting
Oracle Friday last and they told us that
they expect 60 to 70 percent of the
cloud to be consumed in the next three
to five years so think about that for a
minute either were in the cloud we're
giving strong consideration of the cloud
a great number of our customers are
telling us that it's cloud first and if
we can't go to the cloud I need to know
why we're not going to the cloud okay so
this is again a concept of bringing your
applications that are interacting with
the data that you've got up into the
cloud closer to the actual data itself
and then relatively low maintenance and
costs now obviously you can do this on
your own depending upon the licenses
that you've got with the software you're
going to utilize but again in the MSP
program you don't do any of that so if
your application and there's about
twenty seven MSPs in North America we're
not the only one there's 27 so you've
got the ability to interact with any
number of those msps that are out there
and again absolve your need of
administering the solution so that
addresses another issue that we may be
considering and I don't have time money
effort to train my staff on interacting
with the IT infrastructure in the cloud
if you work with a Oracle MSP you don't
need to do any of that we're actually
the first and second line support for
both Oracle and SAS in this particular
case you buy from us you don't buy from
either of them we buy for you for them
so that means things like cloud service
agreements that we may have some
difficulty signing you don't sign you
don't see them because we're the
customer you're not okay so the whole
intent wrapped around this is to provide
what's close to a click through
licensing model you go to a website you
click this is what I want we provision
it through Oracle we provision the
container for you we give you
authentication methods to gain access to
it and all you do is log on and utilize
the solution so that's relatively low
maintenance we kind of call it no
maintenance in this particular case all
right so Oracle customers are obviously
moving their databases to the cloud and
with that if we
move our analytics we are separating the
distance between those two making it a
lot slower 50% of SAS customers run
their analytics inside of the Oracle
database and again because of that we
need to be close to the data itself so
the value proposition how do we address
all of these powerful analytics
assembled by two of the best Oracle and
SAS positions your power analytics close
to your data obviously for better
performance and are relatively easy to
purchase solution so a couple more
bullets out there obviously your
containers are portable we can lift them
we can move them if we need to another
beautiful part of the solution affords
one the ability to resize if they need
to we can also go metered or non-meat it
so if you don't need it for a particular
point in time we can turn it off and not
bill you now I'm not selling this thing
put it there I'm not selling this
solution to you that's not what I'm
trying to do up here I'm trying to sell
you the benefit of using Oracle's Cloud
container service for any of your
applications we're a huge proponent of
using it for analytics but please don't
think I'm up here trying to sell you
this solution I'm not okay alright so
basically what it looks like from our
perspective is our servers we're gonna
create the actual docker image and I'll
show you step by step here in a few
slides just exactly what that looks like
from there we're going to publish it out
to a docker hub you can get your own
docker hub instance at no charge go out
to the doctor hub website they allow one
free private docker repository private
mean that no one else is going to see it
so what we do there is we create the
image we add the software packages we're
going to use we include any startup
scripts we're going to utilize and then
we publish that up to the docker
container at that point we can now
provision these whenever a request comes
in so again like I said we've got up to
21 different test environments for a
30-day trial if you
try this out when we get a request all
our team has to do is download pull the
image down to the Oracle container cloud
service and then via the admin node push
it out to worker nodes here the worker
nodes are separate virtual machines
running up an Oracle cloud container
service in our demo we're going to have
one docker container in every VM we are
also pre loading this with analytic data
so you have a requirement to test the
solution by uploading your data data is
already up there for you to interact
with at that point we would contact you
give you the URL to log in and you can
start using the analytic solution wrong
way computer alright so the first thing
we have to do is obviously build a
container install SAS studio create the
tarball create your docker file in your
startup script and then finally build
the docker container itself so here's
the URL to go out to Sasa's website it
will give you the installation guide
that isn't necessary to walk through
this will then create a user and the
group that's required to do the
installation and then we run a script
called setup SH and to install SAS so
like I said this is very very basic in
this particular case we're just running
a tape archive right tarball create
create SAS test dot R and we see we're
putting in the docker file itself we're
putting in the SAS test R and we're
putting up our startup SH script slowing
down just a little bit this is kind of
what the docker file looks like this is
an example of one that we actually use
to provision the test environment so we
start off with the from instruction says
it tells us is a new build stage is
going to set the base image for my
subsequent instructions the maintainer
sets the author field so it tells us who
we are so we'll have call your IT up
there and our support email address we
then go through and do a yellow dog
update or modified
is what young stands for answer yes to
all of them and install all of the
libraries that are required for this
particular solution to execute that are
not included as part of the standard
Linux distribution that we just used we
do a user add adding SAS user we set the
default password and then we're going to
expose a port port 3808 zero we expose
that port on our container making that
port visible to our virtual machine so
we can reach it from the outside to gain
access to it all right then we add our
software the tar file that we just
created we add startup SH and then the
entry point keyword within this docker
container file tells us what scripts to
execute when the container starts up are
there any questions on what that looks
like or what we're doing there
okay now here we've got a startup got SH
script and here we're just starting up
set u ID dot Sh we're running SAS studio
SH and then notice at the bottom we've
opted to run tail - f9 dev null well
we're aware that there are methods in
which one can start up a container in
the background one can start up a
container pardon me
disconnected from the console but what
we have found is by tailing a null file
the container never shuts down the
script never ends so your SAS analytics
pro software is always available to you
there's no load on a system reading a
low file but because it never finishes
reading a null file the container never
shuts down we found it a little bit more
reliable than just connecting it via a
container and then trying to disconnect
it ok so there's a couple options out
there for you that's the one that we
chose to use because it works best for
us so then we have to go out there and
actually build the image so we do a
docker build and then give it the name
of your version whatever
for instance you're creating : version
instance and then we're of the opinion
that you should always test it locally
because it can take some time depending
upon the software software payload in
which to push the information out to
your final end nodes so we test it
locally we're gonna run it 3808 o : 3808
oh is the port for both the container
and the port for your virtual machine so
we're passing it through both systems
can connections right and then once
you've tested it and it's worked
satisfactorily then we're going to push
that up to the repository so if we go
back a couple of slides we just created
on what's called the call your server
you just tested it on the call your
server and that last command then just
pushed it up into the doctor hub for us
so we can now pull it down okay so
that's kind of a basic your file is
created now I need to create the actual
docker container itself so create your
resource pools register your repo create
your service deploy the image and then
connect to your container so this is
what the presentation looks like for
Oracle's container cloud service let's
take a look at the left-hand side
because the rest of these slides I don't
include it to make the slides a little
bit bigger and easier to read but
basically we can see where we can start
services deployments containers images
and hosts we can look at our resource
pools our registries so we see right now
that we've got one deployment and its
status is okay there's no problems to
report we've got seven hosts and we've
got three resource pools we've got a
default resource pool a development
resource pool and a production we see at
the bottom we've got one container one
image and seven hosts 26 services one
deployment in a total of three resource
pools so at 50,000 feet this is the
first piece you would see when you log
on to Oracle's cloud container service
to get a general idea of what you've got
it's running alright so the first thing
we're going to do is set up a registry
top top Riteish we see the new registry
push button and that walks through the
steps now forgive us we actually used
the pieces right from our running
instance so we kind of scrambled the
piece there after index and to the right
hand side the email and our username
address for privacy
this is an actual screenshot from one of
the demo instances that we've got up and
running so we create the registry we can
also edit it it will include the email
the docker registry URL where did we
register this particular piece your
username and password and in this
particular case the description we use
docker hub because we opted to use our
own docker hub instance for those of you
that are already an Oracle cloud
customer hardening with containers
Oracle also has their own you don't have
to go out to dock or if you prefer to
publish it within Oracle I actually
recommend that you do because it'll be
far far faster going out there
provisioning your new docker containers
when you need to now did anyone hear
about the kubernetes announcement that
Oracle made couple days ago no ok so
kubernetes is a piece that does
orchestration for us it kind of takes
over a lot of the manual pieces that we
see here where we're publishing and
we're pulling and then we're deploying
oracle has made a couple of changes and
the way these container service works
the first one is they're going all-in
with kubernetes and I highly recommend
you take a peek at it if you haven't if
you plan on interacting with a large
number of docker containers if you're
just going to do a couple of them don't
worry about it but if you're gonna do a
large number or large deployment then
kubernetes is definitely a piece that
you want to look at will help you
automate those deployments a lot more
than doing everything manually that
we're doing in the examples we've
provided here second announcement that
they made is docker containers is now
going bare metal as well so if you've
noticed in my examples here I've talked
about we're deploying it to work
machine okay there now also going to
allow you to go bare metal so I'm not
necessarily to limit it to the sizing of
a particular virtual machine shape that
the Oracle cloud service currently has
so we can envision large containers if
we need to decimal or wrapped around the
concept of micro-services where I've got
a large number of smaller darker
instances running concurrently with
dependencies built upon each other
okay then we're going to start up our
service and here we see at the very very
bottom we've got our SAS studio there's
a couple of demos that show up there if
you want to interact with those the
bottom one is the SAS trial one that
we're going to use we see at the top
it's relatively easy to create a new
service there's a quick start wizard to
walk you through the steps if you've
never done it before and then once it's
up and created we see that there's a
button there for deploy along you
actually go through and deploy that
service so that's a method in which we
would deploy our SAS trial instance out
to one of our worker nodes so here's the
editor if you wanted to create your own
new service the name of it the service
identifier the service description and
then the scheduler and I'll talk about
the scheduler here in a couple of slides
be very very careful with your naming
scheme up here with the service name so
what I mean by that is if all of a
sudden you're going to be using
thousands of docker containers because
you decided to fully embrace the micro
service architecture which is where
docker is going now
we need to come up with some sense of ok
as this app tier as this middleware tier
is this database tier find a naming
scheme because it's close to impossible
to get everything renamed properly after
you've done that so take your time and
be sure that you get the naming schemas
in there properly so really is a matter
with that scheduler of you having the
ability to determine how to run this
particular container and again I said it
slide 27 or so think I'm on 21 we've got
a slide out there that kind of shows you
what that looks like ok so we see that
we can create our new service there's
the image that we've decided to use a
command if you want to start it up and
then any variables options that you may
need to set notice that we can set up
DNS labels environment variables volumes
ports links and networking there's a
large number of additional options that
one can use that may be needed that we
don't necessarily need
at this time inside of our docker
container for SAS will have to grow
those a little bit when you decide when
you decide to tell me okay Brian I want
SAS in the Oracle cloud and I want to
attach to db2 so we would then obviously
have more than just two check marks out
there and that's something else that the
MSB does for you you don't have to
configure those connections we do again
when you're done when we're done after
you contract with us we're just going to
tell you the method in which to access
the solution you don't have to do any of
this and here you can specify your own
environment variables if you need to you
can add your own ports now notice here
it includes both the host port and the
container port we have to provide both
if you don't do that you open the port
on the container but it can't get in or
out because the port on the VM is not
open conversely if you open it up on the
VM the docker container instance doesn't
see it as well so you need to specify
the ports on both of those to get
outside of the docker container and then
outside of the virtual machine and then
we can also do it via docker run now I
don't care for this spot that we used
here believe it or not those are
lowercase YZ and peas last night I spent
quite a bit of time trying to convince
them they were lowercase and it didn't
work but for those of you that are going
to experiment with this I highly
recommend that you you know copy and
paste it and you'll see they're actually
lowercase we can also do it with yamo
and if in the event that a lot of us are
comfortable with using the yam a
language specify your image your
environment variables that you've got
your Oracle cloud container service
description and then the ports that you
need so if you don't feel like going
through that that gooey piece we can
specify it all manually and then we
deploy it here we see the orchestration
we've decided to deploy a quantity of
one per host that constraints the host
and then from the drop-down we would
select what particular host we were
interested in deploying it to and here
we can see the running instance as
healthy notice that there are only
action available to us at that
particular time is to stop it it's
running in the default pool here's an
instance of my container and then
finally here's the image we're using and
then there's all of my hosts so we had
seven worker nodes in this particular
construct and we've got one particular
container deployed on them so again this
is all visible from you within the
Oracle container workshop if you will
making it really really easy to interact
with the solution all right so before I
give it over to our data scientist with
three minutes to spare any questions on
that all right so my email will be at
the end if you guys have any questions
on this presentation you want to
experiment with this I recommend you do
this is going to be the future of
hosting applications so if you don't
know what kubernetes is if you're not
interacting much with docker containers
I highly recommend that you do all of
the software that I am interacting with
at this particular point is looking at
getting everything ported over to run in
that environment because it gives you a
better layer of abstraction this is
going to be a replacement for a virtual
machine so all of you that are running
virtual machines be it
Oracle virtual machine for x86 or Oracle
virtual machine for SPARC or VMware or
hyper-v or any of those a docker
container is going to replace that level
of virtualization and the reason why is
as we just saw a spar far easier to
build to configure to startup to
shutdown I don't have to worry about
provisioning memory not worry about
provisioning CPUs or any of that because
that was all done when we stood up the
host so now all I'm doing is adding and
deleting virtual
machines concept of microservices allows
me if it's Christmas and I work for a
huge retailer pick one and my website
all of a sudden is becoming overloaded
what can I do
easily spin up new docker containers to
help us answer the load now I'm not
spawning whole new virtual machines with
an Apache web browser or an Oracle web
service running on it all I'm doing is
relaunching another docker container on
a different host in the same pool I
could put on the same host if I wanted
to but I'd probably put it on a
different host for a little bit of
failover and availability but basically
my point through all of that is in my
personal opinion and I've been doing
this since 1981 young nettled my
personal opinion docker is the future of
virtualization if you said with that I'm
going to hand it over to Frank who is
our data scientist and he's gonna walk
us through a demo thank you Brian so I'm
gonna introduce you to the actual
product of of what we built here in the
container and hopefully connect it to a
few of the business and value statements
that Brian was talking about earlier so
you know why are we talking about
analytics what purpose does it serve I
mean every organization are basically
data collectors and and if you don't
collect enough in your own business yeah
you can buy it from other people and the
goal is to monetize it we want to get
some insight from it get some business
direction or whatever your purpose wide
wide variety of purpose and so analytics
is basically the bridge or the tool that
we need to accomplish that mission so
regardless of what tool you're talking
about in analytics you need to
accomplish three basic things you need
to have some data banishment component
you need to have an analytic component
and you need to basically communicate
that
what your fight needs are near analysis
and as Brian kind of talked about
earlier it's data sources could be
anywhere and in any product and most
companies have a variety of data stores
and places that you have to dig in to
get that data so just highlighting the
the data management component that that
SAS offers in this solution yeah
utilizing SAS access engines to create
the data connections and with the
capabilities that are really required
for data management we're moving beyond
just consuming data so so most people
who are using SAS are are using it
because it's actually a great
interactive tool with the data and so
these access engines actually provide
that functionality so for instance if
you had the access engine to an Oracle
database you're taking advantage of of
all of that features that you have and
you've selected that Oracle database
like partitioning and all of its indexes
and special features so you're gonna
leverage all that in your interactions
with the data the analytic component we
have not just the core statistics but
you know we in this particular package
where we're adding basically a
full-blown workload of statistical
functionality with the counter metrics
process control operation research and
of course interactive matrix language
for rolling your own data scientist
so now let's just move in and actually
see what what this container looks like
so basically I've just logging into web
browser I have a zero footprint
requirement for this if you have a web
browser you can connect and do your work
you can it offers you mobility so
wherever you are you can be monitoring
your job or being productive and we're
using an interface called SAS studio
there's a lot of ways to approach the
SAS product but this is the one that
we're gonna demo here today and what it
offers is some point and click
functionality in terms of wizards to let
you walk through tasks and and I guess
in just a description where we're
building all of this functionality on
top of the core base SAS product so
you're there's a lot of flexibility and
in how you accomplish your mission so
you can use Sasa's you know
fourth-generation programming language
you can use the more modern dstwo
language to get take advantage of kind
of the advanced data manipulation like
distributed computing and
multi-threading you can use an SI sequel
so it gives you a lot of it offers I
guess a lot of options for whatever your
strengths are and in programming
languages or how
you know communicate with data also with
the SAS access engines it's a it's a
good idea to also mention the pass
through sequel so I've just have a
couple of code examples up here so the
top I'm looking at a live name section
statement that basically creates an
alias that I can use to reference those
data objects and and use throughout my
you know SAS languages or in the bottom
section I'm looking at a sequel
pass-through statement where you're able
to leverage your talents or the
functionality of you know the language
that of the database or a storage system
that you're interacting with to work
with your source data again we're not
again we're not just consuming data so
in this example you know I'm creating a
view I'm using hints which an Oracle
feature to recommend indexes and I can
grant permissions for other people to
access those things so so we're really
talking about a lot of functionality to
support the analytic requirements and so
now we're just gonna show you an example
we're not gonna go through really all
the features there's there's so many
features it probably takes a lifetime to
really understand all the functionality
that you get in SAS and certainly these
wizards don't don't cover it all or
they're kind of the tip of the iceberg
but again it since it supports a wide
breadth of user types from you know kind
of the casual data consumers through the
the power users
they're the Wizards are really a great
productivity tool
so in this forecasting collection of
utilities we have a data preparation
wizard that is going to help me
manipulate data in a way that's specific
for your requirements for feeding data
into a forecasting model okay then we
have a time series exploration that is
going to allow you to play with your
data understand it choose modeling
parameters and options and help you gain
insight into ultimately what you want to
do to do your complete model and then
that's going to lead you into actually
running your model and so I'll just walk
through a quick example of this a just
to kind of demonstrate well what does
the wizard do and really how does SAS
work for you so we've got we just choose
a data set those would be available
through the connections that I the code
that I showed you earlier
I'd pick some parameters some dependent
and independent variables that I want to
to run in my model and as I do this what
SAS is gonna do for me is write the code
to actually do that so we're just gonna
pick a standard ARIMA model pick some
some model parameters so I'll just run a
kind of a standard or Rhema 3-1-1 I can
tell it what I can accept either default
outputs or
going and tell it exactly what I want to
look at in my model and whoops I'm just
gonna make some selections again it's
guiding me through options if you run
the arena's every day you're probably
not going to use the wizard or you're
going to use the wizard to create a
template I can at any time roll over to
the code that it's generating on the
left and just take over from there and
modify it and customize it by if I would
want to from my model I can help but
datasets so it's going to create say a
history of the facts of your endeavor
here and if you get hung up on the way
just right at your fingertips you can
run and get some help on maybe what
options or model parameters you want to
select so you know the wizard offers us
a lot of I guess opportunity for you
know saving time and efficiencies kind
of lowers the threshold and what I need
to be is in terms of my programming
capabilities so it helps you know staff
and let's say you let me just show you
what an example of the results so
basically everything that's relevant for
my statistical analysis is out put it in
a format that I can then just spit out
in HTML or PDF or however I want to
publish this a Word document
again this is statistics intensive
product so you know it's heavy lifting
it's it's not just the pretty chart or
bar graph typically that you're gonna
see in a lighter-weight analytic tool
but you know it really brings a lot of
the strength that serious modeling and
forecasting and and those types of
processes mean so again I you you know
instead of looking at a graph I need I
need statistical things like you know my
Chi squares and correlations and
residuals and things to understand you
know what's really happening in my data
it puts it out with ease and ultimately
when I believe that I've conducted my
model and I can take that information
and do something simple I can
communicate to people who don't care
about the statistical details but just
care about the result where my sales
gonna be in six months or the answering
the question that you're really trying
to model so I guess with that you know
just kind of
go back to a point that I was making for
you know every analytic product you you
really need those three components
you're spending a lot of time back the
majority of the time of your product
probably 80% of your energy your effort
is going to go into data preparation I
need to consume it from whatever variety
of sources is it's located in you need
to do tasks like data cleaning and and
adding value to my data and then when I
get into my different statistical
demands I'm going to do things like
transforms and and rearrange my data to
make it suitable for my analysis and the
way that this product addresses that is
it's all there all those elements that
you need are there in one platform one
language and so you know if that's
that's the real value add so I guess
with that all
it's back to Brian any we have any
questions on the X Pro or that portion
so I just want to add one piece here
these three bullets here you see data
management and analysis and
communications I challenge you to find a
company that does it better than SAS
does all three of them in a single tool
you won't find one that does it better
then SAS does some of the other tools
that you may be interacting with it may
be good in one of those three cases SAS
is fantastic and all three of those
which is why we opted to work with that
particular company to work through the
solution alright so there's my email
there's Frank's email if you guys want
to talk to us later and again it doesn't
have to be about buying the product or
we'd be happy to talk to you about that
but if you've got questions you know
okay Brian I went to your preso and now
I'm trying to set up a docker container
and this isn't working
then just flip with some email we'll
help you with that for the pictures to
end all right and I'm an Oracle ace and
the H team says I have to put this up
there so there you go I'm an Oracle ace
for those of you guys that may be
interested in the H program against them
an email ace is a group of technologists
500 of us globally that go through a
number of different venues like open
world to present various aspects of
Oracle technology so obviously if you
want to do this you got to be a blogger
or a speaker or something along those
lines as you giving back to the
community
all right so we're done with one minute
left please join us for lunch forward a
child which is right across the street
from from from South okay it's on us you
don't have to pay it's a free launch
it's like I said probably gonna be
better than the box launch you're going
to get out
a little bit so with that thank you ever
so much guys appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
