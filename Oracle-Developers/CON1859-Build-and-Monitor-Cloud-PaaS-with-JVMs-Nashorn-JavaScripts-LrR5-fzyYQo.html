building and managing cloud services
with JavaScript my name is Brandon
Borges I work on the Oracle cloud
project management team going to do a
lots of outbound reach to developers so
I'd like to talk to you to customers
partners but more like the technical
people and I have some projects that i
like to build on my free time that
explores new ideas new technologies and
techniques that I think we can we can
use sometimes just for fun sometimes to
actually get some benefit out of that
and this is a talk about Nash horn so
that's a core that I'll be talking about
I'll be mentioning some Oracle products
so there might be some things that a
comment that might change so here's the
safe harbor statement for that again
embrun borges i have a twitter account
if you want to chat whatever i share
over there let's get started with NASA
learn how many of you have ever heard
about that horn okay good i'm gonna have
you already using it ok cool we have
some we have some that's fair next one
is the this new engine on Java 8 it
replaced the pre old Mozilla Reno that
used to be shipped with the JDK that's
one was written from scratch which means
the the guys who developed that they put
a lot of thoughts on how to make it sure
helped make sure they would use the best
out of the JVM most importantly they
invoke dynamic feature feature to make
sure it would be fast second thing about
Nash horn it is pronounced Nass korn na
Nash horn okay okay that is important
because Nash horn it's wrong in many
many ways
sonance morn that's the right word so
say hello to Stewart marks from the Java
team as well a quick overview so it's a
you could say it's java based on
JavaScript language so you are coding
Java programs but using the JavaScript
language so that's hard implements act
my script and the most recent version it
already has implementation for Atmos
crypt 6 no i'm not sure if all the
features of let me skip six but pretty
much there it's pretty easy for the
developers that have been building web
applications to get started because it's
JavaScript right so you just called
something to print one plus one equals
two hopefully in JavaScript and then you
have the resultant just print that now
the good thing about as hard is the
ability to use any java library in
existing Java library that you have so
you can code fast JavaScript you can run
fast because don't have to compile and
that's one is a really fast engine so
you can make a really good use of
existing Java libraries from the common
line without having to open eclipse and
build up program to just have access to
a Java library so you can use an s14
down it has a very tight integration
with Java means you can you can mix a
JavaScript application with a java
application in vice versa it means you
can have say for example Java fax
application desktop application and you
have this text area where you can code
some dynamic JavaScript let me just
evolve that or that information can be
coming from the database and you evolve
that during runtime and you can inject
java objects into the javascript context
in vice versa so it free it's pretty
cool because that allows us to do lots
of stuff that can be much faster code
and save time opening an IDE to go there
create a project you just open a file
and add it and run it does implements
the java x dot Script API so it is a
standard API
for any scripting language on the JVM it
means you can change back and forth if
you want to do an integration with
groovy your Java code does not care
about what is the action implementation
of the script language they were losing
behind your Java code thanks oh here's a
scripting language here's the file I
just put in I'll just inject some
objects and it'll give me a result and
it can be groovy can be Ruby khandvi
Python you can be javascript in s1
there's a common line called jjs it
means you can go to the common line of
your linux environment or Windows or Mac
just type jjs if you have jdk 8 you
already have that tool so just go there
top jjs it will open a console pretty
much like the browser when you type f12
mostly at the time you don't didn't want
to type f 12 and then you have to hide
back again because the left 12 fujin
affect support that means that you can
actually build visual applications with
javascript and i'll show you a pretty
cool sample here and that means 8 has
some support for that for an S one as
well Treecko it has a code competition
you can inject inspect you can debug
that's on a platoon put break points on
JavaScript code it's pretty cool so NASA
on JavaScript and Java combined let's
see some examples let me open my console
here because uh I was hoping to do some
live demo this week and so let's see you
have a terminal you have jjs installed
in madinat the environment that that
thing points to user League JVM java 8
Oracle being jjs that's the binary for
nascar on your console so you can do
just gjs and you have a console to type
javascript so you can say var a equals
Bruno or B equals Borges
and you can do an awesome computation
here very very complex and then you have
something like that right that's
JavaScript but what can do beyond that
let's access some Java API so uh are you
guys familiar with this API here right
who knows how to get the current time
who knows how to get the current time
get current time no llores enjoy the
time already that's good see if you get
instance and they need to get time right
that's a pretty old API I'm glad if you
don't remember it means you're using
something else so you have access to the
Java API all the Java API you can do you
can get any package that exists on the
normal class path of the JVM but what if
you want some library that you created
well you can do something like I don't
have a simple for that right now but you
just do like minus CP my left or jar and
then whatever is inside that jar will be
available on your console okay now let's
do some funny JavaScript how many of
your big fans of JavaScript one person
two three four five six not much okay so
let's define a variable a now let's
let's search for a hey does not exist
let's search for bee bee does not exist
so let's do a equals a that exists
okay add some of the fun things of
JavaScript let's do another one let's do
right let's do what is this in
JavaScript an object right okay what is
the result of object + object no it's
not what is d what is this watch the
result of a rape has ray no it's a
shrink what is the heat result of object
+ array no it's 0 and what is the result
of array + object because you know when
a math does shouldn't matter right so
what it would be the result object so
those are the stakes of JavaScript that
you must be like really scared about
okay so if you want to see the the
actual full the full short presentation
about these things on on on JavaScript
search for a video called lat you to put
just whack wwat JavaScript and you're
gonna see a video on youtube on another
speaker who did some fun not just with
JavaScript to Ruby as well it's pretty
fun w80 wet so just search for a wet
javascript it's pretty fun so uh let's
go back to the these samples now I
talked about some Jam effects demos
right Sam application that you can build
a Java JavaScript so who has ever built
a browser a web browser one person there
to you how many lines hundreds of lines
thousands of lines
you can reuse the library that's mark
that's like to dozens of lines maybe so
with JavaScript and Java facts what we
have actually is one file browser jas
that's a web browser implemented in s
horn with javafx now the good thing
about it is that it works pretty easily
just do like minus gjs minus effects and
you type your browser jas file and then
you have a window John effects window
loading in this example here it's hard
coded it will open google maps so it's
pretty cool you can you can work around
the component actually works pretty well
Street View works and just got a coffee
shop randomly notes that what a diner
restaurant yeah it's a restaurant yeah
I'm hungry so how many lines this code
has okay better how many characters it
has this is the code you can tweet it if
you want okay so let me walk you through
this code here because it does use some
tweaks of JavaScript language okay so
the first thing I do here is as you can
see here what is the first statement
that is called actually called when it's
evaluated is the import on the variable
s i'm importing the package java facts
not seen and assigning that package to
the variable s the second statement that
is executed is the new so i do a new I
reference the package dot web web view
and then I assign that object to the
variable V
and on that object because of the
parentheses I can do that engine got
load and then I give the URL that I want
and the second line is the magic
variable that NASA hunting jackets for
me for javafx staged scene it's it's
equal to our new s dot scene and ask
again a reference to the package so it's
pretty neat just a few characters that
you can tweet and you have a java
application implementing a browser of
course that's it but if you want you can
expand from that okay so it's pretty
cool you can just go there and tweet it
if you want these projects on github
brutal borges / mass horn you can get
this code from there now let's see some
more like complex example of using Java
libraries I have a 02 folder here and a
few examples of code so i have a decode
64 encode 64 that's very basic it calls
the java a oto base64 api so you can
just print what is the encoding or
decoding that that string just sent to
the code so i can just do like jjs
decode i give some parameters and no
actually encode perimeter javab one and
i got a hash code the base64 for that
then again in decode dad but the cool
thing about national horn on a Linux
environments that you can do a shell
script and that's the cool thing next if
you look here there's a hash bank on the
top of the file that means when i call
this script from the shell it will
interpret the file through d jjs so i
can just do this dot slash encode
argument java one
and some variable that should not be
there but it's worked it worked now the
cool thing here is how many of you have
ever written a shell script lots of you
sure how many of you know out of your
head how to write an if statement now
come on it's not that easy all right an
if else if statement with and or
multiple end or okay your guys are
better than me I just go to Google
search for in coffee paste because I
never remember the thing is I never
remember and I'm sure there are some
people here never will never remember
can remember out of their head how to do
a knave say statement or for look on
shell script on bash right so that's why
I go to Google in a copy paste room
stank referring now javascript is much
easier to do that because you're like
web developer you do that every day so
and it's the syntax is a it's more easy
to do that so that's why you go to
JavaScript and you do and you do that so
one code that I wrote that is that I
liked you a lot is NATO NATO is a preço
javascript in that's one that does use
of Java 8 lambda and streaming API what
does NATO does whenever you call the
airline company to give your reservation
code you have to say ad f t 0 and the
guys like what a like be did you say d
no see no be right so if you talk to
them because they are from the airline
company on NATO alphabet they understand
so just say alpha better charlie delta
echo and so on so forth so i did i did
this script here so i just give my code
and it will output the nato alphabet for
me okay now how how hard was this
to write this code so this is the code
first thing it does it will create an
airy list of all the words and then
using stream it will get a map of the
first character and the word so I do a
function to extract the first character
corrector and then the word of the list
and then for each word in my arm I each
letter in the argument I get that from
the map so i use all java api here just
to do that mapping from nato offer bad
to keep from characters to nato of a bed
so it's gone it's a good example on how
to use streaming API it does a lot of
new function to pass lambda expression
because that's one you can use streaming
API you just don't create an let
expression as you would on Java it would
create a function in JavaScript and then
you use that so it's pretty cool I like
this script a lot it helps me a lot to
save time on a call with those guys so
so shell scripting mask on why not using
a language that you are like you're
better at to do the shell scripting I
mean I i don't i'm not good at john
shell scripting at all that's why i
prefer to write JavaScript I didn't have
some integrations you can do jjs there
scripting and that will give you some
magic information from the shell
environment like the current directory
that you are in so you can do on this
corner squad dear it will give you the
current directory you can call commands
like the move command here you can put a
that character that don't own english
you just put that MV and then can call
that command you can use is Zack as well
if you want there's a function called
exact that you can call directly but if
you just want shorter version that's the
version you want so this example here
just move pictures around so that's a
thermal features but these are just so
introduction for you now let's talk
about cloud so playing with cloud
services java sdk is using javascript
code whenever you are interacting the
cloud service you might end up having to
use our java sdk to interact with that
service at the amazon asked there is an
amazon Jake SDK in Java to interact with
DC to manage services manage your
applications and sometimes the
developers what they end up doing is
open eclipse and they create a main my
class main command the main method and
then they have a clean interface for the
library of Amazon and they start to do
creating their own program well that's
it spends a lot of time cleaning a
project so what do you can actually do
with nance holidays just open a
JavaScript set a classpath import that
SDK that you're using and just fired
from the comment line you don't even
need a interface that's popping through
fifth grade of Java project for that so
in here what I do is for example the
Oracle cloud SDK for the storage cloud
service just go there and get the
library download put my classpath and I
import those classes and then I can
interact on Jack in JavaScript with the
service in Java but coding in java
script so i just i showed you that let's
see some rest web api is so when you are
interacting with rats web AP is what is
the commander you guys mostly use lets
you write curl in w get to interact with
that but then you end up writing this
huge curl line with several parameters
several information lots of information
the minus-x get my ex put dash dash
minus data to do a post it's hard in my
opinion to do that and manage that I
prefer to code JavaScript verdad and
there is there is some cool p is out
there in java that you can use to
interact with rat services right i'm
quite sure you all know Joxer as client
API from Java EE or even from
ring or even from Apache they're a bunch
of libraries there they can use to
interact rest services but why why using
crow and rat and NW ad when you can use
an actual program and reuse more easily
that information so that's why I've been
working on this sample here let me show
you the storage the storage simple first
for the third sample will give me so I
just call jjs I want to list my
containers on the storage service and it
will connect and use the library and
here's the container that exists over
there or I can just do create container
gjs create container and I give a name
Bruno and the Bruno is created there's a
bug's to there but it was created and
then I can list again so this is like
interacting with the call out service
but using undefined oh yeah using
javascript for that ok there's Bruno let
me show you a little bit of this code
here so these containers so I do a load
on a connector JS file that opens the
connection using the Java library and
then I use the API itself to get
information from the cloud service so
you can you can start automating lots of
tasks with your cloud services doesn't
matter amazon asia or a cold ybm
whatever they most of them Oh provide
you a java sdk if they don't they
provide you our REST API and it can
ultimate easily with JavaScript for that
let's go to the rest api example how to
call that so here i have open target
javascript file you see this JavaScript
here we'll use
jax-rs client api from java ee 7 to
interact with references so what I do
here is I'm port aldi Java x dot WS
package and important classes to
interact with the rest services I have a
function to get the basic auth that will
create for me string with the
information for a basic authentication
over HTTP the gate Authenticator is a
moral jax-rs client specific object so
it's a client requests filter that every
time I do a call trash service it will
use this object to do authentication I
add some information like Heather's the
authorization Heather of course and I
have them the most important method here
called guitar target the guy target
receives a credentials object with
information like username password the
attendant that I'm going to axes I
create a new client for the client puter
I get out indicator for the creations
for those predictions and then i create
a target and that's the jocks are ice
target pointing to our rest interface
this thing here the dollar brackets it's
for expanding the information so it will
expand that variable into a string
inside this string so that you don't
have to concatenate strings here just
expand them
so that's the open target let's see d
open credentials that's interesting so
uh that's horns that has some
out-of-the-box features to a top with
JSON files or JSON data can be a string
whatever so here I do a json.parse i
convert a string that is rad from these
five accreditation stock Jason so I read
this file here read fully will return to
me a string and then i parse that string
into a JSON object and then I can also
read the password from the password file
that is indicated inside the credentials
not Jason finally I replace this two
stores so you don't see my password and
then I string file the object to make it
more like beautiful to put on the
console and then I return back the
password so i can actually use it okay
and next so let's list some instances so
I'm going to load that file along with
this file all those two files i'll show
you that i showed you i will load them
along with these one here on the proper
order to make sure the functions are
aligned and then i'm going to call get
target the creations object will be
there and I'm going to get you get
target for these credentials dot request
that creates me a request object I do
Jason got parts on the return of that
call and then on the response items I
stringify the response to put in the
console of your terminal so let's see
the output of this comb I'm going to use
a project that I've been working on
called nasrin you guys can
has been dot laced instances so lesbians
on another project at all like Alex I'll
talk a little bit more later but
basically it sets up the classpath for
me so here's the the output so calling
jjs for your application so it put out a
did and output foreign credentials it
called the rest api and here's the JSON
output so here's all my information from
my cloud service and then i can again
expand my coding and interact with that
easier using javascript and existing
Java libraries instead of doing a bunch
of curl and W get calls so you can reuse
even more than shell scripts let's see
other example here we can how do you do
a post so they start instance must call
must provide information to the server
hey start the service so we create a
JSON object in JavaScript we give it a
lifecycle state information it called
start the content type of this call will
be application / vnd that comet Oracle
that's that's in the documentation of
the service the entity of the our jug's
RS API you create the entity is string
defying to string your JSON object using
that content type and then you do the
request you create a request object and
then response i just put at your request
post and I stringify that response as
well to get these titles so did it work
did not it does pretty much that
no this is this is like coding
javascript using us horn to access the
Java libraries that already exist this
is Joxer Jersey just an implementation
for luxuries Jersey is the
implementation for jax-rs API yeah so it
will download so how do you know let me
explore a little bit on has been so how
did I set up the clasp for those
JavaScript files here usually I should
do at jjs minus CP Jersey dodge are and
then call least instances right the
thing is if you if I may even either you
know one library gets to another that
gets to another that that's one order
and you end up with this big dependency
three of many jars and if you want to
set a class path for a JavaScript like
this that it will use several different
libraries you want to use maven for them
so that that was the idea that I got
here they've got me here so I define a
package.json file and then I have a
maven property that you said the
dependence is that these scrapes have on
libraries and then I said oh well this
script will depend on Jersey corridos
connectors and those two dependencies
will download to me all the dependencies
they require to work and that's how it
was easy to call this sample and just
say hey give me the disparities
dependency and bonnet so if we look at
the output of nazarene you're going to
see NASA honey will be called it will be
a temporary about your maven project
getting dependencies build a class path
and then call your actual program with
that class path so that's what it does
in our behind the scenes and that's for
me it's free it's pretty cool
so uh so the recipe is you send HTTP
object mostly going to treat JSON or XML
but if you are working with NASA horn to
do those calls interact with with rest
api's I think it's just you just settle
with Jason and you should be fine again
it's not it's not about oh this is
better than curl but I think it's more
reusable than crew and then shell script
being built with curl my friends have
been doing lots of shell scripts to
interact with the Oracle cloud stuff and
I was like I don't want to be like copy
pasting and replacing in this sub string
and and go to j at it and replace all
the strings to find what what I what I
should change and set a bunch of
environment variables you know just give
me a JavaScript that JSON file that i
put my data and then run it it's more
easy to reuse that way you can do that
in crow you can actually call curl from
within the javascript file like I showed
you so you can he can work on both so
that's why I think that's one for these
kind of operations are is better so
whenever you are looking for a cloud
service you're going to look into rest
services you're going to look at bunch
of operations to manage the clock those
cloud services you don't want to use the
web interface for that you want to
automate a lot as much as possible you
want to put a command line on your a
crontab that will we start a service
that has its subscription hourly instead
of monthly to save some money so you put
that on your chrome tab hey activated
service and how you going to call that
well again using some scripts like that
more smart nas MJS is available on
github it's like just like a toy project
you go to github.com / nazan and it will
help you setting up the
half of your national and files you're
going to define a package.json file like
I showed you it's a it's very related to
the npm definition it's pretty similar
the way you configure maven you just put
group ID then artifact ID and then
version it's similar to the gradall
style there is also a docker container
that I put made available on on dr. hub
so what you can do actually and this is
cool you can go to a doctor registry hub
calm you go to the nasm and then you can
do it you can do this dr. run a simple
and it will get the image of course if
you download it the thing is this
container already has maven configured
and openjdk installed and nazvanie
inside so you don't even need to go to
the github project just got the
container and just use it and the second
cool thing is you can you can use it to
run your local projects so that's that's
what i would do here I would do dr. Ron
I'll do talker 1 minus I ta minus V my
current project my folder the current
folder i'm in on my local machine and
then i'm going to map that to the folder
app inside the container and then as
when will execute that program inside
there they don't even need to download
you don't need only to download a jdk
maven or the nazarene ojs file you just
call dr. and you should be fine and then
you can it's like a binary inside your
environment and here's the execution of
that dr. call so you can automate a lot
of stuff this way you can create docker
images that ultimate lots of information
of operations for you
I just showed you this and we have some
time for questions if you want if you
want to look at the source code of the I
can show you right now the source code
of naznin it's a good thank you ought to
check out because it has some tricks to
learn some of the NASA for an API in
Java API intrigues with JavaScript that
you can do inside yeah there was a
question there
yeah let's so I'm glad as an expert here
on that horn that can answer me that so
the specific difference between package
who using package or using java the tag
to import our plans
yeah yeah so I think I I guess but it's
like I'm guessing right I think one of
them will be on the man in the other one
will check the moment it's called and
the other one you just give a reference
to something that will be loaded on
demand when it's actually used I think
that's the difference but everything's
okay so it's not that my guess was wrong
so you just twit yeah because i was
experimenting everything that i was
learning at that moment so like yeah let
me try this one in that too you know
yeah we can so we are like live
streaming so just shot on twitter
hashtag Anna's horn and we'll give the
answer over there after just junk dog is
done
oh this one oh because some packages are
already available out of the box you
don't have to actually import them okay
java.lang java audio they are already
there okay yeah there is also some stuff
with Java effects that you can use magic
calls with the load command it's on a
schema that will load bunch of imports
for you so in the documentation of NASA
for you can see let me see this one so
you can you have these examples here FX
base jas graphics J as in control she
has these are like schemas that will
nest horn will interpret as hey import
me all those classes that are from bates
from basic controls and controls and
graphics for java facts in those classes
will be available like label button I
don't need to import them and just to
load those other tricks you can do
another thing that I forgot to mention
is that you can actually build a Java
fax application with ness horn and then
use that to build use the canvas the
towards the line bars whatever to
monitor your services to build your
stuff to have your own dashboard for
your cloud environment if you want or
for your application of compromise
environment you know so that's the cool
thing you can just I've seen people
doing desktop development with
JavaScript and Java facts because it's
so like I just type in be running and
it's up and running so that's a cool
thing with it simple to jmax I don't
have any simple to jmax right now but
i'll be glad if you could come up with
some and share them with us what
omx jmx yes ones note i don't have
symbols for that but it's it's it's just
a Java API you can just plug that
information if you are doing a java
application you just plug that
information with your javafx controls
and plot that on some chart it's not
hard just takes time now it doesn't
compile is it is interpreted during
runtime that's a JavaScript right so it
will be introverted by the JVM by the
engine of that horn actually and
executed r in one time so it's kind of
reflection but it much much faster it's
all it's all loaded on demand that's why
doesn't take long to start ok so I DS
supporting that so I'm sure NetBeans
eight supports you can debug you can you
can have code computation with that code
compassion sorry for your script so I'm
sure intellij has some feature as well
yes right yes he does yes questions here
yes you can you can call javascript from
a Java code using the script manager
from the Java jsr 223 I guess I guess
that's one yeah 223 right yes yes so you
can you can use the script manager get
an instance of the next horn engine and
then you can use that to evaluate code
from the Java side so I've seen one
example that I saw was the guy put
JavaScript code in the database with a
bunch of tax calculations to calculate
taxes because those little guys change
those taxes every month well at least in
Brazil nuts right here but in Brazil's
even worse like two weeks every two
weeks so there instead of just putting
their calculation for taxes on the on
the Java code that were required to
recompile that code every time so you
just put the logic inside database as a
JavaScript and they evaluate that during
runtime of course you can also use a p.o
sequel but javascript is cooler for that
okay yes one more question I called a
scorned the binder jjs that is executing
inside edge again so it DJ vm is running
so JJ is just a call that we call
directly the engine the interpreter of
that word but he actually are calling
the JVM yep
oh yeah it is it is really really fast
let me see if I can find a simple here
you somehow the Java facts app started
right it's it's fast I hope I can find
another simple in javafx Jonah facts jjs
simples so there's a 3g 3d sample let me
try this 2d you first
so this is a normal javafx application
but coded and being executed with nets
horn it's an awesome application does
that okay it's nothing it's just like 2d
circles walking around doing nothing
there's not a simple 3d rendering which
with ness one as well DJ s minus FX FX
3d version too I guess it's just one
there you go you have our 3d reference
so can you can call any Java API with
nats horn you're just coding in java
script right that's the biggest
difference so i can go to my code 3d
version to you and I change the color to
blue and I'll call again and it's
supposed to be blue there you go but
this is an actual Java normal
application okay so it's it's pretty
fast
then you're going to get and talking
benchmarks and I don't want to talk
about benchmarks yeah yeah that's we can
talk about them later no more question
yep
okay so every time you call the script
manager you're going to create an
instance and you can have a scope and
that that gives you your own context if
you want a new context and you scope you
get screwed turn on the news corp a new
context and in that context you can have
different scopes different levels cause
local scope global spoke scope but you
can you can set whatever context you
want so I can just go to its good
manager you get your instance new
instance and it's a totally different
environment so you don't have variables
clashing between them okay it's like
it's like calling javascript in
different browsers totally different
browsers you can do that from within a
java application
well it depends on how you're going to
evaluate that they then depends on goal
ghana you're going to did it's it's more
about your use case than particularly
issues if you are if you are letting the
user type JavaScript on the text area
and evaluating that because you want
then the guy will call season blood acid
and we'll crash your shut down your
server okay but sure you can you can
define poly security policy for that
okay well one more question is yes I'm
familiar with that but that's for the
Java language no that means you cannot
be able to i'm not sure i'm sure you're
going to be able to open a console and
type java like you do with Python or
Java Script but i'm not sure if you want
to be able to write a script and rerun
that yeah I'm not following that that
specification closely enough ok inside
of that ok we are out of time thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
