the DevOps cloud native microservices
with my sequel workshop in this lab what
we're gonna do is assume the persona of
balaji gupta are java developer and
we're gonna construct some
micro-services to expose twitter data
and then build out the CI CD or
continuous integration continuous
delivery pipeline to expose those micro
services so let's get started
balls first task will be to go into the
developer cloud service and accept the
task or move task number one to create
the initial git repository for Twitter
into the in progress column okay once he
does that he can then go to the
left-hand menu up to the top into the
project window
project window and click on new
repository we'll go ahead and give a
repository a name and we're gonna choose
to import an existing repository and
we'll give you this path to get the code
go ahead and click create
and there we see our code pulled in from
github
you
alright next we're gonna go out to our
build step and click that in the menu
and we're going to create a new build
job so we'll click on new job and give
it a name
this will be our twitter feed build
we're gonna select our JDK 8 that's the
JDK we need for the code that we've
written click on our source control tab
and specify get along with the
repository we just imported next we'll
go out to triggers and we're going to
choose to trigger based on SCM polling
click on our builds
and on the right hand side we're gonna
add a new build step to invoke maven 3
all right now there are a couple things
we need to do in the build build steps
one we need to change clean install to
clean assembly assembly and then we're
gonna go over to our post build steps
and we're gonna choose to archive the
artifacts specify that we want the
target to archive we're going to go down
to our g-unit test results
and drop in some of our code there click
Save and then we're going to initialize
the build now so you don't have to sit
around I did speed up the video here so
you can see what this will look like but
this will take them a minute or two to
complete
you
next we're going to go out to our
deployment step and create a new
deployment profile so we'll give it a
name
you
we're going to select a deploy to the
application container cloud service now
here you're going to select your data
center that was either part of your
trial account or provided to you by your
instructor along with your credentials
to access that you used earlier we'll
test our connection and then use that
connection we're going to set the new
deployment to build automatically and
choose the Twitter micro service example
artifact we're also going to check to
include a manifest a CGS manifest and
we're going to set them memory parameter
pretty small for this so that it'll play
relatively fast last not least we're
going to kick off our deployment process
all right once the deployment complete
we're going to go back to our main
dashboard where we started today
and we'll open the application container
cloud service and here we can see that a
Java SE container was deployed to expose
our twitter twitter micro service
information we can copy this link and if
we paste this link into a new browser
tab we can actually test the get method
for this Twitter data by adding the
slash static tweets to the end in here
we go here are the tweets that are that
are coming in that we can access right
now for this project we we obviously
wrote this code for you for the sake of
time but you can always say go through
and read the code in more detail and one
of the cool things is we're gonna go
back to our agile board now and since
this is completed we've created the
initial repository we can drag and drop
it into our completed swimlane I'll tell
it the amount of time we spin on it and
click OK
and our first task in our sprint is
complete we can also see the report has
updated illustrating the amount of time
and effort we spent on the task alright
now we're going to transition out to our
client image running in our compute
cloud service where we've pre-installed
Eclipse and the Eclipse plugin for the
cloud for you and we're going to go out
and and configure that plug-in real
quick by clicking on the other tab and
searching for Oracle cloud next we're
going to kick click connect and in our
connection details from earlier
you
it may prompt you for a storage password
just hit Oracle for both and hit OK and
you can click no when it prompts you to
create a master password in the bottom
window you notice it's connected out to
the developer cloud service we can see
our agile board and we can even drill in
this time we're going to drill into our
code and if we double click on the git
repo here it'll actually clone the code
down from the developer cloud service
and we can go out and begin to import it
directly into our project
we're gonna import it import an existing
a local repository and we'll choose the
code that was just cloned down
you
and there we go pops up in the window
next we're going to double
look at our issues and it'll begin
fetching back the issues from the
developer cloud service we can see the
one we just created but now we're going
to drill into the step to create a new
feature that there's a filter on the
Twitter rest service so we can see here
many of the same fields that you may
have seen in a previous wizard in the
web only this time we're gonna go down
and except except this which will this
particular task or this particular
feature and when we click Submit here
it'll actually post that information
back to the dev CS so if we go back to
our web interface and hit refresh we can
see that feature tube to create a filter
on the Twitter feed service is now in
the in progress column
let's go ahead and open our code and the
first thing we're gonna do over here is
scroll down into maven and run a maven
test on the existing code just to make
sure that it imported correctly
you
you
you
and when you run this test in your
environment it'll run pretty quickly and
what you want to see at the end is a
build success line item in the console
window here there we go
you see that everything was imported
correctly
now we're going to go ahead and open up
our static tweets that Java code what
we've done for the sake of time here is
rather than have you program out the
filter we've kind of written the code
for you and commented it out so you're
gonna scroll down in the code to where
you see this comment and you're gonna go
ahead and just delete the comments and
there you see now we've exposed our
ability to search on that get in point
the other piece of code that we need to
go ahead and modify is some my service
tests Java this would be R there we go
and just like before we've we've written
the code already for the test
all you have to do is is comment out or
remove the comments around the test
block
you
you
you
go ahead and save all the changes real
quick and let's test to make sure these
changes are working correctly so we'll
run another maven test on the new code
I had an open our console window here
and once again if we did it correctly we
should see a build success at the bottom
all right now let's go ahead and we're
gonna create a new branch so we're gonna
work off the master branch here and
we're gonna call our new branch feature
- which has the filter as a part of it
so I had that branch and then we'll
begin the process to come in and push
our code back up so wish you a commit
and that'll pop up our window we're
gonna want to do a couple things here
which is to add some comments as to what
we did you can notice on the bottom left
hand corner we can see the files that
were actually updated here and at the
bottom we're going to issue a commitment
push
you
everything looks okay here with our new
branch to do the commitment push so
we'll click Next
check it check the next screen and then
click finish
all right and we can see that it was
published back up to our git repository
in the developer cloud service and one
of the interesting things if we come
back to def CS and the web UI we can
check to make sure this happened by
going to the top here in the code
section and clicking on feature 2 we can
mouse over to the logs tab here and we
can see our committed code here and even
drill into the code and see the exact
lines that were changed
you
there we go we can see where we remove
the comments
you
you
all right next what we needed to go is
go up to merge request and this is what
we have to use our imagination a little
bit today we're doing everything as one
user cloud admin so that you don't have
to log in and log out but in reality you
would log in and log out here at this
step so the first thing we do is as Bala
Gupta and we're going to go ahead and
create a new merge request under his
name for feature two click Next
paste in a few details
and in reality our review here would be
Lisa Jones but so if we can move it
quickly we'll just choose cloud admin
now what would happen here is Lisa Jones
would then go into her developer cloud
service and she would look at everything
that was assigned to her she would see
that there's a new merge request
assigned by from bollock Gupta to her
at which point in time she could review
the change files and then make the
ultimate decision on when to merge the
code so she's gonna go ahead and
initiate the merge that will pass off or
initiate our our build job and we can
see the build is queued and then so you
don't have to wait around this take a
minute or two I'll fast-forward through
the actual build process so you can see
what it looks like here alright this is
what it should look like at the end of
the day he'll then pass that to the
deployment phase and your deployment
will take a minute or two to run then it
will complete and now we can go back out
and test our endpoint you see our
original end point still brings back the
static tweets data but now we're gonna
filter on the keyword Expo and we can
see that the information changes and
brings us back every item with that
particular keyword
last but not least let's go into our
agile board and we will mark this
particular feature is completed so we'll
drag and drop it to the new swimlane
make sure we allocate how much time or
document how much time we spend on it
there we go Bala has officially
completed his task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
