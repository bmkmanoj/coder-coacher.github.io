at Oracle code Beijing
I'm your host Javed muhammad with the
Oracle technology Network and I have as
my guest today Kenneth Leung Hume I
apologize who's a senior principal
architect so Kenneth welcome thank you
thanks for coming on the show so you had
a presentation earlier it's quite a long
title API design development government
and delivery that covers quite a very
large scope give us the two-minute
version of of your presentation just
give us a quick overview if that was
about can I just give a 5 second version
whatever whatever works for 30 second
okay okay I what I did if you talk fast
no rush okay it's about a TI lifecycle
management uh-huh that's why I mean you
talk about all the old faces for doing
API from the planning stage up to 33 and
maintenance stage okay and I actually
take some of the topic as the highlight
okay that's the fall curvature is put in
in the titles so so if someone is is the
planning or architecting the API you
know for that particular application
what are some of the important things to
consider I actually go through in the
insider presentation okay or in my
section from two of the topics one is
about what you usually talk what we
usually talk about is the if I want to
develop a API am I going to do a cook
first approach or the disciples approach
is say that again please
are you going to do a water birth okay
do the coding coding first yeah okay
designers or design first okay so that's
why I actually do some a little bit deep
dive in this topic and talk about okay
if you
for some use case if you want to do
something okay
you probably will go with the disciples
approached it also means that when we
develop the API okay we want to have the
formal specification with some popular
format so that our application developer
our consumer of those api can easily use
them okay okay
and for on the other side okay if it's
more like internal use api not that much
about governance or even security okay
then probably might be something like a
corporate approach
get the menorcan too much about the
agile and the dough specification or
those documents identity these on draft
service up and running as far as
possible and then we can do the rest of
the work later okay later
all right so others are like so does
Oracle have some offerings that actually
help in terms of in terms of planning
API is that is the apiary or and exactly
together which is an acquisition that
Oracle has recently made exactly okay so
a theory is a very quick tool for doing
the the API planning and design and help
and in the API first
and design so suppose so my I Section is
more like to cover the overview so that
the potential customer and also our
partners got a quick preview or
understanding about us when a theory
will come in and how it helps and then
later on there is another section
actually delivered by one of our
partners from cap Germany okay here you
actually go through more details about
em endured the actual design phase and
also how to use a theory in the demo a
live demo is that Louis yeah we had them
on earlier okay
small world alright okay that sounds
exciting and if customers want to
actually use a tryout apiary
they do that through the the $300 credit
that we offer for people to try out the
cloud services answer that's very easy
okay if they just want the child a PA
okay just go to apiary and register I
think it's a PA dot I always ya know
because a period tree all the different
tiers of services okay
there's a one three tier okay the
project is not private but open to
public and you can ask as much as
different projects you like so you just
create a project and then you can start
writing the API poop in and having the
spat and documentation generator and
also have the so-called tools different
tools so that the consumer of the API
can actually do some automatically
cogeneration to generate a tying code
for their apps okay all right well it
sounds like a real exciting space and I
guess in terms of it just closing here
is the my first time here in Beijing and
you have any suggestions for any food to
eat or places to visit allomere my
three-day visit if we don't have that
much time I mean today's almost gone and
it's like okay hello food okay
picking that is enough okay that's your
the second persons recommended Peking
duck is a must
okay by the way P Kings name changed
from Peking to Beijing but it's so
called Peking duck which I find very
interesting yeah and for pays to go
piece the Moscow is the Great Wall the
Great Wall okay Great Wall I'm coming
Kevin thank you so much for coming Thank
