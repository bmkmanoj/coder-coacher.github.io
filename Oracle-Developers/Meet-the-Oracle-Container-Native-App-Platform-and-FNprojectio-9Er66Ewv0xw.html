developer community and I'm here with
John Middle Houser who is with our cloud
development team hey how's it going it's
going well how are you doing I'm all
right so great to have you on board
what is your team working on because
you've got containers you've got all
kinds of things that you're they're
working on yeah so I'm part of a new
team that was formed about nine months
ago that and I'm running the engineering
for all of what we call sort of cloud
native application development so the
vision of the team is basically create a
set of products to make it easy for
enterprise developers obviously that's
Oracle's main customer really any
developers to build cloud native
applications what I mean by cloud native
applications is kind of Netflix as the
canonical example it's applications that
scale on demand that are built up of
micro services that can run or route all
around the world kind of the Mott what
you know analysts and stuff called the
modern application development so our
group is focused on taking sort of those
all those products that are out there
tools that are out there
interestingly in a cloud agnostic way so
obviously we work very well on Oracle
cloud but a lot of our tools are
designed to work across any clouds we
want to have Oracle cloud win on what
Oracle wins on which is operational
excellence so best security best
performance best everything but you know
developers don't want to be locked in
anymore so kubernetes is the technology
many people have heard about it's part
of what's the cloud native computing
foundation right
and we just joined as platinum members a
couple of months ago I was up on stage
announcing our I'm the member that they
representative for Oracle thank you that
must be weird yeah look at all these
people
yeah exactly so it's you know it's one
of these foundations kubernetes is kind
of the most famous project but there's a
bunch of other projects so kubernetes
came out of Google's Borg which was
basically the way Google manages their
own capabilities yeah so it's you know
there's a lot of these open source
technologies that have kind of been
market proven by large web techs so
they've been donated into open
source by Google and by uber and by lift
and and these technologies they're
really kind of hard to stitch together
so a lot of what our group is trying to
do is is have a developer focus but take
that best-of-breed proven technologies
put them together in a unified way
expose that to a developer who may not
want to understand all those
technologies they just want to write
code right make it really easy for them
to build modern applications so is it a
driver how are you exposing it yeah so
the the main interface right now from a
visual standpoint we recently acquired a
company called worker yes so it's worker
it's about wer C ke R dot-com
that is our CI CD platform that was the
CEO of workers yelling out that is our
CI CD platform where we expose these
capabilities so one of our major
projects we announced here at open world
a couple days ago was this integrated
developer suite using worker as the
front-end but also provides capability
to spin up container registries
spin up a kubernetes cluster the idea
being that a developer can simply check
in code set up pipelines and worker have
docker register containers built
automatically so all of this is using
containers as a native capability docker
containers built pushed into our own
registry which we're offering deep
integration with Oracle cloud
infrastructure and then automatically if
they want spin up kubernetes clusters as
well so again that taking sort of
technologies that other people have
built that are proven that are getting
traction but making it dead simple for
and then developer to use okay you got
that done fast because we just acquired
apiary and worker and you team kind of
rocks it yeah we we have some incredibly
good engineers yeah so worker started
working with with Oracle in April but we
actually just closed the acquisition
four days ago so we just did some
analyst briefings and Mees was
joking that it's his fourth day at
Oracle and look at all this work we
already did so yes bragger yeah that is
really really cool congratulations thank
you must feel good to have such solid
code out there so fast it is and so you
know we had kind of two major
initiatives that we announced this week
and and if you go back and you watch
mark cabbage who's my boss and runs this
group he did the Java one keynote one of
them is this integrated suite built
around the work or CIC it's D um we're
gonna build micro services on top of
that the other aspect of that is is sort
of how to users how to developers
program and so the other thing that's
kind of the the new way that modern
applications are being developed is is
what's called server lists or functions
as a service okay one of the problems
that we've seen in that world is that
each cloud provider that does it you
know so Amazon of course has their own
Microsoft has their own they they lock
those developers into their clouds so
you know developers don't want that they
want to be able to program in sort of a
cloud agnostic way so what we announced
was something called the FN project and
that's FN project do and this is a
container native but cloud agnostic
platform for server lists so that was
our other big announcement that we've
been doing demos and talking with folks
about and that that again it's an open
source project that we're working with a
bunch of other community partners on but
it lets you develop and deploy and run
your code kind of at a function level
but run it anywhere so you can run it on
your local laptop you can run it on Prem
you can obviously run it very well in
OCI and Oracle cloud infrastructure and
we'll be will be offering a managed
version of this early next year but you
can also use the same capabilities and
run them in Azure or AWS or any of these
so it it really breaks that tie in
between you know server list functions
as a programming and making them cloud
specific unbelievable so we did that two
in the last nine months that was built
by a team that had built a similar
project called iron iron functions but
the team came from iron IO and that's
also a team that we've acquired that
that's within my organization so
lot of what this is as I said we're only
a nine-month-old org is is a combination
of taking folks who have worked on other
Oracle technologies but is being built
by kind of you know folks like myself
who've been in startups for 20-plus
years this is actually my first big
company and it's because I'm within this
org that's this you know it's cliche but
it's operating as a start-up within
ortho right it's right and and and it's
being built by people who have that
mentality great so question for you so
are you deploying these as your own
cloud services or are they part of the
Java developer cloud service or where is
it fitting into that Magic Man yes so we
have managed version so the answer
depends on which part we're talking
about great um
worker is an independent entity right
now it's still being run as worker at
worker comm you can go sign up today
there's a free account for trying it out
free community level account you can
also start to buy it through Oracle as
an enterprise customer so that
experience which I described which was
kubernetes plus a container registry
plus a CI CD that's being distributed
through the worker brands today um
the FN project I described is a pure
open-source project so it is has its own
github repo you can download it you can
try it out we will be offering a managed
cloud service around that early next
year as part of as part of OC I and in
Oracle cloud but the that that's
basically I talked about before you know
the goal for selling these things is
around operational excellence and in
leveraging deep integration with OCI
Oracle cloud infrastructure so the
manage versions of these things will be
sold as independent cloud services down
the road nice
well that's kind of cool yeah so wow you
got so much done in the first four days
that you know it some of these folks at
work yes so let me ask you you're a
developer right yeah at heart okay so
it's been a lot you don't want me touch
production code anymore it's been too
long but yes text editor geez uh well
I'm old so I use VI or vim stuff really
yes
far out I started my world actually as a
Windows developer but that was a long
time ago so you know I went through sort
of the you know Microsoft developer you
know what the heck was it called the MS
VC yeah Visual Studio
I guess Wow butBut when I'm when I'm in
the Linux world I almost called it the
UNIX world which shows my age as well
exactly yeah I'm old school VI VI yeah
wow that's impressive that's pretty cool
okay so which browser do you use do I
have to confess this I use Chrome you
use Chrome yeah okay you're you're cool
you can stay okay thank you see there
was this study well I have a lot of
friends obviously you're still it at
Mozilla Firefox so that's where you know
it's a confession but well there was
this you know just this random survey of
you know which browser you use can
actually will is an indication of how
successful you will be in your career
okay and they said that if you use
Safari or Internet Explorer
you are 30% less likely to be promoted
then somebody who uses Chrome or Firefox
and the whole reason is it's because if
you're using default technologies you're
willing to settle for it right now yeah
that makes sense
well but if you really want something
you're gonna go out and get it including
downloading it and configuring it well
the other one which you may not even
have heard of is a browser called brave
which was started by the guy who wrote
JavaScript yeah and is you know that's
my other choice because it does all
kinds of ad blocking and tracking and
it's really good from a security
standpoint so we
now I have to look into that one that
would be really cool well so are we
going to see you on the road for any of
our code events definitely yeah
me or me or some of my team we're also
because we're becoming very active in
open source we will be at at some of the
major conferences as well so good
the cue brunette ease conference is the
end of the year in Austin and we we have
a bunch of talks that we'll be
announcing some new things at that point
we've become very active in those
communities now that now that it's
official and we're and we're members so
that's kind of our next big wave of
announcements for for my team nice well
that's fantastic
I am so glad to meet you John I mean
sorry that mark couldn't make it
mark cabbage could not make it but
that's okay because chops really really
interesting wasn't he thanks so much
great having you here happy to be here
