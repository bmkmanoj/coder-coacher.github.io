Oracle code event here in London we
really appreciate you making time to
come here and spend the day with us my
name is Deepak Patil I'm a vice
president of engineering in Oracle's
infrastructure as a service platform
engineering team it's part of my day job
I'm responsible for essentially building
various aspects of our structural
service platform working very closely
with our customers or partners our field
and and really help the company build
our next generation cloud platform I've
been at Oracle for about a year and a
half now prior to joining Oracle I was
at Microsoft for 16 years but at then I
left the dark side and came out Oracle
and I've been a software developer an
engineer much of my adult life while
it's Microsoft I was one of the founding
members of Microsoft Azure and that's
where I was until I joined Oracle so in
many ways are kind of grown up in the
cloud or last decade and today I will be
talking about kind of how you can
harness the power of cloud to write next
generation to that application you know
every every industry and every business
in every industry is going through a
generational transformation around cloud
computing and the way the cloud help is
helping eliminate the themes and
boundaries from innovation for
developers it's just been phenomenal and
I've been very fortunate to contribute
to that and watch that up close and
personal so I'm assuming that that the
harnessing the power of cloud 2 to build
your next generation killer application
is really front and center of of most of
you since the topic and and let's get to
it
what happened alright so before before
we get into the details let's let's
really understand where we're at in the
evolution of cloud as a default
computing paradigm there are 60 million
x86 servers being run on the planet
today out of the 60 million servers
seven percent of the servers were
shipped to public cloud vendor students
public cloud workloads that essentially
means that seven percent of worse
computing workloads are running in
public clouds today so of course there's
a lot of talk about cloud and and and
and the momentum around the cloud where
it is also important to understand where
we're at in the general evolution of
cloud as a computing model of course we
all know and at least I believe where
this is going and and how ubiquitous and
how transformational cloud is very fast
becoming nearly year over year the
annual shipment of x86 services is
increasing by about 35 to 45 percent
that essentially means that about five
years from now more than 40 percent of
worst servers will be shipped to public
cloud vendors to run public cloud
workloads but it is also important
important to understand and register
very very in that overall evolution by
2020 besides the excess x86 servers
there will be about 50 billion devices
on the planet and those 50 billion
devices will add about 15 trillion
dollars of GDP to the world capital by
2030 so besides the server's the the
entire cloud ecosystem will encompass
all sorts of devices and it's going to
it's in the process of unlocking
unprecedented power for all of us there
are about 10 million developers more
than a little more than 10 million
developers around the globe and I have
always believed and a lot of people
around me in Oracle I always believe
that that person has a group of people
all of you have had more impact on the
evolution of what cloud it is nowadays
today than any other person of people so
while the transformation to the cloud is
just getting started
it's the best time ever to be a software
developer and I say that I say that for
four reasons number one is the
technology democratization is happening
at a faster pace than ever before back
in the Stone Age which is about three to
five years ago most of the software
software standards data standards
architecture software package software
solution decisions were made either by
the office of the CTO or the IT
department now the access to software
and software solutions is easier and
more seamless than ever the learning
curve for new software technologies is
easier and better than ever and much of
the standards and compliance and data
architecture software standards are
already met by the software that is
easily available so the office of the
CTO and the IT department doesn't make
decisions about what software to use
anymore
it's the developers the phenomenal
transformation that has happened over
the last few years
second thing that has happened is is the
significant acceleration of engineering
velocity the three things I believe have
contributed massively to that
acceleration of engineering velocity is
DevOps
continuous integration continuous
delivery models and and the advent of
micro services again it all speaks to
the the basic premise of really giving
software developers the capability to
focus on the innovation that they are
interested in and taking the seams and
the blockers away and and not make them
focus on stuff or that they don't
want to focus on
I don't want to I hope that word doesn't
go on YouTube
the third elements to just why it's so
awesome to be a software developer is
access to global scale and reach of
software solutions as well as
development teams globally this cloud
again plays a huge role here in terms of
just making this dynamically scalable
infinitely available on-demand
instant global capacity you can decide
to build a solution and plan on
provisioning and deploying and packaging
it and and going live in India China
Japan and Brazil in three four hours
from now that was unthinkable
unthinkable a few years ago bandwidth
growth in 2012 the global the total
bandwidth consumption availability was
less than 100 terabytes per second it
has increased fivefold since then in
five years and it is expected to
increase fivefold from here in next ten
years if somebody had asked me what the
next best killer app is going to be
about ten years ago I would have said I
don't know what the next best killer app
is going to be but I know for a fact
that the next best killer app is going
to massive quantities of data from point
A to point B at the most optimal
efficient and performant fashion the
just the general innovation and
investments in global bandwidth
have made that possible and and we see
the fruits of that today and then just
the general models about distributed
development and and and and containerize
development and all other things like
social development around github are
again making this global scale and reach
easier sorry and the last thing is
social development just the advent of
social development where where this
general embracing of open-source
technologies advent and an evolution of
things like github and evolution of so
and communities around the world so
Oracle is in the process of going
through a generational transformation
itself and really embracing this this
evolution of development models inside
Oracle we have more than 20,000 people
building cloud platforms our cloud
applications and really making the value
proposition of what we have to offer to
the developer community better every
single day so let's take a few minutes
to really walk through the approach we
are taking to build some of the
foundational components of our cloud
platform our core beliefs and core
approaches based on kind of this this
basic premise that for the cloud we want
to retain what's worked and we really
want to focus on modern developer and
deliver what's needed and there was also
one of the value propositions that kind
of I saw when I came over to Oracle
where we're essentially I and a lot of I
and a lot of people around me thousands
of people around me essentially had this
value proposition hey you build
large-scale cloud providers cloud
platforms over the last decade you
learned a lot of lessons you made a lot
of mistakes how about an opportunity to
come over start on a clean slate and
build the first second-generation cloud
platform in the industry there's a
phenomenally compelling value
proposition that kind of drew me to
Oracle and what we are what we have
delivered over the last several months
and and the platform that I'm going to
talk about today is a result of a lot of
vision and a lot of work that went into
that belief and making that belief
happen so the things on the left-hand
side are some other things that we all
we all have come to expect an assumed as
the basic kind of fundamental premises
of a cloud platform you expect pay pay
for what you use and you expect fast
just-in-time provisioning and you expect
yourself self-service and high scale and
all of those things I mean if your cloud
platform doesn't have these things it's
not a cloud platform but then as as more
modern cloud native enterprise
development has started to happen
around cloud a lot of things on the
right-hand side have started to evolve
this is significant expectation around
uncompromised security and governance
from power platforms there's expectation
on flexibility and meeting the
developers where they're at instead of
locking them in a particular development
model or paradigm there's expectations
around uncompromised performance and I
will talk a bit more about them what I
mean by that but we generally think
about performance in three buckets there
is peak performance
there's predictable performance and
there is price performance so creating a
very clear compelling value proposition
around the cloud platform across these
three areas is it has become a newer
expectation and requirement from modern
developers around the cloud platform
none of the cloud providers today have
done a very good job of communicating
creating and communicating the simple
intuitive developer friendly pricing for
cloud platforms so that's another
expectation that the developers have and
last not belief fairly seamless and
complete integration across the ice path
and fatback so that there is this
clarity around the API layer and policy
architectures and configuration
management mechanics and all the
management options and so on and so
forth so a lot of this belief in terms
of retaining what's worked and what what
are our developer partners have come to
expect but then delivering on solve
these newer and and more modern
expectations from cloud platform really
went into us making some core
engineering decisions around our cloud
platform and I'll talk about some of
those so it our infrastructure as a
service platform it starts with our
regional and data center design each one
of our region's consists of three
completely fault independent
availability domains you can look at an
available you can look at a data center
as a unit of capacity in an availability
main so region secession is so different
geographies provide disaster recovery
and all of these availability domains
are connected with nothing but a very
fat pipe they are in different
electrical grids they are on different
fault zones and and really provide when
especially when combined with Oracle's
maximum availability architecture really
provide a phenomenal structure overall
to create higher availability
architectures as I said this
availability domains of these data
centers in each region are connected
with nothing but a very very fat pipe
that allows us to assure our developers
less than a millisecond latency across
multiple data centers within a region so
once we essentially provision and build
these these multiple availability
domains in a region connected by a very
very fat pipe the next step we take is
essentially build a very fast
caleb of flat predictable and flexible
network that is absolutely not
oversubscribed one of the challenges I
had in my previous life was the capacity
resource in each available domain or
each data center that we always ran out
of was net was network ports in this
design because of the flatness of the
network we can grow up to a million
ports in each data center each
availability domain another element is
because of the flatness of the network
and because of the size of the pipe we
essentially assure less than 100
microseconds latency from any point a to
any point B any two hosts within an
availability domain that essentially
means that you can go from a complete
you can go in two or less hops from any
computer ode to any storage node or I
need two storage nodes or I need to
compute nodes
so again we build highly available
highly scalable data center architecture
we build a physical network that is fast
predictable flexible the third thing the
third big decision that we had to make
was how do we build and design our
network there is a raging debate
generally in the cloud community about
where you want to put your i/o
virtualization most of the most if not
all of the existing the current more
popular cloud platforms put their i/o
virtualization in the hypervisor we made
significant investments in treating of
network as our platform so what we did
was we took our virtualization out of
the words our hypervisor and we put that
in the network we call it off box
virtualization of the bumfuck line that
essentially means that everything
running to run it's an own private
virtual overlay network what this allows
us to do is it allows us to abstract the
control plane the policy architecture
and mechanism essentially all the
processing and all the management
mechanism for our cloud platform in the
network what that allows us to do when
it when you put it all together is it
allows us to vend be very powerful
bare-metal servers and vme storage
engineer systems VMs containers any
middleboxes
anything with an IP address onto this
network when you think about bare metal
servers we run no software oracle runs
no software on these bare metal hosts
you can bring any operating system any
software that you want and run on this
very very powerful bare metal servers
and on the other end of the spectrum you
can essentially come and do your
container application deployments on the
same network our general vision is in
future you can bring any IP address and
plug and play in this next
work and all the underlying policy
mechanics the general cloudiness of the
infrastructure will remain the same this
is an industry first in terms of just
the basic architecture of the cloud
platform you have everything from bare
minerals really powerful a terabyte
ramped up bare metal servers to
containers and everything in between the
general philosophy we have is we want to
give you a completely software-defined
virtual data center in the cloud that
you can look to as a seamless extension
of your on-prem data center and connect
either using MPLS or our IPSec VPN are
fast connector or a number of such
options and nearly eliminate themes from
your on-premise data center on your
cloud data center experience so we build
really really highly available geo
distributed data centers as our base
foundational investment then we build a
fast predictable Network on top of that
then we take some fundamentally
different different decisions around how
our virtualization stack and our network
architecture works and then of course we
we we put some really really powerful
machines that you can use in these data
centers as you can see from the specs we
are some of the most powerful machines
available out in the market screaming
fast and and when you eliminate all the
themes from from Network hops and and
and hypervisor overhead and so on so
forth I'll talk about the i/o
performance that you get on these
machines which is unprecedented in the
industry so when you kind of put it all
together the core of Oracle's kind of
infrastructure the service cloud
platform it it starts with essentially
you you a very powerful virtual private
overlay network that comes with a range
of options from bare metal servers to
engineered systems to nvme to VM to any
middleboxes if you can bring firewalls
in the future
middle whatever you want to want with an
IP address and then you also have very
high performance storage attached to the
same network another element we make
significant investments in is a we call
it Oracle cloud ed customer now very few
of you if anybody is going to take
everything you got all of your
applications all of your IT systems and
move it to the cloud by Friday it's very
unlikely so most of you are going to
remain on this this cloud journey you're
all either taking or how taken the cloud
journey are going to take the cloud
journey but you're going to stay in that
journey for a while and and there will
be many of you who will be either queasy
about moving to the public cloud right
away or cannot move to the public cloud
rather because of data sovereignty
residency restrictions performance
requirements integration requirements
and so on and so forth so we take
everything that I described and we put
it behind your firewall and give the
same cloudy experience to you behind
your firewall managed by Oracle through
this model of Oracle cloud that customer
Oracle happens to be the only
large-scale cloud providers that is
responsible for the entire stack I have
people writing software sitting next to
people who are designing the hardware
sitting next to people who are writing
the firmware designing a
software-defined network we are kind of
one throat to choke or one hand to shake
depending on how happier with Oracle
what that has allowed us to do is we
went from concept to general
availability of cloud at customer in 51
countries in a span of nine months and
we continue to innovate and iterate of
course with the help of thousands of
people who are working on on making a
cloud better we continue to iterate at a
very fast pace but a public cloud
deployed in in in our global data
centers in multiple availability domains
and then you're completely private and
secure instantiation of cloud X customer
that sits behind your firewall but then
you can seamlessly burst onto public
cloud essentially makes for a fairly
comprehensive set of deployment options
for for further cloud infrastructure for
you now the key areas that we've made
investments in with respect to
differentiator of course security is big
I remember having talked to the
customers many many customers four five
years ago where security was the concern
behind moving to the cloud and security
is fast becoming a reason to move to the
cloud physical isolation of the server
the investments we are making in
auditing and anti-spoofing
the investments we made in how
segregated our network zones are and
just the general design of a network
where you don't we you can trust us but
you don't have to trust us there's a
zero trust and one made between the
cloud provider and the cloud developer
all of those make for them make make for
this becoming an extremely secure cloud
platform second element is I talked
about performance let's talk about peak
performance as I said real if we put
this service on this super flat and
super fast network and these are some of
the most powerful machines available out
of industry with our dense IO which is
one of our more powerful shapes you get
about 4.2 million for querida ops and
2.6 million for K right ions that's
about ten to eleven ten to twelve times
faster than comparable shapes of compute
capacity available in the market ten to
twelve times with respect to predictable
performance as I said you don't have to
take more than two hearts to go from
point A to point B within an
availability domain
so essentially there is no hypervisor
overhead it's predictable performance at
scale one of the challenges again I had
in my previous life was the was the
predictability of latency especially at
scale between a compute and a storage
node because more often than not a
compute node sat on a different network
than a storage node that won't happen
with us we will within an availability
domain you will always get less than 100
microsecond latency across I need two
nodes across available it domains you
will get less than a millisecond latency
across across the nodes and then across
regions of course but we that's where
the the speed of light matters
but we generally assure you of less than
100 milliseconds latency and there's a
ton of stuff you can do with respect to
development and design and architecture
of your applications when you are
assured of latency at scale price
performance I think I talked about peak
performance I talked about predictable
performance it's again very important
for us to make sure that deliver all of
the superior performance at a very very
low price the the dense IO shape that I
talked about you get twice the course
twice the memory four times the storage
10 times the IRS at 20% less cost than a
comparable AWS shape but as you may have
noticed the theme of bigger innovations
and bigger focus has been on network of
course as you may know of all the cloud
providers you you generally get free or
very very inexpensive ingress because
everybody wants you to put the data into
the cloud it's the egress where you get
taken for a trip when you have to take
the data out we are our 87% cheaper in
Egrets than AWS you get first 10
terabytes of egress free every month and
after that we charge your penny a
gigabyte a month
so our kind of key areas of focus
especially on price are on network but
then again our general-purpose computers
also about 38% cheaper than aw
so of course you get flexibility with
this platform with bare metal servers
you can bring any operating system you
can bring in your hypervisor we have no
Oracle software running on these boxes
but on the same with the same policy
architecture with the same UI and with
the same deployment mechanics and with
the with the same configuration
management mechanism
you also get VMs you get containers you
get engineer systems and the entire
stack for the for the entire scale of
performance requirements another area of
investment for us is this this concept
of compartments where we really kind of
handing the control of policies
resources capacity in the hands of
development teams for management of the
entire entire cloud resources this is
one of our ways essentially of really
addressing the problem of shadow IT so
when you think about our infrastructure
as a service platform and the
integration that is that has happened
across eyes and our past capabilities
from from database cloud service to saw
a cloud service to Java cloud service to
up there cloud service and then all the
all the SAS applications that
essentially have started to take
advantage of the same availability
domain architecture high performance
network high bandwidth network very very
screaming screaming lis fast servers
it makes for a fairly compelling cloud
stack another element for that is very
important for us is to build an open and
secure cloud platform
on on oracle marketplace you you you
have access to more than 700 plus open
source tools and packages and
programming frameworks that you can use
to program on our cloud platform and
this is one actually a very near and
dear to a lot of us engineering leaders
in terms of continuing to make
investments in this I always believed
that multi cloud is a fact of life a
cloud platform providers of the world
have not made a lot of investments in
really embracing the realities around
multi-cloud I want you to put everything
you got in Oracle cloud but I also
understand that that may or that may or
will not happen you will want to have
options and it is very likely that you
will / you will leverage multiple clouds
so our investments in in in really
giving our developers freedom to program
with multiple languages multiple
programming frameworks essentially is an
and evidence of our commitment to to
support whatever you want to do in terms
of multi cloud approach Oracle is making
investments in four areas with respect
to the cloud beyond kind of what I just
talked about
number one is we are as I mentioned
we're we have 20,000 plus developers and
engineers making the cloud platform
better on a daily basis we're investing
billions of dollars in in provisioning
data centers provisioning networks and
servers around the globe and it's a
pretty having having been doing this for
for several years now I'm going to
appreciate how daunting this endeavor is
in terms of going to newly essentially
stamping out footprints of your cloud
platform in a new country across the
globe we have plants to grow in in a new
region around the globe
every quarter and an Oracle happens to
be one of the few companies that has the
capital and the you nearing expertise
and the global partnership network to be
able to do that so all of that kind of
in some ways adds up to just the
fantastic adoption and acceleration that
we are seeing across the developer
communities as well as the customers in
last year alone we were added more than
5,000 new customers who are called
platform as I mentioned we have a couple
of years ago they all of this I talked
about across the eyes has an sas back we
had about we had about 12 services we
have 70 plus services today and that
that again is is it is a testimony of
the engineering investments Oracle is
making in the cloud
we have customers Oracle cloud customers
in 142 different countries and on the
cloud marketplace you have more than
3000 different cloud applications that
you can use written by essentially 900
plus different partners for Oracle and
that's another area of investment that
that we are very aggressively making
speaking of partners especially its kind
of near and dear to a lot of our
developer partners these are just some
of the examples of the partnerships that
we have established over the last couple
three months alone in the big data and
and no sequel space we we just recently
announced partnerships with cueball and
data tracks and skaila again going back
to the to the to the realities of multi
cloud where you can you can use the
terraform architecture framework for
cloud orchestration as well as invest in
vietnam in building your images we have
about we also announced partnerships
with about 70 MSPs
and a size and ISPs or
three months so we continue to make
investments and one of the one of the
histories one of the elements of Oracle
history is the very very strong base of
partners that we have across the globe
so just to underline some of the
investments we are making that space I I
would like to invite Mark Shuttleworth
to the stage Mark's the founder and CEO
of canonical that that Bill's been to
and marks a mark and I have fantastic
conversations a couple of times about
the opposite Rees for the cloud as well
as some of the work that marks company
is doing that unlocks some phenomenal
potential for for some development
opportunities for our for our global
developers so I would love to invite
mark to the stage and take it away okay
Thank You Deepak and good morning
everybody so I don't know how many of
you actually really appreciate what
Deepak showed you in describing the
heart of the Oracle infrastructure
because bluntly London is in a place
where that kind of engineering typically
happens right but what you saw there
based on everything I know about how the
Facebook data centers built how the
Google Data Centers built hyzer is built
how yuba and Netflix and those sorts of
amazing amazing tech centric businesses
engineer stuff that most people never
get to see I can tell you that if you
got a big check from a powerful
institution and got told to go hire the
smartest people who really understand
the very cutting edge of all of that
stuff not to squander money but to
deliver real real performance and
resilience you would end up with an
architecture pretty much exactly the way
Deepak described the Oracle cloud
architecture it really does represent
the state of the art in proven
performance and resilience architecture
which is pretty fantastic it's one of
the reasons I'm really excited to be
here
Deepak used a key phrase which is that
today
is the most exciting time ever to be a
software developer and I think the
reason for that is that it is
increasingly clear to every institution
in the world that the key to their
future growth and success and survival
in some cases is to empower software
developers right you are either working
at a Silicon Valley company that wants
to own a sector whether that's
healthcare or automobiles or finance or
markets or you're working at a company
that is going to be fending off a
Silicon Valley competitor soon right so
the reality is business today is
software-defined and that's why
enterprises are essentially doing
whatever they can to unleash innovation
and so that's really the thing that gets
me out of bed in the morning I have a
great privilege of working with people
who's who define themselves not by what
they preserved effectively of the past
but but by what they created as
potential for the future
and so for me this is really what it's
about it's about enabling people to
innovate around their data right there
are really other than the architecture
right and and exhibit Iike Deepak
described here is first-class
infrastructure but they're very
compelling commercial reasons why there
is a center of gravity in the Oracle
ecosystem that will run best on the
Oracle cloud I have no doubt about that
I think Deepak's commitment that that
ecosystem will also be open and
available to you on other clouds is
exactly right because that's what CIOs
need and want right but they're
compelling reasons to understand why
there'll be a true center of gravity for
commercial enterprise data on the Oracle
cloud but remember that infrastructure
that has that says is common to
everybody right that's not what
differentiates businesses what
differentiates your business from the
next business is the stuff that you
build that's unique to you around that
CRM or that that common enterprise
infrastructure and that's the bit that's
really exciting right
what cloud really is doing is it's about
allowing people to shift responsibility
for common infrastructural things to
people who professionalize that right
and do it to an amazing and amazing way
and it lets you totally focus on the
pieces that are different for you and
different for your business and
differentiates your business but we know
that those things have to be tightly
integrated they have you know there's a
center of gravity around your data your
your innovation has to sit right next to
your your your your your systems of
record and so that's where we see that
ecosystem really being important that's
where we see a bunch of being really
important you may not know it but there
is now more a bunch of in production
than any other version of Linux in the
world and that's been achieved really by
focusing on the people who want to drive
performance and drive change and drive
the future if you're hearing about
containers and darker 80% of that is on
a bun - if you're hearing about machine
learning 80 percent of that is on a bun
- if you're hearing about self-driving
cars or AI 80 percent of that is on a
bun - and that's really what what what
we're here to enable one of the very
exciting hot topics today is containers
TPAC talked about docker and oracle
infrastructure essentially available
through docker and one of the very
exciting themes in the docker ecosystem
is kubernetes we work with both docker
and Google and one of the things are
excited to do together is to bring the
canonical distribution of communities
which is essentially kubernetes straight
from upstream straight from the Google
community effectively as commodity
infrastructure that is instantly
accessible to you right next to those
systems of record on the on the Oracle
cloud so thank you very much for the
opportunity to speak it's a pleasure to
meet you when I walk through the door
someone came up and said thank you for a
good - I use it every day even though
I'm technically not allowed to and I bet
there are a couple of people who feel
that way here today and I would say this
right every major successful growth
initiative in every company that's been
around for more than ten years
with somebody who did something that
technically they weren't allowed to do
so I'm here for you and and good luck
let's do great stuff together Thank You
Deepak
thank you much it's always a pleasure
and a privilege to hear you talk so I
have a few announcements to make because
this is a very important forum first the
Oracle developer code series of events
you are the most important audience um I
don't go to a cio conference and say the
same to them you really are the most
important audience because of whatever
I've said so far in terms of how this
group of people is really shaping the
future of cloud which is a generational
force and transformation for our
lifetime so one of our core areas of
focus especially around that of the
Oracle code event is to continue to
invest in this event well this becomes
the de-facto mechanism for us to share
product updates and innovations share
details of partnerships and really take
the work we are doing to all of you in
person and directly so bob increasingly
as we do more of this code code events
you will see or a lot of us spend a lot
of time talking about kind of some of
this core platform innovation and
partnership announcements so we we
acquired this company called worker I'm
still figuring out exactly how to
pronounce I'm a domestic worker last
week or couple of weeks ago thousands of
users essentially create and and add the
deployment and packaging pipeline use
application deployment packaging
pipelines used by essentially hundreds
of actually millions of deployment and
application pipelines used by thousands
of developed
on a daily basis and loved by developers
on a daily basis as continue eyes
application development gains in
popularity worker is a solution that a
lot of and an option that a lot of
modern developers have started to go to
for their cloud native development and
kind of going back again to driving
innovations kind of horizontally across
the entire stack of is pattern stack
sass vertically across the entire stack
from data centers to to continued eyes
the applications this is an example of
of the capabilities that we're adding to
the Oracle cloud platform so I'm very
excited to announce and and talk about
the acquisition of worker another thing
that we are not we another partnership
that we recently reached at is our
partnership with Pluralsight Pluralsight
is a global leader in in technical
training and cloud-based curriculums we
have been working with guru sites for a
while as an as an Oracle code attendee
you get 10 days of free subscription to
Pluralsight we have a bunch of Oracle
cloud assets and we are continuing to
invest in building courses that that
will be made available on on Pluralsight
and we are continuing to invest in our
partnership with guru site but but
please visit below site check out some
of the Oracle cloud courses available
there and and we will continue to make
investments in our in our partnership
with tools like as the de-facto vehicle
for for putting cloud cloud based
training material for our platform
investments so with that I think that's
the end of my talk again thank you very
much for all of you to come here spend
