have all of you here for the last
session of Java one so I know that a lot
of folks have already gone flying home
and it's a privilege to have all of you
here because today we're going to talk
about how to run your existing or your
new Java EE applications with wild flies
form in the auto complication container
cloud matsunaga today I have here my
friend have I albany vidis we're both
Brazilians and we were both directors of
developer experience at red hat and my
twitter handle it's a tia naga referees
at rafa been a java champion and also a
microsoft MVP Rafa has a lot of
different certifications 10 meters of
the apache delta spike project so he's
one of the most competent engineers i've
ever met and he today he's helping me to
provide you a cool demo of how while
flies form works and how is that can be
and I always like to start my talks with
the sentence from Forbes now every
company is a software company you don't
work for a bank you work for a software
company you don't work for an industry
you work for a software company because
software is changing the word without
that we leave I also like to introduce
ourselves as software craftsmen and some
people like or dislike the software
craftsmanship movements but the best
definition of software crafts solution
that I have is that software craftsman's
are people that care about their code
about their job because we know that we
can change the people's lives for the
better with software and we decided to
make a choice to deliver better software
invest faster for changing people's
lives and one of this the common
examples that we have on this new
economy that we leave this new word that
we're leaving is that the largest car
transportation word in the world also
cars the largest lodging company in the
word owns no real estates which is
Airbnb the largest online retailer in
the world owns Don stock which is Ali
Baba and the largest content network in
the world produces no content which is
facebook all of them have in common the
fact
that these companies only exists because
of software so software is changing the
word and we know that software can
change the world for the better and for
the worse we decide to be the ones that
responsible for the best and we belong
talking a lot about DevOps and micro
services and lately we have seen the
appearance so many different fetch our
frameworks like drop wizards we can also
generate to use verdicts we can use a
spring boot and now we also need it for
a long time a fetch our solution for
java ee applications and now we had that
that's why we have that that's why we're
here today to talk about wildfly swarm I
know swarm maybe is not the best name
because a lot of things are called swamp
reform these days including a container
orchestration platform from docker the
wild flies form you know if you know the
watch fly application server from Red
Hat JBoss wildfly swarm is the first
definition that we can give to you it is
that what fly swarm can be the fetch our
solution for a traditional java
application server in this case wildfly
but what platform it's more than that
because you couldn't just break a
monolithic web application server and
but on that in separate separate peace
who had a lot of work in engineering
we're proving that every day because
what why platform needed a whole new set
of capabilities to be implemented in top
of top of that to support this new kind
of self containers fetch our
applications and you need dynamic
dependencies you can rely on everything
on one single class f you need to be
able to pull all of this dynamically you
don't want people configuring XML files
to be providing which resources do you
have in your fetch are you had to
automatically find and configure
everything else so we say that the our
slogan for websites farm is what flower
is just enough application server or
even better right sizing your services
you can do your service dependencies
with the right amount of jars that you
need to run what you want
and for example in a traditional
application server if you're running on
top of Wild flash form you will have
your application built on top of the
Java specification and you have
implementations for jax-rs you have ejb3
you'll have the transactions IP is you
have JTA you have korba you have the
batch API but being honest how many of
us use all of these ap is doing every
day so maybe we just we just want to
create a jax-rs endpoint we just want to
to you create a corp application if I am
writing programs with that and all we
wanted to run some bad jobs without even
interface want to process all that but
we have to bundle all of these things
inside the an application server we have
to deploy and since we're talking about
we want to deploy in the Oracle
container application cloud and
everybody is talking about containers
these days too when you say oh maybe I
should provide a docker image and you
know everybody these days also use the
infrastructure as code tools to automate
the environment provisioning and you
don't want to be packaging like 500
megabytes of application server in every
doctor image at a tribute you could be
better locating that resources using a
darker image layer but some platforms
maybe don't offer support for that so
they require you to provide in your your
container creation metafile to provision
or oil your whole environment so to
answer all of these questions that's why
we created wildfly swarm and you know if
you just want to create a resting point
you just a very lightweight jar to run
this up to Jesus kind of application you
can just add the jerk there as
dependency and it will automatic run in
your world fly swarm fat jar and we're
not restricted to fetch RS to you can
provisionally world-class form your own
ward the and it can be deployed in any
application server supporting Java in
the markets so we have at least two
different options for you to create
artifacts to go to the production let's
play flexible you can use a fetch are
you can use a standard war and you can
add a lot of different dependencies that
we
bundling inside what flies from these
days to running this new microservices
word and let me open here my browser
before continuing my explanation I would
like to show you some very cool things
that we have at the wildfly dash swarm
dot IO ah you know for many of you may
have touch it spring boot and spring
boot generator the starter in the
initializer we also have a word fly
swarm generator so it has a very similar
interface so if you want to add your
dependencies your 15 from project and I
just wanted to dig we have a lot of
different things if I could just run
jax-rs with jay z XB json p and
everything else but if you want to check
everything that we have for now we can
open all of the available dependencies
you can see we have integration
technology like camo we can use our
Killian CD Iraq station Drew's batch API
came a 4gb in camo for all sorts of
components that you can integrate what
else we can use hystrix everybody these
days in Microsoft's Wars needs to talk
about resilience and circuit breakers
and everything else we also have
integrated history which apart from the
neck Netflix OSS and inside water flash
warm as you can see that people love
camo and you have data sources you don't
need to configure that your data source
inside your application server anymore
you can use a code or even environment
properties to bootstrap your application
server using what flies form to you can
use a data grid like finished pan you
can auto configure in data sources for
post with my sequel h2 what else you can
be reactive and integrate what flies
form with verdicts we had just had
another session about verdicts on money
so you can integrate is so some of the
engineers might be working with some
more tight integration between verdicts
and CDI for the for the javits 20
to integrate the event loop of vertex
their stream you have to talk on the mic
they they are planning to integrate a
CDI events with vertex of event was
eventbirth that's right thank you that
was what I want to complicate plan
vertex is a distributed application
reacted it to be the application
platform so any distributed application
platform needs an event bus so you might
be one using JMS for that but vertex has
its own event bus and sometimes you need
to integrate with other technologies
that's that's what they're working on
right now because we talking to them
today and other ribbon if you want
client side load lab load balancing and
all of the things there we have an
extensive list of supported technologies
you can just speak whatever what you
want and we will just add that small
dependency to your classpath and in your
dryer when you generate a fetcher with
one flies form so one of the pain points
of many projects that we have to deal
with is that we have conflicting
versions of dependencies your project in
our project and it's hard to just keep
copying and pasting a poem so we
generally use it created a quad fly
swarm generator too easy all the steps
because you know most people do in fact
our approaches are creating
microservices if they're using
microservices probably they're
generating a new project then you have
the you can have the benefit or having a
bomb dot XML that you know that we work
right out of box instead of just have to
configuring and sorting out what is
working what is not working okay so
that's the main generator starts I'll be
back just in a moment I want to show you
now that how what fly swarm works at
least for the bootstrap part you can use
what flight you see there's very little
java code when you bootstrap and jax-rs
endpoint use 1 plus warm but sometimes
you want more than that so you don't
need the main method insides water flies
form if you don't provide any main
methods in your
jar and you know do not declare that on
them your manifest file it was simply
consider that your applications standard
java application and we will look for
java ee resources in the bootstrap and
deploy your your applications I standard
Java e-file but also if you have
packaged like multiple different
resources and you want to be very
specific to what one to deploy to your
java application server you can use your
main method to create a new swarm and
then create a deployer using shrink-wrap
you specify which are the files and
resources that you want to add in your
newly boot war file and then you can use
the deployment that's one of the options
which is kind of traditional by new
nodes and approaches require that and
maybe you want to bundle in a fetcher
application and a pre-existing jar from
the third pre-existing war from a third
party so that's one of the easy ways for
you to be bundling that also if you but
you if you want to configure it
programmatically use your comment line
using an interesting dsl for you to just
be now to completing the things that you
want to configure you can use also also
use the swarm class to provide the
fractions that you want to configure for
you to first be clear for each one of
the dependencies that you want to add to
what fly swarm in what flying swarm
terminology we call that a fraction so
fraction is an auto detectable and pack
and prepackaged piece of a third time
for party dependency that you had to
outfly swarm so that's the terminology
of so a fraction if you want a data
source for h2 there's a fraction for
that if you want to use jpa there's a
fraction for that so now we're
configuring the fractions and then you
just configured that using your your
plain old ide you start and deploy that
so that's the one of the three options
that we have for deploying wild flies
for modifications no main method just
let what flash form audited out to
detect everything for you you can use
you can use shrink wrap to create a jar
selecting the resort
you want to add or a third party library
that you want to add and you can use the
dsl that swarm has to configure it to
programmatically configuring your your
your dependencies in as fractions okay
so now back we want to show code
something running so generate a very
quick project with wildfly swarm I want
jar x RX we've CDI and i'll just name
here one java one I'll generate the
project it generates a zip file I'll
just unzip it and it shows me here John
one you can see there is a pawn dot XML
some files come example rest that's a
rest endpoint and it creates a hello
world end point if an open here in my
very beautiful oops Visual Studio code
well not the best ID for java who knows
but i'll change that okay that is open
at least with Adam where else people
will start complaining with me
okay now we have an open another open
source test text editor and you can see
that it generated a default endpoint
which face hello ward endpoint do reply
with a text plain hello oops hello
javaone 2016 from wildfly swarm if I
just save that you know there's just one
java file in my and just a pawn docked
XML in my project that's enough because
all of the dependencies are provided by
wildfly swarm and if I get to him go
here and is accurate download Java one
and there it's a maven project mvn
package
its assembly my fat jar will give the
wildfly so I'm plugging which is already
on the pawn dot XML forget it to the
target folder you get to see it
generated I standard war file because
it's a java application too big ok can
see it's ok so there you have the
standard war file and you have a demo
dash swarmed jar which is my fetch our
it has approximately eighty nine
megabytes I know it might sound a bit
big but we're improving the size in each
release so don't be scared about that
you have eighty nine megabytes and it's
a factor if I run it javed s jardim o
swarm it's going to bootstrap a what
flies former environment with just the
jocks Derek Derek X John R X dependency
and CDI if we ran let's see if we hello
is working localhost 8080 hello yes
hello jawan 2016 from wildlife swarm so
that's the very basic demo with the
generator that I wanted to show you
because you don't it doesn't have to be
hard to to bootstrap your application
but Raphael has a much cooler demo using
what flat form that you'll be able to
show you so what ad so just presented to
you is the hello world as you can see
it's just it's very simple basically I
just need a class with my jax-rs
endpoint and a pony xml one xml file one
class file and it was able to create the
detox areas and point another way that
you can use to run besides running the
package and running government the duck
java def jar is that you can call the
whitefly swarm plugin from your
from your console for example if you
call call swarm vote fly swore run with
a plug-in that comes together in the
poem XML let me open the points ml here
one of the things that were created in
the generator is the Declaration of the
Walt Weiss worm plugin if you do that it
will not only package but will
automatically start application for you
oh of course was our error here that's
nothing special probably because I
forgot to clean my environment let's run
it again dimos you know yeah so as ads
on explains it will first transform that
in a war file because it at the end it's
a warrant application but it will get
this application will get ended where
they warp i bought my application so
something that I'd like to do here is
start to produce some some more code so
we can deploy at Oracle cloud I have
here a code that I saved
it's always better to commit your demo
code from get before going the abduction
stage because something can always go
wrong yeah so what I have here besides
the hollow road I created entity a jpa
entity I have a repository implemented
using a posh dealt spike which is very
similar to the features of spring data I
have my endpoint with Jax areas in the
path message that receives a post read a
message and a gap tree to get all the
existing message from the repository and
finally we have a utility class that
provides the ant identity manager
factory besides that I have a import
sequel it's a file that we will just pre
populate my database a declaration
configuration file for a part out spike
the being XML to an evil CDI and the
persistence that uses that jpa uses to
get my data source but I is something
that I like to show you is how this data
source were was created you can see that
basically I don't need a main i'm in
class to start my hello world
application but since i need to
configure the data source i use here
some java called a double click here
just ok thank you i just used a java
code to declare my h2 driver and then
declare my data source with my
connection my username and on any other
theaters that i need to enable for these
data source so let's finally run this
and see the result
aven clear wildfly run what fly swarm
run oops world flies clean clean not
clear
so perform the same stuff that happened
before it creates the dwarf aisle it
uses the water is warm plug-in to enter
that together with Walt fly and finally
deploy the application
you can check that just the jar will be
bigger because it's using jpa and h2 the
JDBC driver so we added up be a few
dependencies to this this jar yeah and
let's try that so our hello keeps
working we have here the hello from Walt
fly but if we go to and today I endpoint
message we can get the message from the
database in using the JSON format okay
great race you can show the main code
again just a second yep okay because we
know that when using docker images for
for example in containers use sometimes
in fact most of the times you pass you
some information using environment
variables so you have some magical
environment variables or processing
properties you can pass to outfly swamp
so to all come cutter configure some
fractions but if you want since we're
just using a DSL side java code you can
use in system.getproperty to get the
environment variable that you have set
up and you can just inject in your code
here so it's just plain old java code
reliable you know what is exactly what
is happening in fact that's my favorite
approach instead of just using magical
environment variables in fact let me
show you this because I haven't one
example using inside a container for
example here I'm connecting to my sequel
it's basically the same the same class
but I use season get and or get our
default data source username if I don't
specify any environment variable it will
get my user and my password but of
course I could override that with an
container environment variables okay
particularly I prefer this approach
because it's my code I know what is
going on and I know where the property
comes from so but it's a matter of
choice yeah as a developer oats well not
the road but experience the developer I
I like to see the code where the common
things come from so okay perfect now
this code is located now in github so
you can get it yeah and I'm going to
show that because I want it okay and
this code we just committed and pressure
to github.com rafa been named as last
job one 2016 it's a very simple
application and we're going to deploy
this application to the oracle
application container clouds so I want
to show you a bit of our container
application clouds we're using a trial
counsel you have 30 days for free to use
any kind of resource that you want so I
mean you may want to give a try to and i
will also would like to thank Bruno
Borges which is a product manager from
Oracle and their engineer team because I
had some troubles of the Oracle
application container cloud before
javaone we're not trying to run some
demos and they help Italy very quickly
to set up everything so thank you very
much and today i've been testing of
course the demos before the session and
if they were much much much faster than
monday mainly because i believe that on
Monday people at open word might be
demoing the same thing that I was doing
so the cloud might be over capacity so
it was very slow and laggy sluggish but
today's fast so maybe we'll be able to
see the end of a deployment ok but let's
go with calm because I don't know how
will they be the output so we have a
cloud account here I have an account I
have to choose my data center all of my
deployments have been doing us jus I dig
into my services and here i have my
account you have a lot of different
options but for me i want to use
containers to for my deployments so
we're going to open the application
container platform here you have metrics
quotas and everything else i just use a
service console which is the thing that
I used to deploy
occasions you see I have the pre
deployed some applications to test it
they are all working and you can specify
some some resources so the deployment
options that I have their Oracle
application container cloud for me to
create a container and deploy that's to
work with loud I have to open here
gratification the type of applications
we're at the Java one so choose java
okay I have to give a name into the
application so here it's going to be
last demo of jawan and I have to choose
their archive I can choose a simple
application it's just a hello from them
I can show a storage path the storage
path is a path that is inside Oracle
cloud storage so if i have previously
are the uploaded of deployment fire to
the Oracle storage i could be able to
reference the path here but not usually
a easy solution or can usually up use
the upload application archive i will be
providing and uploaded the file that i
want so i have pre butte one that'll
show you how you have to do that so now
don't one here
right
Here I am in the right folder so
basically to deploy to the order
application container cloud you need a
mann fast JSON file which configures the
environment that you want to want to run
your application for java SE you have
two different options you have java 7
and java 8 okay java 7 in this case is
supported by oracle but if you're using
the free version you you probably want
to stick with Java 8 i'll be using java
8 and you can provide a command which is
the command that you will be using to
run your application so you see you can
run up just about any java application
has a command line to start up so you're
not trying to just fetch our approaches
I could easily be unzipping a whole
application server in my current folder
and just provide the command line to
start it up from here so no big deals I
could be using that but probably you
don't want to do that because there are
better deployment options for you to do
to be using like for you for example
Oracle provides the weblogic application
server as a service it might be a better
fit if you want what if you like
weblogic to deploy there but if you want
to use a light weight platform like one
fly and you want to use the wildfly
swarm approach you just have to provide
Java that's jar and you can provide a
beautiful here port for you to property
for it for you to bind it to the right
port and the jar the jar that I want to
run you can check the since I'm
providing the port parameter I here to
my comment line eat it behaves much like
Heroku you know I don't know how many of
you have played with Heroku loco is the
is it was a great platform when it was
launched it now it could have improved a
bit over the years but you have to
provide the to your application because
your application has to change to
dynamically accommodate the port that
you'll be binding instead of just
mapping maybe a better approach but we
have a configuration file that map's the
exposed part that you want to the world
with the support that is being binded
within a container but that's approach
for Oracle cloud and you will check
there is no docker file no possibility
of for me for creating my own doctor
image and uploading that I can't also
provide my own docker file to upload for
that and I kind of understand the secure
the reasons behind it because running
doc spontaneous oops as routes as root
can you hear me okay as root is this
still an issue so it's kind of hard to
guarantee the security of your
containers when each one of the
developers can provide their own docker
file so maybe that's the free one of the
reasons the Oracle prevented the
creation of docker images from the
developers so basically you just have to
provide your own time which means that
Oracle has to based images for the for
us java 7 and Java 8 that's the only
base image that you can choose
everything else you have to run on top
edge over you can you need to generate
an artifact we everything that you need
and upload to the Oracle cloud and a
command that you want to run so that's
the only option that you that's a run
command from docker that's the only
things that you can use from for the
configuration of your container and then
you have to add you have to create a
tire fire or a zip file with all of this
contents the contest that you need to
run application including all of the
dependencies and libraries and the
manifest but JSON file if you provide a
zip with that let's create a zip zip
last demo dot zip with my demo swarm jar
and my manifest JSON if I provide all of
that in a single jar or a zip file which
now size is about let's demo 107
megabytes I can upload it to the Oracle
application container clouds let's demo
here click configure how many instances
I want running in the environment how
many gigabytes are want around I'll run
it just one gigabyte because what flash
form is very lightweight and creates now
it's uploading and since most of the
Java want and these are
Wi-Fi network is awesome at this point
sao bua it will upload very quickly we
will also be the point but we don't want
to wait for that i have previously i
know it sounds like cheating but open
another tab here but i need a backup and
service console and the same application
that i'm deploying right now has has
been previously deployed a few minutes
ago so here are the statistics memory
use it some of the activities and
interests you think is the Oracle
content application cloud always expose
your you need to expose an HTTP or HTTPS
resource and it provides you an endpoint
which is this big domain dns name and
you might want of course monte to map
using us name to your own application
domain name if I open that / messages it
will provide me the same messages that
Rafael shoulder localhost the same
application was just now deployed to the
Oracle container application clouds so
that's
okay let's check if it has already
deployment my application is being
created and now I have to wait for the
resources to be the point but you see
once it's finished it to be running at
least I hope successfully so some
confidence considerations of the
deployment options that we have so not
using docker containers they might have
the reasons for that but that I think
that's a down a bad thing to improve the
oracle application container cloud
because maybe dr. fios is a thing that
is most developers you know in use these
days you can change your base image you
have to use the base images that Oracle
provides you for the same reason for the
security but maybe you would want to
bundle additional dependencies instead
of just uploading every time and again
the same dependencies so that's another
reason for consideration but the biggest
complaint that I have about this
deployment options is that you don't
have a CLI for doing that you have to
open the application container cloud
console you have to get and upload the
thing the only thing that you can do for
now to automate this process I would be
able to upload my head fact to the
Oracle storage to be doing that but
there is not more options of that so my
assessment of the two of the Oracle
container application cloud for now is
that first they intend to keep using
docker for the containers second they
need to improve a lot and if you want to
have the mindshare for us developers at
least here starting a job one maybe we
need to prove the developer experience
using some CL is for us to provide an
upload or contains because we don't want
to be accessing the console maybe I
could just use in or HTC upload
something to upload my files and
everything has to be automated and
another important point is we want
always to develop our applications using
the same exactly environment in
development testing and production
Destin environment can be provided in
the oracle application container cloud
so I know that the testing and
production will most likely the same
environment but I have no way of
configuring a development environments
email machine using the same base images
the same java version and the same exact
environment that I'll having the Oracle
container application cloud so that's
one of the points of improvements I need
in the industry in the medium term to be
able to have a way to set up a
development environment which is similar
to the one in production in my machine
so i can test my application at the
container that is getting butte inside
my notebook instead i have to deploy
every time and again i imagine if you
remote workers i might might not have
the uplink that I have today or if I
mean I'm in a plane I want to be able
I'm going to fight over Europe like
going to take me 12 hours in the flight
I want to be able to develop and test my
applications so that's one of things
that's certainly the Oracle contain
application cloud can improve and that's
I believe that most of the containers
providers these days are trying to
develop an offer to developers because i
think is crucial first to be able to
compute a very effective deployment
pipeline and not on pipeline development
development environment okay so what
else could I say take it again so I
tried both protocols HTTP and HTTPS they
automatically upgrade your connection to
https either though if your application
is only exposing an HTTP endpoints so
you have no option of using just plain
HTTP HTTP which is a good or can be a
bad thing depends on how how you see but
i'm trying to see from the positive side
security is a priority here you need to
use an S TLS certificate and I went into
this issue because on the previous demo
that I did here i was using verdicts and
ID
know that I need an HTTPS point so we
had to configure last minutes to change
our live coding so that's that was a
cool thing and we showed you one fly
storm but if you want to deploy any
other kind of jar that exposes an HTTP
in point you're free to do that because
you just need to prevent or to provide a
command line that can run about just
anything you may you may be able to
provide not only the port no because
sometimes you want to deploy you want to
configure application dynamically in
each one of the deployments the jdbc URL
is one of these options so not only the
manifest JSON file you can also create
another file called deployment Jason in
that deployment that JSON fire can
provide the configuration for your other
environment variable environment
variables that you want to pass through
your application so you can dig into
your source code and capture this
environment variables for configuration
so you're not stuck to just the port
parameter you can create other
parameters in a peck peck the deployment
JSON inside your zip or tar file upload
that and will be run successfully to
okay so you have this option student so
for the Oracle container application
cloud that's what I wanted to show you
so it's not that hard for you to deploy
your applications in fact one of the
things that I may also maybe that could
improve that's a tip also because
developers usually the trial is limited
to 30 days I had to create true there
are different accounts because my
expired I create another one with
another email to be able to demo demo
here today but usually you don't have a
specific time frame of 30 days to be the
point and it's very common in other
platforms for you to have a coder you
can run one container for free for
whatever the time that you want for you
to be testing so that's a useful thing
for for developers for us to have that
available so you placed it so you place
the application to deploy now
the Oracle cloud Oh Kenny yeah I once
see it's running really finish let's
check I said lastima right don't wanna
thats diva of course I'm the developer I
want ok I want to learn that in it you
know succeed oh it's running and since
the one that I deploy it was the last
demo which for me luckily it will be the
last game of the week and because this
is my sixth session so might be a bit
tired and esteem oh oh it's fit run and
messages ok so it's running successfully
has been deployed so another thing that
I've noticed in the past weeks that the
performance fluctuates a bit depending
on the data to running I guess they're
just improving their data center
capacity so it fluctuates so how Monday
it was it was very slow it took me like
30 minutes to deploy an application but
today is reasonably fast on the week
before job one each one of the points
was taken like 15 seconds which is a
very fast in reasonable time but this
week I know because of the workload and
everything else and this is a new
offering so it might the the performance
is still fluctuates but that's that's
some of the things that I know that
they're certainly trying to improve ok
so that was the most some of the quick
demos that we wanted to show you I also
would like to inform you that wild flies
form is one of the first micro profile
implementations that we have available
so it's a joint community just to
improve the things around this fetch our
approaches that we want to use with java
ee specifications so guess the message
that I want to tell you is that your
java ee skills are still very available
in this new microservices word you don't
have to discard that to start choosing
and other different technologies because
we want to
we know that the Java EE platform is
very powerful we can keep using that so
I don't know how many of you check it
Adam being sessions at each other one
where he was using macros just plain old
java programming to create some very
nice microservices using the iPads that
we have today so you don't have to throw
away all of this knowledge you can keep
using Java EE for your applications and
if you want to dig into the fetch our
world to create these containers to
create to deploy applications in
different environments like the Oracle
container application clouds you can use
what flies form to generate this fetch
are using Java EE still using Java EE
skills to deploy that and since most of
the things that we're using today for
micro service are open source like the
netflix OSS stack you can also integrate
that and white flies from can also
configure that's automatic for you so
that's one of the key points that i
wanted to show you and all of this
content about microservices wildfly
swarm container creation container
deployment container consideration
platforms is available and or will be
will be available at developers redhat
com so we have a lot of videos articles
tutorials we have webinars we have
O'Reilly books all for free just if you
registered developers com we would love
your feedback and if you have some
direct feedback for us we are available
at twitter at anagha at rutherford NJ
will be more than happy to assist you in
any questions that you need to deliver
better software faster and that's what I
had to say for you today thank you very
much for being here thank you
and if you have any questions we are
available for some how does what flies
form stands against spring woods okay
that's number of a question that we here
too yeah because everybody these days is
talking about spring boot what i have to
say i work at Red Hat I love spring boot
because I think it's an awesome
framework for you to develop a new
microcells applications but I also
believe that we have some different
niche markets for each one of these kind
of vacations java ee is is provided by
the standards committee innovation must
not come from a stance committee that's
the opposite of standardization so each
one of these companies in the java
ecosystem must innovate biden servants
to check what works and what doesn't
work so later it can be standardized it
so spring boot took the lead on the
factor approach on the outer
configuration thing on the providing
dynamic dependencies in auto registering
so it has a lid on that because it kind
of used this concept what else i also it
was a very good thing for a spring boot
to integrate the netflix OSS stack for
cloud first applications so i can see
that it's a trend that probably we are
going to see we were already seen macro
profile and mostly like like we saw in
the jaw bones keynote we're going to see
that's also integrated to java ee
probably java e9 and so standards always
come later and we're seeing a lot of
different innovations to what class form
had has some great innovations that we
don't have we don't see in springwood
and what else drop weezer also had some
effect drop beautiful was the first
fetch our implementation available to
the market but they they took a long
time to reach 10 so spring boot took
over and and since we are using micro
services and you have many different
thing teams inside the organization each
one only its own in points maybe you
know that's a java enterprise market
usually say
mounted in a bit between Java EE and
spring so you might have spring
developers that they want to use fring
boots but you also have a huge amount of
java ee developers that I want to learn
everything again so they want to reuse
their java in skills so they will be
able to keep running or keep creating
their numerical services using java ee
so I think it's important for technology
like what class form and other fat
charge of e containers to be pushing
this boundary so I can advance and the
later standardize on plain old java okay
okay I'll be very honest not yet but
yeah yeah we know because we see that
it's working and why not because we at
Red Hat we can innovate to we can
provide great things to the market so
competition fosters innovation we want
people innovating so we can let us check
Oh what is the minimum amount of set of
features that you need to be able to
discuss actually deploy a java
application so we later we can put in
Java EE and since we might be spectin
java ee 9 42 thousand at the end of two
thousand 17 yeah it's a good point to
see what's failed and what one so and
also you have on the point you want to
study we r enterprise companies we have
an enterprise monolith you want waked up
tomorrow with a Microsoft architecture
oh we have the thousands of springboard
applications popping up in my life that
you it's not going to happen so you have
a legacy I'll call now legacy java ee
monolith and most of the cool things
that the netflix stock OSS provides you
don't need for enterprise application
yeah so instead of just seeing what
school you need to check out
requirements you because you won't be
needing all of that and maybe on that
new piece that you're creating to
integrate it to your enterprise monolith
okay maybe you can use the features just
like the atom in session you can use
plain old java ee because it will be
enough for you to provide and it will be
much faster than just having to learn
spring boot because you already know
java ee so it's it's a matter of trade
off so i would you use this fetch our
approaches like spring boot drop wizard
and wat fly swarm if I had no legacy if
I had a new team guys that guys that
just drop it off college so they have
fresh start so there is no legacy to be
keeping maybe that's a good point but
for enterprise companies I don't think
that is the best way because we have to
keep the living room valium and from the
experience that will be having the past
like eight months talking to customers
visiting people and trying to develop
solutions for enterprise companies that
have legacy sue to go on I still believe
that we're just migrating very slowly
for now keeping splitting just a small
piece into microservices so most
enterprise companies won't have 20 micro
servers running but I believe in a big
old monolith and three or four specific
strategic microservice where we want to
innovate faster running and on these
endpoints you can use any of these
technologies so that's one of my
considerations around java ee spring
boots and micro services that's how i
see it happening because there are
different words start our ports unicon
words and the horse word all the
reliable enterprise companies for the
odin reliable one I can see that Java is
too i have a lot of ground to cover it's
going to be very popular for many many
years to come ok how about i have answer
any more questions
okay when I run it it shows only eighty
percent okay okay when you when I start
when you start what jboss three hundreds
here it's showing any percent okay
honestly I don't know the difference is
ideal if you run jboss on your machine
300 megabytes by the Oracle contain
application cloud is running yet Oracle
is showing eighty percent memory
consumption honestly I don't know how
they count the number so I can tell you
that because the same memory consumption
that I have in my machine should be on
the Oracle contain application cloud so
here we about the same 250 or something
but I don't know the resource allocation
that the account if you if they have
some overhead of the containers some
other things that are spinning up
together and all of the accounts We Need
to Talk somebody from Oracle cloud to
show us how they count the memory of the
applications okay and just to be fair
because since they charge also pair
memory yeah it's important how they
count that
ok the question was when I build a word
flies form a vacation application fetch
our it doesn't it doesn't just pick the
jboss jboss application server modules
because what flash form has much more
than standard JV java EAP is so we have
the fractions which were redesign it to
accommodate the jboss modules and we
also have a lot of new and different
stack which is not part of java ee that
we integrated as fractions in wildfly
swarm so that's why we have history we
have camo we have bindings for multiple
things inside well class form and the
list just keeps growing because it's an
open source project so anybody that
wants to contribute is welcome and we
have a lot of engineers working of
adding even more dependencies to
world-class form the question is if we
at Red Hat tend to have a supportive
Asian wildfly swarm thing okay okay yeah
most of the customers only uses the
certified version which is je bosse p
and the answer that i have to give you
is and i can't comment but you know
maybe it's likely okay but I'm work and
talking about my personal opinion
because I can't say yes or no as an
official statement but is at my
particular opinion very likely
okay and the question where the comment
was that it's very important to have
this supported enterprise companies we
know that and I know that all of these
providers or fetch our implementations
also know that so that's why I think
that's very likely to be day to be for
these versions to be support and
verifying in the market very soon okay I
just not allow it to say dates okay okay
okay yeah yeah we know no you know and
we want to sell it okay okay any more
questions okay people again thank you
very very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
