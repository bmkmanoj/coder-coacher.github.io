Oracle cloud in Prague sorry too many
events
my name is your employee from Oracle
technology Network and my guess is Adam
bein Adam hi hello hi hi nice to meet
you again
yes nice to see you again so Adam you
are also also you did a keynote today
but you're also like very involved with
Java EE technologies and so so what
what's new we have your release coming
up so what is what is exciting sorry
first I'm fanboy of Java EE but I don't
contribute that much because of time so
really but you contribute with your
feedback right I mean you get yeah this
was the plan the problem is the Oracles
peg leads are too good so whatever they
do is they really it looks right so um
what I actually did I just reminded
about an older feature request should be
a pickup in Java 8 8 again and the
problem with me is this is really hard
to learn from this pack I'm waiting
until something is usable now we have
glass 55 we can use the book and now I
would like to cause a little bit with
Java 8 and feel like it feels like and
then give the feedback it's still not
too late so this is my way of operating
so my feedback is always late because
it's really hard to learn from PDF yeah
yeah but yeah but your question was
actually what's you write about Java 8
right Oh what's exciting for you yeah
exciting for me are small things for
instance actually probably boring things
was very important for instance it
becomes easier to mutate adjacent object
so before you had to know to copy it
over to another JSON object right now in
Factory accepts JSON object is a small
thing but saves a lot lines of code for
instance then there is a Jason merge
operations of this Jason T is a small
things which would really looking
forward to this but if you look from
outside they okay it is a view method
and the view methods but a really
important one
then the Jason B
for the mind link less important for my
projects but a huge deal I get lots of
questions about that is it is a budget
or not right now we hunt crafty JSON
object mostly but Jason be big deal
because right now if you just use the
job eight seven way and you switch the
provider it could happen that your JSON
format changes which is not very good
for the API stability stability this
going to be written in Java 8 security
big deal
CDI you can launch in Java it's e what I
think about this probably it makes
specific detecting easier you can launch
the CDI container without arquillian
just with Java C just for unit tests so
this is what I'm excited about this is
even more streamlined and even more
simple cool and server-sent events so
again i think yeah actually that yeah
although interesting because WebSockets
they are not always working because of
infrastructure firewall and proxy
servers and sse is one more things which
we can use and jax-rs is actually with
the flow like api and reactive style
also really important so you also in
your keynote you talked a little bit
about like micro services right so you
point out to service server life which
is yeah yeah
so what else is is mixed I mean makes it
easy to build a micro services
infrastructure with Java EE 8 the core
story is what serverless
actually means we don't need service
we're not meant that way what I wanted
actually to to tell it during the
keynote and I forgot about this but
wisdom Java if you think about this we
have the server but we don't care about
the server so what we only care about is
the API surface which is relatively
small so what I use in the keynote is
probably three key annotations nothing
else so what it actually means I don't
care about the server at all I could
build a war and I deployed in the
keynote on glass to g5 and Tommy in
London on white fly and I could push it
to Oracle cloud so what it for me means
it is not sound less but it solves the
same problems our service
so this is and this is what I try other
to explain to my clients and what
happened they always took Java e for
microservices so before that their
thought is to bloat it not cloud ready
not cloud native and this is not true if
you measure this and what I also did I
try to measure note the overhead during
the keynote and it turn out the overall
was negligible like 50 max so what is
basically means go for it just build
simple apps with Java right now and this
is somehow I think also the future of
Java EE why that because you should
focus on business logic
no no more under infrastructure ok sorry
for you don't answer yeah no good that's
very good that's actually yes because I
mean we talked also a lot about like
when is it a good use case for doing
micro service yes right yeah
also my clients you know asked me help
us with micro services so what I always
say ok what's the problem
right so are you selling micro services
are you selling you know I don't know
bread cars or whatever and and and then
if I know what the problem is then we
can solve it with or without micro
services and the problem usually is over
bloated exaggerated and over engineered
applications and we will remove the
bloat with Java EE is good enough ok so
there you go then decode delete code and
you're happy yeah so there is still time
to to test and give feedback actually
for Java young 8 yeah because it should
be ready I mean there is a voting
process going on but it should be ready
at the end of July I think yeah about
yeah there's a little time to get
sitting back and Java is now with github
so this is a github.com slash Java so
you can look at this yeah ok and any
advice on what you do what you test them
how I what I will do I would just take
the glass 55 and play with it
just build a simple app take one feature
and try it and give it back this is what
I would do this also what I'm doing so
what interests me from projects and look
at the and by the way there are some
good talks from Linda de Michael all
over the world that they are recorded
and she makes a great job you know
talking about the pictures so just watch
the talk on Oracle YouTube channel or a
DevOps channel or the
Vox USA no it's also a great list of
features great excellent so thank you
thank you very much as always great
interview thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
