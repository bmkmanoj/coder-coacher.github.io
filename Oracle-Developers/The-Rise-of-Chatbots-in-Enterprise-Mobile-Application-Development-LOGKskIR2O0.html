it's let's get started I know I'm
between you and the party whatever that
party is but I see they're setting up
champagne glasses in the next door so
it's probably non bent Dom Perignon but
who knows you know anyway so a glass of
the everyone here and hanging out toward
the end and we're hoping to say to the
best for last
so we talked about bod a little bit in
more detail I know there was a demo
earlier today I saw around chatbot what
I want to do is take chat bot from ok
what a Shabbat were the different
components and different terminology in
chat bot and then go load deeper we're
actually quite a bit deeper to actually
how chat pod typically works and the
differences between different chat box
so it's going to be a low introductory
ball the way to a little bit deep so
we'll see if we can get that fit in in
45 minutes and not to delay any any
party afterwards ok so let me introduce
myself
names Joe wrong part of the part product
management team Oracle look after a
mobile platform and also bought platform
to the new probably new product Oracle
mobile as being around for a little bit
longer but bada is very new and as with
in general right so the topic is a write
the chat pod in the enterprise mobile
application involvement I think a lot of
you seen these scientific film the belt
BOTS rising and being able to produce
itself and so forth watch too many
Terminator were are no carbonated movie
by anyway I came from California so he
was our governor for eight years I all I
can say is it could be worse I will
leave with that no he's a good person
ok so a little bit of a road map
information that just warned you I'm
going to uh disclose
okay so first of all you sing this
there's an app for that
Apple trademark that great now there's a
new school of thought right and the new
school of thought here is what is the
best interface the best interface is not
is no interface we're not having a user
interface at all because whenever you
have a user interface you have to learn
it simpler the better
right and then even if you look at what
Apple did they did what they did is they
simplify laws the more complex UI
patterns into something that's really
easy to use so how do we take that
mobile UI and user interfaces into
something even simpler simple by using
conversation conversation in the most
natural form of communication just like
you know I'm explaining and talking to
you today you know all you need to learn
is English or I can talk in other
languages
then you understand me in most time most
of the time okay you don't have to learn
how a button works and how a flipped
Jack gesture works and you know I think
a lot of us that probably have parents I
use an iPhone and you know they get very
frustrated using it because they don't
know how to do these gestures right it
may be natural for us but conversation
is even more natural anyone can speak
you know a language can we'll be able to
communicate right so that's what chatbot
depends on right chatbot depend on these
virtual users they're not really human
so it's pretend to be humans that are
programs to assist real users in a
conversational interface so on the other
side of the this chat application looks
like you're talking a real person but
it's not it's actually a bot a program
that helps to decipher what you said and
then act get data make you know do
business transaction on your behalf
right that's what chat bot is bada is a
more generic term botton
basically some sort of program that
could generically you know could be a
robot could be whatever that perform
Kasim your behalf Chapa specifically
supports chat interface or as a channel
the and and this is where we're really
focusing on is to extend mobile and
these mobile interfaces to to this more
conversational interface and it has
quite a bit of challenge with that right
but the other key characteristics for
chat pod is that the interface is much
simpler it is just a conversation I mean
it could be and on top of that you could
display some additional dialog boxes to
allow them to a guy user to pick and
different options but we'll go through
what those are and the third aspect for
you know what chat pod does it actually
does real work on your behalf right so
it goes to the backend application
actually takes what you tell it to do a
conversation natural language
essentially turned into sequel queries
get data back and then return it back in
a natural language format that is
nutshell what chat pod does okay now the
and that's one of the I think all of you
may have the type of experience right
let's say you have talked to a cable
company and you call them you hear music
you don't hear more music and then
finally takes a while for someone to to
respond right and all of you have this
type of experience right and it's
extremely frustrating it's because at
the end of the day the other side of is
a human being and a lot of these service
hotline right and the capacity for these
service agent may be very limited so a
very common and one to actually first
use cases for chat bot is a service
hotline experience so rather than you
someone calling in how about a user says
okay I need to use a you know I got a
new job and that this is actually be at
the same scenario of that Larry Ellison
did at the open world right he did a
little spiel he made fun that his title
now is officially CTO so he watered a
new business card right so a very basic
and much better user experience for this
user in this case our CEO is we just
simply type in Avenue row I want to
reward a business card okay and then the
chat guys that person through an
experience write much more responsive
than having Larry calling in and and
relying on human Asian to carry out the
task and imagine the other side of it is
well what if it's forget if our star is
chairman making it how about any other
employees write as much better
experiences for employees to interact
with system this way all right
and you seeing this demo before so I
don't want to do these static demos I
want to get to a real demo as soon as
possible okay
now before we go into a different type
of chat bot we're actually going to a
chat bot demo they're really two types
of chat BOTS right so the first type of
chat bot which is where most of the our
customers have started it with chat bot
which is more of a conversational guided
experience menu driven you know the
terminology use shares BOTS on Rails
that's probably not II know it's
actually not glue be on Rails but it's
bots on Rails but what it designed to do
where most of the users get their toes
what so to speak is with the type of
menu driven bot and the experience is a
little bit like a telephone system IVR
system right you'll press 1 for this
press 2 for this plus 3 for this of
course chap odd or chat interface gives
you a richer interface to
to interact the system but the whole
user experience is very guided and
that's where most the chat pod started
today the second level of the chat pod
is much more intelligent than that and
that's where the the main topic for
today is covering is the ability to take
free text and also voice as input system
needs to be able to understand what you
said and be able to work on your behalf
that's the second type of more
intelligent chat bot okay so banking is
probably the the most common example for
for BOTS and you know we all use the
banking applications right and you have
to login banking application after you
authenticate they have to learn
basically how to navigate and different
menu so what if you could just go ahead
and basically tell bot what to do and do
a transaction so let me just flip to a
little demo
now before I okay let me see need to
force it so that it replicate the
displays
see my okay so this is my I'm using my
iPhone right and it's tethered to my
laptop so it's projecting what's
actually showing it could always be
dangerous because I'm actually using a
facebook Messenger for this live demo
right so two things I want to demo it
just adds an example what a chat pod can
do for you why not like to start with
something a little unconventional
so this is something one of our
engineers for the bot platform had bulb
so how many of you have currently have
little kits like one or two year old
kids right so and I think most of us at
one have one so when they're little the
conversations relatively simple right
generally speaking there will be asking
one of three things it will either be
asking for something want a candy or
something or if they're complaining
older my sister hit me or took my book
away or if they need sympathy in my
tummy hurts and things like that so one
of our engineer used our bought platform
and the natural language capabilities to
build a very simple parenting block
right so to basically automate responses
to these two-year-old so for example you
can see this so let's say if I want
masking okay as a kid can I have gummy
bear
let me try it again see it if this is
real yeah for a cue sorry your session
expired
I don't think so alright so I if I am
let's say okay yeah kandi just due to a
show I don't think so if I ask it again
can I have candy okay so it's a very
simple demo but one aspect right it's
just shown here not only parsing what
the kid is asking for but also
recognizes that between conversation
remembers the last thing you asked so
that's part of the what the bat platform
can do or should do for you is to
remember the conversation history and in
this case they Noah said I don't think
so and then what if let's say I'm
complaining my sister hit me oh are you
okay right so I it's showing a needing
some sympathy where we're so forth or
say my tummy hurts same my book anyway
and then it can even do things like
let's say send a emoji and be able to
respond so anyway these are just
examples of how Lange natural language
processing could be used to to respond
but a more serious use case is maybe
more a financial application so for
example rather than logging into a you
know Citibank application what if I want
to just ask what is my balance
okay then you notice that they're
different type of balance we're
different type of checking in Cal work
account out a half so we asked me for
what type of account I want to check my
balance with okay and then it returns a
balance very simple interaction but with
two conversation we'll be able to get it
yeah so that's more events topic but
I'll just cover very quickly so it's two
levels one is with you know Facebook
obviously give you user ID and that
information so the other and then
there's two ways we can authenticate one
is that through the platform we can
connect with Facebook and use Facebook
as annotation agent right support that
the second level is we can also display
and where you see here right is you can
still see a custom UI so with the
platform you can interject custom UI in
this case you can put in a custom login
screen - there's a second level
authentication then path and then grab
that - whatever that token is then pass
into the backend service so you can do
that as well which is that which is a oh
is a big problem with the chatbox line
right is be able to authenticate so in
this case you can just say embed
additional login screen and use the
secondary login screen second factor to
a to authenticate okay and some of the
other things I can do with this banking
bot I can say is a make like payment oh
actually that's not a that's something I
can chain right is a
maybe network connections having
problems there you go now you see a real
live demo and I see I need to do
additional training on the bottom right
so I'll show you what the back end looks
like and how I need to do additional
training but these are the types of
things that you can run you can run
let's see I asked transfer money or like
that
now it's asking for my balance anyway so
the additional work needs to be done to
have to fix that but is an example of
what a a ball looks like right come on
back to my plantation okay
okay and one of the things that you know
what does it really mean all mean for
developers right and for developers
really chatbot means that it's much more
reliable and fast intuitively used
platform for you know and some of the
initial use cases is for a b2c type of
interactions the fraction of the cost
right so the one of the things that the
chap I will be able to allow you to do
is not have all these service agents to
and stand by and answering questions
chaibat can automate a lot of these
these services it's a really an easy
entry into a mobile strategy because
again chatbot doesn't require you an end
user to spend a lot of time to learn the
mobile application nor does it require
mobile developers to spend a lot of time
to build a mobile application by simply
just designing a conversation you will
be able to interact with your customers
well some of the things cloud-based I
guess you can have on-premise system in
this case our cloud platform at that
capability and provide that capabilities
and it's much easier to build an
application I will show you in a minute
what that how do you actually build an
application and lastly is cross-platform
so and that's the beauty of having a
platform so a lot of these social
networks you know or chat client support
their own platform for for building chat
BOTS right and the problem is that you
end user may not be you just using
Facebook where they may be using other
type of client so this is where having a
platform and they're having that
platform to be able to access multiple
channels will be helpful right
okay now moving on next is what is the
intelligent chat bot really means right
you know it's a long sentence but
basically the art of Chapa what it
really does is to take what user inputs
basically distills what user intends to
execute and also grab the data from a
natural language and then invoke the the
actions invoke the backend programs and
return these responses right so that's
what natural language processing and
machine learning really means as you go
and you go ahead and train these BOTS
now one of the things in natural
language processing really does well
with chat pod is the ability to decipher
the real use of real user sentences and
then be able to a call so this is a
apparently there's an use that theory
apparently save babies life by calling
ambulances after the baby stop breathing
now that's that's all sound pretty
magical but let me just jump over to
you see actually I did this ready okay
so let me do this so in a previous
example just okay so let's get into a
dive into a bit on what the different
components for a chatbot and what you
know what a different terminology are
involved with with a chatbot so first of
all the example of a sentence transfer
$100 from my default account to someone
Lydia for babysitting right so if you
decipher and that sentence the first
thing that you want to grab out of it
and this is the the first thing that a
natural language processing system will
do is decipher the intent for that
sentence so in this case the intent for
the sentence is to do a money transfer
and that's what the and it looks
that's what do you intend system does it
figures out what user wants and how
could that intent or actions be mapped
into the into a real action where the
training comes from is how do you train
the system to recognize intent your
trainer system recommends intent by
entering by telling system and this is a
term again terminology for chat uh
pterence --is what does that mean it
basically means it's a sample of data or
a sample of sentences that you can train
the bot with to say if user asked these
type of questions or make these kind of
statement then they intend to ask this
okay so for example send money to
account transfer $20 to account pay
money to account give money to Roger
these are all different uh turan SACEUR
different data samples that you can
enter into the system to train the bot
and basically from the intent model
basically means that it's a model
sorry so once the you enter in the
samples and then the next step is that
you put these samples and this is what
system does into the natural language
processing engine and that allows the
naturalizer for processing engine 2
based on these samples to make best
guesses at what those intents are okay
now the I'll just maybe quickly go
through all of these and things now the
second category of terminology that's
used in chibok quite a bit it's what's
called an ax t right so the best way
thing of an entity is like an attribute
so when you execute for example a sequel
query right so you need to tell it you
need to give the few attributes you need
to maybe do a search based on you know
account type equals two checking you
know that's a that's type of an
attribute in chat box world the
terminology is called entity so in this
case the different attribute for this
transfer is an orange here a default
account that's the type of attribute or
entity right and also Lydia that's the
person's name that's also a entity and
the again the env system basically
processes all these things that enter
into a sentence and then find what is
the irrelevant for the for the specific
intent so again the the the order of a
deciphering chatbot first thing is
deciphering intent and then second thing
is to basically from the decipher the
entities from these sentences to
basically be able to process what
additional attributes that's needed so
one example that would be a financial
banking bot right is when I say check my
balance you know it's a region Erik
question it doesn't know that I'm asking
what type of account so it needs to be
able to ask me and clarify what that the
type of account is so that type of
account is a entity right so Thursday is
for the clarification typically that's
needed now so one of the things that the
bot does is need to be able to account
for the fact that it needs further
clarification so we need to pop
additional UI to ask for questions but
also if the in this case the entity
entity is already provided then needs to
be able to recognize that okay the third
part of the chat pod is the ability to
design a conversation flow so this is
really core to what we now call user
experience above for chat bot right so
for mobile applications for any type of
application user experiences based on
how you lay out the user interfaces and
how well it performs with chat bot it
really has to do with how you're
designing your conversation or dialogue
flow right and the best way to think of
a dialogue flow is essentially it's like
a the way it works it manages the
conversation flow and ultimately act
like a state engine so as someone asked
a question and you get a reply it moves
to the next state and then be able to
respond okay so let's look at it you
know what does all means in the context
of sub Orko's intelligent bot right and
and most of the bot platform you see in
the market today has the same type of
features we do a little bit differently
but just for illustration purposes let's
look at the Oracles bunk so let me this
is a real
okay
so basically this is what the local
intelligent bought cloud service
homepage looks like so let's look at the
financial bot okay then for this
financial bot again this is a banking
chat bot so there's a few things that we
want to allow the banking bot to be able
to do want to allow end users check
balances ask questions send money track
spendings and also look up transactions
so these are the five category of things
were intent or actions that you can user
may want to do right so these are model
as different five different intents okay
then for each one of the intents there's
a list of basically a list of sample
data or example sentences where you
train the bot with right so when we talk
about you know artificial intelligence
machine learning really train the
machine to learn if a user ask a
question similar to this how much do I
owe you know all my credit card it's
meant to ask for balances and not FAQ so
if I move to a different intent then the
sample question for FAQ is a little bit
different and so forth and sample now
send money now the interesting question
is well what if user then type in
exactly what that sendin does and that's
where the natural language processing
algorithm comes in right what it does
first of all is and in distant in our
example we go through two levels of
natural language processing first level
it's just basically pattern matching
right
we pattern we match patterns with what
was typed here versus what user enter
then and these pattern could also be
based on proximity of the words and so
forth and as soon as the first ages
it's it's a language in Penton meaning
that we're literally just transfer that
into digits into vectors into numbers
and then perform recognition based on
that and the second level of processing
then is where the natural language comes
in where we look at the grammars and
also look at the synonyms with a similar
meaning word so that if someone doesn't
say you know maybe it is not a great
example transfer so use a different word
for transfer we'll be able to recognize
that all that a synonym is built in into
the language processing so that's how
we're able to recognize even if user
doesn't type in exactly the same word
that we can recognize that now you know
yeah yeah good no so you train the
processing engine so let me show this an
example here right so you train at based
on first of all based on entering a list
of these examples right and then you
could run tests on these on guessing
example so let's say I want to type in
what is my current balance
all right so it rectly recognize that
this is asking for balance right but if
I look at click on this intent and I
mean what it actually does is it goes
through the natural processing engine
and that does a ranking of what are the
likely intent that the user is asking
based on the sentence right so the way
that so the algorithm the basic the
basic algorithm is not or should I say
is something that we control but what
you do is you train with a different set
of set of the call utterances but they
basically different sentences right and
the way that you also could train is
let's say if you enter in something what
is my current balance and fortunately
not just an example if I guess
incorrectly right if via intend engine
gets incorrectly you can check and
correct that and say an example and
retrain it and that's going to tilt the
answer next time to the example you can
add a to that in pain just added okay so
there's no you know black magic it's
very straightforward basically you train
the intent engine to do be able to do
machine learning and I'd be able to
correctly parse the intent the the one
of the things I think the one of the
questions we get a lot is okay what if
you let the end user directly train the
bot right and some sort of self learning
and what we learned is and just by
looking at some of our competitors
examples it's a slippery slope because
it allows any user to type in you know
and basically a type in the run intent
and then bias the model so right now
what we're doing is we're focusing on
just allow the developer to train the
model and then as you find in accuracies
will capture all the
interactions but then through the
analytics capabilities and you'll be
able to look at that and then do
additional training and ditional add
additional examples of utterances from
here yep
I'm sorry I how do I know
ah that's good question so well really
by doing well that's that's a very good
question so it's by first of all doing
more using this testing feature to
really test different inputs right so
just get a lot of people asking a lot of
questions and the other thing that you
want to do is by looking at how the
intent is being resolved in ranked I
don't know if you can actually see it
right and you want to chain you want to
enter in the examples so that these the
differences between different intent are
greater right so there are a few tricks
to do that by more clearly emphasizing
certain terminology and things like that
so so that's the funny that's an
interesting challenge that now you will
have is when you develop a chat pod it's
longer a technical skill but also some
linguistic skill right of how best to to
guess the correct examples to put in so
that your confidence intervals are
greater and behind the scenes there's
the natural language processing
algorithm is based on basically a based
on probability probabilistic model it's
not a deterministic model and that's a
tell is able to make a more more
accurate prediction okay but it's one of
the new algorithms that won the
university have recently developed but
because of that it's also more important
to be able to attain these sentences so
that as you test these BOTS you see that
there's greater differences in
confidence interval
I wouldn't be able to assign a
percentage because it's a yeah it's I
would say the how the all the pattern
recognition and also all of the natural
language processing be able to
understand sending them as we able to
understand you know there's encyclopedia
in there that's able to understand
similar meaning words that's all part of
the built-in capability but as far as
applying it to be able to answer a
specific question it specific intent
that's what the that's what's something
that you as it developed me is to to do
alright now the next level down and now
we talked about intent we talked about
and then we have looked at the entity
for each one of the intent of course you
can then define a set of these entities
which are of course attributes there
some of the attributes are built in so a
lot of times people may ask about time
may ask about numbers and may have all
emails these are all built in attributes
that could be deciphered from the
sentence and automatically passed as
essentially attributes to the backend
the third part is conversation design
right so so basically in the in the our
cloud of cloud service what we use is
basically an XML definition of designing
a conversation and the way that we
design conversation is that essentially
this is like a state engine you know we
define different state where in the
beginning we're asking initialize the
bot and then we first run through the
intent engine to guess what the system
is is one intent what intend the end
user is asking and also we can set the
threshold so remember there's a
confidence level of whatever want to
display all of the
possibilities want to make sure the
accomplice star show is leaves point
four right if it's lower than that then
we just simply display that message you
saw earlier unable to resolve intent
then it's going you know time to go back
and retrain the bots to be able to
understand a better understand the
intent and then it basically go through
a state of state for example start
balances star balances basically is okay
now if I just resolve the user intent to
asking for balances then it's going to
try to get the account type now if the
user in the sentence ready say okay I
want to check my checking account
balances it's able to typically pick up
pick that up and then automatically
populate the account type so we wouldn't
display the account type dialogue to you
but if it's not there then it's going to
display that the three different type of
accounts that you know these are PM
types that that were different the three
fifth possible different account types
that the end user may have okay and one
other thing I think I wanted to just
quickly be able to show with this
finance bot and why a conversation
design is important is let's see can I
show this from here
thank say for example I want to start a
transaction to to pay my a babysitter
right so for example okay actually it's
not working properly anymore I think I
may have messed up by one of the
trainings let me see okay actually
actually what I should have done is
retrained via bot by ending adding and
make payment to my babysitter as an
utterance
and then retrain it retrain is actually
a changes the attributes for the
underlying model takes a little time so
we want to do that let's say send money
to my babysitter okay I give up
the it's I know why it's having some
problems
yeah
so let me go through that so what the
way that it connects to the backend
system is by going through what we call
custom components or going back to them
so a unit of work for bot right is
okay so the four parts to the 2d
intelligent bot platform we talked about
the AI engine basically be able to parse
the engine there's the dialogue flow
execution that's based on XML custom
component is actually where you connect
into the back-end system okay so what
custom component is is written in in
javascript in nodejs
basically what it does it takes the as
part of the conversation flow if it
needs to get data from the backend it
will directly invoke that API that's
written in nodejs what's called a custom
component and then returned via data
back to to a dialog engine so that's how
it works
now that API and how that connects the
backend in the context of Oracle
intelligent bought that's all done
through Oracle's mobile cloud service
platform so the Oracle mobile cloud
service platform has ability to allow
you to create a pis and connect it back
in integrate with the backend enterprise
systems like Oracle e-business suite JD
Edwards or SAS application so these
api's are implemented in Oracle mobile
cloud service and I allows the
intelligent bot to call the back-end
services and you can also just directly
call these back-end services if vacuum
services are exposing the API as rush
services ok so that's how you return the
data back to the custom component the
the fourth part to it is the what's
called channel configurator so one of
the strengths for having a platform is
that you'll be able to work against any
chat messaging channel Facebook is the
most common one in North America in
other countries in Japan and Korea
Taiwan for example its line in China's
all.we charts for example so what we
allow you to do we have a different
channel configure
leaders that allows us to leverage basic
to the SDK for these chat clients so
that will so the user chat could go
through any one of those channels go
into our AI engine go into our flow
execution and display UI and the return
back and doesn't matter what user is
even you know check clients using will
be able to respond to that okay and what
we just talked about is custom component
and that this is a more detailed
explanation with the custom component is
the custom component is basically all
running a know container right and a
signature is a REST API and is
implemented node basically connects
through a connector these connector has
a the job of basically authenticating
against any type of remote serves in the
backend in intelligent bought base we
could just call these API okay it was
just the order of house invoked and that
the way that's implemented is basically
there's a set of SDKs and shelves that
written in nodejs that would be able to
call the back-end services and api to
return data back okay so I think that's
we're running a little short on time to
I'll just show what the custom component
code basically looks like there's a
signature of a CK and shell that
actually does the interaction with the
with the bot platform the Bob platform
doesn't expect the API to have a certain
signature but then from these JavaScript
API implementations and it's able to
call additional JavaScript code to for
example actually I'm sorry hate this
I keep having to go back and forth and
I'm sorry thing didn't quite come up
okay let me get out the presentation
mode just quickly show you this
sometimes Mac's are really slow okay so
basically this is what a project for a
custom component looks like in our case
it basically there's a and can really
make it really not much bigger
there's the SDK and shell JavaScript and
that basically established an interface
for the bot platform to call the backend
API right and then these interfaces then
in turn call additional API is where
JavaScript modules to get data back from
these from these back-end services
that's how a custom code is implemented
yep
yes so the question is and you know can
you create any type of body using the
platform absolutely you know I just
showed two example you know parroting
BOTS which is completely trivial maybe
not so trivial example and the financial
bot but also this is very use very
commonly in for example retail right and
retail someone wants to ask questions
we'll just place order online where's my
water that's a very simple example yeah
so that's a good question so right now
the pricing for different companies
there is quite differently but generally
speaking the pricing is going to be
based on the number of requests that is
being handled through the bot alright so
actually speaks to apologies for this
x-ray I think my Mac has gone bonkers
completely the speaks to the ability to
design efficient bot to very quickly
allow a user to a complete the
conversation right when I wasn't able to
show actually I could probably yeah now
I'm not going to attempt there's a
something is wrong with my demo instance
today I need to retrain it beat it into
shape but basically there the other
thing I want to show is there are also a
ways to design your conversation to
allow all the context requests so a lot
of times if you are resolved to a
certain intent you're down with a
specific conversation right what if in
the middle of conversation someone asked
for a completely unrelated question it
is something that food the dialogue
editor you can handle these unexpected
branch as well so but there's something
that
can do any other question good yes so
the question is can you interject
multiple actions into a single call so
for example I wanted to both return my
balance but also deduct $10 I know for
example bad example perhaps yeah
absolutely you can do that but that all
has to do with how you design your API
so that might that would requires a
basically resolve to is sort of a few
ways to handle it that could resolve to
a different intent maybe it's a more
complex intent that you wanted to the
users to to be able to handle that -
that actually makes two actions then
your component you basically make these
two API calls to create these two
actions so you can do that as well
although it's probably not something
that you want to do it's a unless these
two actions are closely related then
naturally they should be grouped as a
single intent then all then basically
just handle it in your custom component
an API is to be able to group these
operations together
hmm yeah yep yeah so the question is you
know is it it's impossible to do
conditionals so there are two type of a
conditional right so the most common
conditional actually is if the in the
way that user is asking a question
it already specify a specific entity so
for example already rather than what is
my bank know bank account balance to say
what is my checking account balance
right so that that's the user already
specified the type of that entity and in
that scenario you need to be able to
handle the user input that may or may
not contain that entity so that's one
condition that that we can handle that's
a very natural important thing to do we
call these basically enemy is entity
slotting so basically the entity is
really being slotted to for checking
account for example that's one condition
that's naturally Candle the other one is
let's say an example of if we want to
only allow user to handle and make a
transaction if their bank account has
more than $500 yeah the the xml also
have conditional statement allows you to
okay if the return the you know we
everything it could be a return and set
as a variable from the custom component
so if we call the custom Honan it comes
back as a with the balance variable then
we from the xml from the dialog flow
designer then can check for that balance
and then branch off to a different state
based on that so again the the dialogue
if we look at the what dialogue looks
like I'm going to just going to kill the
oppression if three doesn't work very
well with the presentation mode doesn't
work well with
flipping back and forth with the browser
is really hard to see but if you look at
the browsers
again what you're modeling really is the
different state that the conversation
goes through so a conditional statement
really means that you go to a based on
some variable value you would
conditionally go to a different state or
this could also be you go to a different
state obviously based on what in ten
years all of it too
any other questions or the demo
unfortunately didn't work quite as well
so I need to look at my intent engine
and maybe what's going on is I need to
one of the things I need to remember to
do is you guys should have done this
before I start to you starting to demo
basically what this training process
does is to take all the utterances all
the sentences and then reset basically
behind the scenes we'll have a neural
network that does all the pattern
recognition and all the processing of or
two likely intent and all this does is
it rebalances a lot of the you know we
the way I will use it we jiggle the
neural networks so to change the how the
system deciphers in a sentence so maybe
that would be better but we're all the
time so I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
