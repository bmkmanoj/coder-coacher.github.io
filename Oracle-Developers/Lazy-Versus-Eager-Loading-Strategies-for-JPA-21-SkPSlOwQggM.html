Benson of it and today I'm gonna tell
you about loading strategies in JPA
first of all I was like this it's very
nice to see you here in such a number ok
briefly about myself I've been doing
professional software development for
over 15 years I've been all the time
active developer and I still I must say
that I love it
most recently I found it company it's a
start-up its aim is to bridge the gap
between V and us trendy Adina so
basically in value investing new
research in order to detect and refactor
various anti patterns vulnerabilities in
software in regard to performance
databases security and so on
so basically connect traces of database
and JPA programming are my daily job
first briefly about my love story with
JPA then loading strategies hints and
corner cases and finally some countries
possibly a little bit disappointing too
but we'll see first disclaimer because
in the past it happened often that many
people after my talks they thought that
I had been bashing JPA
it's not the case I do appreciate JPA it
took off my shoulder a lot of
boilerplate coding a lot of point
configuration and so
so I'd appreciate it but as in a
relationship we have our ups and downs
so I don't know about you but I
perfectly know about myself
that's the often I've puzzled a little
angry and a bit not oh anyone here who
shares my feelings raise your hands
please
oh it's not only me
very good but good so one of the corner
cases of JPA
just for a good start that's a puzzle i
used before but it's very neat one and I
hope that she find it interesting as
well so we have a very very simple Hydra
class and TD class high drives that
mythical creature which is supposed to
withdraw three hearts in place of one
cut off right so we need some business
rules for that that's why our getter
forehead says with that unmodifiable
collection just she has control over how
the hats are managed so basically we use
JPA defaults we have fun like a skate I
pole for one too many and that's all so
we will use T transactions the first one
each of transactions uses new
entitymanager the first reduction just
creates and Percy's be Hydra with free
heads the second transaction just times
did our previously stored Hydra and now
question to you how many queries will be
issued in the second transaction so it's
it's a I forgot to mention it's a
hibernate puzzle so we have many JPA
providers by the way how many of you use
hibernate yep I thought so because
that's the case - and is the most
popular one Argus anyone uses eclipse
link a few hands open GPA even less and
I think that many of you haven't heard
of data new clothes anyone heard about
the eternal clothes Oh
two hands appreciate okay so hibernate
is the meaning or the most popular JPA
provider so that's the hibernate case it
looks like it should be only one query
in the second transaction right because
the one we read he select the one one
Hydra entity right heads are lazy loaded
so and they are not touched in this
piece of code so they shouldn't be
loaded neither right so who goes for the
answer a nobody
oh I guess you're smart you know that
must be some trick here and you're right
so who goes for be a few hands what
about see a few hands
maybe four or five what about D on
little Hans and he none of the above
here you can expect everything from
hibernate I can say so okay so are you
surprised to selects one delete free
inserts why why such weird things
happened here right because it was
purely read-only transaction we didn't
modify anything and why all those delete
and inserts are issued the case is that
during commit files hibernate checks
whether collection property is that by
dirty I mean whether or not it's been
modified during the transaction and
hibernate does dirty checking on
collection by copying Java identities
Java object references and the case here
was when you had a second look when you
have had second look at some our piece
of code the case here was that we
returned from our get new on my
modifiable this so it means a new Java
object reference which obviously differs
from the original one so hibernate
feelings that it's new collection and if
it's new collection it has been changed
so it needs recreation even though
nothing changed under the hood right so
during fight we only have one select and
during the commit phase we have another
select two
like hats one delete to delete all the
hats and free insert to insert free the
same the very same had that's pretty
funny and with the optimal in terms of
performance right so take a look at your
own peace applications company based and
look for such cases so let's just
learned here expect unexpected yeah why
did it happen because we used property
access mappings right in case of feel
taxes mappings it would be fine because
we happy note we'd get access to the
original Java object so the lesson for
us to use an operated collection of the
threatened by in hibernate don't change
our collection references unless you
know what you are doing because it some
cases it might be performance wise to
recreate collection in case it's like we
have a large collection and we remove
and add a lot of objects so it's better
to delete all the objects with one query
delete statement and insert one new ones
once again so but that's only the case
usually it's better to keep the original
reference unchanged because it was
pretty tricky mapping right you can say
so but such cases are pretty popular in
applications because of the red piece of
code so it often happens that we pass
hibernate entity to the view and then
based on web view we apply some changes
to the hibernate entity and
often it happens that changes took place
for other attributes and collections
remain unchanged but we just set them
all right so in this case the hibernate
semantics would be done exactly the same
recreation of the entire collection how
other providers behave in this scenario
it turns out that they behave much much
better than hibernate exit Eclipse link
and Dayton closed execute only one
select as expected this comparison is
based on my previous talk it's a
performance comparison of JPA providers
it might be pretty useful for you to
take a look at it if you do a lot of
hyper night programming all basically
JPA programming because based on that
you might switch to another provider it
might be performance wise for you
another lessons learned from the sample
you see that a lot of depends on JPA
provider right so JPA
java persistence api is just a
specification it's a great piece of work
but it's only a spec it says what should
be implemented by JPA provider but it
doesn't say how it should be implemented
and the implementations are very very
different so if you want to tune your
application you need to tune it in
concrete environment with concrete
provider and the concrete database
by the way do you have any performance
problems with your paper JPA provider
raise your hands any problems that's
many like half of you so that's not bad
I must say that's with large data you
will always run into performance
problems with advantage JP provider and
without we provide as well so it's a
matter of scale not always that
technology used behind the scene so
hints for you about loading strategies
when we should he is eager loading
strategy for sure when we know what we
want and or we want a little so what
does it mean that we know what we want
so when we exactly know in a current
point of our current execution path what
will be required in the future so
basically we know how the rest of the
path execution path behaves and that it
will only need exactly this piece of
data so for such cases it's better to
use eager loading and if most of our
cases share the same range so it's
better to configure our JP a model to
delay too eagerly loved this piece of
rent or if we want a little so if we
want to pull from the database only a
small amount
for data like small entity so no needs
to divide this already small entity into
tiny pieces right because network
latency plus round trips to databases
will kill our performance now loading
strategy usually better eager I
mentioned Network latency and and number
of round trips to database so if you
have pretty high network latency it's
better to keep your number of round
trips to a database role so it means
that usually it's better T to pull more
data then you need just for for the
future just to keep this number of round
trips long so in total yes it changes
cache is another strategy to speed up
your application but not in scope of the
stock bus yep
that's a very good command and and it's
it's important to have like a holistic
view on performance of your application
so don't focus on tiny little pieces or
don't tune only loading strategies take
a look at your application as as a whole
so that's important during turning this
talk is specifically dedicated to
loading strategies that's why I
don't speak about other performance
problems in general but yes
keep that in mind this now when should
we use lazy for sure lazy loading means
that we postpone loading of data from
database until they are accessed it
actually access by the application so
when we don't know what we want and what
will be used in the future so let's but
a lot only required data like that I
think about it tomorrow do you know that
words those words I guess that's classic
can with the Wayne's Scarlett O'Hara
come on guys okay maybe not circa target
yes that's you know then we switch
network latency we need to take into
account so that was the previous slide
about when we when we introduced any
network latency in our communication
then it changes a bit and it's better to
usually it's better to do
eagerly load a bigger chunk of data so
another another hint is that if you want
a lot of data so it's better so it's
obvious that we can't load all that
large chunk of days at once right it's
better to apply divide and conquer
strategy let's load what's needed in the
first place and then we'll think about
it later on it depends so my favorite
answer and my favorite strategy as well
we'll see later that's totally depends I
think that's it's the favorite answer
for IT people pants so it depends on
your application on your hardware on
your specific use cases but I can't
provide precise data because it's on I
assess that on a case-by-case basis
up then it depends then you need to
think then you need to think that's the
problem sometimes right I would like to
have Frank ready to use solutions as
well but unfortunately we work in IT we
need to think a lot so what about large
objects in case of large objects
consider lies a property fetching so
recommended usage is for blobs clubs
formulas but you need to remember about
bytecode instrumentation otherwise it
will not work it might silently ignore
your lazy loading requirement so that
requires a little bit more configuration
on your side large objects but to be
honest something smells here large
objects and JPA during eat them but you
really need them basically large objects
might be a sign of some sort of an
anti-pattern in your model so pond on
your objects model in these cases
because large objects are not going to
work well large collections already
mentioned here definitely lazy you don't
want to really large collections like
thousands and thousands to be more
specific in your memory in case of large
collections you might probably heard
about and plus one problem right so
that's not a clock there and plus one
problem because
in some cases and some provide most
providers it's a configurable batch size
so they don't want they don't love
collection lazy collections one by one
element they launch them in batches just
to speed up so this is a JPA provided
specific configuration and the defaults
are pretty okay rather smallest person
member hibernate in its defaults has
like five for batch size okay so another
puzzle and connect case nautical the
case that default behavior of hibernate
so we have planted three puzzle pretty
simple as well and straightforward so we
have a forest a forest have collection
of trees pretty straightforward right so
we have fun one to many like yeah so my
my mistake
it shouldn't be written is unnecessary
because plant tree is supposed just add
a new tree to the collection yeah but my
spot
thank you
so again we have two transactions the
first one creates and persisted for a
sweet 10,000 trees and the second one
just creates a new tree finds the
existing forints and plants plant a tree
in that forest so would you think it
looks like one persist is one insert
right find is one select and country
might be like another insert to create a
relationship between a tree and the
forest so at first glance it should be
like one snag and two inserts you've
already learned that that's not the
simplest case so but maybe I'm tricking
here so who thinks it that's one no one
but smart audience what about being to
select some to inserts that would yep
there are t there are two people what
about C
two hands as far as three free hunts
what about D yes I see there's much more
people think that's the even more well
it's not that bad so it's only two
selects one delay D and 10,000 plus two
inserts Wow
because again it's not straight for what
drink basically the combination of one
to many and collection and aback
semantics and pack semantics means that
hibernate rack vv8 the entire collection
maybe when we change our unordered for
us to more ordered or cut hibernate we
behave differently what do you think no
still back semantics it's still back
semantics we need to use order calm and
index column for lick semantics so so
that would change the recreation of the
entire collection but the lease is again
not the best approach when you want to
insert in the beginning of the list
because it requires an update and
updates for the entire collection to
change the indexes of the elements in
the database so but when you add in the
end of the list
that's fine because no updates are
needed so again it depends on your use
cases and usage patterns set is much
much better because in case of set you
require only
delete or one insert to remove or add
slamming into the collection so that's
the best approach in case of hibernate
however you always pay your rent right
you need in case of set there is another
problem because hibernates needs to load
all the elements into the memory why
because of because of Java set semantics
Java set semantics requires that all
elements in the set are unique right so
to check whether they are unique or not
and you know element is unique or not
for a given set we need to have all
elements accessible so for large
collections it implies background
loading into memory so unnecessary
queries and in addition it introduces
transactions and locking schema problems
with versioning and optimistic locking
it's like when we plant a new tree we
lock the entire forest so pretty stupid
behavior I would say so
Plus not performance wise so so
basically you shouldn't he is want too
many on D as the underside it should be
used as the inverse side of a mapping
however again we run into some problems
with collections collection types for
hibernate because of now when
one-to-many is
the inverse side of the collection set
is not the best choice because again
because of set semantics and if we want
to keep our object model in sync so it
again forces loading of all trees how
about other providers they behave a
little bit differently I would say most
performance wide wise Eclipse links
issues only to selection to inserts for
for the case open GPA and data and close
free selects one update and two inserts
so basically it's it's much different
than default hibernate behavior so
you've seen that there are a lot of
things going on behind the scene so
first of all you need to take a look at
your mappings and to your your object
model before you start tuning lazy and
eager loading because that's usually the
place where the biggest problems lie not
loading strategies per se but your
object model itself so the last approach
to loading strategy it depends as I
mentioned before so basically it depends
me is that it depends on on dynamically
on our current application state so
basically we want dynamic behavior
that's in the same place we based on
some parameters probably from the
interaction from
user we want to load that piece of data
or that piece of data and and so on so
until jp-8 2.1 it was pretty difficult
to configure basically we had only third
queries which were not that easy to use
and was not applicable to all the cases
and such a dynamic approach is possible
with with JPA 2.1 so I don't know how do
you handle such cases in your
application that's for example for one
view what view you want to do to display
only parts of the entity for the other
view you want to display the entire
entity how do you handle that lazy
loading can't open such an interview
probably yes because that's quite common
approach so so that was the case that we
don't care basically and we we depend on
default we depend on default lazy
loading we can take care of that by
using such queries by provider specific
extensions like such profiles in
hibernate or fetch plan you know page
APA Eclipse link as far as I remember
also has similar feature so basically we
are trying to give some hints to
underlying
JPA implementation to construct
the best query for our case but it was
not until J the Java EE 7 it was not
standardized it all those extensions
were provide a specific another approach
which I seen and applied in my own code
bases was to use different mappings for
different cases so we we had the same
data mapped into different entities and
then we could apply different loading
strategies in different configurations
for different cases just the declarative
simulation of dynamic behavior and it
but required it required much more care
plus much more
additional code so here JPA 2.1 comes in
handy
we've got entity grabs in JPA e 2.1 who
has heard about entity graphs and one
okay so basically it's sort of according
to the spec it's a template that
captures the parts and boundaries for an
operation on query but basically what it
means it's it's a fetch plan or fetch
hints for query or find operation so we
can define the final and entity graphs
by annotations we can create them
programmatically defined by annotations
named entity graph named entities are
revenant attribute nodes and
corresponding interfaces to create some
programmatically so basically we we
specify which attributes we would like
to eat early
load
there is the concept of that default
fetch grab graph and it's basically
transitive closures of all attributes of
the graph specified or defaulted to
eager then when we when we construct the
entity graph we specify loading strategy
for each attribute we add to a graph we
don't need to add all the attributes
from our graph persistent graph tool to
our empty graph so we we just choose the
ones those which we need and we specify
when we add them it means that we want
them to be eagerly loaded and there are
two modes in which we we can pass our
entity graph to our entity manager it's
we can pass it as a fetch graph a lot
graph basically it defines that in fetch
mode that all attributes specified by
the entity graph are eager and the
others are lazy in case of load grab a
load mode all attributes specified in a
graph are eager and others loaded as
specified by the mapping or as defaulted
by the mapping so the the first mode is
like overwrite for our model the second
mode is like augmentation of our model
what are the advantages of entity graphs
better hints to JPA providers because JP
a provider must load all attributes
specified as eager and it can load more
data if it thinks it's better for us o
for it for for it so so basically we
have currently you have all eagerly
loaded data it may be more it entity
graphs provides better hints for JP
providers and hibernate now can generate
much more smarter queries for example in
case of mappings with free tables
instead of issuing and plus one more or
less queries now it it's able to issue
only one select with free with with to
join us on free tables so with entity
graphs your hibernate code might behave
better and another advantage is that now
we can dynamically modify which pieces
of data are about it when we need them
so based on our design of use cases our
design of UI or business card
there is always that question and I told
you in the beginning that you might be
disappointed
in the end so is there a silver bullet
fortunately no no silver bullet you need
to keep your model needs that's the
first thing and one which I mentioned
beforehand a lot of depends on your
entity model that's the primary source
of performance problems you might want
to apply the hints on loading strategies
especially use of entity graphs and JPA
2.1 that's very useful and might produce
elegant code and simplify your code but
in general in case of performance
problems you need to tune your
application your whole application in
your concrete environment
think about how differently JPA
providers behave and think how
differently underlying databases behave
so you need to take into your mind all
the entire infrastructure and all your
business codes so thank you any
questions
if you have any questions we can become
not included in the presentation there
are pretty good examples in JPA job in
Java EE tutorial and if you want I can
uncle sent you a few examples just in
case okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
