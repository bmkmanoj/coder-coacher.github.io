have a software developer that doesn't
have much to do what we're doing here
I'm sharing stuff about how I work with
a team that I'm on and it's something
we've been doing for about three years
it's grown for us to be calling it mob
programming and I was invited to speak
here and I feel very honored to be here
this is overwhelming to me to be invited
to a conference of this stature so I
very much appreciate that let's go so i
got this story detail i have my computer
way over there i'm just going to turn to
this to remind me what i'm talking about
at the moment this about the most
important thing and I used to think I
knew what the most important thing was
but it turned out as I given this talk
everybody walks away with a different
idea of what I meant by that so let's
see what you guys come up with but this
is the concept we call it mob
programming and that's just kind of how
I think of it it's all the brilliant
minds working on the same thing at the
same time and in the same space which is
essentially what agile software
development is about that's one of the
tenants of agile software development is
the idea that we're working as a team
but we added this slightly different
wrinkle to it that we're working on the
same computer so we have a single
computer that everybody's working at
conceptually that computer is the only
computer that when we're working
together any code goes into our code
base we have other computers around but
we're essentially working on this single
computer so we'll see what that's all
about if that still seems it interesting
to you stay but I believe in the law of
two feet and that is if you not get in
value at that it will not hurt my
feelings I won't show how much it hurts
my feelings when you get up and leave
okay because I really believe you have
to be in control of your own learning at
conferences like this right okay this is
what it looks like from the front and
this what it looks like from the back
does that make sense so you can see
everybody's sitting together we got a
couple of tables couple of projectors to
act as monitors we
always have a couple keyboards so that
different people have different
preferences they can use the keyboard we
want we've we've had several other
keyboards we tried out there's some
other computers around but the one
that's in use right now is actually
let's see if I get this to work this one
right here and the other ones are not
connected to what the team is doing
they're used for other purposes we'll
talk about it's part of what the team's
doing but not the code we're putting in
I got way too much material to do in the
time we have so I'm going to scoot
through it pretty fast but this gives
you a view from the other direction you
can see we've got a projector we painted
out the wall with some projector paint
or whatever so that would protect nicely
and that's how we work as a group so
I've got a little three minute video
that I'm going to show you now well
let's go on to this we call it day in
the life and I'm just going to play it
and I'll talk through it because it
doesn't have sound and okay so this is a
day of mob programming or whole team
programming we spend the first hour I
don't know if you can make it out in the
back there with an hour of learning we
spend the first hour every day learning
together studying something in this
particular case we were talking about
cohesion but it doesn't really matter we
don't do a stand-up like a lot of agile
teams do we don't just stand up because
we're all already aligned and we stay
aligns throughout the day nobody has to
explain what they were working on
yesterday because we were all doing the
same thing we have the two projectors we
have the single computer we have a role
called the driver and the driver rotates
every 15 minutes so every 15 minutes
there's going to be somebody else at the
keyboard everyone else is considered a
navigator our product owners come and
sit with us they think we're great or at
least he let me put that on there as a
joke we have a manager in a coach of
course and he never does any real work
and this is what it looks like now
people always ask there's a person is
blurred out in these pictures that
person wasn't comfortable with being on
YouTube and stuff so i graciously bent
to her wishes and blurred her image out
it took me four hours to do that
so that you can see some these are the
back doing some solo work so we do solo
work as well it's not a forced thing
that we will work together all the time
buys dr. pepper can I say that on by Dr
Pepper they pay me to say that so you
can see so many different is at the
keyboard every little bit when we take
lunch this year has been a little hotter
than usual but we usually go out and
take a walk together and not everybody
has the same schedule your free to do
whatever you want this particular fellow
likes to walk after eats the rest of us
walk before we eat we keep our energy up
by doing that sort of an important thing
is to keep your energy level going it's
just one of the things we found that
works for us and then when we get back
this is the last few minutes of lunch
and then we kick back in again and we
work this way all day long we have for
three years so that might seem a little
bit hard to do but unexplained a lot
about why this kind of works we're
functioning as a team the whole time I
see a lot of people say oh this is my
team but they never actually do anything
that I would consider team like you know
they're sitting separately they're doing
that work separately they meet up
occasionally and that's okay if that's
what you call a team but it's not what I
call a team and I think we've seen
enough of this right it will end in a
second anyways that's not my computer
doing that is it
we'll see we get this plane again okay
so that gives you a pretty good idea a
couple photos and a three-minute little
shorty video which you can watch on
youtube by the way it's got about 8,000
hits now and it only took us two years
to get there so that's almost all most
viral right we're going to start making
money on that sin okay just kidding so
I'm going to ask audience participation
why would we work this way this four or
five reasons why would we work this way
we learn from each other more productive
we found that it actually is anything
else what's that so like automatic code
review always happening automatic design
review what's that quality we'll talk
about that just a little bit but yeah
our quality level is very high what's
that team bonding we are very that's an
important part of this so here's the
thing those are all good reasons why we
keep doing this these are some of the
benefits that we get from it but the
reason we work this way is because the
team decided to work this way that's
like a really critical part of my
philosophy is a people doing the work
can figure out how best to do the work
that's why we're really clear when we
talk about this we're not suggesting
anyone else do this this is the way we
work and we're sharing it we'll talk
about that more as we go along but the
team discovered this was working well
for him and that's what I'm going to
talk about right now we had a little bit
of work to do on a project that had been
put on the back burner because there
were a lot of problems with it somebody
had started on it before I came to work
there and when I got there part of my
job was to get them you know back on
track i'm an employee at a place called
Hunter industries that's a wonderful
place that makes irrigation products
great place to work they brought me in
to kind of help rejuvenate this team as
an employee there and so we were
learning to do a lot of the things that
I think we need to learn to do like pair
programming and tdd and refactoring and
all these kinds of things and to do that
we were doing these weekly
sessions where we were practicing
together and then one day we picked up
this work that I kind of put on the back
burner because the deadline was coming
and as we started working on it we
gathered in a meeting room like you know
how a meeting room you see has a long
table everybody sits around and there's
a projector projecting to one end of the
long table on a screen so we all set
there passing the keyboard around as we
were looking at this code just
rejuvenating or refreshing ourselves
about what this project was and at the
end of this two hours session of working
we had arranged for this room for a
couple hours everybody said well let's
just keep working this way but since the
room was scheduled for someone else we
went through our scheduler and found
another room somewhere else we went
there and over the next week or two we
just kept doing that every day we'd
start in working this way and at the end
of the day we do retrospectives at that
time we were doing retrospectives every
day at the end of the day we would say
what went well what didn't go well you
know that kind of thing and we just kept
on it and after about it it was almost a
month we found a little room that we
could use permanently so this was
something the team decided to do and we
just discovered it we didn't start off
saying well gosh if pair programming is
good let's get 20 people you know it was
just we're doing it this is working
let's keep doing it and we haven't
stopped it's been three years this week
oddly so this is I've tried to answer
all the questions that people have asked
me over the last two years since we
start talking about this so I'm trying
to cover all that if I miss something
please forgive me and I'll stay
afterwards and answer your questions but
how can we work this way and this is one
of the first things we discovered
because an agile manifesto we have this
first value of individuals and
interactions over some other stuff
everybody forgets about but it's
individuals and interactions we only
have people right pretty much they're
writing there's someplace around here
they're writing robots that will replace
us all but for the moment we just have
us and the people we work with to be
able to be sane in this environment we
needed to pick up something like this so
this is what we agreed on we'll treat
each other with kindness consideration
and respect
now I am the most disrespectful least
kind and considerate person you'll ever
meet but when you work with other people
who realize we need to work nicer
together we help ourselves become better
at acting kind and being considerate and
having respect for each other sometimes
if you just do the things that somebody
who is respectful would do you become
more respectful this is what we had to
do so to be able to work this way we had
to have this as our foundation we treat
each other well however that's not the
whole story so I'm going to share one of
the practices that we have we call it
driver navigator there's a guy his
name's Llewellyn Falco who I've been
interacting with now for seven or eight
years I learned a lot about what I know
about TDD and pair programming from him
and he had this concept of pair
programming that we call the strong
Perry seeing strong pairing any idea
that we have has to go out of our head
somehow and into the computer through
someone else's hands that's really an
important concept whatever idea that I
want to get to the computer we have to
be able to articulate well enough to
explain it to someone else who's going
to put it into the computer that's how
we get this real continual design review
and real continual code review its
vetted by everybody who's there it's a
pretty cool thing so I learned that as a
pair programming process and we adapted
it into our mob programming that's how
we got to mob programming was learning
to do that style of parapro maybe I
should ask anybody here do pair
programming okay so there's four or five
standard ways of doing pair programming
that's one that's worth best for me that
doesn't mean it would work best for you
it's just I learned it and it worked
well so we basically have the role of
the driver and the driver is at the
keyboard and their job is to translate
the stuff that's being thought about and
vetted by the group and getting in the
computer everyone else while that
person's at the keyboard is a navigator
so we'll see a very nice
presentation I personally put together
on how this works the keyboard is a dumb
input device right it does very little
unless somebody pokes at it well like
your normal developer i guess but
anyways then we have the driver the
driver is the one poking at the keyboard
in our model everybody is a navigator so
everybody on the team can act as a
navigator QA people we have on the team
designers whatever it happens to be we
rotate every 15 minutes the 15 minutes
is arbitrary you could do it every five
minutes when we first started we were
doing for 25 minutes we'd start rotation
at the beginning of the day we put
everybody's name down we're going to
fall it same rotation throughout most
that day when 15 minutes is up that
person comes down the next person goes
in for 15 minutes they're the driver
they're taking those instructions from
everyone else and putting them into the
computer we switch it up frequently a
question what if somebody is not a good
typist well I'll cover that a little bit
and I'll be glad to cover that
afterwards the thing is is that it's
only for 15 minutes and if you really
have a lot of trouble with things like
people aren't a good typist or a good
coder you might shrink it down to five
minutes they become quick better very
very quickly as somebody who's a half
way okay typist becomes a real great
typist after sitting in front of
everyone else you know that's sort of
what happens but we'll talk about that
and it's really what happens at the end
of the rotation we just start over again
that's one of the rules I learned from
will and Larson the basic idea is keep
the same order through the day it makes
it easy to think about so this is our
big fit practice and now I'll share a
little bit about a tool we started off
using my compact communication device to
as a timer these things come built-in
with timers you might not know that and
so I set it off for four minutes or
eight minutes but we would just ignore
it it comes place a funny sound for a
while but everybody just ignores it
because whoever's at the keyboard you
know what they'll say wait wait I'm
almost done i'm almost done this is not
the important thing
in programming by the way the important
thing is up here not the keyboard the
keyboard is just how we get what's up
here into the computer so we got a
really loud timer even just really blare
out that didn't stop us either we would
ignore the loud timer so one of the guys
on the team secretly just wrote a little
program that every 15 minutes would
blink out the screen and then you can't
do anything and that's so we turned it
into something actually works you can
see up in the corner I know if you can
make it out there's a list of the names
comes from a little file and we could
add names to it and whatever and then we
can set the timer there's a place over
to hit to set how long it's going to be
there's only one rule we have to follow
that little button in the corner
restarts the timer and the rule is it's
the person who's coming to drive next
who gets to do that if you're already
sitting there you're not supposed to
restart the timer so that makes sense
we're just going to roll through and
another question
it's a it's a weird thing but it's not
about the code it's not about typing in
it's about the communication that's
going on so I would say there's probably
five or six other patterns we could fall
I've watched one team doing this where
they would just work to the end of a
they'd write a test and work through the
end of the test and then they rotate do
you could do it different ways so the
question is basically why i use is time
or white shut it off but my experience
has been let's break that bond with the
keyboard and then once we've done that
then we have a better attitude about our
coding I could get pretty evil about
staying in control a lot of pair of
programmers do and this just makes it
where you just mix it up and you can use
this with a pair as well okay this is a
question we always get asked how can we
be productive with five people at one
computer I have no idea so I don't have
an answer for it I have some idea that
we are more productive and I have some
guesses about that I've observed now and
I've been trying to collect this to
answer this better but I really don't
know I just know that this is what we
saw with the five of us at that time we
had five people we did a certain output
and when we work together as a group we
got a much greater output now output
isn't a good way to measure software
productivity outcomes is results is is
this making more money for our company
but hardly anybody measures things that
way but i'm going to point something out
one of the people on the team I grabbed
a bunch of those yellow and blue cards
which represent essentially projects we
are working on or parts of projects and
stories we're working on we don't break
it down to the task level on our cards
like some people do I grab those out of
a bucket and threw them down so I could
take a picture of them and then I put it
back in the bucket and we put the
picture up on the screen to kind of look
at it and make sure there wasn't
anything proprietary there there's
probably some really important business
secrets well one of the guys here said
hey all of that work was done in two
days you can see the dates we mark it
red when it got done except one card as
two days worth of work the other one
probably represents cults of the
closer to three or four days are a whole
week I have no idea exactly what is
going on but I'm going to share some of
that idea with you now I I got to say
that a little differently I have my
guesses but they really they're not
proof of anything so I can't really say
this is why we're more productive but
this is a thing some more bodies
participation what are the things that
destroy productivity you guys are all
massively productive okay context
switching a big one another one
duplication okay what else distractions
what's that can some of these meetings
meetings yes meanings James put
political games particularly but just
sitting there and allowing yourself to
do something else what do they do
nowadays it used to be World of Warcraft
what do they plan now same thing they
still haven't won geez okay what else
how do we just what destroys
productivity morale problems
communication problems boredom do you
say boredom boredom like this boredom
okay what else
what bug fixes bugs okay I don't think
we need to go any further we may list of
about 20 items I picked the top seven or
eight communication decision-making
doing more than barely sufficient
technical debt bugs thrashing that's
context switching politics meetings you
guys could write this talk if we could
get rid of all these problems what would
happen we would just automatically
become more productive I think but
here's the thing we didn't set out to
solve any of these problems we just
noticed something that was working good
for us and we kept doing it that's a
very different thing oh did somebody
just send me an email it's a very
different thing than setting out to
solve problems massively different this
is said what we noticed we notice that
many of the problems just faded away
when we start working as a real team now
I have a long history of teamwork myself
because I did things in my younger days
that required that people actually work
together in doing real team things like
an installation crew or maybe a group
putting on a concert where everybody has
to work all at the same time doing this
one concert they're all interacting with
each other so here's the thing if they
just faded away this is like extreme
programming what Kent Beck had said
about he thought of all the practices
that he knew worked and how did he know
they worked because he had experience
with them that they did work he didn't
have any proof he knew for himself they
were working he noticed he thought of
him as like a control board with a knob
for each practice what happens if I just
turned them all up that's what he says
in his book extreme programming
explained I think that was a book great
book so that's the practice we were
doing let's just turn that up so that's
sort of what happened to us so let's
look at a few of these now we're going
to run out of time if I go through all
of these so I might skip some slides but
I've heard this is a good conference for
skipping slides somebody told me that
okay
communication problems now I like to say
this because once I worked at a place
where they were having various
communication problems so they put
together a little team to list out the
problems and see what we could do about
them and like we ended up doing a
two-day presentation on communication
problems so I've kind of given up on
that there's just so many problems I'm
going to share one with you so I call
this a question cute i'm ok you know
what cute i'm is like so when
something's waiting in a queue to be
worked on that's its that's its cute i'm
ok so this is the thing the amount of
time we must wait to get an answer to a
question that is blocking us I worked on
a job once where I was allowed every
Monday to talk to the main tonight who
could answer questions for me so what am
I boss told me to do just save up your
questions does that work that does not
work because you're blocked so we'll
talk about this so question Q time we do
a value stream map you guys know what
value stream maps are will show you a
little bit what that is a value stream
map the green bar at the top is we're
getting work done the red bar at the
bottom is we're blocked on something so
if we think about it with with waiting
at the end of the green we got a
question we need to have answered we go
to the person who can answer it they're
not there we can't move on until they
come back that's that's what a value
stream map is the stuff across the top
is giving value this stuff across the
bottom is not giving value so this
example very contrived if we got one
blocking question every hour we worked
that's my example I'm going to give you
the ideal q time is 0 right we asked the
question get the question we need to
have answer to get the answer
immediately so I'll quickly show you
this so that's what a value stream map
would look like if we were always just
getting value if you can see in the back
that green bar all the way across so
that's the ideal what if it took us two
minutes what if it took us 10 minutes
how much time we were losing in the day
on the 10 minute one
about an hour an hour a little bit more
than hour what if it took us an hour to
get those answers wonderful was like the
job I was on by the end of monday i had
enough blocking questions i couldn't go
on a to wait all week but here it's just
if it's one day that's what we're
getting productive time is almost zero
compared to the question answering time
here i've just bundled them up because
you know we want to see things clearly
16 minutes weights 70 minutes waste four
hours ways to eight hours waste in the
eight-hour day so we kind of extend the
waste into tomorrow morning so how do we
typically solve this we've got this kind
of a look let's say this is ideal
example this doesn't really exist every
hour we get a blocking thing and it
takes an hour to get to answer so how do
we usually solve this switch to
something else so we get another ideal
task that exactly fits up there so we
can do this to it we do enough tasks
always keep us busy but what problem are
we solving by doing this we've noticed
the people that are doing the work
aren't busy enough so we're solving the
problem of them not looking busy enough
that's the symptom of the problem what's
the problem what's the problem can't get
the answer in time the answers take time
to get let's solve that problem that's
the real problem so how does the mob
solve that problem any question that you
would ever have to ask of another
developer essentially gets answered
immediately we have zero cute I'm so
sure certainly well right but this only
one kind of a question we'll look at the
other one in a minute if like typically
on a team the team lead is a guy
everybody goes to with a question and
he's always busy doing other stuff or
she they go over there to talk to him
and it turns out they can't answer the
question right away we don't have that
anymore we actually anticipate those
things a lot of questions don't even
come up because we're anticipating where
we're going but the other thing is with
our product donor the specifications are
clear are so we made an arrangement with
our people we work with they have to be
available to answer a question within
two minutes whatever they're doing now
they can't always do that so we have to
be able to switch every now on that but
this solved the problem for us we pretty
much put in a rule if you want us to do
this project for you you got to work
with us so you can get it done quickly
and we did it done quickly by you
answering those questions quickly that
this doesn't solve all of it but it
solves a lot of it this is what we found
we basically have an automatic one-piece
flow you know what like that is right
you just work on a thing till it's done
then we're going another thing till it's
done so all the brilliant people because
we are all brilliant in software
development right all the bringing
people working on the same thing at the
same time with the same goal we get it
done quickly this is just what we
noticed I don't know if there's a
science behind this I'm not a
psychiatrist psychologist researcher
professor I just know that this is what
it seems like to me I don't know
decision-making problems there's two big
things that I noticed with decision
making before you make the decision
you're reluctant to make the decision
till you gather enough information
enough sign-offs enough other people
looking at it so we're reluctant to
commit by the way my wife did all the
drawings that I have in here and the
only reason I even am invited to
conferences to speak is so people can
see her beautiful drawings so I just
love her work imagine in this situation
why is that crab reluctant to eat that
worm
because he knows at the other end of the
worm half the time it's not just a worm
and it's something that's going to kill
that's how we are we're reluctant to
make those decisions we get sign-offs we
see those email queues both going back
and forth from our from us to somebody
else and then they include their boss in
it and comes back to us so we have to
include our boss in it and it goes back
and forth and back and forth till
finally somebody makes a decision that
they feel they can support later on why
do we need to do that this is why we
need to defend our decision why do we
need to defend it because it would
reflect really badly on us at
performance review time that we made bad
decisions so now no matter how bad the
decision is we have to be really good at
defending our decision so that just
happens to be a picture I think this is
a picture of my wife made of herself
waiting for me to get home not really
but that I all of her art that I use I
just see something she doesn't go can I
use that in my presentation so I find
something kind of matches for me she
doesn't do this stuff most of the time
directly because I ask her to do it she
just lets me borrow it but look at that
you've got your boss maybe our dog on
the floor there is kind of like the boss
he's going to help defend you got your
own defense the shotgun and you're
becoming more and more irrational over
time that's basically how I see this
because what's happening is as we go
further and deeper into a bad decision
we we're defending it even though we
have no real defense anymore and I've
seen this happen many times we don't
have that on our team everybody who's on
the project is working with us
throughout the whole thing any decision
that we make we make together so this is
sort of how it is this little guy could
get as wild as he wants and notice
either going to pay attention to them or
they're going to arrest them but this
group of people will get something done
because they are all tuned in on the say
they're going to tar and feather
somebody regardless if it was a good
decision or not and tomorrow they could
go wait we tarred and feathered the
wrong guy it's not so good for that guy
but for the rest and they go we can go
on with our lives give them a little
retribution and I mean a little what do
they call it you pay them for
restitution so it's called pay up pay
off the poor guy that you just messed up
and go on with your lives basically this
is the way we look at it we make the
decision quickly because we know we can
undo it quickly and we're all involved
in it we're making better decisions all
the time so we've gotten rid of the need
to defend our decisions because we know
we can move quickly passed a bad
decision we make a lot fewer bad
decisions because everybody's looking at
it at the same time we'll go on doing
more than the bare necessities this is
one thing that often bothers me on
projects and we've kind of solved we're
all the whole team focusing on what's
the least we can do right now to deliver
I don't know if they're delivering a
good thing or a bad thing I just like
the picture the point being that as we
work on something somebody on the team
is going to say you know that's good
enough let's go on so we have this
automatic let's move on and we've
instilled this in everybody so our
product owners by onto this as well
they're paying attention to if we can
get this delivered today because we try
to deliver every day if we can deliver
this today do we have enough value to
give some value out of this thing let's
deliver it and otherwise let's let add a
little bit more but we can always add a
little bit more tomorrow but almost
always what happens by tomorrow we've
figured out something even better we
want to work on so we've lost that just
doing everything out of our system and
we focus on just doing a little bit at a
time this is kind of how we do it I'm
going to go through this really quick
basically any idea it means something we
need to learn and we turn into what they
call a story which just basically means
if you click on this that happens then
we design it encode it this is all
happening in a very short amount of time
10-15 minutes to this point by the time
we got it ready to go into real use and
we try to do this three or four times a
day on the things we're working on we
can now get feedback you can't really
get feedback on it and tell somebody's
using it that's not true with everything
you know you don't want to send somebody
to the moon and they have and say you
know this is a working so well however
most of stuff we write isn't like that
and now we can avail evaluate what we
got you know and what new did we learn
and it all starts over again but the
interesting thing is
at what point in here is discovery
happening give it a shot come on every
point everywhere in here discovery is
happening we want to accentuate that we
want the continuous discovery all the
time and in this mode that we work we
get that it's hard to get this when
everybody split apart doing their work
we'll see a little bit of that in a
minute technical debt now I don't look
as large as I have looked at certain
times in my life because I often had a
weight problem you've heard this thing
in the software used to say garbage in
garbage out remember that I don't know
do people still say that garbage in
garbage out you put garbage in puts in
it doesn't matter what comes out the
other end it's not going to be correct
but with me with junk food it's garbage
and garbage stays you get the point
garbage in garbage days I don't need to
junk food I stay trimmer than I am right
now I've been eating too much it's the
same thing with technical debt we take
on a little bit of technical debt and it
stays and then we take on more technical
debt and it stays and it actually
multiplies our chance of taking on more
technical debt you know this is a
problem so how do we deal with that so
I'm going to try I want to see if I have
enough time oh you'll have to look that
up on the Internet
the basic idea is is anything that we
allow to stay in our code that we know
we should fix that it's because you I'll
give a real quick example if you've if
you've written a little chunk of code
and you look at and go this thing's kind
of a mess but we don't have time to fix
it then the next person who works on it
has to read it and try and understand it
and then they have to hack around it and
that just grows and it grows so that's
what they call technical debt the basic
idea is it's like credit card debt if
you pay by something credit card you now
have to pay interest as well if you let
that go on very long you know they come
and take away your Porsche or whatever
it is what's that you want to go back
I'm always going forward what do you
want you want this one again another one
I think I won't get to the end of this
yeah that's you're probably right most
of what I have here is wrong so that
it's through the feedback you've just
given me that I know that we can so this
is really more of a loop each one of
these little parts so you're probably
right but write me a flame to one of my
blogs and and then I'll then I'll resist
no
I don't know much guys I just sharing
some stuff that we do so this is the
thing some stories come up on your board
we're going to work on these three
stories are these things the same
they're never the same but a lot of
times they're similar so let's pretend
this is a case about one aspect of
technical debt we have three similar
stories always looking at them on the
board three different people are going
to work on them they pull them down they
don't really necessarily yet notice the
similarity so they go work on them the
one guy pretty good programmer comes up
with a nice clean design does anybody
remember object-oriented programming now
they don't do that anymore right but
that was in the day of object or any the
next person they do their design not
quite as good as the first guy but they
still got something working someone else
has a completely wacky idea still the
code works for the moment but this is
what we get similar ideas as far as the
problem we're trying to solve turn into
even more dissimilar ideas as we code
them unless we're all paying attention
that they are very similar and we work
together to get the result so this is
basically what happens when my team
works on something because it's
one-piece flow we're all working on
every problem the first one comes in to
the team and we work on it and we always
come up with the best solution we can
and I'm going to make a really strong
point about this the best person on the
team for any aspect of what we're doing
the rest of the team rises to that for
that particular thing it's just what
happens because we interject when we
feel we can best add to our result so if
I think I've got a good idea for this
I'm going to express it so that's
basically what happens to us we get a
pretty good design every time however
the next one comes in somebody on the
team and that could be the next day it
could be a week later it could be a
month later it could be a year later
something on the team's going to go that
rings a bell and this is an interesting
i remember we did something like this
and someone else on the team will now
say yeah I think you're right and
between the three or four people are
there five people we have this
collective memory and we're going to
draw out of ourselves that similarity
which we don't find it when we work
individually even doing code reviews and
stuff
let yes I I'm going to run out of time
quickly and I will I will answer every
I'll stay here till midnight and answer
every question but we'll get through
this to the end now yeah it's already
warning me yes we still have a little
bit of time I'll answer at the end of
this if we still have time when the
second story comes in and we recognize
that similarity we will go back and
refactor the code and pull out the
commonality and the variability parts
are you familiar with that idea right we
do that and then all we need to do is
write the variable part now the next one
comes in we don't even have to abstract
out anymore necessarily we just go ahead
and write it this is a good way to work
and this keeps us from getting that
technical debt of dissimilar problems
that's a kind of code duplication same
basic results done in very different
ways but this really starts paying off
that was one way of pays off when we get
a bug report so here it is what
technical debt and this is technical
debt free do those look like better
designs I hope they look like better
designs to do it this way but it doesn't
matter here's what happens a bug report
comes in and there's a bug we fixed it
and we fixed it now what usually happens
when you have three similar
functionalities coded three different
ways that bug is going to report get
reported two different times or more
those bugs often happen because somebody
misunderstood something about the
business logic maybe early on and never
got communicated through and we find
them spread throughout our code this
next one we have three or four places we
need to fix it this one you don't even
know how many they get about to this
point and what does somebody say rewrite
it so who gets to rewrite it that same
idiot that wrote it in the first place
so this is the new version of it
and those paintings are also by my wife
i love these paintings that's what
happens so by everybody working together
on these things we've avoided this and
this is just one example of one kind of
technical debt let's go on so we'll talk
about thrashing that's my dog Homer
Homer is a wonderful and very brave dog
except for when loud noises happen loud
noises freak home or out I'm going to
watch this watch this very carefully
going that's what happens to Homer when
a noise happened he goes in the corner
he'd start shivering and even if it like
it's a storm that still miles away he
knows it before we know it and so he'll
get the car and go oh there must be a
storm coming but all I need to do is go
around the drill or go make a smoothie
and he gets freaked out this is a kind
of thrashing I'm a once made a list at a
workshop we made a list of all the
thrashings we could identify and I think
we came up with 40 different kinds
including all kinds of sabotage a baton
and things like that anyways this is
what happens to developers they get in
the middle of something and then
somebody comes in interrupts them they
might be in the flow as they say they're
deep working somebody comes but it calls
to be there a middle of a job and the
next morning you know they come in they
haven't started in that day and someone
comes in says all we need your work on
this other thing for a while now often
it's a vice president in the stories you
hear the vice president comes in and
says oh we need you to help us because
we got a conference coming up got a
trade show who is it they take off the
team when they need to do the trade show
the best guy if I had a t-shirt I'd
throw it at you because you've already
answered half the questions I appreciate
it they take the best person off what
does that do to the rest of the team
that's the one person they go to get
their answers from there's already taken
them an hour to get the answers now it's
going to take them days to get the
answers okay that's just one kind of
thrashing there's two ways to deal with
thrashing and problems of this type one
is you just remove them and the other is
you make them where they're irrelevant
okay so this is how we remove it first
of all when we're working as a team I've
actually seen this happening vice
president comes in there and they go all
you guys are in the meeting okay I'll
come back and then they never come back
they go raid some other team they get
the brilliant person off the other team
that's so we've seen that happening but
another way is well first of all let's
go through this if we just remove it by
dedicating ourselves that we are not
going to allow things to thrash us
that's why we block it from us we say
we're just not going to go do those
things we're not going to give in and
when it's the whole group we can do that
it's hard to do that as an individual
because it's on your performance review
you wouldn't help the vice president and
therefore we lost a big client or
whatever but let's look at this other
way to make it irrelevant first of all
the teams all here working together
somebody comes in with a oh there we go
something the thrash and they drag
somebody off but all that collective
memory has stayed in the team we're
still working on the thing we wanted to
be working on and as we work on it we
are moving ahead we're not waiting to
ask somebody a question because we've
all been deeply involved in it the whole
time when that other person finally
comes back he can get activated back
onto the team very quickly because this
idea that all the information he needs
is right there and as they watch it
happening the next bits of coding
they're familiar with the problem and
it's somebody on the team is also going
to say oh you know how we solved that
thing so everybody gets back up to speed
really quickly another way and I like
this one even better is when we're
active and we're really working and
something comes in that's really an
emergency to deal with then we just take
it on as a whole team let's just get it
done and then we'll get back to whatever
we had everybody there's enough
collective memory about what we were
just working on before this happened as
soon as we bring it back on the screen
we're all going to good somebody's going
to go oh yeah here's right where we were
it's a really marvelous thing to see
happen and by the way if you're ever
down in San Diego where we're from and
you have a day you want to come by you
can come mob with us for a day and see
how we do this stuff so you always
welcome to do that as long as you're a
halfway reasonable human being and all
of you probably are a halfway reasonable
human being right okay so this is
basically how we deal with thrashing I'm
watching my clock quite a bit here
politics I can't really solve most of
company politics problems with this mob
programming thing but one thing that I
have noticed is a lot of teams I've been
on over the years is people will get
their own work done if that is how they
are rated for their performance over
helping somebody else not everybody's
that way but if I don't get my work done
today and it reflects poorly on me I'm
going to get my work done quickly so at
least solves that part of the politics
of it that we can at least say I'm
willing to help others now I'm not going
to waste time because it's a team effort
so that's that's all I'm going to say
about this one I can go on and on about
the politics &amp;amp; Company matter of fact
that's probably the biggest problem in
software development today is all those
problems of of territorialism and
parochialism empire-building people
protecting their careers people just
happy to be holed up in its summit
somewhere in the company just wait now
for retirement all those things and then
power these power plays people make this
is about safety and there's somebody
here who talks about that a lot Joshua
Carrie husky and ons an earring so this
is an important thing we deal with that
quite a bit on our team but I'm not
gonna go into more details who said
meetings meetings are a big time-waster
I'll ask the question are these people
going to or coming from a meeting yeah
we dread going to them so what we do in
meetings what a meeting normally is is
people gather together to get some
information together share the
information here the information be told
something then they kind of bat it
around a little bit so they can make a
decision about it then they assign some
things for people to do and everybody
goes off so we're aligned for the period
at somewhere near the end of that
meeting and then when we leave we start
getting out of alignment immediately
I've actually been I was in a place
where for about five or six weeks this
one guy would get assigned something
when he come back he said no that was
Jose Joe was supposed to do that and he
would say then at the end of the meeting
they say no you got to do that he was a
no problem i'll have a done by close of
business today and at the next meeting
he said no Joel was supposed to do that
it was like his good pattern
that worked well for him oh that's a
good point so I'll bring that up real
quickly we have a single phone and we
have a single email account so all
communications with the team is done
with through a single email account and
all communications over the phone is
done with a single phone we always pick
up the phone and say hey you're on
speakerphone the whole team's here that
keeps people so from saying nasty things
to us usually and by having that email
where we're all involved because what
happens on a team when the one person
they need to communicate isn't there
that day then it waits till the next day
and then maybe they send one to the boss
and say why didn't this guy take care of
it that's why we always have those
things that automatically send back I'll
be back on Tuesday yeah so we the only
kinds of meetings we have anymore most
of the time are the company-wide kind of
things like safety meetings or T you
know the department wide meetings I have
nothing to do with the specific work
we're doing all of our meetings are done
with all the people that need to be
there come and work with us you know we
very rarely do anything beyond that
that's a kind of a different topic than
the mob programming itself it's about
really about that one-piece flow and I
be happy if you can arrange with them
here to do another talk I could do
another hour on that continuous learning
so this is just a little observation
about what has happened to us we noticed
we went from a mode where it's hard to
do learning to a mode where we're
continuously learning two things I'm
going to speak about this this again can
be a whole day I can workshops on
refactoring and things like that and we
do them in a mob situation where
everybody works together because these
kinds of learnings are really powerful
but this is what we learned about how we
should act about learning this is a
demonstration here let's imagine that's
a mother and she's teaching her daughter
how to bake something and then when this
happens the mother could say you idiot
why did you do that let me do it or she
could say that's exactly what happened
to me the first time I did it and here's
why I think that happens maybe there's a
better way so if you take the right
attitude the learning happens you take
the wrong attitude the learning stops at
some point that that girl will be riding
a motorcycle getting tattoos hanging out
with the wrong kind of P
we've got trouble this is the other side
of it though so we need to have the
right attitude when if someone is making
a mistake another thing is it's often
the junior person who has a new idea
that is useful to the rest of the team
you might not have noticed I'm a
slightly old and my ways of solving
problems are very different from a lot
of the ways the people that are my team
that are very junior to me I would never
have thought of their ideas I want their
ideas that's what keeps us up to date so
this is the idea that the junior person
often has something way bigger value
than we give them credit for and we have
to be watching for that so that's just
what I wanted to say about continuous
clip learning we are always learning in
our environment not just during our
study periods and we have to do it with
the right attitude this is a warning we
taught someone mentioned this and we
even have one the team members write a
blog article about he wasn't a very good
typist coding isn't about typing you are
going to be exposed anything you don't
do well will be shown to everyone else
and we all make mistakes so you have to
take that kindness consideration respect
and realize you have to extend that to
everyone else so they can be comfortable
making mistakes in front of you because
if you make it where it's difficult for
them to make mistakes they'll hide their
mistakes and you can't hide it in this
environment so it becomes very
uncomfortable so that makes sense you
know you have to change how you behave
towards each other to make this work so
you are going to be exposed some people
just can't deal with that they're not
any lesser of a human being because of
it you know if somebody just can't stand
to work in front of other people they
still bring a lot of value and can do
work it's just in this environment
that's a tough thing to do so I'll cover
this only for a second I think we've
covered everything pretty well and still
have a few minutes left we pay a lot of
attention to our organ aam ecstatic or
next rain dies at the end of the day
everybody's you know from squinting at
the screen and stuff like that so we
learned just the right height to put the
screen everybody has their own chair so
when you come up to you
turn at the keyboard you bring your own
chair with you you get your choice of
keyboards and if the people did there's
working here weren't happy with those
keyboards we'd let them go find one that
they want to bring on and then they
bring it you know we had our HR
department has this thing where they'll
come and do an assessment and they gave
us like five different keyboards to try
and we try the ones that everybody
decided on the particular ones and
that's what we use also same with the
mice somebody wanted a trackball thing
whatever you have to be the key to it is
you have to be able to switch quickly
like some guys use coal Mac you know
Cole Mac it's anybody do Cole Mac
keyboard if you note Vorik keyboard so
Cole mac is like the extra geeky version
of Dvorak keyboard so it's like you
hardly move your fingers to use it you
know it's for controlling carpal tunnel
and stuff well that's fine you can use
any keyboard layout layout you want as
long as we can switch between keyboards
quickly so we have to figure out and
solve that problem the thing overall is
though we got to take care of ourselves
so there's a big tenet of agile software
development is this is it got to be
sustainable if at the end of a week or
two we're feeling bad backs and our eyes
are strained we have to figure that out
and solve it so we can keep working well
day after day you notice at the
beginning we work it basically an
eight-hour day four days at four hours
of work an hour for lunch four hours of
work so we're not extending our hours in
the three years three and a half years
I've been there I think we've worked
late maybe at extra hour two or three
times and that's it and the whole team
to tell you that if they were here
because they would fear retribution from
me not at all not at all and I invite
them to come and they've gone out on a
lot of talks with us so what is the
ideal member number of team members
everybody always asks this question so
I'm going to share that here first of
all I don't know what the top level is
but when you get under three it's pair
programming so
you do the math as they say so we've
been finding working with five or six
has worked well with us we've worked
with as many as 12 people I did some
demonstrations with as many as 16 people
I have no idea if we want it if we have
the time I wanted to do it here i bet
you we could put enough of a team
together out of this group here to
program almost any problem in the world
and we could start out with the mob and
it's some at some point we would
discover how to break it up and we have
a heuristic that we use let me see if I
have a separate sighs this is our this
is what we do if you don't feel that
you're contributing or learning that's
probably a good time to take a break and
go work on something alone or take a
pair with you and go do something else
it's completely dynamic there's no rule
that says you have to be focused the
whole time if you just feel like you
need to take a break you can just sit
there and zone out it doesn't really
matter programmer zone out all the time
anyways so but the team can keep working
there's no rule about this so that's the
basic our basic heuristic if you just
don't feel you're contributing and you
don't feel you're learning go work on
something else there's plenty you can
work on probably on your own this is
really important to me if you'd up one
practice let it be retrospective the
reason this is important to me is we
would never have done what we're doing
without that but by doing this we would
have discovered something that worked
better for us whatever it might have
been it might not have been more
programming it might have been something
else completely different but if you
continually looking at what you're doing
and viewing it for getting better at it
reading and studying see what other
people are doing so you can reflect
meaningfully you're going to come to
something better than you are at today
so we at that time we were doing daily
or every few days very short
retrospectives it's a good thing to do
so people always ask us do we recommend
mob programming what do you think
we don't recommend this exactly what we
do is share what we're doing this is
really what it's about maybe this is
something they'll work for you but maybe
not don't go back to your place of work
and say you know what we should do
because that's going to somebody's going
to hate you for it I guarantee that I've
got a lot of people who hate me out
there we're just sharing because people
asked us to share and I think we're at
the end of this thing we do invite you
to the base most important thing there
pay attention to work what works you got
to listen to each other you got to see
what's going on around you I love this
idea explore innovate in Shinto what
works listen see observe reflect to knit
adjust and I love this saying from
robert henri robert henry ought was an
artist an art teacher so when i'm going
to modify it slightly for us the object
isn't to make great software is to be in
that wonderful state which makes great
software inevitable let's put that
together let's put that together and the
great software will just happen we've
probably forced the software through
that's never going to work I think we're
kind of at the end guys thank
so I think that we have like five
minutes I could answer questions and
then I could sit and answer questions
beyond this if you want somewhere out in
the hall yes back there you yes without
side developers off-site yeah remote
yeah so right now one of our team
members is remote and we we have to use
a system that allows screen sharing the
work very very well and it works it
works great so I wouldn't do it
necessarily right off the bat but if
that's all I had and the team wanted to
do it whatever they think will work but
yeah and I know of a group a ruby group
of Ruby programmers that are doing this
all the time completely everybody's
remote so you can look that up Pat
Maddux Ruby steps and see what they're
doing another question encourage more
navigation that's an interesting thing
because you know what happens is the the
whoever's considered the most capable on
the team can can often be just relegated
everybody else is just say okay you're
the one doing it so that's a position on
the team that has to be extra where that
that's happening and just allow others
to to do the navigating it but not
everybody starts out good at navigating
so the question basically is how do you
how do you encourage people to navigate
and so if something it's a skill that
you have to build but almost everybody
on this team as has gotten pretty good
at navigating so that's a good point you
can't practice it we do a lot of
practicing to another question the
average job experience on the team all
bad no let's see so mean the number of
years yeah so when we started here we
had everything from someone's been
programming two or three years to
somebody's been programming 15 and 20
years so and I've been programming 30
years so that's what ever the average of
that year mathematician you can figure
that okay
how do you compensate you mean to like
performance review kind of stuff so my
own philosophy and you know I got to be
careful because this isn't you know my
company that I own or anything but my
basic philosophy is this teamwork so
everybody's on it's a level playing
field if there's a raise to be had
everyone would get the same amount so
that's not something I'm really able to
talk much about but that's my philosophy
of how this thing should be I think
overall throughout the industry
throughout the world in all industries
that's certainly a broken part of work
that we need to figure out I don't have
the answers for that I'll be dead soon
enough and I won't care after that so
yes sir I never do any real work no so
my job is essentially one of the team
members kind of put it correctly I think
once it said I've sort of a tour guide
so like I know if we go down that alley
we're safe we can go get the wonderful
food at the end of it but if we go down
somebody's going to beat us up that's
kind of the things that I know about so
my main job is to make sure that we are
progressing well and then I'm protecting
the team from things that they can't
protect themselves from and trying to
make things better so the basic idea is
as a leader I think of myself as
providing a vision that we can move
towards and as a manager I'm helping
support the environment that we're in
that's basically I do the team is really
self managing yes
lines and he says no because the
technical
if that really actually ever happened is
this the idea of if a product manager
tells us to allow technical debt into
the product how do we deal with that
this has nothing to do with mob
programming but this basically just has
to do with us as professional
programmers it would be like you know
hey we got six people that we got to do
heart transplants on quit sewing up
everybody you know it's like we got the
heart replaced let's just leave the
heart open now they let's go on to the
next guy we have to close things up
correctly so if as professionals we have
to take responsibility for that if the
company is saying no let's take on all
the technical debt we want not where I
work but at some other company cuz we
don't do that then you know that's what
resumes are for right so yes working
together is wonderful what excuse
everyone in our biases views that is the
productivity with a plan maybe so so
saying what everyone in this view so as
we become more experienced it might be
less productive overall and as we come
more experience maybe we can apply
experience better if we're working
separately and that's all possible so I
would experiment with that and see if
that actually is true and and if it was
otherwise we could be building new teams
with this team as a nucleus I don't know
there's a million paths we can go down
and we can we can defend all of them
equally well it's kind of like John Kay
says about Benjamin Franklin Franklin's
gambit it's like the wonderful thing
about being rational human beings is we
can rationalize any decision we make
right so that's I have no idea i'm just
sharing some experiences one more
question
what what how did we discover it I tried
to cover that the basic idea was we were
doing using coding dojos to practice
coding things we want to learn to do so
the coding dojo is very similar to this
it's a little more strict than this is a
method for working together to do a
learning experience and I'd learned that
from the well and Falco by the way who
had learned it from the people from the
Paris software craftsmanship group it
was a technique they developed almost
ten years ago I believe so it just came
to me and I saw it and I thought I like
that and so I start using it as a
teaching and studying tool and so it
just happened to be something the whole
team was familiar with in one day we had
a project we're working on that
everybody got together to look at and we
just started naturally passing the
keyboard around we have one of those
Wi-Fi what it can't bluetooth kind of
keyboards passing it around and it just
happens so we discovered it the key is
we noticed it was working well for us so
we kept doing it so we didn't sit down
an event you know what we need to
something to talk at conferences about
let's make up something so crazy that
nobody would believe this and they'll
come and listen to this it wasn't like
that ok so i think i can keep answering
questions once you know we have to leave
this space but but i'll go outside and
i'll answer questions if you want to ask
them thank you so much you already
clapped wait a second I'll clap for you
guys now thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
