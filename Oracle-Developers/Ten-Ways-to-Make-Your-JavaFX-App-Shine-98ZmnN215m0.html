this presentation called
ten ways to make your Java FX
application shine and I have to say it's
a big honor to be to be to be given the
last slot at JavaOne you know they've
always saved the best for last right so
yeah it's a big success know definitely
in this case yeah so we like to think of
it as you know all the sessions you've
been going to have been leading up to
this this is the highlight of this
conference a few words about us this
originally this was a very nice picture
of me until patter here came along and
added his touch to it
my name is Martin I work in in London in
Sweden at a company called axis
Communications and I work with mobile
apps and web apps and stuff like that I
like beer and I like to create graphical
stuff gooey coatings and things like
that so Java one is the perfect match
for me hi so my name is Pat and I work
as a consultant in Sweden and despite
this image I'm not that fond of dogs or
cats or cows my favorite pet
or should I say animal is actually
seagull so if you've been walking around
the pier 39 you might have seen them big
majestic you know just evil-looking
seagulls and I just stare down waiting
for you to just lose lose focus so they
can attack and they look so mean and
that's my favorite pet and I like bear
all right
and the worst part is that this is
perfectly true so yeah so we'll be
talking a bit about design specifically
design sort of design tips or design
routes for developers
actually we're not designers we don't
have fancy designer degrees or anything
so I hope there are no designers out
here so that we can actually say
whatever we want but we we've been
working a lot with user interfaces for
many many years and we think we have a
good idea of what works and what doesn't
and there are so many ugly programs out
there and we thought we'd do what we can
to make them look slightly less ugly and
so this is sort of our take on some
design tips for developers before you
starting before you start this design a
user interface
you should put some thought into sort of
the overall style of your application it
can vary a lot from something very
natural-looking to something very flat
like you can see in this example and
it's also it depends a lot on your
target platform if you want to create a
JavaFX application for Windows 8 to be
running sort of a metro look then you
should should of course not go for the
left style here and vice versa so you
can pretty much you pretty much have
three different options to go with and
that's the stick with the JavaFX default
theme or default cloaking field which i
think looks good and it's going to look
even better in JavaFX 8 their second
option is to sort of mimic the native
look and feel using something like
Equifax on the Mac for example which is
basically a CSS file that mimics the
look and feel of OS X or you can try to
create something entirely customized the
completely custom that convene for your
application and and sort of go all in
with your design but we'll start off
with our first point and that's
something that that's very important no
matter what style you're using and
that's layout so layout layout is one of
the things that we tend not to think
about too much we just take it for
granted
it's not that difficult and JavaFX has a
lot of different layout paints that we
can use so we have the board of pain
where we can add content to the center
which of the borders and we have flow
pane and we have grid pain that is like
a table we have stack pane to add
content in layers and we've anchored
pain H box
v box and typing so we have a lot to
choose from
now speaking of you know based on my own
experience I know that I always fall
back to the layout pains that I know and
I wrote my first swing program in 1998
and my teacher showed me the border
border
borderlayout in swing and that's why I
always go back to the border layout no
matter how the user interface looks
because I can always cram it in somehow
you know you can always you can always
use brute force to make it look good ish
but in some case I mean what if my
teacher would have shown me a flow pane
using a flow pane as the base layout
it's never gonna work ever
what a pain is is good enough choice
flow pane is not great pain is good so
what I'm saying is know your layout pace
spend time working with them try
something new don't always go with the
border pane try flow pane so another
thing that is related to layout this is
an example that I'm going to use during
this presentation and it's just well
it's kind of a registration form for
Java one and well it's it's okay but
it's not that okay there is something
missing
but let's start with the layout what
should I choose what layout would you
choose border pain and it would work so
I could I could put the logo type at the
top and I can put the labels in a in a V
box and put them in the West border but
it's not you know it's it's bit it's a
little bit confusing so a better choice
would probably be grid pane and since I
know that this application is going to
evolve during this presentation I know
the requirements and I know that the
grid pane is a perfect match so I'm
gonna stick to that and this is what it
looks like now there is something that
is its bit
I don't know it's bit oh it's bit too
much to beat crammed it's a bit cramped
so what I'm going to tell you right now
is the most important thing in the
entire presentation if you just remember
one thing this should be it space or
white space always add white space to
your application it's a simple group but
it's the most important group ever
now I know that some of you are thinking
hmmm this rule this the most important
rule in the universe it's not for me but
I'm sure I can guarantee you that it is
because if you don't add space to your
application you will end up here you
don't wanna go there
there is some space bottom left corner
that's a design miss I should have
should have putted something there you
know the banner is something so you
don't want to go there I mean this is a
bit extreme but you get the point you
get the point
oh yeah yeah so on the other side of the
spectrum is this it's Google and this is
something we use every day they have the
logo type and the search field and two
buttons it's it's easy for me to say
that of course that they should you use
this design I mean it's it's obvious but
I don't think it's obvious for Google I
think about it what if they added a
single banner do you know how much money
they would make another what about it
there's billions of dollars to be made
by just adding a few banners I mean why
not why shouldn't they
it's money so I think that this design
rule is for everybody adware whitespace
to your application and that's what I'm
gonna do
so this is my application and I'm gonna
do two small adjustments I'm going to
start by just adding some padding around
the content area of the application and
it's super simple using a grid paint so
I create the grid pane and I invoke set
padding and I provide the method method
with an inset subject now I will have 60
pixels surrounding the content area and
it will look like this much better one
line of code
the next thing I'm gonna do is just
adding some space between the rows and
the columns and we do that by getting
the column constraints object that is
available on the grid pane and I set two
columns column constraints the the first
one will set the first column to 160
pixels wide and the second column to 200
pixels it's that easy and then I do the
same for the rows so I set the logotype
should be a hundred pixel high and then
40 pixels for the form and then another
80 pixels for the logo and there are
other ways of doing this you can set
padding or margin inside the layout
container the bunch of different
different ways of doing this but I chose
to do it like this and this is what it
would look like you like it oh yeah it's
a big improvement
good job thank you so the message here
is don't get crowded everything that you
do mustn't end up on the on the screen
being shown to the user I know you like
you I know you like the feature that
you're developing but you don't have to
show them always I mean you could put
them in in a toolbar in a menu I mean
it's a possibility I know it sounds
crazy but you can do it so don't get
crowded ad space space is like air for
your users if you don't have space you
will choke them and unless you you want
to do that you should add space the
second thing we want to talk about is
adding style and now I'm just going to
show you very basic things of what you
can do with style and then Martin is
going to show some more advanced things
I hope so CSS is a powerful friend
I mean CSS been around in the JavaFX
world for a long time but it still
amazes me up of what you can do with it
if you've seen Jasper pots and the work
is doing
and the work is publishing at the
effects experience site it just it's so
amazing and it's all just CSS and a lot
of time I guess but it's basically just
CSS if you know CSS you can you do these
amazing things so take for example this
very simple Java fix example we have
four buttons it looks good but if I want
to if I want to change the way it looks
in a totally different way I can just
add some CSS and I've actually borrowed
this phone from Jasper Potts and it
might look a bit scary in the beginning
but once you get in there with it it's
dead simple you just set font family
ends and fails and sighs it's it's
really it's really easy to work with and
this is the result some CSS some Java
effects and a brand new look there are
other ways of doing it and I can create
a button and I can invoke set style and
just provide the method with an inline
CSS string in this case we will set the
text field to white and we can do it
using using F XML as well but just
adding the style attribute and if we
have a CSS file we can load it into our
scene graph but just invoking get star
sheet and add and provide the add method
where the reference to the CSS
and we can connect the CSS stylesheet in
the file with our notes so we've created
a button and we set ID and a style class
one way we can do it is just by
specifying that button and by doing that
we will affect all the buttons in the
scene graph we can specify the start
class so every node that has the side
class school buttons will have a text
field of white we can specify a specific
node with a specific ID by using
- my button I have my button and we will
in this case this specific button will
have a text field blue so it's using CSS
it's extremely powerful and it it it is
extremely easy it's easy for me to say
because I don't have to work with it but
you have some some serious so CSS
is a powerful powerful friend and you
should spend time working with it it's a
bit of an uphill in the beginning and
you have to learn CSS or the JavaFX CSS
version but it's definitely worth at the
time because you can make some really
good-looking applications right ok
so alpha tween we've seen how to add CSS
to our program let's talk a bit about
how to actually use it or what you can
use it for it and the first thing we
want to talk about is color now there
are I mean if you want to add some color
to your applications usually you have a
reason for that like we want to brand
the application using our corporate
colors and so on and in that case you
already have a color scheme that you can
use or at least be inspired by and pick
one or two colors from but if you're if
you really don't have anything to start
with you're starting from scratch you
know just want to make your application
look cool then you might want to you
might need some help picking colors or
you might need might need some
guidelines when you pick colors you just
you just
you just don't want to pick random
colors and put them together and there
are some very proven roots for picking
colors or choosing colors this is
nothing that we've come up with but it's
generally accepted color theory that
seems to work for designers I don't know
but this is a color wheel and it's
basically a circle with all the
different views of color that we can
think of of course you can have darker
versions as well but this is basically
to pick the color itself I'm using this
color wheel there are a few different
methods of of picking the colors that
you want to use in your application the
first one is called a monochromatic
color scheme and that that's basically
just picking a color and choosing a few
different shades of that color for your
interface so in this case I picked a
nice blue shade and created some
different variants of that that they are
guaranteed to work well together because
it's basically the same color the
drawback with the color scheme like this
might be that nothing really pops out
everything is it's sort of blended
together and it might be hard to guide
the user to focus on certain buttons and
so on so a better way might be to go
with a complementary color scheme and
this is pretty much the same thing but
you also add the color on the other side
of the color wheel too to your theme and
here you can do the same thing like pick
your if the blue is your primary color
you can add a few different shades of
that blue and that and I use the orange
for like the OK button or for warning
boxes and stuff like that if you want
even more shades you can use a triad
which is one main color and two colors
next to each other on the other side of
the color wheel and as you can see these
colors I'm picking using these rules or
guidelines they work pretty well
together and you can sort of rotate this
shape around or change the angle between
the different
spots and it's it kind of works and
another ways to use a tetrad where you
have two colors on each side and you get
the idea there are more more different
routes like this but these are the few
basic ones that I think work well here's
an example from an app I use quite
frequently called untapped and as you
can see it's it's obvious that they have
a very monochromatic color scheme they
basically have this yellow color and
darker versions of that and it works
very well I think it looks good you
can't really go wrong except maybe that
they could use a complementary color for
highlighting certain things
another example is it's not a real
application it's a design concept by a
woman called Elena Cordova and she
created this proof of concept for the
Prague zoo and she's been using a very
interesting color theme I think because
these are colors that you probably
wouldn't expect to work well together
but I think they really do and they
create a very interesting and complex
look that's it's interesting to look at
and I think it works incredibly well so
if you come up with something like this
people are probably either gonna love it
or hate it but I think you you're doing
the right thing at least pushing the
pushing the limits a bit so once you've
come up with the colors you want to use
no matter what method you use to find
them it's time to apply them to your
JavaFX application of course and there
are a few interesting color functions or
features in Java effects that we're
going to have a closer look at the first
one is called base color if we look at
this image you can see that there are
five buttons and what's interesting here
is that I've achieved these different
colored buttons by just setting a single
property called base or base color so by
adding a single property I can get a red
button a green button and so on but
what's really interesting is if we look
closer at one of these buttons you can
see that it's not just a
in orange it still has all the different
gradients and there are much more of
them that you might think at first you
have at least three one three of them in
the background of the buttons um and
they're still there but they're orange
so this is first it first it took very
obvious like yeah it's orange nothing
strange but then you start to think
about it's like wait a minute it's
orange but it still has all these shades
how does that work so yeah we're gonna
have a closer look at that you just set
it using the effects base style sheet or
style sheet properly so for example red
orange and so on and this affects my
example in a more realistic UI we have
structure of controls or now it's
looking like this this is from the scene
builder tool that I recommend everybody
to use it's a very nice tool when
working with JavaFX gooeys we have an
anchor pane with a couple of buttons a
slider and we have a grid pain with the
radio buttons and what I did in the
previous example was adding the effects
base CSS property to every single node
like this so I set the FX base red on
the first radio button you can see that
it turns red but CSS works in a very
clever way I mean that if I move this
property up one step to the containing
pain all the controls within or nodes
within that pain will inherit this style
so we're just setting it on one single
pane I have set it on all the radio
buttons which is of course much less of
a hassle and I can even move it all the
way up to the top node and have it sort
of being inherited down to all the
controls in this UI so this is very
clever and this is a very easy way of
sort of branding or adding adding a
color of a choice to a standard JavaFX
UI so you can have a red version an
orange one the other one or your
favorite the
pink one with a purple background and
the pony so how does this work we want
to keep sort of the shade but we want to
change the color of it and this is based
on something called derive in Java
effects using derive you can create
brighter or darker shades of a color so
here I have a simple circle with FX fill
the fill color red and using derive I
can create a lighter shade or a darker
shade so we have the derived function
with an input color and sort of a
modifier so we can both have a positive
percentage or a negative one but the
powerful thing with this is that derive
the derived function can also take
another style or a reference to another
color that we don't really know for
example if we wanted a darker border to
each of these circles we could set FX
border color derive and use FX field as
the input color so we would get a darker
version of that color no matter what
color it was
so some clever guy at Oracle has figured
all this out for us and we can just say
well I wanted 50% darker another example
here that also shows another fancy
feature of CSS in Java FEX that's not
there in CSS if you used it from HTML or
something like that and that's the
option to create variables in your CSS
so you see the lighter middle and darker
and properties up there
those aren't anything that's that I'm
setting or it's not anything existing
that I'm overriding its variables that
I'm creating so a great variable lighter
and I set that to a derivative of my
fill color that's a hundred percent
brighter than the failed color the
middle one is just a fill color and I
create a darker one as well then I set a
5 pixel wide stroke
a gradient to that so you can see that
immediately I get a very nice gradient
border that works with any field color I
can specify so this is really nice and
all of the all of the JavaFX components
or controls support this already so you
can play around with them and add this
base color to have them change change
the colors any way you want but there's
also another interesting thing with this
image that I showed em and there's
that's something called the ladder
function if we look at it again I said I
only set a single property on these
buttons but there's something else going
on here as well I can't spot it the text
color yeah
so I just set for example blue and the
text turn white because that's it would
be hard to read the black text on a blue
background so that seems some like some
kind of Voodoo but we'll have a look at
it the latter function just like the
derived function it takes an input color
but this is a bit more complicated what
it will do is you can you can supply it
with any number of colors to choose from
so in this case I have yellow pink and
green which are all nice colors but
maybe not go so well together but in
this case the function has three colors
to choose from and based on the in based
on the brightness of the input color it
will pick one of the three I've
specified so if the brightness of the
input color is in the first third from
zero to 100% it will pick the first
color and the second third it will be
pink and the third the final third will
be green and you can also specify
different percentages for these input
colors so I could say that I just want
yellow for the first 10% for example and
then and so on and so on so this looks
horrible but it but it
it's sort of a vicious visualization of
how the function works and I had to
think about it for a while when I first
sort of tried to figure out how it
worked but it's very clever when you do
when we want to do things like they said
you want to pick a color based on
another color that's I mean it's it's
brilliant and this is this is why
different JavaFX components can change
certain colors based on other colors
that you have set so we have been
talking about picking colors and using
the different color of functions in Java
FX to change color of components but
also using variants of colors or picking
other colors based on once your users
are setting or that you are setting
yourself so we have a lot of interesting
features to play with here and I think
it's great fun you can do really cool
things quite easily with CSS and a bit
of Java effects magic so moving on move
away so I'm gonna talk to you about
contrast and contrast is concept that we
use to make one or more specific UI
elements
stand out from the rest and we have
three different ways of doing that the
first one is color by changing the color
of a component it will stand out and it
will grab the user attention we can just
change its size of an element with the
same effect or we can change the
alignment and it's kind of the same but
it's different ways of doing it so
starting out with the color I have four
buttons and I've set the rightmost
button to the default one and Java
effects will highlight that with a blue
color since it's the default and
starting up this example when the user
sees it their focus will immediately go
to the blue button
the user will probably not even read the
text on the three of the buttons if it
says okay the user will just press okay
so that's how we draw focus to a
specific component and then its size
one thing that bothers me if is the Java
one logo it's a bit too big so it would
steal the focus from the ok button but I
can just remedied it remedied that by
changing changing the size of the button
so I use the blue the blue default
button and making it a bit better a bit
bigger to grab the focus from the user
so there is another thing that's
bothering me I have seven labels and
seven text field I'm supposed to to look
at at the same time but 7 of them is a
bit too much for me so i when i read the
first name i have no idea what's going
on it at bottom with IQ stuff and the
opposite when I would read IQ I have
forgotten first name that's bad
nevermind
so it's a bit too much but by using
alignment I can fix this so I haven't
really added anything except for two
headers one contact details and one bear
consumption and that will make my brain
realize that there are two sections and
I have used alignment to make them stand
out just a little bit so I've moved the
bear consumption and the contact details
just you know a few pixels to the left
to make it easier for the brain to pick
it out and I have added two lines I
don't know if you can see it and I've
added just a little bit of space between
the zip code and the bear consumption to
make it even easier to realize what's
going on
so use alignment to make something stand
out it's it's extremely powerful and
going back to the JavaFX seam builder
they have used all three kinds of
contrasts the first one and this is the
obvious one is the working area it's
blue there's no way you can miss it and
it will tell the user that this is the
main area this is where you're supposed
to work and the the gray areas to the
left and the right that's secondary
don't you don't have to care about that
look at the blue and then they've
highlighted the work I'm doing you know
the work of currently doing so if I will
just leave the computer grab a beer and
go back and look at the screen again
the highlight will tell me that this is
where I'm working it's it's extremely
basic but it's also very very powerful
and they've used color to make some
labels that are not so important
blending to the background so the top
row top right bottom left text wants to
give the user attention and they've they
have the library and the hierarchy text
and it's just a little bit bigger
it's probably just bold font but it
sends a signal to the use of that this
is two different things and then you use
the alignment to show the user the
hierarchy of what they're working with
it's extremely powerful okay all right
moving on moving on um so far we've been
talking about things that are quite
important no matter what style you want
to use in your application you can use
color and so on even in in a very very
flat style user interface now we're
going to talk about light and shadows
and that's not really something that you
use that much in a flat UIs but you can
at least use shadows
and to sort of highlight different parts
of of the user interface and so on
so light and shadows in the user
interface can be used to add an illusion
of depth to an application and depth is
useful for helping the user to sort of
perceive the user interface they're
looking at it helps guide the eye and
it's a very good way of indicating the
state of a button for example or
indicating that something can be clicked
or grabbed or something like that and
it's a very nice way of highlighting
hierarchies in a user interface so the
sort of light and shadows I'm talking
about is of course just a trick with
colors here we have a very simple gray
rounded rectangle and by just adding a
gradient to it it immediately it
immediately looks like it's standing out
from the background and we sort of want
to click it it looks very clickable and
by adding a simple drop shadow we have
sort of completed the illusion here it
looks like something that's really
standing out from the background and
this might not work in a flat UI but if
you want to go with a bit more
traditional one or whatever you want to
call it I think this is a very effective
way of showing that this is something
that you can use this is not just a
decoration a very important thing here
is of course to keep the direction of
the so-called light very consistent so
that the gradient and the shadow sort of
follows the same line otherwise it will
completely wrong and these days almost
always you almost all you ice uses light
that comes directly from top back in the
Windows 95 days that I used to come from
the top left but we have moved on from
that so what we do here I mean just
setting a gradient background on
something it's very very easy in this
case is a rectangle so we're using the
fill color but any color in JavaFX can
be set to a gradient using CSS and it's
it's a linear gradient in this case I
just specified to
which means it will go from the top to
the bottom I don't have to specify that
it it's gonna start at the top and then
the rest is just different colors that
is going to go through creating the
gradient and you can add as many colors
as you want and you can add different
percentages to them to have a more
interesting gradient it doesn't have to
be linear linearly this distributed
throughout the component and there are
different functions you can use here as
well and you can specify certain points
a start and end point you can specify
different behaviors to what to do when
when you reach the end point and so on
so it's quite advanced at just creating
a simple gradient it's very very easy
adding a drop shadow is a bit more
complicated a drop shadow is an effect
in Java effects and you can add effects
to your nodes in three different ways
using Java code programmatically and F
XML file it's very easy and I like it
because you keep sort of the layout code
separated from the logic or you can use
it do it using CSS of course in this
case there are a couple of limitations
if you want to use CSS there are only
two styles or two effects you can set
using CSS that's the drop shadow and in
your shadow and you can only set one of
them at a time on a single node when
using CSS so if you want multiple
effects on the same node you have to use
Java code or at fix them out or if you
want to use any of the other effects in
in in Java effects except in your shadow
and drop shadow so let's have a look at
a simple drop shadow here I have a white
text with a drop shadow and there are a
number of parameters here that are not
that self-explanatory in CSS so I'll
just walk you through them through them
really quick the first one is the blur
type there are different blur types in
Java effects that creates slightly
different results and they also take
slightly different amounts of time to
compute so I think the three passbooks
is the one that looks best but I think
it's the slowest
so it depends on what you're trying to
do hmm I think that's a quick one I
think but I'm not sure but it's there
you also have a color of the shadow of
course you have a radius which is the
size of the shadow there's something
called spread that we'll talk a bit
about a bit about in a minute
and then just an offset X&amp;amp;Y so in this
case I have an offset only on the y-axis
because I want my life to come straight
from the top
but this spread I have two different
extra examples here the first one has
spread zero the middle one has point
five and the right one has one and
that's sort of the scale of the spread
and so what you do really is you give
less space for the gradient part of the
shadow see if you use point five as you
spread half of the space of the shadow
will be filled by the shadow color so if
you use if you look at the right example
for example all of this space of the
shadow is filled by the shadow color so
you can play with this point five
usually looks okay so you can play with
it but it's it's not really something
that you care about and you can create
very different cool effects using drop
shadow the first node here has no shadow
at all the second one has a very light
drop shadow the third one it's a bit
hard to see but it actually has a tiny
tiny drop shadow that's white and that
makes it instead of making it look like
it's hovering above the background it
almost looks like it's Singh sank into
the background and we can complete that
with an inner shadow to make it look
really cut out from the background which
I think it's yeah it's a really cool
effect I don't know what what you should
what you could actually use it for but
it looks really cool
so by combining different effects in
Java effects you can create very
interesting results and each of the
different effects are really kind of
easy to understand so I like that
combining different things to create
cool cool things right
so adding animations to your Java
effects application it might be a good
idea and I'm gonna show you two ways of
when it's a good idea to add animations
and the first one is to reduce cognitive
load or as we like to say thank less so
I'm gonna add an animation I want Adam
add an animation to an application where
I change a big big area of the working
space so if we look at this same builder
again on the right side we have three
paints properties layout and code I want
to click on the on the code tab there's
a big toolbox coming out being shown and
without an animation it would just pop
up and I would have to spend a lot of
CPU to figure out what happened so take
a look at this animation it's really
quick but it tells the use of what is
happening so it fills out fills in the
blanks so you don't have to think but
what happened because you can just see
it and most tools work this way the
other option we have the time that you
want to use an animation is to catch
user attention so going back to our Java
on registration form we we have the okay
button and when the user clicks the okay
button we validate the fields and we
want to go give feedback to the user and
in case they've
the first name or their symptom from
Paris we want to want the user to see
the error now the problem is that the
user is focused on OK button they click
the ok button and we want them to see
what's happening and that's when my
animation is is as handy it's a very
quick one now the thing is that the user
the human eye is extremely good at
catching details that are not in focus
it's all about survival in the in the
good old days like billions of years ago
but it's the same thing today so we have
focused on the ok button but we'll see
the red triangle coming up instantly and
using animations in Java FX's is really
simple we just create this fade fade
transition and we set the duration to
250 milliseconds and we specify that no
2 operator
it's the warning icon and then we set
the phone value
it's the pasady to 0 and we set the to
value to 1 I will just start it it's
super simple and there's fade transition
you have translate and your scale
transitions so you can do just about
anything there is one thing that you
should but there is one thing that would
like to say to you that is this is like
really important
don't overdo it okay yeah so don't
overdo it
animations should be settled should just
be there you don't want to catch the use
of tension by blowing up everything make
it small make sure all right if you
during your development figure that you
want to collect user input or visualize
something in a way that's not available
in Java effects which is becoming less
and less likely before because there are
more and more components being added to
JavaFX everyday almost it's not like
back in the swing days where we had a
button in the text field and that was it
so basically in Java effects you can
create pretty much anything you want if
you can think of it you can probably
create it in Java effects we started
looking into this and realized whoa this
custom component thing is really hard
that's very complex subject and I don't
know if you know Garrett down here or if
you follow him on Twitter he has had
about 250 sessions during this java one
about custom components so we won't go
into the details too much but you should
follow him on twitter and at least it's
gonna make you feel a bit bad about
yourself because you're not really doing
anything and he's doing things all the
time so it's very depressing but luckily
he has agreed to do a three-hour Q&amp;amp;A
after this session
and I heard there will be there will be
beer right that's correct yeah there
will be beer yeah so you should catch
him on the way out he's the one with the
red hair mmm so it's easy to see but
custom components are amazing you can
create really beautiful things I'm using
the different animations and transitions
and so on enjoy effects combined with
effects and things like that you can
make things that just look great
moving from something very concrete to
something a bit more fluffy and but
maybe even more important is attention
to detail we've told you many different
things here like many different tips and
tricks and so on but always pay
attention to detail when you use them or
even if you don't care about anything of
this just pay attention attention to
detail when you create your user
interfaces because people will see if a
line is a pixel of for color isn't
really right and it can make even the
most polished UI look really cheap so
give it an extra look ask a friend if
you don't really have the eye for it
but try to make things look as perfect
as possible
even if it's just a couple of labels
okay so going from something very fluffy
to something bit more concrete so steel
that's the only way to do it
no just kidding apparently stealing is a
federal crime so don't steal what we
mean is getting inspired by other people
look at our solo follow him on Twitter
read magazines you know follow blogs and
there's a bunch of free resources that
are really good that you should take a
look at so kind of steel we'll get it
inspired right to finish things off we
just thought we would show you a quick
example of what's working or improving a
UI using these routes could look like so
we have a very simple login window here
it looks okay maybe at first glance but
there are a number of problems with its
of course first the title isn't really
centered or aligned to anything we have
alignment problem problems with the
password fields and the buttons at the
bottom won't read aligned to anything
the headlines or the labels and the text
fields aren't really grouped together as
you you don't really know where they
belong and so on so we'd start from this
and see what we can do to make it look
just a little bit better
we'll start by moving the text fields
around so you can see we just group
things together a bit more so that the
user name label and the user name text
field are grouped together and we also
align the fields underneath each other
to make everything look a bit more
polished and the next thing we want to
do is sort of as you can see the entire
bunch of components in the center isn't
really aligned within the windows we
want to move it a bit and we also have
to think a bit about these buttons at
the bottoms at the bottom we have the
login button which is an important one
then we have the about button and a lot
of developers really like the about
button and they want it to be big and
sort of everybody should click the about
button and see that code by pie seeker
and graphics by persica and music by
passuk and so on and users don't really
care about that so we can probably get
rid of the above button and also the
Help button it's good that it's there
but we don't want it to do as a sort of
a primary button to go to so what we
want to do is this we have the login
button as you pointed out there's a bit
of an issue here it should be the
default button of course so that we
highlight it even more we have changed
the Help button to a link so it's still
there but it doesn't take as much as
much attention and we have lined up
everything so it looks tidy
and then we just add some CSS like that
and it's a bit washed out on the
projector but it looks a lot more
professional and I think I would
definitely prefer using the right one to
the left one and it's not really that
hard all it takes is a bit of patience
and really taking the job get what
you're working with so the conclusion
here is that if you have a presentation
with ten design rules people don't
really notice that you just had nine
rules right sure or did you okay that
was the plan
great yeah you win no but as somebody
suggested the ten through this used the
other nine routes just leave it yeah
okay no but I think what we talked about
in the beginning space and layout and
attention to detail are the two most
important things and we're happy to take
your questions we have giveaways we okay
I have a ticket for the appreciation and
oh yeah that's we apparently have a
ticket to the appreciation event as a
giveaway that's not really worth
anything right now but sure we can sign
it for you yes
yeah um yeah sure and the question is we
didn't mention anything about how the AI
flows across the page or sort of there's
a very traditional model that the AI
scans a page from left to right and so
on and that's been pretty much debunked
it doesn't really work that way people
look at the most highlighted thing and
click on it that's basically how it
works but sure we could have mentioned
more about that it's more interesting in
webpages I think and web design where
you have a bit more content but yeah
it's important to think about definitely
any more questions do you want to take
it alright thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
