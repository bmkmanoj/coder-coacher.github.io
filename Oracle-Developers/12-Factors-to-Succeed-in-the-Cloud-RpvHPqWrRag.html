everyone take a seat and and enjoy your
stay so my name is Rafael benítez I
work for Red Hat for more than seven
years I started in Brazil as a
consultant then I moved to a software
engineer role and now I'm based here in
u.s. acting as a director of developer
experience essentially I'm a Java
developer okay this is my firm ation
it's my background it's what I've
learned it's my main language since 2002
it probably and given that the Bob's
factors are so important for developers
now nowadays I'm also involved a lot
with containers and everything related
to divorce factors like like automation
automation with tools I can't roll chest
and purpose okay but essentially
containers and Java development is my
background skill by the way everyone
here is a developer we having any
project managers DBAs operations cool
welcome something that I like to suggest
to everyone for everyone in the
development process not all developers
it should join a developers program
Red Hat has its own developers program
which is developers at Red Hat calm and
Oracle has its own developers program as
well which they address is developer
oracle.com talking about the developers
program of Red Hat there you can find
valuable resource for developers you can
find free access to products you can
find free ebooks webinars blog posts and
things related that will help that
develop the development process in
general ok that's why I like to invite
everyone here to to join the developed
program
but let me tell you a story that
happened to me when I was in Brazil
which was more than two years ago one
day I was walking there in the zoo with
my niece she's like at that time she was
like four years old four years old and
she she was she was and she's still
crazy about heroes she likes about
everything related to DC and Marvel and
superpower superheroes and she was
walking with me and my brother in the
zoo she looked at the animals I looked
over to one to another and come to me
and asked I realized that every animal
has a superpower I realized that the
snakes have their poison the bird can
fly
the Lions have its darest strong so I'm
starting to wonder what is the human or
what are the human superpowers and when
she did that question to me I started to
think and wonder the same what I what I
would say to her what would be best
answer to that small child of four years
old and the best thing that came in my
mind at that time was about thinking and
if we think okay with it we think
thinking has taken us to places that we
never imagined before we never could
never imagine that the moment that we
are leaving actually nowadays ten years
ago or maybe 20 years ago with the
internet and computers and mobile device
and total access to Internet and
connected devices and well well that's
that's one thing thinking has make us
problem solvers that's a point okay
there is a dog until we decide to become
programmers
was that we identify a problem that when
we have that feeling and touch to find a
solution we try to analyze the cause and
effect about this solution and about the
the problem itself to finally identify
the proper solution for the fur for that
problem and once that we find one
solution however whatever it is we start
to have a kind of continuous improvement
of that solution which is what I like to
call as a feedback loop and it's
important to mention the are the
importance of feedback loop in our life
for example when we are learning how to
walk
we depend up the feedback of the gravity
to know if we are walking the right way
when we are learning how to speak when
we're at when we are a child
we depend of the feedback of our parents
to know if you are doing the right
pronunciation which we are doing the the
right grammar okay so feedback loop is
very important so once that we have what
we think that's the best solution for a
problem what do you think that we should
do with that solution you haven't
guessed because my suggestion my
suggestion is that you should share the
solution because when you share you will
have more people joining this feedback
loop you will have defeat there for
other people there were other people
that might face it the same problem and
that's what happened with Yoko Yoko is a
cloud company and they have customers
with this they with different problems
but they all have the same root for
those problems and they find the best
solution for death for those problems
and they decided to collect those those
those feedbacks create a portfolio of
solution
and release that as a manifesto as a
methodology that's called the 12 factor
app and what we will do today together
is a journey through each one of these
12 factors and learn how we can develop
better cloud native applications no
matter what language we decide to use
but all of them share the same principle
of an avoid and mitigate problems in
when you are developing applications for
the cloud this manifesto is released in
this website called 12 factor dotnet you
can find it here and basically each one
of the 12 factors has a title and a
small description of it you can open and
see a picture and a detailed explanation
of what is this factor but we will
explain each one of these factors today
you don't need to memorize you just need
to understand why that factor is so
important what problems they solve and
why you should consider this when you
are developing an application so the
first one is called code base right it
seems a little bit tricky when you read
one code base track correct in revision
control many deploys but what does it
mean well it means first that you should
use a version control but you should you
need to use the version control on the
right in the right way and what's the
right way to use a version control
essentially is when you have one
application
that you store that in a in a certain a
version control and that same
application will be deployed in
different environments you deploy that
in a development area then you deploy
that nice staging area to finally reach
the production and let's be honest no
matter if you have the latest and
coolest technology running on your
laptop if your source code is not the
in reproduction it doesn't have any
value to the customer it doesn't have
any value to the company our objective
as developers as people who work in the
software industry is to place that thing
that we produce in the production so
customers and in the company can benefit
from that but what you should not do
well I've seen some companies that they
once you have a setter they they want to
evolve faster this the software and they
store things that are supposed to be
deployed in the development stage in a
repository and something that should be
more stable that we will receive just
bug fixes security fixes from the QA or
from the production it's stored in
another repository that's wrong you
should avoid that please use the same
repository and you can't control that
using branches tags and things to
control and merge the code later okay
because otherwise you'll have a problem
when you decide to merge your code okay
what you should not also do is for
example have the big Whipple story
called the repository that ruled they're
not all you should avoid that okay some
people like to store the application
ABCD and Docs and everything in one same
repo that's a that can cause a lot of
problems you can you can start to mix a
story of a software development with
that off with any story about another
software development you can have
problems when you decide to release a
version you say my version the version
of this application is under they the
tag whatever and in that tag you can
find different things documentation and
and let's be honest also documentation
evolves in a different step than your
product sometimes
your product Israel is on the release
1.0 and you have aerators and bug fixes
in the documentation and the
documentation walks in a different step
than your code so as I told you we will
do a journey together and deploy a 12
hectare application so let me show you
here I have an application stored in
github it's using this URL that I can I
will just copy and clone it locally so
let me do a git clone and I have
everything inside my repo and inside my
repo locally ok so let's move on to the
next factor the next factor called
dependencies explicitly declare you
delete dependency but what does it mean
well it means that you should never
please never store dependencies inside
your repo inside your ripple story I've
seen people for example who are
developer here and is an is a Java
developer and what other language do you
develop then it does net developer here
no js' okay I've seen people that commit
dependencies on the source on the on the
source source control they commit jar
files and usually they change the name
so they they will make it easy to refer
that dependency they what used to be
like Apache Commons 3.2.1 they just
change that to Apache Commons and that's
hard to manage so you should always use
a package management tool every modern
language has a
package dependence management's who for
example nodejs has any p.m. may Java has
maven Ruby have jams and in this case
since we are working with java
application we are using maven in all
dependencies here is stored inside my
XML file right you can see my source
code there is no binary file sort of
course there are some binary file that
you can sort like image but please don't
store dependencies now what we will do
to continue this journey of twelve
factors will take a detour to the factor
five and then we will return to the tech
tree and for later because that makes
more sense to explain those factors the
fifth factor says that you should build
release the title is viewed release and
run and said that you should strictly
separate build and run stages but what
does it mean in team for the purpose of
an application why you should split
those things in different steps well
because they are different things the
first thing is build your application
what we will build suppose that you are
working with a java application you will
use a continuous integration tool that
will collect the the source code from
the repository and then release a jar
file if you are using a you burger or a
war file if you are producing a web
application because you like to avoid it
works on my machine how many times you
have seen people okay I will do a
release today and they go to the console
don't do a maven package and crop that
in a USB Drive or place the henna in a
storage and says it's on that is it's on
that folder just cop to the production
you should have all avoid that as much
as possible so
of course I'm talking here about
different stages but they can do be
performed in us in a single shot by
continuous integration and continuous
delivery - so for example imagine
Jenkins with a with a pipeline plug in
each one of these steps will be a
different stage of the pipeline okay so
so let's pretend that I'm jenkees and
now I will produce my software I just
check it out and I will build my code
okay you can see here that I'm producing
I'm using maven it uses the dependence
that I have previously downloaded and I
have now my uber jar file here okay now
the next step the next step is to
release the software and how how and
what we will release the idea here is
I'll talk a lot about containers as I
told you in the beginning the idea here
is to release a container image because
with a container image I can create
different several instance of containers
based on the same image and I'm not only
releasing a war file or a dress or a jar
file I'm releasing a full container with
with a Linux kernel with file system
with binaries with the help libraries
environment variables volumes everything
that I need to run this application will
be inside the container
why containers again because it makes
easy for to do these deployments
everything is there and we need to
update from version 1 to the version 2
is easy also and if something goes wrong
it's easy to do the row back by the way
who is using docker here have a heavy
about docker containers have you heard
about
openshift and cuban et's with the
orchestration tool so I have here in
Oracle cloud let me get the public IP I
have open shift with the open source
project running and on Oracle cloud what
I will do now is release the software
you can can see that it will upload the
resources to OpenShift and start to view
the image
whoever use docker before with it know
that it needs some add some instructions
in a docker file you can see the docker
file here the docker file is really
simple it will add my fetcher
inside the container in this path and
trigger the queuing of Java so when I
dual release I'm doing a release of an
image inside OpenShift
something that's important to mention is
that every release has your unique ID
and containers is good for that because
if you take a look here on the inside
OpenShift we can see that the image has
your church of six 256 code which can be
used as a really tidy even if you are
using the same tag latest if you do any
change the schedule 56 will be order and
that means that the total different
deployment okay but the application is
not running yet so let's now run our
application
when I asked openshift to run my
application YouTube get the image and
create a container with that image and
also create a route our route to access
this application so let me get it here
yeah my application is running okay I
have here the Declaration image - a
factor my a12 factor the ports that are
exposed I have one container running and
my application is running what you see
here is just simple it's a hello world
it gets whatever I use it here I can say
hello Oracle and it will reply hello
Oracle from the name of the holes using
the version 1.0 that's that's simple now
let's see the other factors let's return
to the factor number 3 the sector number
3 called config asks you to store the
configuration in the environment usually
you can think that environment variables
but the idea here is that everything
that needs to check that for that's
supposed to change the behavior of your
application should be stored externally
to the application if you want to
connect the database you if you need to
retake if your application because you
changed the user name and the password
of your application you are doing it
wrong you can you need to store that in
environment variables in a configuration
file externally you store that in the
environment not inside your application
so that's the idea here if you are if
you need to paint for any reason repair
your application you are doing it wrong
so let's change the behavior of this
application by simply change adding an
environment variable and you can see
that I will not do a new release the
behavior of my application
we'll change so what I did here is
introduced a new environment variable
because I asked to introduce a new
environment variable a new deployment
happened we can click here and see on
the environment that I place a new
environment variable called greeting it
says hi and the name my configuration
has changed so let's refresh our
application okay it changed my
application without any need to
repackage my application remember I did
I just build once I just released own
okay pretty neat right so what about
backing services back in service means
that every resource that you want to
attach that you want to use externally
for your application should be used as
attachable resources not only resources
to store things or to store data but
also suppose that you want to consume
something suppose that you want to
consume twitter's you can just treat
that as a taxable resource but they to
be clear in this example imagine for
example that you have a database my
sequel running on premise running inside
your company and for any reason your
company decide that the best strategy is
to move that database to a cloud
database to run my sequel inside Oracle
cloud so if your application doesn't
treat that with like a tangible resource
if it should too couple too tight it
will be hard to you will probably need
to to change or repackage your
application so you need to think how
treat the these resources as a pet will
be sore
so there and the idea here is it's just
like that if you have something a volume
and you decide to change from my storage
to a tray storage in the cloud you
should be able to perform that and the
way that I will choose that I chose to
demo that is deploy a my sequel database
right my application is here and this is
the sector number for and I will release
a database as a backing service I will
just attach and how that work to for the
application to know where they might
where my sequel is installed well of
course it plays a new configuration
remember about the factor number three
so inside my new deployment you can see
that's performing a rolling deployment
and by the way rolling deployment is
where and when it starts a new version
or our or another container with the
configurations that you need and once
it's running it shut down the previous
one
as it happened now and you can see here
inside this container that in my
environment variable now I have the
definition of the holes the password and
the username so I can come here when I
try to access my application it will
give me an error because the database is
empty so you populate the DB sorry
and remember I mean securing locally and
it's communicating with Oracle cloud so
the database is populated now I have
read she and I was able to attach a
database to my application I did that
after my release okay so let's continue
what about the sector number six six
called processes what does it mean it
means that everything should be
stateless see think about rest it's
usually easy to think about rest when
you are producer a kind of of stateless
rest api because suppose that you are if
you if you want to do a deployment like
three pm in on a friday and you have
several people using your application
you can and you realize that you cannot
do that because you have stayed inside
your application that's why it's a bad
practice you see it together with other
factors that you should be able to
replace your container easily by another
any moment that you want and to be able
to do that is only when you have
stateless api but what about the data
the data will be on the backing on the
back image service that we produced on
the number four right even the HP
session you should think in a way to
store in a banking service something
that allows you to replace your
front-end without losing any to the
possession the idea here is to be easy
to change your one version of the
application to an order every invocation
that you do would have a different
behavior based on the version that will
deployed okay so in this case here it's
easy to demo because it's just a reson
point that returns hello it doesn't have
anything
eight but let's go back to the port
binding part by and says that you should
export service via port binding but what
does it mean in please think for a
moment about java application servers
usually they run on the port 8080 but
you want to expose that to the world on
the port 80 right you should have a way
in containers allows you to do that to
do a mapping between the external port
and the port inside the container think
for example that you the guys here on
the operations I know that you are
working in the operations and you
decided to run three instance of my
sequel on the same server because you
don't have more servers available and to
be able to run three instances they have
to run in different ports so you cannot
rely that your database for example is
always running on the port 3 306 it can
run on the port 3 306 but internally
because my sequel runs by the full the
hole in the port 3 306 but for any
reason you decided to explode that and
on the port 5000 and again how your
application knows that's running on the
port 5000 again you can use the
configuration and inform that you use an
environment variable or configuration
files to say ok my database is running
on the port port 5000 let's see that
happening here inside openshift
if we take a look on my sequel it says
here that I have a mapping services my
sequel yeah I have a mapping between the
port 3 306 to the port 3 306 inside the
container but let's change that
I've introduced a new port that map's
the port 5000 to 3 306 I can even go
here and edge it my definition which is
a yellow file and remove the port 3 3 or
fix and inside my container you will see
that now I have a new information new
configuration map into that port but
which is what's most more most important
is that my application is to behaving
the same and that's the idea your
application should adapt no matter what
change did the operation people decide
to do on the environment if they decide
to change the port that's fine if they
decide to change the hostname that's
fine that's perfect fine your
application should adapt once more just
remember I did not release a new
application until now I just released it
once but let's continue
what about concurrency it says that you
should scale out via the process model I
like to say that this is the best
advocate for micro service because
suppose that you have increased on the
say in the sales on the sales you should
be able just rescale this sales service
you don't need to scale the finance
service or the data warehouse a service
just because you increase the volume of
of your sales so you should be able to
scale up and out your services and
containers are perfect for that because
you have one image and you can just ask
for any container management tool like
I'm using here open ship please scale
that to treat replicas 100 replicas
how many how many replicas I need so let
me demo that you can see here that I
have just one
replicas running okay and what I will do
now is scale that to three instance and
once more look here I have two uses but
as long as they are becoming available
they start to be placed under the same
route and start to receive the request
so I have now three replicas replying on
the same end point so as you can see
containers helps a lot of course I can
do that using the management console I
can click here and you can see that I am
new pod a new container will be placed
once it becomes available yes because
what I have here inside each one of
these containers let me open a container
here for you
I just reduce to treat each one of them
let's open let me open a terminal have a
java application running it has JVM
but if let me do it if X a X you so you
can see here the process with the PID
number one the process number one is
Java dot you are a my because I'm using
a you burger here and my application
okay just because it's based on the same
image I can create multiple copies of
the same image and create a many
instances yeah one thing that's that
worth to mention is that I'm running
here everything it will with just a
single instance and in Oracle cloud with
for Oracle CPUs and
gigs of RAM but I should be able and
that's the idea of scaling out the
process I should be be able to use up
and shift and create for example ten
nodes and when I asked to run these
replicas OpenShift will automatically
get one of these nodes and run the
container there so it for example I have
the company the node ABC and D I decide
to run ten containers
it will run two containers in on the
node a two containers on the node B four
containers on the node C based on the
availab available ax t of the server
okay so that's how you can create a
cluster of containers so from the from
from the management uy from the
management perspective you don't see any
difference but in the background any
orchestration container extraction tool
will do that for you which will spray
the containers among your cluster okay
okay inside these openshift instance it
has a h a proxy that received a request
and send that to internal load balance
that has it's a single IP for the
collector you can see it here the closer
iTIP
so anything that comes in this URL goes
to that IP and that IP based on this
selector with more internal to cuba
native it will find every container that
has these these labels F equals my
vector app deployment config so it knows
that everything that has this label is
placed here so then that's why you
map the route to the service to the
containers that's why you see them being
them aggregated okay yes that's the idea
for example you I will talk later about
the dev to prod parity they should be as
much closer as possible so we can run
the same this the same culture for our
production and for our staging for
example both of them in the same closer
you can of course reserve some nodes for
the staging and some nodes for the
production but essentially it's the same
environment it's the same closer okay so
to go deeper in this subject about
containers and orchestration I strongly
suggest you to visit the website
OpenShift org there you can find the
open-source container application
platform that allows you to run
containers or run and manage containers
docker containers in general in this
case in this case this application is a
vertex you choose this application here
it's a used to build reactive system for
the JVM so it doesn't really use an
application server but I could use the
it will not change the result of the
other behavior but the idea here is just
show that I can run java application or
in fact any java application focusing on
these principles on this methodology
independent of the language or the
technology
I really don't know because I've never
used Oracle container service so I don't
know how to answer that okay
and sure sure okay any yes because it
runs containers everything that you
place inside containers if you run if
you decide you to place a PHP
application inside the container it will
run if you decide to run a web logic
application it will run if you decide to
run will be application in this just
place that inside the container it will
run because it runs containers it does
not run Java or PHP whatever it runs
containers okay
so let's continue to this sector number
nine that says about disposability well
one way that I like to explain that I
like just explain about spoof ability is
about the theory about pets and Carols
have you heard about that
right let me four who have never heard
let me explain how the theory works was
that a question okay the idea is that we
we used to treat our servers like tests
for many years we give them names if
they were sick we took them to the vet
and seriously one once
I saw I see that me crying because the
server died so yeah so we treat servers
like that and the idea is that we should
treat them as cattle if they die just
replace the karo
1 2 3 by X Y Z that's easy they should
you should not be emotionally at
due to the server and that's the idea
you should be able to start or stop at
any moment without any notice you should
be able to start with the minimal
startup time if you decide to shut down
your application should be able to to
handle and gracefully handle the site
term and you also should be on a reboost
against sudden death
so let's demo that by killing some
process here okay we all know that I
have three replicas running and I will
kill some process so I destroyed two
process here and you can see that map
location as you run because I have one
replica running and that's another
feature of open shoot it detected that I
asked to have three instance I killed it
I killed two and but suppose that it was
a crash something that happened it was a
lot of memory for any reason the
container died OpenShift will detect
that is that I don't have more tree
instance running and if you run the
three instance for you so let's play it
again because I really like to kill
containers look here it detect and it
will fail again to me okay and as soon
as it became available I start to
receive requests on those so here you
can see a little bit of possibility you
can see a little bit about I forgotten
the name of the other factor but never
mind so let's move forward about the
number 10 they have to prosperity
keep your development stage in
production seem as similar as possible
of course we all know that and here I
like to say that
- advocate for to use CI CD pipeline
because that's the idea
the developer will place their code
inside of source code repository a
source code management then at CI CD
pipeline will get the source code from
the ripple stories not from the the
guide machine we beaut release the
package deploy that run the test and
deploy that in the production by the way
let me tell you another story
I worked in a company like 20 years ago
now yeah I don't look that old but yes
I'm I'm that old
where every time that the phone rang we
started to count how many minutes it
would take for the for the developer say
but it's working in my machine and hung
up the phone so yeah we should have the
development and production as close as
possible and with containers is easy to
do that because I have worked on until
now in my development area right you can
see that that my prod my project is
called 12 factors - dev and that I have
an image with the sha-256 C 1 a B 1 B
and what I will do is release that in a
staging area in the same cluster so I'm
not only have as much as similar as
possible but I'm running on the same
cluster so let's do it
what I will do now is send my image to
another namespace
but look they hold the closer is still
the same and I have here the same
sha-256 C 181 B and my application now
is running in the station area with
another total
your friend URL so my URL now is called
twelve hectare at them
- staging base it on the same image
again I didn't release the software
again twice never Marge I just did that
on detector number five and I was able
to place the my application with the
same behavior and production in the
station in that case okay now we are
about to talk about logs which is easy
it means that we should treat our laws
as event strings and containers are read
do that everything inside a container is
already ice cream we don't our
application should not worry about I
will store that in what volume I will
store that in a file that I will rotate
every five mags no because if it's a
stream I can use different tools to
collect those strings if those walls are
important like for example I can if I
decide to to store I can have a size car
container that will collect that blog
and store that that log if I want to
analyze that log I we have tools like
for example logs - with logs that you
can collect parts and transform logs so
for example I have now here are 3
replicas of my of my application running
I need to aggregate all of them so it's
only possible if I run I every log as a
stream of data and any application that
needs to collect that data will collect
and do what is needed with that log and
finally with our left factor of our
journey is admin process it means that
you should run admin the management task
is as a one-off process we all know I've
showed you that containers usually run
one process is the PID number one
if you do need to do any management
process you will create another process
like I created here at terminal that's
the PID number 30 that will avoid to
have any for example suppose that you
want to perform any task that will
consume a lot of CPU and memory that can
affect the CPU usage for that process so
if you are doing that externally of your
main process you are good to go it's a
little bit tricky to to demo that and
the best way that I found to explain is
just creating a new new process like the
batch process in this container okay so
that idea everything in the 12 factor
app is not attached to any technology
it's not attached to Java to php.net
but it can best satisfied by containers
where every we've seen until now I've
used you just containers it's very it's
very satisfied satisfied by micro
service and also using CCI CD pipelines
very Fox and that in the vast practice
because well it's try to help developers
and also people from the operations to
have a nice weekend at their home
instead of deploying application at 4
a.m. on the Saturday on a Saturday night
if you want to know more about this
website or app that URL is here also if
you want to play with this application
the the demo app link is also played
here and we are open to questions don't
be shy
okay good good question because I like
to say that the big mantra of containers
is containers are ephemeral you should
not store anything inside the containers
even because of the disposability you
should be able to replace it easily so
you should store outside containers in a
volume and in this case often shift has
plug-ins for different storage
mechanisms you can store that in NFS
volumes you can store that in the cloud
you can store that locally so you have
different plugins and and once that
you've found founded it will mount as a
volume of your container and the
continue your container will see in text
that NFS volume for example I suppose
that we don't have more time I like to
thank you so much for your presence here
if you have further questions please
feel free to ask by Twitter it's easy to
find and find me in twitter my twitter
handle it's at the raffle any thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
