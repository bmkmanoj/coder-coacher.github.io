It's time for another 2 Minute Tech Tip!
This 2 Minute Tech Tip was recorded in the Developer Lounge
at JavaOne and Oracle OpenWorld 2017.
And the clock starts now!
I'm here at OpenWorld, where I'm delivering a session about
why SOA is still alive, and it's more alive than ever!
I  say that because we are living in an era of many innovations and digital transformation.
People and organizations are looking for
new projects,
for example chatbots, microservices, IoT, and so on.
I've been hearing about why SOA or a service bus isn't good enough now,
and why it is a bad idea to use it.
People are actually trying to pit microservices against SOA.
In my opinion that's wrong.
Because if you did a good SOA implementation,
if you are already engaged with a SOA initiative,
and you did it in the proper way,
then you are more than ready to go with those innovative projects.
For example, if you did it as SOA, and you based your services on design patterns,
and you are fulfilling the goals of SOA,
for example, intrinsic interoperability, vendor diversification, and federation,
then you are more than ready to go with a microservices architecture.
So my point is, if you really did a good SOA design,
if you really design services, then whatever you are looking to create or
innovate,
you are ready to go.
SOA may be an old term that we've been talking about for almost 20 years.
But in 2017 it's more valid and more alive than ever.
Don't throw away those elements.
Don't throw away that knowledge.
Don't throw away your architecture.
Because it is good !
Just keep doing that and you will be ready to go with any innovation project.
OK. Thank you.
Was that a good tip?
