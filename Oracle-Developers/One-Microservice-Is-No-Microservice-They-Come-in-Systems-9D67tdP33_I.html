thanks for joining me today this is
actually one of the least favorite spots
in the day to give a session because
you're all very satisfied no longer
hungry tired so this is like the
toughest job at present I could wish for
don't be afraid to ask questions I'm I'm
pretty flexible whenever something comes
up just like jump up move your body and
raise your hands make sure I'll see it
one microservice is no microservers they
come in systems and the good question is
why is this guy actually able to talk
about micro services and systems and
yeah I'm a developer advocate working
for and being paid by like bent but
that's not been my whole life obviously
like just being a developer advocate
flying around nice idea of that kind of
job I actually earned my money for a
solid double-digit number of years as an
enterprise architect for a German
independent consultant and I spent my
time building really really large
systems for automotive OEMs so bad news
you missed my fun talk the one yesterday
wasn't recorded and I could like bitch
around about all kinds of customers and
talk a little bit more about like war
stories this is definitely going to be a
little bit more low-key but just imagine
that Germany is one of the greatest car
manufacturers ever and I've had them all
seriously not only driving just building
their backends so and in my spare time I
actually run my own conference it's
called Java land which is pretty cool so
whenever you have like fun and want to
visit a great theme park in Germany it's
actually happening in a theme park so
not no kidding so roller coaster
sessions a lot of fun best food you ever
could imagine don't even think of
comparing that to anything else did I
miss them it's not I thank you Oracle
did I miss something I had a pleasure to
speak on many many conferences in many
many places my favorite place to speak
actually is my living room on the V Jack
so whenever you guys feel like
entertaining yourself a little bit or
learning something while you're at home
sitting there the V jack is a great
place to be and they have a couple of
amazing speakers every month always and
they actually won a Dukes choice of what
yesterday so shoot out to to Simon whose
was actually running the show when I
hear a little bit more about me know
okay let's start with services I would
be able like my big role model Josh long
who is amazing as a speaker he once told
me the one thing a secret is you need to
talk about yourself like at least for 30
minutes to get rid of all the anxiety
and start over with your 20 slides in 10
minutes he's probably coding a lot more
let's look at code honestly this is
probably the most boring thing you've
ever seen it's a it could be a random
example out of a random application I've
been working on for so many years
obviously an ejb exposing some kind of
magic might be in rest endpoint what do
you think there's this like what what
would you call it has it a name haha
auto services we're getting there wakey
wakey busy dads and moms it is some some
people call that a micro service is that
a micro servers why not why it's just a
service it's a service and obviously
there are some dependencies injected
right so there are binary dependencies
microservices should like this is not an
introduction to microservices
unfortunately but you can keep feel free
to ask me like the one thing is they all
fully solely response
well for everything they do for the one
thing they do because they only care for
one thing including data and there
shouldn't be any binary dependencies in
the code to other services this is
obviously just taken out of a random
java ee application and it happens to
have just a restful endpoint so why are
we doing that I seriously I'm absolutely
a fan a big fan of Java EE I've been
writing so many years so many lines of
code great systems scale-out amazing
like I've seen weblogic clusters 500
nodes running on Windows NT and I'm
believable honestly it's more than 10
years back and they are no longer there
for reasons I might disclose later and
but why our business actually looking
into um deconstructing those beautiful
old cars I mean seriously millions of
dollars have been spent in legacy
running in the basement randomly
projects I personally let projects up to
200 team members we spent like 20
million dollars to build something that
has a reasonable business value and it's
been running successfully for more than
10 years by now why are we actually
looking into breaking this thing up and
how could that look like okay first how
and then why this is an example like
this is what everybody out there tells
you to do these days slice up your
monolithic applications build a bunch
full restful endpoints expose them and
yr them back together does that look
better than binary dependencies like it
depends yeah absolutely I love
architecture I'm a big fan of that
answer absolutely actually gave it today
myself so I'm guilty yeah do we really
want to do that like Jack's ass has
great client api we can totally use it
but doesn't look right does it I mean no
no kidding seriously that can't be the
answer what's totally crystal clear to
all of us is slicing up something or
starting greenfield with something is
easy as long as you only talk about one
service this is like the the typical
spring bootie example isn't it like this
look how easy it is G starting works
awesome but how many service actually do
does production-ready systems need to
have like microsomes while we're talking
what what do you expect a micro service
based architecture to have in terms of
number of services reasonable size erp
system any ideas dozens I'd say hundreds
absolutely I mean we need a user service
we need a lock-in servers we need a
amazing rate so that's going to be
tricky stepping back and forth a bit
this is our beloved java ee stack right
so let's assume that we're just slicing
our monolithic application exposing a
bunch of restful endpoints and trying to
be happy now we're starting to scale
that thing is deploying multiple wall
files into one application server enough
probably not so the binary dependency is
just down there and if the application
server goes down you're lucky to lose
only 20 services at once amazing and we
don't want to cluster that shitty thing
anyway do you I don't absolutely not and
there's a lot more around it like
enterprises have built a complete
ecosystem about that kind of monolithic
applications they are like let me let me
look here like 18 programmers on average
with big customers for business analysts
because somebody has to tell us what we
do right because we don't have a brain
of odds to project managers amazing this
is actually a real life example that's
why I'm reading it at six quality
assurance engineers one of my most
favorite the ones like
learning to complain about like
December 23rd when we're actually
putting it into production Christmas Eve
3d bas don't forget the dba's amazing
guys right so this whole thing is just
an echo system and again we're talking
about slicing up things that have been
there for many many years and have been
super expensive let's think that that
through a little bit how could that look
like if we scale something like this and
really slice it up like take the
individual app servers have more or less
independent services deploy them split
the team's up have a micro service team
that has like one quality engineer maybe
and maybe we can find a project manager
who's willing to actually manage more
than two services at once so the true
story is if you're breaking up your
monolithic applications you add
complexity in a reasonable amount and
that's something that also nobody tells
you because it's so easy right just
breaking up something like a chocolate
piece of chocolate okay what else do we
have I think that we need to talk about
the technology approach behind all of
that because it is reasonable to break
up monolithic applications how long does
it actually take to just let me sneak
here know how long does it actually take
to bring something into production of
that size like a monolithic application
who's actually using Java EE spring ok
what's the rest like play our cows Carla
you already said guys go how long does
it take to put your application into
production on average six months three
years one year awesome how often do you
deploy into production changes two weeks
that's pretty that's pretty advanced
seriously yeah so usually changes and
those systems are super complex so
they rarely had like any documentation
they started ten years ago the
architecture is mostly questionable
because it's grown architecture and and
I've been doing that myself right so we
kept fixing we kept adding stuff and we
ended up with something big that just
does its job right and putting in
changes also requires all the quality
testing cycles again very little was
automated back in the days and we're
getting better we learned our lessons
nobody is to blame for all of this but
as a matter of fact like deploying once
a quarter is something that is rat right
I mean seriously we've been happy to put
that thing up like every four times a
year and I have to admit that's just not
reasonable anymore for business business
today require productive systems that
actually do earn them money and that's
the funny part that I didn't realize as
a developer when is a software system
actually starting to earn you money or
bring you money as soon as it chips into
production because not on your developer
pc right so we need to get everything
that we have in business advantages or
changing requirements like legal
requirements I can tell you a thing or
two about the European Union amazing
thing you guys think you have United
States European Union is the best
central legislation put into the
individual countries to be put into
practice and loss and this whole thing
can take up to a year to actually go
down to all the countries but the time
frame to implement them starts exactly
the moment this law is put in place and
that's mostly like six days turnaround
for insurance stuff like that so we
can't just wait three weeks to get
something deployed we can't wait even
longer right so that's a big motivation
for business to actually start to speed
up the development cycles a lot and on
the other hand maybe we create new
business models today that just needs
constant adoption that need work on
existing data but have a ton of it uber
is one of my favorites because I've been
using it for quite a while we don't have
that in Germany
you're gifted great so uber in Germany
is a big big thing they're fighting the
cab companies and yeah different anyway
they started out with just a bunch of
cars drivers assigning people paying
money awesome and they develop new
business models on top while there were
they were in production and they
actually started to analyze existing
data how did they do that is that like a
batch job running over the weekend now
it's not right so the data has to be
processed in time in real time maybe at
least in close real time we're on the
JVM let's not forget that what else do
we have like my favorite example
frequent flyer miles Lufthansa so
whenever I take a flight and I'm like
touchdown on the tarmac I'm checking my
miles could have been like another
status update or whatever I have to wait
a couple of days because they are
processing it in the back end like
legacy relational database everything
needs to be processed that's not my my
experience my expectation as a customer
I as a customer I'm really getting
restless at a couple of companies
seriously online banking that's all you
can do I expected a lot more from you
and all those influences actually kind
of push us into the direction of micro
services because we can individually
update features without having to test
the whole thing again what how would do
we do that how that's the big question I
had actually put put a couple of
technologies on on the slide that has
the number of Internet connected users
and devices on it so when Java Eva's was
invented it was like 1997 maybe round
their spring came shortly after to make
it usable I get that what was trigger
running when they started has anybody
know that Ruby on Rails right so they
said it's probably not going to fly with
Java EE let's try something new
something more agile something that
works for us
database first database of Twitter my
secret they still have been in the
relational database world right they no
longer there anyway but what came after
that more connected users acha was
invented as a distributed system
approach high loads one of my favorite
examples is probably papal at that point
because it's a reference we can talk
about I'd love to talk about others I
can't thanks recording how many VMS run
papal dual-core how many you've read
that right did you not it's serious
aight aight dual-core machines run papal
anarcho not a 500 notes weblogic cluster
that's that's kind of thing right that's
amazing and it's responsive it works
never failed me funny is that actually
the term microservices popped out popped
out a couple of years ago already like
2000 what is it like 13 earlier even so
it's not brand-new it's just that the
needs pushed way forward on that and
that's the reason why we all have to
have to learn and educate ourselves
about microservices yeah thinking about
data and the amount of data that needs
to be processed one of my favorite
examples is actually a german insurance
they are very conservative and we have a
lot of data protection law so everything
they do is looks kind of totally famous
and bleeding edge probably not for the
states but one insurance teamed up with
a car manufacturer and they started to
offer your personal car insurance
depending on your driving behavior so
the more speeding tickets you get i mean
they have maps they know how fast you
actually allowed to drive in the various
areas and they can detect you or your
driving behavior basically any of you a
good boy you actually get a very little
off the insurance if you're a bad guy
then you end up paying
bucks more that's pretty funny I
couldn't even imagine how to do that
with Java EE at that point I mean we
have a constant flow of all kinds of
data coming in on all ends from devices
and we all have like what fitness bands
and and iPhones the sheer amount of data
that needs to be processed and the
chance is behind that to actually use
that to answer new questions that you
never thought about while designing your
applications that's the big chance that
businesses are looking for to implement
with those micro service-based
architectures and everything needs to
coast less than it did yesterday for
sure so a double core VMs is a pretty
pretty great thing if you can kick out
weblogic server for that that's probably
the reason why and Thomas did the famous
statement I'm I'm a fan of gardner right
like we all are right absolutely but
this pretty much nails it I can think
about a way to make java ee work in a
micro service world there are some nice
approaches honestly um references to
wildfly swarm and everything they do
that's pretty amazing but it's still
built on a blocking stack so flowing
data in between those modules is
definitely going to be a challenge not
saying it's not possible to be a little
bit of a synchronous and have a micro
service feel to it but that's pretty
much it I think we used the the right
tools I love Java I love maven i love my
eid e i love everything that we have and
i really want to keep that I don't want
to switch to Ruby on Rails I don't want
to switch to something else right so we
really want to stick with Java but we
built the wrong things at least for
today's requirements and believe it or
not thinking the whole microservice
story through a little bit more you end
up coming up with problems you've seen
the the client API calls jax-rs right
but what we really need is a lot more
starting with like developer experience
you all have seen like Josh long opening
20 million windows starting services and
just being amazing as a presenter do I
want to do that as a developer like on
my project that needs to finish at some
point I don't want to like be the key
stroke hero I need like an integrated
working development environment if I
fire up 20 services because that's my
system I really want to want to have
them all up and running with one command
and not 20 terminal windows right
service look up in discovery how do we
do that there's a lot there's a lot
missing that's not even the distance
lands of a specification out there and
we're definitely not falling back to
Jane the I lookups are we nope we're not
so API management everybody is talking
about that if I have my endpoints and
they might be restful or not somebody
needs to like govern that 100 micro
services and versions we need something
distributed security amazing how do I
protect my individual services and don't
force users to actually relog on every
time and there's not a standard inside
if you know something let me know prove
me wrong it's definitely true so it's
still kind of an emerging architecture
approach that everybody is putting into
practice in a different way these days
and we all have to start like today we
can't wait for standards if we wait for
standards like as a nice quote from from
somebody talking about the JCP a couple
of days ago it's it's probably not
totally fair but i like it so the JCP is
the place where software goes to die so
when we have a standard and everybody's
using it it's no longer innovating and
this is exactly a problem with a micro
server space right now because so much
stuff is in motion and is moving right
now we need to develop new approaches
new ideas how do we start are we
disappointed now
who feels like I'm not going to
implement that ever none awesome who
can't wait to start a who head is
actually running a micro service based
system already one hand to hand three
four or five that's not a lot good news
is we don't have to start on Ground Zero
literally not because I always wanted to
see my name up on a slide with a quote i
just created one i need to keep you
awake don't I everything you learned
over the last couple of years and your
whole career about software development
and architecture the basic principles
are even more important today the more
your system actually falls apart into
individual little teensy bits and pieces
you're responsible to keep them together
as an architect everything that we
learned even from fancy like SOA oh
did I say shapes learn there are lessons
learned that we can definitely take with
us and we should keep them in mind there
are a couple of new things that you need
to look into design patterns just
emerging I'm not going to read that
slide for various reasons but I want to
give you a couple of examples one of my
favorite memory I have began back from
my old Java EE days is me printing out a
query which is super slow introduction
walking with a coffee into the office of
my dbas getting shouted at for like five
minutes about that crappy statement and
whoever wrote that and I said it was jpa
I'm sorry took another five minutes
before I actually took a look at it and
he said I can fix that I thinks I knew
that could have been quicker right so he
fixed it put it into production couple
of magic on the back end I was totally
satisfied for maybe 15 minutes after the
update went life
because ninety percent of the
application was slow basically so the
one tweak on the red side turned the
right side totally slow you can optimize
relational databases in many many ways
but you need to pick a line lane right
so you just can't have everything at
once and if you have micro services that
are read mostly and you have services
that are right mostly you are definitely
having a different set of requirements
you could run individual databases
underneath which is probably a challenge
just from an operational perspective you
could use different data stores like
JSON data stores Cassandra or whatever
you think of no sequel approaches or you
can actually use new architectural
patterns likessee QRS and actually
separate the reads from the rights and
this is something that nobody in Java EE
or monolithic land ever has heard of and
it's out there since many many years and
it's pretty usable the only thing is we
need to find a way to integrate that
it's not hibernate is not going to be
the answer at that point which is kind
of disturbing so we still have to learn
new things and it only makes sense if
we're designing our system around an
event sourcing approach and I know that
I'm actually throwing buzzwords at you
at that point so here's the backstory I
have two beautiful daughters that I'm
proud of one is eight and one is five so
one is about to go to school in Germany
and the other one is like in third grade
and they come the oldest one comes back
with homework we all hate homework but I
consider my slides your homework and
there'll be a resource collection at the
end and all the slides are up on the
Oracle website already you can dig
pretty much into all the buzz words so
don't be afraid just keep that in mind
as a good summary of stuff to look into
one favorite thing that I have kind of
under design patterns is the main driven
design
that's something that's also been out
there since many many years let me just
asked to verify who's doing
domain-driven design and their
applications right now well that's what
33 hands four hands five hands what why
aren't we all doing it it looks pretty
fancy like bounded context that's a
pretty pretty great fit for micro
services in general so it's super
complex right it's it's a different
approach you need to think a lot more
than we used to think because we know
Java EE we throw layers together we have
like rare vaguely business components
everybody was happy with that there are
a couple of other approaches but the
Mayan driven design actually is like the
one fit for microservices another good
thing to learn about so it's a good
mixture solid between what we already
know and a little bit of challenge going
forward learning new things there are
also a couple of things that you need to
take care for and why you actually need
to switch your thinking a little bit
Automation is the one key part to
success if you're not able to fully
totally test put into production do
everything you need to do with your
micro services you are going to fail
from the second on and another nice nice
thing is designing for failure learning
to design for failure we've been spoiled
as container driven developers for many
many years with our Java EE application
servers what happens when an ejb fails
it does roll back some somebody actually
does something for us right we don't
have to care for it it just magically
happens worst case we get an exception
okay I can handle exceptions that works
but how does that work in microservices
the Machine dies no dice oops did that
just happen wait that shouldn't have
happened seriously you need to need a
start embracing failure which is
something that we never did we took
things for granted we thought about
handling failures that's been pretty
much it that's not
going to work in Microsoft's based world
and there's a good Amazon example I
don't know if it's a real story but when
they started to introduce amazon prime
they had a payment failure the payment
service failure and they still want to
want it to be life sure they wanted to
make money what what happened while this
payment service was gone when you wanted
to buy a movie what was the result
amazon still gave you the movie and
didn't bill you because they wanted
their customers to be happy and
successful maybe it's not even a
technical decision at some point maybe
it's more like a new business approach
so there are all kinds of things how to
how to learn to design for failure data
separation obviously is one of my
favorites when you listen to talks about
slicing up your monolithic applications
did you realize they all end just the
little minute above the database that's
wrong so micro servers are solely
responsible including data and if you
have something existing you definitely
will have to break up your database
sorry to disappoint you there's no way
around them so the data design in
general looks different and that's not
going to change performance is one of my
favorites because I fights fought so
many performance wars in my life and
that's not going to end with micro
services especially not if you're still
a firm believer in jax-rs and points and
chaining them that's theoretically a
great thing but there are a lot of
things in between that can lead to
endless calls like just imagine that you
have ten Jack's air services chained
after one after another zinc ruinous
worst case ten seconds response time
what's the average acceptable response
time from an application sub-second
right so that's something that we all
have seen in many specification
documents ninety percent of all you eyes
and interfaces have to respond in 0.2
seconds
sure we make that happen amazing I can't
recall the times I've seen that so
really great so what we actually need to
do is a complete shift in thinking how
we build applications so far and what
we're going to do moving forward and I
think we we spend a lot of time
investing into efficiency and robustness
of our applications making sure
everything works perfectly fine and this
is exactly not what we're going to do
moving forward we need to embrace all
those failures we need to be super
flexible we need to update components as
soon as we get a new requirement and a
new idea a new question to answer and we
need to learn to build resilient systems
we've seen that before or at least the
buzzwords right so that's the main
points of the reactive manifesto it's
it's a pretty pretty great fit the
reactive manifesto itself helps a lot
building a common language to talk to
each other it's it's not it's not a
framework it's nothing you actually can
use to implement things but I have a fix
for you there's something out there
since a couple of months and they just
released version 1.1 and it's called
log-on-log um is a micro service API
framework let yeah let's let's call it a
framework it's open source give it a
shot a couple of resources at the end to
get you started fully integrated
development environment as you would
expect it and we need feedback the
project is eagerly waiting for community
to jump on there and just provide as
much feedback as they can get it is
basically developer productivity layer
on top of existing technologies like our
kind play so whoever tried acha a couple
of still using it ? okay so many people
say it's too complicated you can do too
many things sames true for play wii
do have Java API of guys doesn't have to
be all Scala right so give it a shot if
you liked it but I totally respect if
you if you're on the I don't want to
learn something new side logon is
actually fixing that to a certain extent
because it is super highly opinionated
all we offer are basically two api's
doesn't sound bad right so it's too it's
not 20 it's not 7,000 pages of
specification so that's why we call it
highly opinionated and there's the story
behind the name actually that is a
Swedish word a Swedish saying almost it
describes the right size just the right
amount of something and this might also
be a better fit than the word
microservices so we like to call them
logon services there's no right size for
service is there so I've been asking
that question since a couple of years
already so what's the optimal size for
micro service what the right size fair
anybody whatever at whatever you say it
is twenty kilobytes that's what I always
answer must be twenty kilobytes right no
single responsible principle right so it
really needs to do the one thing and
there is no sighs there is no
measurement no nothing that's why i like
the word log on so much development
environment which is pretty pretty
amazing started out to be just SBT and i
fought hard as a developer advocate
internally to give all of us the
blessings of maven so now we can
actually use maven with that which is
good the persistence api is built for
micro services which means it makes
stuff like secure as approachable for
you and implementable so you don't have
to go out there and just figure a random
secure as Java framework just use log on
it all works via eventsource Delta's so
instead of storing updating deleting our
stuff in a relational database we're
only sending around
you change events and those change
events actually get replayed and build
up your system state did I mention that
you have to switch your thinking a
little bit for microservices this is
what's going to happen and this actually
doesn't matter if you're using log amor
if you're looking into vertex so there's
a lot of systems that follow those
reactive design principles that will
definitely lead into that direction
logon is just trying to help you at that
point this is what it basically looks
like so event sourcing in the middle log
on persistence as your interface towards
API is and approachability developer
convenience if you like to call it and
all of this gives you see QRS and yes I
totally acknowledged that seek urs is
not a good fit for all kinds of
applications you still will have a super
simple use case that just requires crud
nothing else and this will happen in
micro services because what we really
want to do is use the right tool for the
right job I think that's another good
pitch for microservices it doesn't all
have to be log on it doesn't all have to
be vertex or Java EE we can actually
start mixing technologies because we
might be more efficient or more more
easier to implement something with at
least the selected set of technologies
instead of just being fixed to Java e5
because our license is just not expiring
right and depending on the complexity of
the domain model you're working with you
can actually wave that's the first one
for me you could actually decide which
way to go and log on this is going to
open the persistence API a little bit
more and give you direct access to a
JDBC driven databases which is not
something that we like and you should do
that carefully because jdbc is
definitely synchronous and blocking as
an API and that might be something that
gets you really into trouble in micro
services
I want to see how we get started little
hago just a couple of more slides or can
actually nobody's asking questions
anybody want to challenge me you already
film believers I highly appreciate you
all of you that's an archetype out there
just get it started simple as that copy
and paste should work you actually get
to microservices why why isn't that like
a simple hello world project exactly
because to our system as a minimum
somebody is giving you an example
project which has one service not the
right way to go down there so you have
two services basically a hello world
service that is sending a ping stream
and the other one is just printing that
out that's pretty much all it takes
super easy and we do a lot more for you
we actually start those services for you
locally in one JVM so you don't have to
go through all kinds of hassle to deploy
that somewhere in the KU Bernie T's
docker cloud oh that was Oracle
anyway it's all running in one JVM it's
lightning fast it's local and it's still
individual services that we wire
together on the back end we provide a
little teensie service locator you also
have a local service gateway like all
your infrastructure that you need to
test and develop and be super efficient
locally is already there just start them
yeah and that works is that all we need
like migrating legacy what about all
those as400 host systems in the basement
how do we connect to them do I get like
an IBM Jax is connector soonish probably
not so here's the good news logon is as
I SAT a nice abstraction layer plus a
little bit magic on top of existing
technologies and the mad
happens underneath in the ARCA parts
acha cluster and namely ARCA streams
Anika streams actually is a great thing
the team around acha just launched a new
initiative called add pakka so Apache
camel done right meaning non-blocking
and you can literally access all kinds
of external resources by just
implementing a sink in the source and
accessing it through log on so it's all
their kind of integrated but hidden for
the beginning experience but it's still
available and you can use it I'm not
saying it's all there yet and it still
states camel here but this is exactly
what alpaca fits in and that's a nice
thing to have so if you have like a
fancy host system somewhere that you
need to connect to this is definitely
the way to go forward at the moment la
gum is based on Cassandra a couple of
more persistent options persistence
options are coming up and as I said it's
open source so if you're missing
something file some issues on the github
issue tracker that's pretty amazing so
having ideas or even contributions
heavily welcome is that enough probably
not right so the simple example doesn't
show you a lot except the little ping
between the services and especially it's
not really diving into the sea QRS and
persistent parts like read side right
side so I decided to do something
totally weird actually I took took an
existing example that kind of started in
one of our developer offsides with a
team and made it a somewhat bigger
example so cargo trekker is something
that all of you know already it's it's
the most famous example from all the ddd
books and even an ex oracle evangelist
use that to put that into java ee mode
which is kind of nice and I thought it's
time to do it right so here's it build
on logon still based on the one dot 0
branch so I'm accepting pull requests
whoever wants to update that
it's two services and a front end which
I like because I'm a UI guy I'm I
totally love you eyes beautifully made
you eyes and somebody has to present you
something it can't be all interfaces
right so this example actually shows you
how to how to work with WebSockets
update events and all that kind of
things also you get a jock size and
point to list all the cargo things
there's not a lot of business features
in here but it shows you a lot more what
a lot of them can do and how you should
use it what do we do now I mean laga min
1 JVM locally sounds great for
developers but how we do actually put
that in production good question right
life and asked to put it on the Oracle
cloud for example I've failed for
various reasons that I'm not going to
comment on but yeah we have a product
called conductor that comes with the
reactive platform from light band
there's built-in support available but
from the logon perspective there's
nothing that ties us to that particular
way of deploying and putting it into
production so log them doesn't know
anything about conductor actually is
it's an it's a service locator that is
the biggest problem here and there are
two different proof of concepts
available Jonas poner obviously had a
boring weekend and implemented the
zookeeper based version and the console
based version and that might be a good
hint how to how to actually use that we
do have a community pull request for
Cooper neeti support so ever wants to
look into that I'm can't wait to help
that might be another great way to
actually deploy and distribute alarm in
production the service bundles
themselves are comparable easy to
generate you see the magic three letters
like SBT don't worry we also have the
maven support here it's just not a one
liner because maven always has like that
kind of pump files right and I decided
to just outline the steps here and
there's another very extensive
documentation
you need bundle file may even assembly
plug-in itself is like any way it works
so give it a try a couple of resources I
just want to briefly walk you through
next steps downloading playing around
with it giving feedback la gum is on
Twitter that's basically me so you can
also just give me a beer and talk to me
that would be my preferred way and if
you want to learn more about the
reactive principles behind log on and
why we decided to build this thing as a
framework and make it available publicly
then you definitely need to read Jonas
bonus book which is a wit it's free just
register give us your email address will
send you a copy of those and a washing
machine so that's easy and because I I'm
a super super bad loser I just can't
it's it's amazing i said Jonas don't get
me wrong but I need to write another one
you were talking about architecture I'm
talking about implementation and this
book actually walks you through the
cargo truck I example line by line if
you need a little bit more hand-holding
you don't have to call me every time
this book should definitely help you out
what else is there to say we could see
each other again in a couple of weeks at
the reactive summit in Austin so if you
have nothing better to do just buy a
ticket plane hotel come over meet me and
all the reactive pioneers so we have
people from redhead vertex there's a
couple of more technologies that you
could definitely learn a lot about it's
not only about lagemann thanks for your
time I'd be happy to take a couple of
more questions or drink beers with all
of you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
