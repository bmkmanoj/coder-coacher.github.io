one-man-show started with Java 90-95
since 1997 I'm freelancer really
freelance I never worked for a larger
company or smaller company so actually
never worked really just free Partizan
heck I would say before I forget if you
ask me a question which is somehow
related to Java or Java fix or at least
Java II you get a t-shirt and please ask
many questions because the t-shirts are
heavy and take lots of space in my back
and this is the only talk I have today
so uh lots of questions where I was on
glad is Java Vic's talk is so well
attended the next time I would do
something like Java fix on micro
services with with html5 then it will be
full but right now it's almost full is
also okay thank you for coming some
references have write a blog Twitter
account and he exists the workshop
Munich Airport okay
this is the logo and then who attended
the talk last year probably something
similar I probably was the title
enterprise Java fix Olajuwon someone
attended yesterday last year
okay I got really good class evaluations
but I was absolutely not satisfied with
my performance and and why not I and the
last year I explained
model-view-presenter and passive view
and whatever and then actually during
the flight back I thought who actually
cares about all the patterns right I
mean usually in the practice you just
pick one and go with it so what I will
try to fix it this time so I just have
two slides with the basic idea and then
implement from scratch a Java fix
application in my way and this is MVP
application and explain you why is why
why is proactive or wise what after will
hopefully see but why it works this way
this is actually the idea for today hope
is okay and please ask me questions so
on and what I will start with yeah the
t-shirt look like this this and and and
now a Java related
this is a t-shirt related but the back
is you can compile the back at this Java
code but you can get over it so um so
what I would also use in my presentation
just warning a small framework is not
even framework there are two classes and
you can build it by yourself or not
actually it was tuned hours out of three
but you could put it in one class but I
was called separation of contents so a
better and it really doesn't matter look
at the source code is nothing so you
could build by yourself so and I
actually don't care whether you use the
framework or not as apache license but
it's surprisingly successful someone
uses already probably who is this
afterburner no one because at Jammu one
I got already to new project who are
using summer robots at the university is
something really interesting and I was
surprised and so many people are using
this so um it was actually just a true
of Constable now is some at least a
small field trainer quad github to use
it you only have to have one single
dependency and I think these about the
dependency I don't know forty K or
something so no external dependencies
nothing and or use maven archetype which
are we use in in few seconds and this is
the last slide so what will happen what
I will do today is our I will use the
scene builder because it has to be
faster symbol de is the tool which is
meant to create you ice quickly and and
and productively there's a problem
always was I don't know whether you
remember Matisse from NetBeans or from
from eclipse was even more interesting
right what happened and per IntelliJ
form builder what all the tools did they
generated lots of code and you got the
hooks or protected regions and you can
fill out your code in the blanks there
the problem was you were dependent on
the code and what we did in the past was
swingers where we let the generated code
inherit or implement an interface and
our controller was just depending on the
interface so we could easily regenerate
the code because Matisse
was not perfect from time to time
became inconsistent and we had to redraw
the UI again or jazz rolled back in
separations what we did right
so what is the difference in Java VIX
the difference is inversion of control
so the sim builder right now generates
code but you don't see it and a symbol
that calls your code not like your code
is depending on symbol de symbol less
depending on your code and this changes
everything that's the first idea from
today talk why the first time in the age
of Java visual editing tools could
actually work and if they don't you can
still partially write your own code
earhooks
and this is what really works well work
well in my projects lots of projects and
I always use a symbol then actually my
open-source project like light fish are
even road was symbols afterwards because
I was able to delete lots of code and
was easier to maintain for me questions
of are in ration of control as always
solution to all your problems right so
you got the idea and how it works well
is since there's an ethics ml Laura
added loads an XML file which is
generated by scene builder and the
return value is a parent which is very
similar to J panel and swink and you
just plug the the DES parent to your to
your knot frame to your stage and you're
basically set this is the D and the next
question is ok but if I a button or text
field how to how to bind the listeners
to my action lessness
and this happens with dependency
injection provided by a fix ml order so
there are annotations you will see it in
source code a fix ml padam no ethics ml
but they didn't I think they don't even
know that there's a dependency injection
because on one talk I mentioned there's
actually great idea this a truly
dependency injection this XML is the
annotation afterburner is able to do at
inject as well a different story but
ethics ml comes with Java fix so and the
next heck is the last take Wow
afterburner works is behind the scenes
the ethics ml order now it gets made a
little bit
loads of XML files in this XML file you
can specify the controller this is your
class no requirement except default
constructor and if you have a public
method this public method can be used as
action
snuff button or whatever and in this
present you can inject you know you I
feel to whatever generated or not you
are not required to inject this stuff
but you can you got so far
so and now how afterburner implements
the dependency injection and now there
is one really nice thing in in the XML
order you can register I think is called
controller Factory and if you're just
set the controller factory fix ml will
ask you to create your classes and then
you can you can introduce Google juice
spring or whatever and because I don't
like any other dependencies I created my
very small it's like three hundred lines
of code dependency injector which which
which just supports at inject nothing
else and this is just efficient but this
is the actual hack there's actually
great extension hook from Java fix
itself
you can register your own controller
factory and whatever is created by the
XML runtime every time a runtime will
ask you can you give me the class and
now you have the interaction everything
crystal clear you don't have to know
this if you implement Java fix UI and
it's just interesting if you would
something would something would like to
have a spring integration whatever or or
or or use afterburner wondering how it
actually is working so no magic there
everything crystal clear should I repeat
something no ok oh this might as well
last slide so this will ethics ml and
the basic idea is what I will show you
many conventions so as I saw ethics ml I
asked the question how big is actually
the fix ml should I draw the whole
application with it a part of that what
is the relation between the ethics ml
file and the application itself is it a
view a tab or what is it and for me it
was all always suspicious and that there
is just one to one relation between
control and a fix ml and I actually
filed the back at Oracle in the JIRA and
it said there should be multiple
controllers per a fix ml because
otherwise to become huge you just
imagine one class was five thousand
public method is not maintainable an
Oracle set is intentional convention of
a configuration one to one say okay if
it is intentional
we need another convention and
and my convention was there is one tab
or view or something which is drawn by
adeno UI designer whatever and there is
exactly one package preview and the
package is always the same contents this
is the only idea of afterburner actually
and the contents are on the slide so
first there is one class one file with
the name of the package hello so I am
assuming here there is one one view with
the name hello okay hello fix mmm so
there is some hello view if you write
the hell of view in inherit from ethics
ml view what happens behind the scenes
it knows there has to be a flower file
with the name hello it fix a man and
loads it for you so there is nothing to
load is encapsulated was very simple
trick and there is a hello presenter
this is just nice to have something like
this and the hello presenter is just
stock presenter in initialized by JavaFX
but because Java VIX asked me to create
the presenter I created my own hook and
I'm supporting in the presenter and
inject everywhere whatever is injected
to the presenter and represent a itself
and inject post construct and pre
destroy supported everywhere and
everything what whatever is injected is
singleton which always the case in swing
there are now scopes nothing that simple
justice okay this basically is yes
whatever you like this is a usual a tab
sub view something more complex usual
Java related so and if you do this you
get a simple application I will also
start with this but delete the sample
application because I wanted to show you
something from scratch okay so there's
the last slide thank you ignore it for a
second it should come in and one hour
but so and this is just examples what I
created for myself for my own the
archetype you can of course start from
NetBeans as well but it's the same as
what was is called ignitor it's a sample
application for java fix and how to call
it dukes
so
and now it could take a while because I
have to endure oh no it was fast because
I have actually internet connection with
a cable so I thought we I have to talk
for five minutes right now
so what happens if I start this it will
hopefully run this is always exciting
particularly in the talks so lunch and
create views and it created asynchronous
its 256 views each note is a XML
collapse loaded with presenter into all
the injections so this was me
performance and this sample application
just shows it is completely of
engineered so as whatever it's possible
in afterburner is within the
applications away too much for today
wise or complex many projects are using
afterburner I got many requests so
there's Fraunhofer Institute for for for
for power plans or whatever and it was
really surprised they have continuous
integration with thousands of controls
so I'm interesting stuff and they asked
me to implement some new features and it
was easy to do so implemented more
features but for my applications that I
need on that subset so what features you
can load configuration from property
files inject properties override
properties resistant properties and
whatever lots of properties and
configuration Enterprise projects love
properties I'm just curious why no one
asked about logging is also very very
popular and enterprise so this is what
every Enterprise project starts with
logging in configuration of course right
so questions so I would delete
everything because the deal was from
scratch and so what this actually is it
does way too much so what we actually
need is just this is standard Java
accessor properly no there should be a
main method and the main method invokes
lunch which interns involve invokes
start and why it's not compatible
because we need a view and I I submitted
an in the airplane I wrote an article
about this and then I got a better idea
how to structure the applications and
for instance what I usually did I
created a folder here with the who's the
root view so this is the the skeleton
you and I think it's even simpler if you
just put it in the in the root folder
like here so what I'm going to do create
exactly device I would start with a fix
ml and this is just XML file is empty of
XML and what was do was Duke's the
application is named Duke's this is
Duke's and finish no controller nothing
and you can see net miss tries to to
create the the F XML in source main
resources which is nice but I don't like
it
what what what is think better that CSS
and Dukes everything is encapsulated in
one package - who's the first change so
you and I actually stole the idea from
wicked I don't know there's a web
framework and I use it a lot and this
was the same and they really like it
because I don't like you know to hop
between source main Java and source made
resources so did it the same here why it
works because in the Maven poem i I have
to configure a little bit and say source
main java wrote also a fix ml and CSS
this is the tweak why it works so maven
packages everything I forgot to mention
its time on maven 3 build yeah questions
of are no questions so then I think yeah
this is this was the idea in the India
planes I think the first view the I'm
assuming we get more than one view so I
would like to create more than one view
for you and the main view you know what
starts the the skeleton frame or
whatever I put it actually here in the
in the root of the application and
usually the name would be call me a
heads or Dukes but I don't like to
rename it right now and this is where I
put it here when actually it would be
even better if the name would be AB here
so the one is strange actually and that
the first one but the other one gets
more reasonable so um Java class I
called it what was it at view and this
app view inherits from F XML view and
this basically is so if you instantiate
this it will know that it will have to
search for epics ml and loaded you are
set the most asked question is is this
class always empty and the answer is
sometimes you would like to extend the
parent view or perform some tweaks you
can do this but in all my project it was
empty but you could do something but it
surprisingly how well it works with
scene builder and one really surprised
you have no questions no criticism so
far so a nice audience or very good but
you don't get it next t-shirt just
joannec because I need something to load
right so then I will need a utility
class you know to call it or something
this is the only reason yeah
I tried what I think is a CSS empty CSS
what yes this CSS doesn't have to be
there but it is it will be taken and you
can style the OL application CSS but
this is true the afterburner
also is able to load CSS if it finds one
you can use CSS you don't have to yeah
you have CSS CSS CSS and the over CSS or
UBA you know whatever mine means to so
German word but you like it even a
company this name would never work in
Germany but here is a very popular right
OPA
okay so everyone
Ubbe CSS is loaded first and then it's
overridden so yeah how outwards yep
presenter is just a POJO if you would
like to use that is initialize Abul from
java java fix you can implement
initialize little and then you have to
implement an interface this method and
this method is invoked for
initialization it is actually nice for
debugging whether it actually works so
now we are almost set except what we
have to do is we have to go to the epics
ml here this is empty and I will have to
say I would like to have a controller
and the controller is come a hex follow
me Duke's were better follow me and AB
presenter and there's actually a
NetBeans back what I recognize it always
creates two F XML IDs I will have to
report this
so I don't know why it kept is just once
and now it will work so and this is this
XML is nice as you can see it is
actually configuration of a builder
effect or a factory is Apple absolutely
readable
and the best support for F XML editing
you get worth IntelliJ really so it is a
two-way editing support between IntelliJ
and the presenters net which is fine but
IntelliJ is better I have to say no
problem
so um safe and now I could do the
following like what I only have to do is
to say at view view equals new app view
and view get view
so what view does so the what what here
happens here is this epic semi loaded
and validated and view get view returns
the actual parent so initialize
everything and returns the parent
happens in the constructor and the
constructor is not there so it isn't the
super constructor and then here okay so
let's see whether it actually works
works if it works it works it is white
even for enterprise applications a
little bit too boring
right so on order to be iOS 10 or
something else is less than less than
this will be just widescreen so um so um
hopefully a double yes so now you only
have to add double click on a fix ml and
IntelliJ Eclipse and NetBeans they just
launched the same builder so and what I
would like to do is to create a partner
and what's important there is a code a
fix ID and this is really important so
if I call this okay now I can perform
injection so what it means I'm in the
presenter I can do the following button
what's important is the name ok
convention over configuration they they
have to match
Epic's a man named and this name have to
match and what IntelliJ does if they do
not match you get warning in the IDE who
in doom factoring and we standard symbol
they get the error in the sin builder if
they do not match so an order you need a
fix ml and now it's injected it can be
private but what I always do is all in
my most poor my project is always
package private because of testability
this is what I do in Java EE and this
also what I done in Java fix but you're
right it could be private
before I argue with architect I do
everything private so okay I don't know
said text initialized so just restart
this initialized works okay now safe is
public so we can go here and say button
on action safe it's recognized here
saving and here we can say okay what you
also would like to do is to have a text
field
text field and probably a label feel
free to ask questions I will just show
you the basics yeah afterburner is you
mean 3d injection this would be nice I
have to think of no I deem afterburner
dust is not aware of any widgets I would
say so it will work in 3d but I have no
particular support for 3d because it it
just don't don't care about the widgets
only think it does it interacts with the
F XML or D epics ml controller factory
uses my injector and this is the only
integration between both so you can use
for 3d as well 3d injection but 3d
injection is actually would be nice in
the 3ds three-dimensional space and I
have a question oh you get a t-shirt
right
this was a perfect valid question and
the other guy you get also t-shirts I
forgot yeah you have to pick it up later
yeah okay this is everything Java FX
native and what's afterburners is this
what you don't see
XML load load you will have to do to do
this code like this F XML overload and
you will have to pass you know the name
of the file and then find the file as
resource then you have to think about
the relation but what is actually
created so this is what afterburners off
so the afterburner is just the
convention and convenient loading of
everything yeah I have a multiple
screencasts this sample application and
Java doc is is not there because obvious
and but no one complained about the
ducks ducks and I'm really surprised
that how violet is used but I think the
screencast is sufficient so I created
multiple screen cuts if everything is
lacking I'm really faster with screen
screencast and dogs I just will record
in two minutes and and publish this is
much better than than writing wrong
documentation
everything and there's no private method
you can override over everything but
this is never never do this but you
could you could yeah you could make it
but more interesting this is loading for
instance from different rest locations
something this would be nice so you can
dynamically load views this would be
really exciting yeah
and know what I will do I will just
create the basics first so to show you
how it basically works and then make it
more complicated so I will try to
recreate the view in that way that we
get two partitions north and south or
create some split or accordion or
whatever and then we have the problem
now we have one view which two sub views
and how to deal with this and then you
will see what I meant by this controller
can be whenever you like
the watches but only important that the
view and if XML have to have to share
the same convention other otherwise it
won't get found the container is not at
the presenter can be somewhere else and
all the models and services can be
somewhere else
the view and if XML should be somewhere
in the same package in the same Java
package right now no it's perfect
they are ordered me to get reaches a
stream but you can also pass on input
stream in and you can load from whenever
I like yeah and what what the
afterburner does in the pom.xml what I
created is I think it's a configured
maven dependency plugin and what it does
all the all the dependencies from your
projects are pulled and one large jar
file is created what you can start with
Java - char so this is already done for
you I didn't even try this because boo
no dusters there is a boo no Burgas
there is a an Oracle evangelist and what
Bruno burg has created this is like a
web browser so it downloads the ethics
ml thrives from location then creates
everything on the fly so I know it works
and I could do this here but there was
never never requested but this would be
fun actually if it has such feature
requirement and can say I really need it
for my project I would implement happy
for you it is not boring
something you okay so um what I try to
explain last year is a model view
viewmodel is the name of microsoft
system pattern or presentation model is
the generic name and the Java class and
F XML are actually the view
now in the app view you can if you like
you could create your own components and
put the components afterwards here yes
the view is just creator the relation
between the view and presenter if you
have the view you can create the
presenter and or or use it for off the
creation of something very good very
good question you know Wow
yes
you know one complaint complaint about
this so I'm if you try to find an issue
I get lots of for instance many would
like to have scopes in CDI scopes and
always ask the question why and there is
no answer they just like it so but if
you have a reason for this right the
reason I will implement this because it
doesn't seems to be hard but right now
the idea of afterburners don't make me
think it's always the same whatever
package I open it's always the same
structure without any variations this
what I like in enterprise there should
be not it should be boring design over
and over again so there is no questions
yes but this is the ethics ml design
what I don't know there's actually
interesting idea whether I need it
because I could probably directly into
it but I think it's still needed because
it parses and then ask me but yeah
any other questions okay so um I would
call this in input this output and
saving is always dangerous in my case
the most my errors are I forgot to save
so text field input F XML and label
output
so now of course I can say output that
said text input good text or something
else input all this was input get text
so I started oh yeah
so I see it works so it's and of course
what we can do you can also say output
and this is actually the power of Java X
bind on our text property yes text
property bind to input text property and
forgot to start and now is angular talk
right is this first what happens an
angular session they show you this so
questions so far and this was playing
Java fix so um what I show you right now
is just Java fixes nothing to do anymore
with after burn off there's everything
is created there is no yes so actually
after burner so why the name after
burner because I created a a hex control
this was a attendee management for the
airport workshops and this was exactly
the case at JP object which was bound to
the UI to the table
and if you search for a hex control you
will find in github because they've done
would look at this and then my wife took
over and she said okay I don't like the
application I would use Excel and then I
use it now as an example so this is
probably something not right was the CSS
I assume you know so but and then I
extracted afterburner
after after the fact so afterburner and
airport so afterburners the perfect name
it was extracted after it was created so
um any other questions public method is
visible this is standard have nothing to
do with afterburner it just works always
a simpler very good if you were private
you will have to use at epic similar
annotation very good
any other questions no questions
then let's say this view is not
sufficient for your enterprise
application it needs to be a little bit
more complex right so um yeah then what
I would assume first I will delete this
this is always dangerous a little bit Oh
this was too much
that is okay I thought is a buck so what
usually you would do is either I think
the best one here is split pain I think
something like this and what was it this
one so I have a split pain and now I
have the problem if I start this there
is this empty and I have to ankle pain
ankle pain to something like Jeb handles
in swing and now where the afterburner
really shines because the first view is
empty and then I will create two
packages one package for this view and
the other one for the other with you so
I can have as many nested F XML files as
I like and this is why it scales and
this is why probably it is used so much
in larger projects you got the idea so
now I I go here and said this is ankle
pain and this I call north and this one
is south and now I can do the following
I can go to my present and say this was
nice but we don't need it anymore and we
have here uncle pain north which is
injected and on-call pain
south which is injected and now the
question is and now what right we have
to empty pains injected so and now I
will create two packages north and south
here create the two views fetch the
fetch the view and associate with the
ankle pain so the so you can you can
create whatever you like and switch it
really quickly and also interesting you
can create as many instances overview as
you like it is really important so if
you have table whatever you would like
to create as many rows as you like so
there were many requests to create just
one a singleton but this is wrong in my
eyes
yeah I could add this split plane split
pane absolutely
but because I'm lazy I just decided to
eject a subset of the split pane which
is a far more effective and even I just
forgot and don't even have to be an
ankle pain it could be the superclass
what I forgot
so the ankle pain is already too much
it's you know someone this is something
above the ankle pain which is sufficient
no parent this is too generic is okay
object it's perfect object works and
then reflection you've got a tissue for
this for the object okay you are several
object you have already aunty should
know oh sorry I'm out of shape there's a
programmer so um let's do it
new folder uh no folder let's say Java
class follow me
North the same story again North View
exactly extent XML view F XML view what
I thinking about is to create a simple
netbeans plugin which creates the two
files and actually it's conversation the
airplane so probably would be job for
you after the show because it said me in
one hour you can do this and because it
would say create new view and it will
create you know the folder the empty of
xml and two classes period this would be
really nice because I don't hate typing
and now I have to write so I'm then
present again North presenter I think
svenne is already starting with this
right new F XML
where was it empty F XML the two is of
course north and the only strange thing
is I always have to do this because
right now I cannot configure NetBeans
actually have to talk to unit
folks so yeah that was created and now I
can use it again you know to do
something else here let's say a tool bar
it's nice safe so I'm North North
presenter what I have to do is as well I
have to put the controller and this is a
little bit of redundant
this was the comment I think from the
comm an axe follow me
any other question so ask me the
questions if not I will just hack the
application so for you North us us
actually promised north
I fix them out still a fix ml so
NetBeans likes the idea of this this
does meta you can put the north's
presentable it can be here under the
north you can have any packages you like
there's actually in one of my project
called light fish I have like a monitor
widget and within the model money -
widget I have method monitor widgets and
this is a deeper hierarchy than this it
should be sufficient so what you can do
here in a presenter now we can say North
View now sorry North View view equals
new North View and then view get view
and now I can say this was north don't
get children I think edge and this is
manual but I think it cannot be so but
this is the connection between both
questions
I think it is too error-prone but listen
you can always do this you can always
input you can decide here now to have
multiple if examples good point what you
can have as many ethics MSU like here
with inclusion it will always work and
yeah add a question let's see was it
works actually doesn't oh this is my
standard
now it's saved hopefully works now so
you see a beautiful view so this is
about the partition and now I can it can
be as complicate this was this was the
basic idea of partition I would skip the
South you because it would be exactly
the same
yeah
and never happened to me because the
views are always small and I and I
really Hecht it together and what
sometimes happens that Deeley it is no
more able to lay out anymore so you have
to enclose on in in in in in a parent or
something but it was never inconsistent
so and and I never got such feedback
from the projects with includes if you
include us I don't know what's about the
instances right now I can decide how
many the upper views I have if you
include it you have one instance I think
of everything and now it is more
flexible and I think you're easier was
well you don't have to do to play with
the airfix ml but you can still use the
ethics ml you can say no I decide here
for this view I just use includes it
will always work you know this is this
is just add-on and because if you if I
create multiple instances of this you
know I can say North is also South right
okay this can be a little bit confusing
but um this is time-saver
who did not who did not attend the talk
would say he is crazy gnosis sows so and
now I have two instances of the same
view here and with included won't work
and now something what you also have
usually is communication with the back
end and this is usual pojo I call it
Duke service of course Duke service no
you micro service we don't have any
services anymore
so now you can claim you were also in
micro service talk so it's called
initialize and post construct and
destroy pre destroy and here a method
called hello and it just says hello and
this is in it and this would be destroy
so and now the added value is I could
say here the North preventer I can
inject the Duke micro service or short
DMS and here I have public void safe and
it will call DMS hello
so and of course I need another button
let's reduce this one button code action
safe
so it's saved let's try this you see in
it button hello it works so and you can
have as many injection points as you
like I can inject here another class and
there is no there is no distinction
between model and services but I
described several times this is either a
service or model the only differences
service talks to the backend and model
hold States state so you can inject the
same model to multi presenters multiple
views and access shared state and this
can be either a service or model but
from the ia textual point of view you
can have both right but there is no no
distinction between services and models
in After Burner everything is just pocha
which is injected two instances but one
is uh associated with this and the other
is not because I have two it's a fix ml
no now it's good now it's one if just
one this is one the one is just you have
two instances even of Northview which
one is actually south but and I have
proposed are associated with the with
the the same VMs but the other one the
presenter it should work in both yeah
this is exactly the same yeah but in it
was called only once because their
services yet as a yeah okay very good it
you will have to copy the airfix ml
right it's like what we did we won it's
not supported right now everything which
is ejected is a single T and if not just
grid who's new I thought about created I
could no implement own annotations but
this is a beginning of the end no
garbage collection and everything else
so if you if you need more complex stuff
hook you know spring or juice or weld
which is also used and but I I really
don't this is sufficient and I just
rivet my old swing project was the same
story you had represent unusual and sick
or something which belong to this is
present there was always the case and
usually you this is actually a really
bad example because you have two
instances of the same this was just to
show you that quickly usually you will
have you know this is north of you and
below a really south view which are
independent and if you like to share the
stuff it's on purpose
so you have one model somewhere else and
eject it twice so this is actually not a
real-world example but this is not in
the title just productive doesn't have
to belittle what so questions everyone
happy
view are not injectable you cannot
inject fuse the injection work starting
with the presenter and what's also
interesting sometimes you need T
reference to the presenter you can do
this by asking by asking the view for
the presenter so you can say here you
got get presenter and you have to cast
what you have to reference to the
presenter okay what's also supported
asynchronous loading of views too soon
the large project so it is supporting
with lambda so we can look what you
could also equally what I'll do is to
say let's make anything sounds sounds
view get view async and it expects a
consumer of parent an object which
consumes parents an object which
consumes parents this is actually vendor
a statement here it is not on purpose so
not ideal
I got some trouble so I think this is
the code what it actually means
it loads with own internal pool all
views asynchronously if it's done it
passes automatically now invokes the
method children add and it does right
with the ethics ml how it's called
worker or something like swing worker so
it happens in the UI dispatching thread
button
what would you say you have this there
is an yeah there is an action handler
change listener whatever but with with
simpler you usually don't need it
usually if you have working with tables
more complex stuff is just stand-up but
even is way better than swing and the
nice stuff is all the listeners in Java
fix are functional interfaces think
Sam's single single abstract methods I
think is thirty so you can use LOM
that's whatever everywhere this is used
also lambdas in After Burner inside
which is really really nice
so this is just a synchronous loading
what actually requested by a larger
project because they loaded a huge
amount of the dynamic views and they
wanted to do it i synchronously how I do
it not swing rather than there is a
executor cache thread pool and there is
some where you see this is the hook and
some where is it works platform run
later this was the method and I use
completely future from Java it and bite
them together but this is the entire
code of the fixable view
so all convention all the threatening is
two hundred lines of code and there is a
two hundred lines of code is the
injector
so this is really just two classes and
the third class was just introduced for
configuration loading with properties so
this is actually really really simple so
afterburner doesn't matter the purpose
of the talk is more to show you the
ideas what we can do and and this works
really well so I was really surprised I
don't never believe didn't know what you
see is what you get editors but this
works really well and what happens in
worst case inverse case you you make a
small proportion of your view
inconsistent and you can redraw this so
you can minimize the risk and in our
swing projects back then is something
grew up there was really investment of
multiple days right and then here is
there's no risk so in the worst case I
just I just overrides the gate view and
write everything by myself and what I
also like there's XML is somehow
readable so if you look at this it is
actually the same hierarchy which you
will write in code so you can convert
more or less directly this into Java
code if you like
I think we have 5-10 minutes of
something right so we like to see
something so what I could do is that for
instance if I put our file called
configurations or properties in folder I
could inject with IDI inject all the
content of the property file into
presenter for instance so this is
working but this is it would work but
you can also believe me so any I would
rather I would rather answer questions
if you have any
I don't think there's any limitation I
would say so really not because it's
just a convention if you don't like the
convention I would say then you don't
you shouldn't use it because but that
there is nothing behind I would argue
which has a little things with which
created this and before we stop I just
would like to open the Maven built
because there are two things which are
optional but creating I interpreted Java
fix package' what it does it outputs
executable file so I can go to command
line invoke Java manage char and it will
start everything the all dependencies
you declare here regardless which they
are are included in one single jar and
this is the maven dependency plugin and
this is the configuration that
everything is loadable from source main
java someone asked me could it be
somewhere else of course then you have
to change this here at the convention
then it is in another package okay sorry
someone asked questions yep
if it's a really large and you need a
plug-in concept you have to talk to spin
or someone sonar immerses our netbeans
RCP guru because in NetBeans you have
them plugin plugin concept and you could
mix and match plugins with java fix but
how to start who's the main view in tabs
or something so you need first an idea
but how how I would approach this
usually you get from a product managers
Queens or use cases whatever and I would
just take the name of the use case
create an package and start this is I
would always look for association
between a use case or our requirement
and my application and in the indicate
of afterburner is just a package it
always was so if I'm a concept I always
create a package there's my start and
then put classes if it turns out that
there is more complex than this I create
sub packages this was actually your
question and many sub packages you can
structure whatever like but let's say
three main tabs three base packages
within main types at our core do not
split pane so I'll get to sub-packages
this was the basic structure and this is
the real power of this I would say if
you never have tapped it happens
automatically I created it recently and
I think it's actually in my example it's
called predicator this is our the last
application which I created actually FME
for me and what it is but if I save it
opens another view what was this the
question opens or navigates so opens is
simple you just say a stage and open and
navigate you will you what you will need
as a reference to the presenter from the
main view and then you expose method
like left or right and invoke the method
this is the case where you might need to
reference to the presenter constructor
injection is is supported so what you
can do you can create a view and pass
something like a map but the great story
is it is Java 8 so you can pass a
function and function is it results key
to a value so you can create a fix ml
view pass a function and say take this
and this injected it is in the example
which comes with After Burner it comes
with this because each view is so that
the color changed from black to red this
was an injected parameter so it can pass
individual parameters to view to each
view instance ok yes
now usually and I mean I also at the
beginning I doing this for two years or
something but the the model is more
state of the application and there is no
state
I wouldn't put any state to presenter
right now so I would create an
additional class and call it whatever
from after a domain concept and this
hold the state so what this does it
evaluates in Aswan lambdas which I need
it for a great application so I hacked a
very simple application one hour with
Java fix and detritus so another example
Floyd its search for docker containers
for micro services scans the whole
network and this is the state which is
found is put to a model and this pink
you will find my github account so I can
look at this model with all the state
and there is a service which
communicates via rest to the external
services so um okay so yeah
yes what I didn't did right now because
I got so many questions I wanted to hack
a very simple restful web service from
the backend and and access this from the
service it would be easiest and then I
get JSON object and find whatever I like
so this would be probably a nice for you
to see that it works but wouldn't it
nothing to do with the concept but this
is actually what what happens all the
time
and we use either web sockets or jacks
or s-plane for checks web sockets unique
tyrus take T Y R Us is the reference
implementation of web sockets so the
server can push to all job of except
vacations and for a jax-rs
i just use the jersey reference
implementation but you can equally well
use rest easy or cxf or whatever what I
have also stickers not many stickers so
if you really actually have stickers
laptop stickers you get stickers for
free t-shirts you ask a question you are
the first one and the next one is how to
say so I want dishes look for you and
the others have to fight for it I would
say so any other questions if not please
the Eva the the session and write
whether it better than last year or not
so um is it better to code or to see the
slides this is the most interesting
question thank you and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
