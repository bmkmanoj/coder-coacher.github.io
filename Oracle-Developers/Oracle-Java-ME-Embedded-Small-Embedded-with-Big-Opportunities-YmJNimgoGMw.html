and wanted to present you some
intervention plan over here for our
presentation as well as for these things
we are doing we want to talk about our
releases that we have shipped for last
several years and i want to say the
basically the difference and want to
encourage you to try to use them the
eighth one will you probably heard we do
the alignment with a c8 on any side and
we want to encourage you to be brave
hearts and try our all accesses we just
shipped and we'll finish with the
conclusion next one so it's good to be a
first probably feels presenter at this
set this conference cause you'll
probably see a lot of similar slide and
will be bored by the end of this week
but anyway so this is the slide which
should show what is happening with the
with the electronics around us and as
you can see fifty years ago we had like
11 pitch one computer one one man frame
system which has been used by 10 15 20
people and at these days we do have a
different situation when we have one
person surrounded by the hundreds and
hundreds devices you probably can help
me and try to find out you know
electronics around you in your pockets
and on your you know your tables but all
of them do generate data which is
important for us and all of them do want
to talk to each other at the same
language and they want to talk to to the
to the people to the human beings as
well so so this number of devices and
this number of changes that are
happening to our life is electronics
coming
do generate a big demand to the software
which is running on these devices so the
software should be more than it should
be reliable it should be scalable the
software should be very secure it should
be easy to use to develop the software
and it should be easy to deploy the
software we think that Java in general
in Java ME in particular is a kind of
good fit for the embedded area and
that's what we want to say to today vis
these slides and with the features we
are implementing and development for you
guys so just zooming out I don't know it
probably not very good not very good
visible but let me note and talking
about internet of things in general the
scale of the devices the amount of them
there the differentiation in software
which runs all the device is just huge
and Oracle is basically in very good
position with the Internet of Things
runnin because Oracle has a lot of
subsystems and systems on the backend
and as well as middleware and a gateway
and if you look on the part flight from
me there are small small things where
Java me is basically targeting to ok so
on to the next slide we won't just zoom
in back and so this small think is still
small thing but we releasing this this
is really big it's all around you and
another big thing is that we put Java in
these small constraint devices and we
really think that this is big
in terms of size Jeremy runs out in
quite constraint devices you know
starting from kilobytes and up to couple
of megabytes in general our Java meet
small embedded is completely targeted
for the small devices it has a lot of
optimizations by why footprint and
performance it is sup its support it
supports a lot of on-demand features
like api's around connectivity
encryption location we are very flexible
and visibility to update in the field
over the air over the of the wire and of
course we do have best-in-class
development tool chain is NetBeans sdk
all integrated and all for free on this
slide you can probably find out some you
know course processors where we are
running and viola will give you some
more details on the next few slides and
as well as well as interesting stuff
you're presenting these new updates of
the release is about peripheral io or
javi called device I oh we do support
number of things like i2c spi gpio etc
in terms of footprint just want again to
emphasize that this most space where we
are running is basically a bit more than
hundred kilobytes of brahmand like up to
half of megabyte flash is that I just
want to switch the the micro bio without
architect for the Jeremy implementation
and he'll give you some more details
about the religious worship in
and we are really excited about thank
you question it's a pleasure for me to
present to present here and thank you
everybody for coming recently we've
released several versions of our
platform and one of them was 3 dot 3 and
3 dot 4 3 dot 4 words yet announced
yesterday it's all available to download
for free from Oracle website and it's
also available for partners and of
through OOTN Oracle technology Network
with these releases we support Windows
emulation runtime which allows you to
develop and debug your applications on
the on the host all these tools as
question mentioned tau available for
free and I will cover them a bit later
we have support for arm cortex m3 m4 and
arm RTX britain system basically so we
release binary for this for this
platform one more important work that we
have with arm 11 running on Linux it's
in fact it's raspberry pi which is
freely and what not really but widely
available and you can run our runtime on
on this on this hardware and tested we
have a number of other ports and that I
will both through our partners and
engineering services for examples in
Tyrion whilst models were supported and
Qualcomm Internet of Things platform
that was introduced in 3 dot for release
announced yesterday and we just won't
want to mention that our stack and the
runtime is highly portable
can I well it can run on any other
platforms as needed so here is the
general architecture of our stack
starting from the bottom we have the
hardware I don't know if you see so this
is the hardware including all the
peripherals and operating system and a
pretty flexible porting layer to support
both hardware and operating system we
have the vm running on top of it with
number of features including
multitasking and tool in support
including on-device debugging monitoring
and profiling and a number of optional
libraries and packages some of them came
from the standard mobile space and we
are adopted not an optimized for
embedded reality and some of them are
proprietary and those that I've been
standardized and bedded applications to
run on top of them one of the important
part of this tech is device access api's
and I will cover them a bit later we
have a number of tools including Eclipse
and netbeans plugins and Jeremy is decay
which allows you to emulate and run your
applications without the hardware and
also with the hardware it has a
standalone version and also it runs as a
plug-in folder for the IDs and a number
of services including porting optimizing
integration can be built without product
together with oracle or without partners
so this is the list of genetic general
libraries or extensions optional
packages that we have on our platform
it's pretty much standard and so we can
easy go move forward we have four three
dot X releases we have a feature that
allows you to remotely configure and
monitor the platform manage divide
manage applications and configure the
DVM including reading and setting
properties configure watchdog and
shutting down the vm you just tell that
to the device and do whatever you need
device access AP is also one of the main
goal is to provide the Java API is to
access all the peripherals with no need
to write any native code so we do it for
you we provide a number of interfaces to
access I square see spi and I
analog-to-digital conversion you art and
others I so this is under the process of
being standardized and is well being
actively evolved as the specification
unless it is the implementation it's all
available you can try and test it on the
malaysian and on the real hardware as we
mentioned before as for tooling we have
Java ME SDK probably some of you are
familiar with this tool or set of tools
from the mobile space now it's been
adopted and modified for embedded space
for embedded platforms you can customize
your device select which peripherals and
which configuration you have and run
your application on and test application
on on the host with no need to
do anything with hardware and also you
cannot connect and deploy your
applications and debug them remotely on
the real hard work can connect it to
your host machine we have support for
netbeans in Eclipse and well we try to
use standard IDEs and we provide a
number of tooling infrastructure that
allows you to optimize applications and
the platform in general java me embedded
8 was also announced and released just
recently with early access version so
that you can try and play with it so in
general the architecture is similar we
have Java VM which implements cldc
profile but now its CEO dc-8 which is
updated to support all the latest
features eight is the hint that it
includes are the features from JDK 8 we
try to align not only the api's and vm
features but also i tried to use similar
development experience for for
programmers so you can use standard GDK
tools java c compiler with no need to do
to use any additional tools like
purifier or anything like that that was
before I have I'll cover in a bit more
details it later so the jsr is 360 you
can find the draft on the JCP page and
we would appreciate any feedback and
commands that you have on top of it we
have a number of optional packages one
of them is the core of this platform is
Java ME embedded up
file which has also been in the process
of standardization now and the optional
packages and gcp GSR number is 369 60 61
and another important part is device
access API and security packages and the
number of other optional extensions that
you can run on top of this platform seal
dc-8 is built on top of co DC 1 dot one
dot one to bring all the API nvm
features to to the embedded
specification and it's also line to use
java c 8 and is strict subset of java c
8 specification so we synchronize all
the GDK five six seven and eight
language features so you can develop and
reuse your code in SE and amy world now
we also introduced a lonely requested
Java C API is we updated virtual machine
and do care about footprint
optimizations and a lot of non-standard
work to make it runnable on really small
devices as Kosta mentioned our target is
in RAM less than 100k and in Rome less
than 500 k which is really small and one
of the main requirement for this pack is
to provide the court binary
compatibility so that you can run all
your legacy applications on the new
platform my bio information profile is
ME embedded profile is an extension of
informational module profile next
generation which is
the optional packages in DCPS GSR 22 to
28 it's a it basically it's built on top
of co dc-8 and provide a number of
enhancement for a small and Minter age
embedded market its modeler as well as
we try to model do all the components
and keep the model for example still
dc-8 will also have two models compact
and full profile and you can customize
it for for your actual applications and
actual use cases as well as all other
components on modeler as well and here
you can find the link to the gcp page
with that I pass the mic back to the
question on the conclusion unless you
have any questions right now yes please
right
basically there are a lot of them and I
have so we have no reflection we we have
no no concurrency ap is all I can
basically give you the full list of this
after after this session I believe they
will be available on the yes they will
be available on the web and as well as
wanted to say that there will be
specially dedicated sessions for the
ALDC specs reach 360 if I have the list
of the sessions at the end so but i
don't think that exact one but we can
help you to find out this session they
will be deep dive what is what is the
difference what is implemented what is
not okay thank you any other questions
okay so just to conclude we really
wanted to to encourage you to think
about if you haven't worked with me
before to try to think about this we do
think that there are a lot of power in
the technology and there are a lot of
space where you can apply your skills we
wanted to say for this week fo for your
to-do list please try to go to the web
pages try to download our beats try to
play with them again windows or
specifically dedicated binaries for the
patterns which we support there are a
number of information in the blocks one
of them one of the biggest ones turns
bars block with our product manager I
don't know if you know him or not and
then I've made the short list of the
things regarding the product there are
should be longer least I haven't had a
chance to put everything over so I
really encourage you to two committees
to these sessions there
quite interesting tutorials his use of
our technology over this week and here
let's let's maybe look what what the
exact time and of course have fun as we
do half as an engineers and developers
at oracle try to put your own robot try
to put your beads and and run it and
bring it over here so with that I think
that we yes we are done with this one
nice slide and yeah if if if there are
any questions we would be happy to
answer please also stop by in our Java
me pot and we would be happy to answer
your questions so you just go to the OT
insight there are you know click through
that you can you know download the
library and use for your internal use
not for commercial of course and I think
it's like 90 days internal user but this
is a very simple click through license
just read it in and down and download
the binary SDK and as well run time well
in production then you should have to
connect our product managers like that
parents bar and you will figure out how
it is possible to use and what you know
what are the deals and etc that's i can
give you carte until after after the
talk and you can you can contact me i
will connect it to the right people any
other questions ok so i think it's just
a start for this week we wanted to give
you a highlight high-level information
about our product and we really want you
to encourage to come to other sessions
and learn more in details for all the
features thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
