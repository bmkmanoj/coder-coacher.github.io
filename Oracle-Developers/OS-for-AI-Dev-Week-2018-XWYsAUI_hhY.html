here I develop a week I'm your host
Javed Mohammed and I have as my guest
today John Peck who is a developer
evangelist nice
high-five there with algorithm so tell
you you gave you talk are you gonna give
you a talk I gave my talk yesterday okay
all right so that was operating system
for AI uh-huh when wonderfully had a
great time here lots of really
interested developers okay basically
what I covered there was a parallel
between the development of operating
systems and the development of where we
are with artificial intelligence how we
deal with machine learning right now
okay so as a friend of mine is fond of
saying tensorflow is open source but
scaling is not so the problem is that we
have lots of individual good models
we're getting lots of good data coming
in now we can train models out to do
very cool specific tasks but those
individual models and those individual
tasks are relatively brittle and don't
interoperate well so I may have trained
something up inside one particular
framework inside one particular language
as soon as that framework changes a
little bit my model may break if I
wanted to interoperate with other models
and seamlessly that's difficult to do if
I'm stepping outside of the framework
and if I want that to scale I have to do
a lot of the DevOps myself right now
so this is much more akin to the early
days of operating system development
when we didn't have true multitasking we
didn't have truly multi-user processes
where you could seamlessly switch
between different things and have as
many users as you want working on the
same system
so what we envisioned was a way of
integrating regardless of language
regardless of framework regardless of
which developer created it a variety of
different machine learning models in a
single elastic environment the Sun like
what you're saying it sounds too good to
be true it's like everything is unit
it's so universal it kind of reminds me
of I don't know Java and write anywhere
run anywhere or whatever the the
terminology was I
so it just sounds I mean is this like
Nirvana or like what are we talking
about here cuz it seems like it is it's
very cool and it's a question of where
you want to do the heavy lifting and the
idea is that you put DevOps specialists
where they're best and you leave machine
learning developers to do what they're
best at and this is all enabled through
micro containers and kubernetes so that
whatever language and framework stack is
necessary to run a particular machine
learning model we can have a micro
container ready within 15 milliseconds
that's going to handle that
so when you take your model and you put
it into our system it's simply for the
machine learning developer a matter of
training that model up wherever they
prefer to copying that model file into
data storage and writing what's usually
three or four lines of code inside a
function block to load up that model
deserialize it take the user input input
run a prediction on it and then return a
result okay so they put that code in
there they attach their model they
declare the frameworks that are using an
independancy file and then they hit go
ahead and publish that and we put that
micro container out there for anyone who
wants to to use unless of course you
declare it as private and want to use it
just within your organization which is
also a possibility what happens then is
that micro container is available to be
elastically scaled as much as needed so
whether one person's calling it or
whether a thousand people are calling it
a second you have available immediately
the right number of replications of that
micro container across our cloud hosted
system to serve all of those requests
within the same amount of time okay John
before you go any further I'm still kind
of trying to put all of these pieces
together and probably as so many of them
so when I'm thinking of like DevOps and
I'm thinking of machine learning are we
to be talking about this is kind of part
of the feedback loop of you're using
machine learning to make a better DevOps
but see icd pipeline or what do we do so
it's not to help to frame this because
I'm just trying to figure out you know
where this fits
ABB's
so if you're a machine-learning
developer right now whether you're
working in an enterprise or whether
you're working independently a lot of
the DevOps is on you so you might be
taking that and you might simply be
standing up that model on a single
machine on a single VM that's fairly
easy to do but once you start having to
scale that out and make it work for a
large number of users the problem
becomes very complex very quickly okay
within certain languages and within
certain limitations there are some
really great solutions out there for it
right but if you're working outside of
one of those frameworks are outside of
one of those languages that's currently
supported by the popular function as a
service providers then you end up very
quickly hitting a roadblock where you've
got to do all of your own scaling and so
our vision was make it so you don't have
to do that so DevOps is no longer the
machine learning developers problem all
that they are responsible for is
training up their model finding the good
data doing what they do best and then
putting it into a system that can serve
it with the right DevOps characteristics
for them so now you're not thinking
about DevOps at all as a machine
learning developer and if you're someone
who wants to use machine learning but
you don't actually know how to write it
yourself there's a public marketplace
out there where people that have
deployed their machine learning models
into our cloud each one has a listing so
a developer who only knows for example
how to write JavaScript on the front end
simple web pages can still go and locate
very complex machine learning models and
without having to download any code
without having to build it locally or
anything of this sort they can simply
copy and paste a very simple function
call which executes sout remotely on our
servers so now I can within about 30
lines of JavaScript write a simple web
page that does something like takes an
image from the user
fires it off into algorithm use cloud
color eise's that image artificially
gets a result back and displays that to
the user that complexity of the machine
learning process isn't something that
the end developer has to worry about in
fact they have the flexibility of going
out into the marketplace searching for
colorization looking at three or four
different developers solutions which
might solve that problem and picking the
one they like best
based on a rating and tagging system and
then utilizing that from any language at
all
okay so is this the future of DevOps I
think so
we've seen functions as a service
growing of course with all of the Big
Bird by the way to me when you when you
talk about function as a service to me
it almost sounds like DevOps on demand
the it's a whole new world we're working
in where you no longer have to be the
master of everything you do I've been in
this business for 25 years and Winnie
when I started I was at the point where
in the organization I was at I'd be
responsible we're taking machine from
bare metal all the way up to hosting our
products out live and that got shaved
away and more and more specialized over
time and now we're finally at the point
where if you want to if you prefer to
you can focus on nothing else but the
actual individual code segments you care
about and you can run things in a very
lightweight separated way where micro
services are providing all of the
computation on the back end and all that
you are maybe serving out is a single
web page with a bunch of function calls
in it and you put your business logic
right into the front end so that's one
possible solution but then there's also
the option of desktop automation where
when you want to do something complex
like go through all of the files on your
computer and categorize them according
to what language they're written in or
what topic they're on you can write a
fairly simple Python script which is
going to call various machine learning
processes on different systems and
they're going to return to you the
results you need to simply do the
reorganization locally so you can focus
on just that portion of the stack you
care about and I have to worry about any
of the operational characteristics well
John this is a fascinating subject and
I'm sure we can go on and on I do have
to ask you and I know you come by
earlier is this DevOps is this my
machine learning what's what what just
replicate another and I'd be fine this
is what happens when you don't snowboard
for nine years
I hope you decided to go out on the
slopes behind ice at 25 miles an hour
and separate your shoulder okay oh it's
not too bad now they've patched me up
and I've got about six weeks in a sling
and okay I'm sure there's a model in
there somewhere but John really
appreciate you coming in and they're
dropping by thank you have a good one
you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
