San Francisco the very first article
code so we're very excited and that
happens my guest today Shh buzzer hey
Javed Sheikh great to have you here
today is the director of product
management for developer cloud service
and we just kind of wanted to have a
chat and find out again you know where
things are at and what you'd like to
share so his fault
he had a chance to kind of walk around
yeah in Seville he knows it's a very
impressive confidence you can actually
see the focus on developers and none of
the speakers have a tie on so that's a
good indication a lot of technical talks
a lot of demos during the talk so that's
what we like to see and then yeah we
have a nice demo ground in here and nice
activities robots and three-dimensional
printing so what developers like to see
great so from a developer cloud service
you know there are obviously there are
many people over here because even more
numbers of folks who couldn't make it
here already liked it shared by
developer cloud service well the first
thing to share is they should come to
San Francisco it's a nice place to be so
if the confluence come over to the
confidence and what we've been showing
today is some of the functionality that
we built into developer cloud service in
the latest releases and so those of you
don't know developer cloud service does
several things for us it helps us manage
the lifecycle of code from issue
tracking all the way to managing the
versioning all the way to continuous
integration and that's one side the
other side is actually managing the
agile development approach and this is
kind of the stock that I did today
which was some of the best practices
that our development team have developed
over time by using our products and
using agile development methodology and
showing how they are actually doing
day-to-day edge as DevOps type of
development how they manage all the
issues in one central repository
allowing our developer managers who have
a full view of each development plan the
progress that we're making the load on
different people in the team
how developers walk with the tool and
managing code versions and checking in
checking out doing branches doing light
code reviews online Wow that's fun right
so again just kind of pops just
encapsulate what you think there so the
developer cloud service covers pretty
much the complete lifecycle of a product
from yelled and you talked about
continuous integration continuous
deployment right arm you talked about
some best practices is without kind of
going through all of them but the other
perhaps because of the top-20
silly ones in terms of best practices
yeah I think one thing of that one thing
that worked great for us is this
combination of the DevOps tool being
tied into the edge L tool which means
that when we for example is do work on a
specific task form a ledger side and do
a code change this code change in the
commit message has a pointer to the task
this code change would fire up the build
and if the build fails we know exactly
who did it what was the change they did
and it allows us to much more write a
quicker way to recover from any higgles
encoding and so usually people look at
idle age I love DevOps and sometimes
it's even two separate groups in the
organization and what we believe in is
actually having one tool that combines
the two gives you a lot of value and I
also talked about some of our best
practices in terms of managing the code
lifecycle how we use git flow as a
development approach to managing all our
issues and code branches and things like
that and talked about the importance of
actually having build and test
automation built into the product when
one of our developers works on a piece
of code they actually built a test as
part of the code commit this creates a
build for Dell feature and then the test
is integrated into our bigger testings
and that's how we actually do
development a telecare land seems to
work pretty good for us
great so if developers want to check out
developer cloud service what's the best
way for them to go about doing that and
the best way is to basically take any of
the other Oracle cloud services that
you're interested in and forward tile
and then you'll get developer cloud
service for free so if you have a
database develop he'll take the Oracle
database cloud service for a test run
and you'll get developer cloud service
for free with it and you'll have for
example sequence PL capabilities inside
developer cloud service if you're in ojs
developer PHP developers take our
application container cloud for a test
on developer cloud service comes with it
you into doc yewll's take our local
container cloud service for a test on
developer cloud services there java
developer Java cloud service mobile
developer mobile cloud service all of
them get you get developer cloud service
with a radius and for those of you are
watching you can go to developer Oracle
comm slash try it and from the ones you
can sign in and register you can try out
any of the Sony of the linear dimension
including developer cloud server click
so just give it a try will show that
you're going to run it all right okay
any final takeaway so far well I guess
for folks who may be watching and yeah
you should come really you should come
to an Oracle code event in this
interaction that you have with other
developers realizing that they have the
same issue that you're running into
sharing some best practices this is the
two value of a live event where you get
to meet people it's not just online so I
know that you're watching it online but
you shouldn't come over here so unless
one is the other is next week we're
going to be in Austin so commonly if
you're not local to the Bay Area or
California and you're in the Midwest
please come and check that out it's
going to be a 20 city tour worldwide so
stay tuned and say thank you very much
for coming and enjoy everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
