such a huge crowd joining this early
hours my name is Mel Barnett this my
colleague Dan Irish middle and the
fourth in the next 45 hours we will talk
about the importance of API API driven
architectures for today's IT system
landscapes especially in the following
we will shortly show show you why API
management is relevant afterwards we
will jump into a little practical
example where we will show you how we
started implemented a first
implementation where we replaced a or
where we started to re-implement a
monolithic application on a micro
service based approach using api's and
with this example I think it will also
be more clear what is the responsibility
of api's in today's at the architectures
after that we will dive into some
architectural considerations just before
we do a summary of the key takeaways of
this presentation
yeah Daniel oh and me we are located in
Germany so we are working for Opitz
consulting we have 11 locations
throughout Europe especially in Germany
and also in Poland and yeah we are
oracle Platinum Partner for 27 years now
and we working close together with
Oracle to getting our customers to
manage the challenges especially in the
area of digital digital transformation
Danilo and me we are also part of the
Oracle ace program
so we have a global network of experts
where we exchange knowledge and all that
kind of stuff where we discuss
architectural challenges for today's IT
architectures and you will also see some
of these results within this
presentations because we created some
kind of architectural framework which
from our perspective is relevant for
today's modern architectures so API
management why is it relevant so if you
if you are looking around there are a
lot of api's arising and also businesses
change with this with this rise of the
API so if you look at Expedia they are
generating nearly 90% of the revenue
truly fruit the providing API is today
and this is relevant because so you see
that businesses change how they make the
money also Google and and Salesforce
they have a strong strong strategy for
going to api's but revenue is not the
only thing which is which is a key
factor of why you should go to to api's
you have all all those things like
customer satisfaction and engagement
operational efficiency is so you provide
self services to your partners to your
employees to be more efficient in your
daily business so there at the journey
starts already right and also things
like partner contribution and the
ecosystem so growing new digital
economies if you if you think of uber if
you think of my taxi which is a taxi app
in Germany where you
call a taxi buy a mobile app and then
everything is handled through this
absolute the payment process your you
don't have to pay in cash and all that
kind of stuff so things are changing
even in the private space but also for
the business space so this is the this
is the thing why api's are very relevant
especially in the area of digital
transformation we see that at our
customers also yeah and with that we
will jump into the demo and the example
and tenido will present it to you all
right so let's start to tame the
monolith today we tend to model it and
we don't aim the tiger or the cows that
you can see here okay
a typical challenge that we have and I'm
pretty sure that many of you have
similar problems is that we have a
monolithic application and this
monolithic application fulfills a lot of
functionality so for example what you
can see here on this slide is this
monolithic application is our project
management system it is also our system
where we store all the financial stuff
the controlling things the time
management aspects and even the canteen
management so this is a monolithic
application that we have in our own
company and we have all these
functionalities in one box and the
problem is that is it's an Oracle forms
based solution you know I don't want to
say anything bad about Oracle forms I
call it the create box because it has
this nice krei user interfaces it does
it fulfills all the things that we want
but the problem is it doesn't offer any
API it's public API is so for example if
we would like to implement some new
innovative apps for example for the
canteen management that's quite
difficult
because we don't have these api's I
mentioned the canteen management here
because something that might be a very
nice addition to this thing is imagine
you go into the canteen you order some
food and you have some location-based
services and you get a push notification
on your mobile and it informs you ah I
ordered I don't some need for example
these cows here or I ordered some
vegetarian food and so on so but that's
hard to add some new things here to this
monolithic application but exactly this
was the task improve the customer
satisfaction with new and innovative
apps and modernize what we have to
increase the flexibility that's the task
and in the next couple of minutes we
would like to show you how this can be
accomplished with API management ok what
do we have here you can see still on the
left-hand side there's our monolithic
application and we thought ok but how
can we practice thing up into small
functional building blocks I'm pretty
sure at Oracle OpenWorld you heard
already a lot about container you
already heard a lot about micro services
so of course this is something which we
discussed as well and we thought ok some
of these building blocks that we have in
the monolithic application today can be
a micro service in the future
and we said ok but we don't want to do a
big bang approach so let's start very
small and let's start for example with
the canteen management and what you need
to define is then ok how can we on one
hand establish a couple of new micro
services and on the other hand we still
have the monolithic application we still
need to talk to this monolith so we have
on one hand
Samhita coupled new micro service or
fully decoupled new micro-services and
on the other hand we need to integrate
it we call it semi decoupled services
but I will go into detail in the next
couple of minutes okay here you can see
the picture on a little bit bigger and
you can see the most important thing
that we had to add is we wanted to
establish the api's we wanted to have a
centralized validation a centralized FRA
telling routing and filtering also rate
limit is very important when you look
into modern API platform one thing that
is pretty much important especially when
it is cloud based is the thing it should
offer some kind of rate limit because
imagine you have to pay for every API
call if you don't have any rights limit
then it might be a very expensive bill
when somebody is hacking you for example
yeah so you need some kind of rate limit
to also control how many calls did you
receive and how many calls do you route
to your next services to your next
systems okay as already said we
implemented the fully decoupled micro
services but micro service without
DevOps from our perspective doesn't
really bring all the benefit so we
established also some teams who
implemented the micro services but also
own them and also bring them to
production maintain them and monitor
them on the other hand we have the the
traditional integration aspect to
connect to the monolid so there are a
couple of Oracle cloud services that we
considered for that and that we use for
that for the micro services you could
use the container cloud service or the
application container cloud service at
least this is what we do on this
conference you can also hear something
about server less which is something
that Oracle adds to the platform in the
future in the near future so this might
be an important thing here as well also
about the DevOps you have we looked into
the developer cloud service on the
integration side we have the integration
cloud service the solar cloud service
and the Java cloud service this is also
something that we needed to establish
some adapters and onto API layer which
is the most important one for this talk
we worked with the API management
platform okay the flight from Germany
was quite long and I decided to draw
some nice fancy icons here because I
thought okay when you start how many of
you just start to think about API
management so almost half of it
so because we thought okay when we start
with API management what are the
different roles what are the different
different tasks that you have to do that
you have to think about we can see here
the application developer and he thinks
okay for this modernization of this
monolithic application
are there any API is available already
on the other side we have the back-end
developer and he thinks but well how
should the api's for the micro services
how should they look like how how does
the contract look like okay the first
thing that the app developer might do is
give a search and egg in a catalog some
kind of catalog okay are there any API
is already available if not the API
designer comes into the game and
he has to design the new API this is
something that we recommend to follow an
API design first approach and this is
now something that Sven will show in a
little demo because as part of the API
management platform from Oracle there
comes a Puri and this tool helps us to
follow a design first approach and as a
result well as when is setting up the
demo as a result of the design phase we
get the API description and we also get
an API mock-up which can be used to
start the development for the
application and also for the micro
service okay it's been yeah here we go
so apiary is the platform for doing
consistent API designs for collaborating
on these designs you can integrate it
with github you can work in a
collaborative way you can make changes
to those API descriptions either in
swagger or in API blueprint so you have
the choice how to how to define these
API and the most important thing about
apiary is that on the one hand you have
this descriptive character so you can
consistently define the API share it
with your team and on the other hand you
have the ability to also use this mock
server capability which they neither
just mentioned so if you go to the
documentation and you say ok I wanted to
know how we can get all office which are
offered by our canteen then you can go
here you see all the parameters you can
also see an example for the for the
request
and sorry the special thing is this URL
above because if you make rest calls -
exactly that URL you are calling this
resource and what apiary apiary does for
you is it returns the example data you
just defined here so it is a very quick
win if you define this API first provide
this URL to your app developer so that
he just can start developing the
application and the nagas thing which is
very important about apiary you can
easily change data structures without
having one single line of code written
so this is very beneficial because it
enables you to rapidly develop
applications to rapidly showcase your
you eyes to your end users and change
things which the end user gives back to
you so short feedback cycles and it's
very easy to change here on apiary level
so if you look here we have here a
postman collection so postman is a tool
for testing rest endpoints here we have
different environments we have here the
apiary canteen if you look here you
exactly see the mock host and if we make
a call then we'll receive the example
data which is defined with an apiary so
this is very very beneficial from an
implementation perspective because you
decouple implementation of the front end
and the back end because the back end
developer can work independently from
the front end developer and vice versa
so
is very good for being more agile more
flexible in a for developing new
functionality and we will talk about
this in more detail also later on
because we will tell you about a real
customer scenario where we exactly
implemented it like this okay um so we
saw how to describe the API we also saw
how can it be used as a mock-up so that
means that the application developer he
can start to implement his application
against this mock-up we don't lose any
time also the back-end developer knows
how does the API look like and now he
can start to implement the
micro-services all right the next step
what would it be it would be to
implement the API to enrich it with some
kind of validation rules with things
like the rate limit that I mentioned
before security policies because that's
the benefit of the API management
platform to enrich the api's on a
centralized platform and then it will be
published to an api gateway or to
multiple api gateways you can have them
in your own data center you can have
them in another cloud you can have them
in multiple clouds so and last but not
least the back-end developer fin
finalized the implementation of the
micro services so now he provides the
implementation of the micro services and
the API manager or it can also be done
by the API developer he will now switch
in the in the API management platform
from the mock up to the real
implementation so the application
developer implemented his app already
against the mock-up and now using the
same API we switch to the real implement
and this is something that we can see
now how to implement the API and how to
enrich it as policies and things like
this so so first of all how many of you
have seen the API platform cloud service
before so that's not so many but I like
it very much the API platform cloud
service because it's a very
straightforward cloud service for
defining your API management in your API
implementations so this is the
management portal where the API manager
goes to to implement the api's you need
so you go there this is our canteen
management API and what we have here is
a sequence of policies so we expose this
API using the contact root canteen with
some kind of key validation so if you
wanted to use this API you have to
register your application against this
API then you will receive a unique API
key which you need to include into your
API calls because otherwise it will be
rejected and yeah then you can also
monitor on an application level how much
calls you received for this particular
application to your API and then we have
a basic authentication security policy
you can also use OAuth for example and
Oracle also works on extending those few
generalities for doing authentication
especially doing authentication with
other social media parties we do some
kind of heroine occasion we have this
application rate limit Anila was talking
about
four and finally we have the service
request so this is the call to the real
back-end service in our case this is
implemented in Oracle container cloud
service so and you can manage all this
dis API stuff using this management
console so you can do the deployments to
do the different gateways and what we
also did so if you want your your
application developers to be capable to
look up all the api's you published it
within your company you have to provide
something like an API portal so if you
have this API implemented you can also
publish it to a API portal so and within
this portal your developers can browse
the api's which are available and what
you also can see here that we connect
our apiary documentation to this
particular API so if you go to the to
the portal which is here you can see the
API if you drill down into the API
portal you will be provided with the
information you defined with an apiary
so it is a very consistent way of
providing your API and implementing your
API is right ok it takes a little too
long but that's that's the thing so in
in a peer in in postman we can simply
join change our endpoint so we say ok
let's go to the real API which you can
see here and call this API so you see
the result of the call changes because
we are going we're reaching out to the
real API implementation and we also set
the respective headers so the tenant ID
for example the API key a username and
also authorization so the basic
authentication
so this is really cool and we can also
see this here in the analytics so we
received totally one request today and
this was the request adjust it so you
have a consistent view on who is
invoking your api's so and this is
really cool so with that we will change
back to the to the presentation okay
we saw all the things that we have on
this picture and let's summarize it
again from the picture point of view and
afterwards we will talk about the
architecture so one thing that we would
strongly recommend is to start always
with an API first approach we saw the
benefits of a Puri how many of you do
already have an account for a period
already not so many I would definitely
recommend to have a look because our
customers are also using it if they are
not a customer of the API management
platform for example because this is
something that you could use also for
your other micro services other
implementations that you already have
today and by the way it is free so you
can sign up you can you can evaluate it
and if it fits to your needs you can
sign up for a more cooperate approach
there so there is no no barrier to to go
for apiary and you can work in a
collaborative way another thing that we
would recommend is don't design your API
is without the proper API management
platform you need something in place to
and have centralized enrichment to have
centralized policies that you can add to
your api's and don't put too much logic
inside the api's but we will come to
this later again also what we would
recommend is no api's without a business
alignment so think about it first think
about what you would like to accomplish
and think about which api's - you really
need which api's helps you to do your
business think about the business
capabilities and also the end-to-end
processes we wrote down a couple of
questions that we usually ask here I'm
not going through them with interest of
the time but the slides will be provided
afterwards and I mentioned this already
no api's without an API first approach
all right next thing API management is
essential yeah what we have had Opitz
consulting as we thought about ok how
many what are our kind of projects in
the last couple of years and we saw
mainly for all of them or for most of
them API management is relevant and what
we did is we created the poster you can
see it also on the next slide and we
also provided the UL you can download it
and on this poster we wrote down ok what
do we have today
where is API management relevant for the
digital transformation so you find here
four pillars and the four pillars our
future oriented architectures for human
machine interaction we have end-to-end
integration architectures analytics
business insights and also hybrid
infrastructure architectures and for all
of them
we think that API management is relevant
this is the poster that I mentioned and
the I heard this is another version of
the slide sorry but when we provide the
slides the URL will be on it and and you
can download it what we added to this
poster as well is we thought about ok
which Oracle cloud services could we use
what is of help
and and this is something that we added
here as well but now let's go into the
architecture point of view so as Ben
mentioned at the beginning we are part
of the Oracle a stays program and there
are more than 500 experts all over the
world and within a small group we
thought okay API management it's quite
relevant today
but how do API architectures look like
what do we really need and how should we
distinguish between different types of
api's and this is something we came up
we said okay let's form some kind of
group with experts from from all the
global companies also from some smaller
companies as I said all over the world
and we said okay what we have is when we
just look at the API layer we need to
distinguish between single purpose a pis
and multi purpose API is another thing
that is very optimal when we talk about
micro services to people say are
microservice it replaces
service-oriented architecture we
definitely think no and this is also
something we thought about we have this
service implementation layer as you can
see on this picture
we still need our integration
capabilities things that we know from
the old solar world on the other hand we
have fully decoupled self-contained
systems like microservices both is
necessary from our perspective and both
is needed and we we thought about ok how
which capabilities are needed and which
capability is should the single purpose
API fulfilled which capability should a
multi purpose API fulfill and this is
also something that we wrote down you
can see the link here on this slide you
can access it this group is supposed to
be free if you would like to participate
just contact
us and we are more than happy to discuss
your experiences and also to give some
feedback I don't want to forget to give
some special credit to Lewis we're from
Cap Gemini because he did put a lot of
effort into this he also has a talk to I
think this afternoon and I would
recommend to go there as well he's
really an API expert there are some
other guys from from other companies who
participated as well I don't want to
mention all of them but just have a look
go there and get some some new ideas and
what we see now and and then we'll talk
about this is how can we use the
architecture blueprint that we defined
in the Omega group and how can we use it
in a real-world scenario so this year we
we had a customer who is a working in
the production industry very traditional
from IT perspective with yeah very
straightforward processes internally and
they noticed that they are not able to
create some kind of innovative new
applications within a a certain amount
of time and they wanted to to to change
the approach so they founded some kind
of digital lab for for creating
innovative and new solutions so this use
case was one of the first
implementations which within this
digital lab organization where they just
wanted to expose a back-end application
through a mobile UI what was the use
case the use case was that internally
the customer have some kind of a rail a
railway based transport transportation
system so the engineers on the on
trains have to communicate wire
walkie-talkies to the back end to the
back of his guys so the back of his guys
tell the engineers what to do
so they have to to transport raw
materials from from track ybc to AVD
something like that so and the engineers
on the under trains need to write it
down every time and this is very
error-prone
it is not not optimized because
sometimes communicating by our
walkie-talkies is not possible because
maybe the the back-office guy is not
available because he is smoking a
cigarette something like that and this
screws also up the the monitoring for
the this distinct steps within this
particular task the engineer has to
fulfill and then the customer came to us
with this use case and they asked who
should we implement this from
architectural perspective because they
wanted to build up some kind of
reference architecture for their new
applications they wanted to build and
then we told them that API management is
very relevant also form a security
perspective right so we have this
multi-purpose API layer on the one hand
to expose foutch analogy from the
backend application using an integration
layer underneath exposing the whole
bunch of properties coming from the
backend system and on the single purpose
API or back-end for front-end layer what
we did we scaled this properties down to
the 2d properties which are really
needed by the by the UI so by the by the
mobile application so we tailored to
contracts from operational perspective
and also from from a attribute
perspective to be more
performance when when exchanging data
from the back-office application to the
mobile application so what we did in the
first workshop we bring up this this
this approach from a Mesa which the nil
you just introduced to you and then we
thought okay which kind of Oracle cloud
service are relevant for the for the
different layers so and what we saw is
that in the in the in the UI layer we
may be can or we can go to max to rapid
rapidly develop your I Pro tips to show
it to the customer and to the engineers
especially to get feedback regarding the
UX so the user experience which is very
relevant in case you define a mobile
application right because otherwise if
you have a bad user experience you will
have definitely no acceptance from a
user perspective and that's very
relevant here so we have mobile cloud
service as the single purpose API
implementation from an integration
perspective we have the integration
cloud service sitting behind firewalls
so the the connectivity agent to connect
your on-premise apps to the 2d cloud in
a very consistent way without having
stuff to do with the firewall and this
was a problem you have TD container
stuff and the API platform cloud service
as well and developer cloud service for
doing all the collaboration within the
project so in a first step what we did
because we had a a four weeks duration
of implementing a first version of this
application so we just go for mobile
cloud service and apiary for API first
design we we skipped out the API
platform cloud service because it was
just released when we started the
project and we don't have the time to to
set everything up in these four weeks so
we just go for the for the mobile cloud
service stuff
and the apiary approach we started with
the project on the first day this was
just a meet-up to to get known of each
other the second day we started with
with wireframes
for the UI and in parallel we defined
the api's in apiary and the next day the
UI developers can just start from
scratch using this apiary mock for their
implementation the problem was also that
we had issues with the connectivity from
MCS to the on-premise world because we
have to go to fight through firewalls
and it was kind of a weird journey to to
go to the company processes to get a
firewall access to the on-premise world
it took us over two weeks in a four
weeks project this can be a killer but
but thanks to two apiary where we had
all the mock data we can work in a
decoupled way and this was very valuable
for us so the project went well the
customer was happy and in the next step
we will also establish the API platform
cloud service in between to get around
all these challenges with the vista
firewall and all that kind of stuff so
this is what we did for the integration
you can also use the integration cloud
service mobile mobile cloud service is
the platform for implementing the single
purpose api's and for providing us the
capability to to implement a consistent
mobile journey to provide functionality
for push notifications etc the API
platform cloud service we we will use in
the future for implementing the
multi-purpose API for do all the
management all the the analytics from
the data which which offer from the
calls from mobile devices and from all
over the company and
if your we discussed also with the
customer why it makes totally sense to
have single purpose multi-purpose APs
and what are the different
responsibilities so on the embas so
mobile backend as a service layer we
have the specific specific things for
the mobile application so all answering
functionality push notification
location-aware services all that kind of
stuff
transformations also so the tailoring of
the of the contract provided by the API
so on on the API platform layer we have
purely the stuff endpoint protection
discoverability so everyone can look up
the the api's which are available within
the company and also the usage tracking
and monetization use cases if you look
from a long term perspective
monetization if you provide api's to the
outside world maybe you will provide it
to your partners to your customers maybe
you will also charge them for this for
the usage and this can be implemented
using API platform cloud service there's
no capability in the mobile cloud
service for that
so it's make totally sense also what the
nila
told before is that we think that API
management does definitely not replace
the need for integration right because
the API layer should be a thin layer
just for doing things like monetization
basic security usage dragging all that
kind of stuff but business
transformations should be done in a
inner integration platform which is
capable for doing such things so API
platform cloud service is also not
intended to do those things right so
there is no transformation policy
something like that and we know also
other API platforms which are capable
for doing transformations which are
capable for connecting to JMS queues and
all that kind of stuff
but from architectural perspective we
don't think that this is the right way
of implementing things because on an API
layer you want to have a fin layer you
want to have something which can be
tailored in a very agile and flexible
way so you should keep the
implementation of the API management
layer very very thin
from our perspective yeah this is
actually the comparison where API
management heads to and what is the
responsibility of integration from our
perspective and there are some
differences as you can see here with
that we come to our summary so those are
the the key takeaways from this
presentations and I hope that we could
give you an idea why IPI management is
relevant and what are the ideas how to
compare consistently implement a API
management approach using Oracle API
platform on and apiary so we thank you
all to be here in this presentations and
we hope you will have a great conference
okay in case you have any questions
because we did put a lot of content
inside so there's no time for questions
within the session but if you have any
questions I recommend you wait outside
