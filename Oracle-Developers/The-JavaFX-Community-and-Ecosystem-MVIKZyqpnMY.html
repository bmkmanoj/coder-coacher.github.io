people in the session about the Java fix
community and in this session we want to
give you an insight to the JavaFX
community and echo system where I can
start in the community which activities
are in the community and today we are
three speakers my name is Alexandra I'm
from the company saxona systems and I'm
a software developer and I'm working
with JavaFX since I think now three
years I'm very proud to have James in
the session
James viewers so maybe you can introduce
a short audience a control team okay so
I'm James Weaver a job evangelist or
otherwise known as a Java technology
ambassador with Oracle and so I've been
working with these guys in the community
as well as lots of other people in the
community among yourselves in Java
effects since like 2007 and so I'm
really passionate about this this
excellent community there's my twitter
handle is JavaFX burt and my email
address is james weaver yet oracle.com
and i'm really glad to be here and the
other speaker is Hendrik from canoe and
I think you also can say something about
you sure I'm endogamous from canoe so
it's companies I do a lot of UI and we
added stuff like Java X development so
I'm a job of XT vergata and next to my
work at canoe i have block it called GUI
gosh comm where i work about you I will
gated staff and Java fix weird stuff so
that's about me okay if you start to
heaven look in the Java sex community
for example on YouTube or other portals
you find a lot of cool things a lot of
cool work which the community is doing
and we want to present you this work the
projects which are out there like I see
here in mobile port or some commercial
projects like the Flex account of X
project and other examples of this
pretty cool technology and during the
session there are a lot of dukes
some Dukes of them has have question
marks over the head so we have a lot of
cool presents and gifts for you and if
you answer question correctly or quite
correctly we give you fabulous fabulous
prizes and the first question you have
to answer after the talk is how many
Dukes are in the slides so maybe you
have a calculator with you
I don't know excluding you feel slide
yes give it give us a hint though I mean
are we going to have to count on our
fingers or do we have to take off our
shoes to be able count and don't you
shoot our nose and Travels us yes really
yeah okay very good
I can't believe you went there but go
ahead so yeah yeah authority 2 that's 2
times 21 is 42 right they answered a
life the universe and everything yeah
very good
so that all works out ok let's start
with the evolution of JavaFX so I think
in a picture this is the evolution of
JavaFX and this is the Duke 2 here yes
it counts and JavaFX started I think
before to the 2011 as the S 3 language
from follow functions and it was made by
the company see beyond and see what was
bought by Sun and then created a java
script language in the year 2007 and the
acceptance of this language in the
community wasn't that high because they
had to learn a new language so at this
point the community wasn't that big and
the year 2011 Oracle re-released Java 6
in a version 2 with the Java API and the
acceptance raised and since Java fix 2.2
and Java SE 7 update 6 you can run it on
a device where Java is installed out of
the box so your customers doesn't leave
any prerequisites to run Java X
applications and I think that last big
step is the Java 8 JDK inti creation as
we're a community prepared and extremely
for this event to bring all those
community projects and open source
projects
- in Java 8 port and I think this is the
really the Amaya stone which we had to
achieve by the by the way Alex in
addition to the fabulous prizes I
noticed that the audience is informally
organizing a raffle and some of them are
gonna win if if you trip over that thing
you're gonna actually trip over that
fall on this stage so I'm gonna move up
for this thank you you're worrying me a
lot so please proceed so if we if we
talk about the JavaFX community we have
three topics yes the Java X community
does have places to be yes like blocks
and use pages and things like this we
have places where we can start with
JavaFX like books or tutorial spots and
of course we have a lot of projects and
I think this is going to be the main
part of the presentation of projects
which are out there but let's start with
the thing about counting the dukes let's
start with the place to be and I think
the first part and the place to be
are the official play official places to
be and I think this guy seems to be very
official because he has an sign of
Oracle and maybe Jim could you give us
and short introduction about the for
example the Java fix community page well
sure yeah yeah if you go to Java FX
community comm on the left there a lot
of resources and in the middle there are
some announcements and things like that
and tweets but if you go over to the
right I don't know whether we can see to
the right show you that's where the
motherlode is really of content and so
yeah on the right we've got lots of
different bloggers that are JavaFX
bloggers and we aggregate those blogs
and so you can you can see almost
up-to-the-minute what JavaFX developers
are doing in this space can you do is
there something I need to do on this
microphone to make it and make it a
little better
maybe hold it closer or something just
let me know seong-gye okay thank you so
so we have for example
oh so Henrik Evers I act the top one to
he because he knew we were doing this
session he went ahead and timed a couple
of blog posts available on top and then
we have that light bulb is FX experience
that's one that's actually led by by the
community by some JavaFX developers at
Oracle but it's a community kind of
thing it's called FX experience it yeah
and then I need to go back and then well
then we have Rob Kowski is robbing the
audience by the way
Robbie you here okay so he's a developer
that works for a transportation company
that's based out of Alaska he's been
doing some great stuff with JavaFX
there's this there's this really rather
strange guy johan Foss I guess we kind
of you know he's like the weird uncle
you need to kind of stay away from he's
not he's an amazing okay so he recently
he recently was the lead author on a
book that I had the pleasure of helping
him with and so there's he's also
working on this port for JavaFX on
Android which is which is way cool and
so anyway that's him then we've got
Sebastian board who's doing a framework
called Jay rebirth Jay are you you know
it's kind of a rebirth of Jerry the
whole using the JRE and JVM on the
client for client side you know rich
client Java so we've got lots of
different blog posts that are very rich
passionate prolific the JavaFX community
is doing so really it's great to check
that out to see what's going on in the
community the next group page you can
with it or you should visit if you do
serious JavaFX development is the
giraffe JavaFX so if you find a bug file
it here or
you have questions where I think it's
back ask them here and as Jim already
announced or presented this the F
experience page which is quite
officially in official because I think
all of the guys which are working on
this blog are from Oracle but it's not
an official Oracle support page so these
are the official places to be and the
next part or the next places I think you
can go to our blocks and guess how many
how many blocks did we find just any
number 21 some other idea or no boy you
went there to the 100 okay so we we
analyzed that experience house of the
last few years so obviously there are
more than the blocks we found but in the
last one or two years we found somehow
30 blocks and so I think you won the
book please come up to the stage and get
a copy of so you take up a copy that you
want just a second ago right yeah so so
you have a choice okay maybe shorthand
what are what are what is choices what
are is choices so we we have quite a few
choice choices like for off yawn you
must sign a book that the people who
want only your book so don't let them
use your pen now like four or five books
we're going to introduce the books later
and this is one of the book of the books
so maybe you have a photo camera with
you so this would be the perfect second
to take a photo of the blocks which are
out there or you get a slides after the
talk yeah oh I think we didn't mention
it at the Java fix experience block
there was
the Java fix links of the week sections
so every week they block all interesting
Java fixed ups that happened in that
week and there we find all those blocks
yes sorry I think I'll be able to Java
once at once and also this session if I
don't you know cut up too much will
actually be recorded and put on parlays
so parlays calm yeah and I can we send
that Google calm to maybe so sorry I
don't know maybe two three four weeks
yes if you put it on SlideShare it will
be there earlier you can check out
Twitter our Twitter handles whether we
post it and some of the blocks we found
are very very active so we want to
highlight them so for example the Java
body blogspot a page maybe you can say
something we don't know who is this guy
I never met him on a conference I
haven't either I have tried to find out
who Java buddy is there's anybody Java
buddy here
I've asked I've tweeted about it I've
I've tried to enquire but Java buddy has
been putting lots of Java and Java FX
kind of snippets little little tutorial
kind of snippets of code on how to do
very like atomic things like little
things like for example you know how
would I use a V box or how would I use a
table view or something like that and so
it's a very enriched blog to go through
and and check out like how to do a
particular thing so it's really really
nice
I think the next really good block is
the javac' steal ID block and yeah
that's that's Jen's Theatre at Ian's
theatre yes
yawns can you tell us about that once
can you come up here I'll click here and
that tell us a little bit about your
blog we didn't tell yawns we were gonna
do this but
our game now there I know that there are
a lot of people in the community so we
will put you on the spot my blog is
about our fix of course I'm I'm talking
about my regular Java fix development
stuff and when I'm creating new controls
or I'm figuring out some solutions for
several issues you may get during
development developing Java fix
applications and I'm also blogging about
my Java FX base IOT stuff so hacking a
raspberry pi and embedded stuff yeah
that's what's my blog is about MQTT fxj
it did a lot of open source stuff yes I
have a small front and Java fixed by its
front end for MQTT it's a front end for
for the eclipse Powell library and it's
called MQTT FX I'm also blogging about
progress on that project and I have
another project which is meant to be in
picture database front-end it's called
pic modo it's also mentioned there and I
have yeah the font awesome FX library
which is focusing on that now there's
there's web font which is called font
awesome it's an icon font a glyph font
and I I'm experimenting with using these
font awesome
icons in Java effects and this is what
font awesome FX is about so basically
it's the JavaFX the font awesome is a
TTFN font and the the icons are unique
codes at the end and if you're taking a
label a JavaFX label and placing these
using Unicode
character and also switching on somehow
the using the the fun awesome font for
this label you will see an icon there
instead of a normal letter I'm going to
show you a demo later okay thank you
okay that's thank you about them so I
have one one more block to feature and
Hendrick didn't knew anything about it
so I want to feature the GUI garage so
because thank you especially if you want
to know something about custom controls
implementation or how to layout Java fix
or maybe you can tell something about
the economy okay so this is my blog it's
goulash calm and yeah as I already said
when introducing myself it's mostly
about UI we added staff and Java fix
stuff so there's a lot about custom
controls how to layout sings with JavaFX
art we create who UI effects animations
and on the other hand there is some Java
fix Enterprise stuff like data a fix for
example toad for data fix how to do
Westcourt
or WebSocket communication with with
Java FX so all those topics are on the
block as I said there are lot of blocks
out there we can't feature every block
but I think those are one of the most
active blocks and the next part we want
to show you our one on one places so if
you minds or think about starting with
Java FX you may think okay
where to get the knowledge and which
options do I have
so first option is I think you take in
another book and read it and there are
several good books out there and we want
to have I think some of the authors are
in the audience too and we want to have
a short look on the books so the first
book is a general Java Java 8 book right
so this is by Carrie Horstman professor
Kay Horstmann who has been who wrote the
core Java series some of the older Java
programmers
we'll know that name in that series and
he's also been writing more recently on
Java SE 8 for the really impatient and
and so it's got some great Java FX
content in there I think a book which is
quite similar is the Java how to program
a Java 8 how to program from Paul data
and we have two copies of the book in
Jim's hotel we have pouches for them and
I think you can win one of the copy in
the next few minutes I think next cool
book is mastering Java fix 8 controls by
this guy obviously well what's the
content Hendrick so at the beginning
it's an introduction to new to Java a
fix all the core api's of Java fix in
the book but only in small part and the
second part of the book is how to handle
the layout and Java fix how to create
your own controls and how to use CSS so
it's starting with an introduction to
Java fix button goes in one special
directions that is about controls and
custom controls then I call focus of the
book who likes this book the guy with
the white key right you want a book so
you so you work come on come up to the
stage okay
and the meantime I will go to the next
slide so this is the next book pro
JavaFX eight I think
are there any authors of the book in the
audience one two three I think one of
you four okay so good could somebody of
you give us a short introduction to this
book what is the content about all the
other highlight all the author should
come up here and then one of you should
tell us about it and then that way
you'll be in a position to sign the book
yeah I don't reserve I'm on a college
I think it's pretty important that a lot
of people writing books with good
content whoops
so Joe so in case you bought aren't you
the audience okay
in case you bought a Hendrix book and
you still don't get it you can buy any
other I want of course as well no
offense so I don't know I just updated
all examples of pooja favics to to pro
JavaFX 8 and that's all I did
well actually pro JavaFX is an overview
of almost every aspect of java effects
it started with I think the JavaFX
script and then the next version was
pooja vivexx - and it contains the
different parts of GFX introduction to
sim builder - the controls to the layout
containers - web calling web services
alternative languages and we added some
chapters on a Java on mobile and
embedded Java FX 3d so it's a I think a
broad overview it goes in-depth in for
for a number of controls and for number
of cases but in general it's it's a it's
a reference book I think so it contains
different chapters about the different
parts of Java FX and it contains lots of
samples that you can use to to get
started with in particular areas but you
probably already have the book so you
know
and otherwise I think there are still a
few copies left so hurry leave the
session and hurry to the book store
that's the last time that I that they're
gonna ask me the stage I think thank you
if you have questions don't bother I
don't hesitate just just ask the
questions yes we have the time I think
the next cool book is Java fix 8
introduction by example
are there any authors of this book in
here yeah one mark Maxia mark could you
please come up or say it want to join
Paul the others so why is it Karl here I
think he had an appointment yeah he
called me about this merciless JavaFX 8
introduction by example provides a
gentle introduction to JavaFX in general
and FX 8 in particular it covers all the
basics working with independently of ID
and IDE as well as working with NetBeans
so you don't have to have use a specific
IDE but if you're familiar with NetBeans
it actually is nicely set up with
projects and such not it also we delved
into some of the IOT topics and graphs a
little bit of 3d Java FX 3d so we tried
to cover a lot of ground but do it in a
way that was very approachable for
somebody who wants to get started with
Java FX and doesn't really know kind of
how to get started with it so if you're
interested please check out the book and
if you have any questions let us know
thank you one thing this is dr. Jose
parada he worked on the epics Java FX 3d
as well as the Arduino integration so I
handled more the Raspberry Pi side of it
and Carl and and the rest of the crew
couldn't be here but I'm sure they wish
they were and if not they in fact
we have those give them because Garrett
is already giving a talk at the other
room so oh sure sure because I make
thank you he was working with NetBeans
someone in here who of the Dajjal and
Adam doesn't have this book Paul and
Gail okay so the guy with the blue shirt
with the lines you want a book and in
this the situation we want to get Gail
and Paul innocent to the stage to
introduce the very good book about
JavaFX and integration to the NetBeans
platform and of course to get a sign a
sign yes that's great yeah hi I'm Paul
miss just I'm sorry I'm Paul on this is
Gail one she home yeah I'm Paul and this
is Gail we you know we've been in a
JavaFX since it was a scripting language
and we are working at the same time the
gym and and Steve Chen were working on
it and we thought that job effects was
really a great thing and also going to
be a coming technology but when when it
became an ape in API and we saw even
more power what we felt was missing was
a framework to go with it so we hooked
up with Girton bilinga and and we worked
with him on the on him on this project
of writing a book and so we combined in
this book we combined a learning JavaFX
with the NetBeans platform so that you
get rich client applications very easily
so we do we do we do a lot about
teaching people how to use Java FX
effectively and we also teach people how
to use the NetBeans platform in this
book
so you'll learn a lot about Java FX
you'll learn about F XML we do CSS
styling and we have a lot of
sophisticated rich client applications
in the book to show you how to architect
a real Syst a real UI that people would
want to use with a rich user experience
along with other chapters on web
services and and we also talked a lot
about
- I was going to talk about the threat
issues so what we really concentrate on
what the JavaFX point is integrating it
into the NetBeans platform NetBeans
platform if it has anyone here used the
NetBeans platform to write a rich client
application ok so so the NetBeans
platform lets you write very
sophisticated desktop applications it's
swing based so if you want to integrate
Java effects you need to be able to have
swing and job FX talk to each other so
we address a lot of the threading issues
but we also address a lot of the issues
that if you have a rich client platform
application and you want to do like
database or web services access you need
to use background threads because both
Java FX and swing are at single threaded
gooeys and and you don't want to freeze
your UI so we talked about those types
of issues so they're kind of like real
world application situations and it
isn't a 900-page book but our editor
very wisely printed it on super super
thin paper so it's really not that thick
perfect yeah we also look at can you
send a copy please
yeah well we also have a book signing
this afternoon at between 3:30 and 4:00
at the bookstore and we hope to see you
guys there Thanks thank you very much
baseball
thank you very much appreciated ok these
were the books I think there are some
more books out there yes but I think one
or two more books I know but I didn't
edit them to the presentation no no I
forgot it and the next part where I
could start after we after you read all
of those books our tutorial spots so
there are several and what well not that
many tutorial spots but there are
several tutorial spots out there
I think the first official tutorial spot
is where made by Oracle so they
collected a lot of jump start examples
starting with what is Java fix to Java
fix 3d tutorials where you can as try
code snippets and things like things
like this another very cool project
toriel community tutorial is the code
maker II website you can find step by
step tutorials regarding Java ethics 8
and they made it for Java FX 2 already
and deported and my created everything
to Java fixate and I think there's a lot
of work in this project and feel free to
check it out and play a little bit
around the JavaFX so now we come to the
biggest part I think of this session
there are a lot of projects out there
and we cluster them into 4 topics the
first topic up port frameworks languages
and tooling and you may know it ports is
regarding how to bring Java effects on
mobile devices and there were some
projects out there in the last two years
and two of the projects merged into a
big project which is called Java FX
ports and you can find it under the URL
Java exports org and this community
project tries to bring Java FX on iOS
and on Android as well and in the videos
you can see Johan demonstrating an
Android application with Java FX and it
reacts on NFC signals of the operating
system so you are able to access the
operating system layer and I think this
is a big step in and in the Java fix
technology on the other hand you have a
demo mmm I think Garrett made it Garrett
Khun wat and he's showing gauges which
are running on an Android tablet and an
iOS tablet as well and I think the
performance is quite quite ok if you see
it here and the as I said there are two
projects which merge the first project
is to Android port a project by Joe
invoice and the second project is the
Robo BM project and the cool thing is
about this that I wonder Duke Choice
Award because I think this is a pretty
important community work to bring Java
fix to the next step
so in the next part of frameworks and we
found a lot of frameworks and we had to
cluster them again
because we found application frameworks
we found custom controls we found
middleware components how to get your
data to your application
we found language tools to improve your
language experience with Java effects
and we found a lot of scenes and skins
from Android
not only for me and again and next
question guess how many frameworks or
libraries did we find you can't say 21
you can now say 42 to 50 to you all of
you got books or already 15 ok teen or
tea ok ok some more 25 ok now I have no
idea who said at the problem is I think
some of you are right but you already
got a book so I think come up to the
stage please
you got hit you get a book it's not fair
I know but we have a lot of books so we
found like 45 books libraries which one
do you want ok so maybe you will get a
signed copy yes it's yours it's an ok
yes ok so we found those 45 frameworks
and please take out the cameras take
photos of of the next slide so we start
with with the application frameworks so
these are the application frameworks and
for us our application frameworks or
application promotes our tools where you
can structure your application but in
addition you can also build and deployed
application and test your application so
we we contacted the framework owners
which you of the frameworks which you
see here for the Java one and some of
them answered
ok gave us an answer and gave us a short
quote about frameworks
so now we have a look in the quotes I
think Jim already mentioned the J
rebirth framework it's an MVC framework
where you can structure your application
with the MVC pattern and I think there
are a lot of MVC frameworks here but in
addition you have other frameworks like
the mvvm FX framework which allows you
to to go for an mvvm approach if you
want to structure your views or your
eyes so an example for is data ethics
for example on this guide we only have
the flow API or the flow module of data
ethics
we have some other modules in the other
categories for frameworks - and that
have X is an application framework for
java fix with your support to create
workflows of in your application support
or the motivating starts when you want
to connect to a server and we have data
with us to read data in the background
we have test support - there were also
talked yesterday about data a fix maybe
you have seen it's all ok the next one
is m VV m FX only I already told it I so
I think another application framework
which you can choose to is J's J a c c p
FX so it's another MV star framework
which you can take if you want to build
your application I think this is a
pretty cool project - it provides you F
sorry Google juice out of the box in
your Java fix applications without any
configuration so extend from an
different application than a Java fix
application then you have Google juice
support for application and and what I
really like is that this here at JavaOne
i've seen that some of the guys who
calling these frameworks are beginning
to work together so for example I know
there's an that have X plug in for the
jsep F X framework so
that you can combine boss and yeah have
a better and bigger application
framework with more features so maybe
some of you knows the test of X
framework I think it's the most popular
testing framework to write and
components tests and acceptance tests
for the UI 2 to automate your test and
if you are interested in this topic
there will be a talk tomorrow I sing it
you guys on the clock about test ethics
and I think the smallest framework is
afterburn FX is just like three classes
it atom being made it and I think it's
in it's an MVP framework ok um I I will
give you an overview about frameworks
later so if you didn't have the chance
to maybe make a photo the next part
are custom controllers and in this case
we can show of course more screenshots
it's pretty hard to show screenshots of
application frameworks but think in case
of custom controls we can do it so we
have a lot of frameworks out there or
libraries out there if you want to take
it for root do it now otherwise it's ok
otherwise we dive into the frameworks so
the first one is the controls of X
framework I think it's one of the most
popular frameworks for Java fixate and
it gives you custom controls like an
arrow dialogue with an exception
stacktrace
or it gives you things like field
validation formula field validation I'm
going to show you an example later do
you know how much custom controls are in
control to fix is it a book question no
it's just a question but maybe Johnson
can answer it's do you know it because
we only have one now at a picture ok
What did he say that we have control ok
controls effects session in this room at
5:30 today they're going to go through
all the custom controls perfect
I think Jeff extras is the next one so
maybe Hendrick ok Jeff extras is one of
the I think oddest JavaFX community
projects it's was it before JavaFX -
already I don't know yes
yes it was so it started very early it
was something like a playground to to
test Java eggs how to build custom
controls how to build applications with
Java fix but so it's growing into a lot
of good control in jf extras at the
moment so it's a yeah it's an open
source API was a lot of good stuff and I
think it's the oldest one next one is a
commercial framework and I really
recommend this framework if you want to
display Gantt charts and display large
amount of data and this guy I think his
name is Dirk you know man and he created
the framework and is using it in in
customer projects I think for an Arabic
mu8 Airlines and if you want I have a
demonstration he gave me an example with
the comp you a complete flight data of
Emirates Airlines in this application
maybe I can show it to a table I had it
on my oh you have a two hour perfect
takes the time to start so meanwhile
starting I'm going to go to the next
slide and the next cool project is rich
text effects I think Tomas McCullough
did it and created it and - as the name
says it's a rich text editor and I'm
going to tell I'm going to say something
about Tomas later because he did a lot
of projects it's a cool guy the next
project you project you can use is open
VFX and it's an PDF renderer for JavaFX
applications so if you need it for a
project you can use it out of the box
okay so the next one is GMaps effects so
by using this comp our
you can display maps in any application
it's using Google Maps in the background
I think so yes and yeah you can
integrate a map and an interactive map
in your java X application this is
control
next very important project is to Jeff
reach out project I think there are a
lot of swing applications out there
which are using J free chart and if you
think about migrating those applications
I think one of the critical part are how
to migrate complex tables and how to
migrate my complex charts and the good
news is that Jeffrey charters have in
Java fix renderer or container where I
just can insert your old holes used
charts and use it in the applications
okay
maybe Justin hint to Jeffery shot I
looked at it and they didn't have
Jeffrey shop converted to Java fix they
have an API that converts a graphics
object of Java 2d to Java fix so if you
have any custom Swing component that
uses the Java 2d API you could convert
them by using this tutu JavaFX
and there's a demo with the anyways yeah
all right I don't know what to do here
but I have a new perfect skip back case
I think there's a brief over you about
custom controls I think there are more
projects with custom controls out there
but I think they're very small and just
one or two components in it so those are
the biggest the next part is the
middleware I think it's very important
layer because Henrique mentioned it
yesterday in the in this session it's
very important how to get your data from
for example an enterprise back-end and
there are six frameworks here and again
we contacted the frameworks owner
and some of them gave us quotes about
about the frameworks and for example we
have the data data effects the data
reader and it's of course I may say
something about so the data is data
reader fits perfect if you already have
a server and infrastructure for example
with rest endpoints of a socket endpoint
and you want to create a Java fix front
and father's in this case you should use
the data fix that herida because it
provides everything that you need to
call or make rest chords or you
server-sent events or WebSocket so it it
depends on the you know classical
architecture like you have when using
Java Enterprise for example if you have
the option to implement a new back-end I
think open dolphin might be the right
choice it's a service entry architecture
where you have the controllers on the
server side and this enables you to
share views synchronized views between
several clients so you can have a client
and a web browser and you can have a
Java fix client and I think in the
future there will be an iOS client and
the guy who made it is the attorney he's
sitting here and if you have questions
about open dolphin and how to use it
feel free to to ask him and the last one
is was made by us we created the
framework synchronized effects and it's
a pretty simple framework it takes them
it takes and Java fix grass property
craft and synchronizes the graph to
another VM so nothing more nothing more
complex it's a very simple API it
synchronizes the the properties over the
VM and you can do remote data binding
the next part are language tools so
language tools as a set improves your
language experience with JavaFX and
again Thomas McCullough did I think
underwear fix and reactor fix and they
gave me some quotes and Tomas wrote
that recta fixes an exploration of
functional programming with JavaFX so he
made an API which you can use to have an
rectus dialogue program with JavaFX he
provides event buses and things like
this where we can where we can register
to get informations and react I think
the next thing is Arabic score yes that
is cause a core module of data fix where
all the other modules and that have X
depends on and it has a lot of
congruence stuff in it so if you need to
handle background so that or
synchronized anything in Java fix I
think this module will be the right
choice for you last but not least we
have the seams and skins and we found I
think eight themes or skins and again we
can show it with screenshots in this
case so this is the dupe - by the way so
discounts the first one is flatter and
flatter is in a small framework which
was introduced by Hendrik last year on
the Java one and and yes it was made for
mobile and embedded devices because the
bands are bigger you don't have so much
shiny effect that will slow down your
machine or your embedded device and yeah
it's a forget you I forget modern forget
design and if you are interested in this
I have a session today at 4 o'clock
together with Antonia and get it who not
where we want to talk about figured out
and responsive design for yeah you know
mobile and embedded applications in Java
fix I think the next framework may be a
little bit outdated it in every such a
style your application like Windows 7
yes lined you know so I I didn't do it
but I organized it so it student did it
at at the university and yeah we decided
to use Java 7 because he had
Java 7 on his laptop and
and we don't want to do this Mitra stuff
because normally you you can't include
Java in tall enthuses meet who UI so
when you're working on Windows you're
normally work on the desktop and there
you have this skinless Ariel's windows
skin I think the next framework is where
mate was made by you - it's aqua effects
and its ties to Java FX application in
the aqua style of Mac OS the next cool
toolkit or tool for styling gel fix
applications we heard already about it
is font awesome FX I'm going to show you
the framework in a short demo later and
it enables you to use icons on labels as
a font and you can rescale it as you
want
you don't need PNG or something like
this and next the next small tool is the
undecorated it removes the windows bar
of your application and places buttons
and I think the last one is responsive F
FX which is introduced on this Java one
by Hendrick and as I see so maybe I can
say something about it as you see in the
video this is a dialog SEC X responsive
so it will get smaller all the UI and
the buttons will automatically get
smaller and pvps and the cool thing is
that this is only done by CSS so maybe
you know Twitter bootstrap there you
have this responsive support in CSS
where you can define responsive stuff in
CSS and we did it for Java x2 so with
using responsive f of X you can create
responsive applications by only using
CSS so not only using CSS you need to
coat your application right but also
responsive stuff and the replacement and
the different layout for the components
is done in CSS okay so we have to hurry
a little bit because
sorry Jim I don't think that account but
we have to edit at the end of the slides
through the number okay so what I want
to show you is a cool page which we
created for this talk so we showed you a
lot of frameworks and maybe you can't
remember all of those especially if you
leave the session maybe you miss
something so we created a framework page
which is called chair xlab comm and this
I don't know
do you know cocoa controls org this is
anybody doing Mac Mac development it's a
very simple web page where we have an
overview about frameworks any type of
frameworks as I will open the open the
website
looks like this you have a just like
small grid and you find the the
frameworks which we presented and more
on this page and we will do weekly
updates right now we placed nine
frameworks to have something for the
next week so we do weekly update on this
framework page overview page and I would
really appreciate if you open your
Twitter client on your mobile phone and
follow this Twitter this Twitter handle
and to spread the word about over the
over the framework page and if you doing
something cool Java fix stuff something
open-source ping us or ping rx and we
were added to the J fix yet and there
you if you click on one of the
frameworks you get information about the
repository about the repository basic
the framework web page and so on so as I
said I had to do this because Thomas
McCullough did a lot of a project for a
community and if we have a look on his
github account
I think he's he isn't here on the job
one or isn't he I don't know but if we
have a look we see that he made rich
tefik text effects react effects life
years of ex back check effects under FX
easy bind easy bind and so on and so on
so a lot of cool frameworks which are
useful and we wanted to feature him so
question is what was the name of the
framework page but come on who was the
first thank you
we have three books and pick one chosen
yes and three books we have today which
it's okay okay so I want to give you a
short at least one short demo because we
didn't have that much code in the
session but maybe one short demo how to
can use the frameworks and combine the
frameworks I have to open my EB in there
it is then we run our example and I
created a small application which uses
nvm effects to structure the UI it's
enlightening contacts managing
application and you can create a contact
and you see here a few ballade ation you
see required fields which you can notice
with the with the edge read edge and you
see a field validation for example here
an email address that did a few checks
if it's an email so if I enter
everything the field validation is done
by controls effects you see it works so
now can skip to the to the next page on
this page I have a country's electron
and this country's electoral contests
are coming from an XML file and I used
data FX with an XML data source to load
the XML files and get a results in form
of Java fix properties and yes I think
we have some conditions here for example
if we have another country or a country
that have provinces you see a label
province and otherwise I think let's
have another country you know you
if we take another country we see that
it's changing to state and this data is
propagated through travel fixed
properties so I bind to the XML file
with the XML data source from data FX
and I don't have to think about how to
get the data how to load the data and
say I think it's a pretty cool thing
next thing we see here are the font
awesome icons and hyperlink label which
comes from I think controls effects too
yes and I have to say who did this
example it was Manuel marques the
colleague of mine and thank you for this
ok let's go back to the slides and the
last topic of projects are languages
which well are available on the JVM so
maybe Jimmy can take one minute right so
so many of you are fans of you know
alternative languages that run on the
Java you know the the java vm like
groovy ruby scala closure and there are
there are bindings out there for for
Java FX for those languages last but not
least we have the topic tooling and in
this case we added tools which were
created by the community and for example
we have the tooth scenic view you notice
the tool scenic view who knows it I'm
going to show you how it works because
it's very impressive we have I think
five minutes and this is ok when I have
an open application like my example and
I start the scenic view application it
attaches to the to the Java fix process
and analyzes the scene graph so we can
debug your application life and if you
open your application you see that the
containers of the applications are
colored and divine navigate through the
scene graph
I see where which part of the
application is debugged so I think it's
one of the must-have tools if you do
serious drug effects development and do
debugging the next very good project is
the Eclipse plugin it's an open-source
project to by Tom Schiller is Tom here
today are there may be could you come up
and give us a two minute introduction to
eclipse effects
I know it has a tons of features I had
to talk today to Ferdie Oh
so come on the talk Italia clubs so it's
a tooling platform and Eclipse and the
Wrentham platform it didn't show up in
the application frameworks but its
application framework built on top of
the Eclipse 4 platform which underpins
the Eclipse IDE so that's what we have
and that's why we provide tooling and
all the stuff to get it I already wrote
it to you on Twitter the Java added
eclipsed by the AF clips version 1.0
released I think one month ago two
months ago and India was a feature - how
to generate Java fix property getters
and setters yes and I missed this
feature so long in Eclipse so yes thank
you very much for us we just released
wonder though I think four weeks ago
five weeks ago start the project three
years ago so it's not a bad young
project anymore
well you see a lot of the adoption of
the framework at least and the tooling
because up well we have a perfect ethics
another deter a really smart smart smart
CSS editor who really knows everything
about Java attacks that's one of the
strengths but come to my talk to Ferdie
and you receive more of the best
toolings
of for Java Baxter again everybody in
our company who's using Eclipse for Java
X development uses this plug-in so we
really recommend this plugin and just
for notice if you try it or want to
start Java X development you have the
choice which IDE you to which I li you
take for development for example
NetBeans
so you can read a book about this
Eclipse with the plug-in idea I had a
good ethics support who I think and
Oracle in addition provided then I think
don't have that much time maybe I can
show and we will show you hey you should
have a look on the steamroller because
it allows you to offer
xml files and drag and drop and
configure your your UI so last part of
this session are open source software
projects so if you think about
contributing to the java fix community
you have options like writing a book or
writing blocks or for example joining
open source projects like the frameworks
or you work on a software which uses
java text and there are several out
there for example the sports tracker and
sports records an application which is
now 10 years old it has like 10,000
downloads a year and it's an old swing
client to manage your files watch data
on on fed client for each client without
cloud connection and the guy it's a
colleague of mine who made this
application and he starts to migrate it
through java x now so if you are
interested to race knowledge in this
topic feel free to contribute the next
project is the Bitcoin client of light
house or light hospital Bitcoin client I
never did anything with bitcoins
bitcoins so I can't say that much about
it
but if you're interested in joining this
project feel free to go to the blog post
the last project I want to introduce is
the ethics playground project which was
shown by Carl Carl D he's over there can
you raise a hand yeah Carl he made
oh and Kairos main also of this book he
wasn't there when we shown it so that
sky egg icon he created and playground -
do you know what a playground is do you
note maybe you heard about apple
introduces Swift playgrounds so you can
try code snippets and there is in
rendering area next to the code area
which gives an preview of the code
snippet and how it acts
so we can avoid code smells if you try
you code before in the in the in the
playground so I think you can join there
too and the code project
that's what not least I have to say that
we want you to join the community yes as
I said you have many options you can
contribute to project frameworks write a
book or tell it like this and the last
question I have to ask you how many
jokes were in this life is it right no I
caught it 31 so there are very difficult
dukes in there for example on the Java
community page in the avatars so you got
29 but you already have a book ok yeah
so so come on come come come to us to
get a book so car do you want to sign a
book thanks that you're attended to the
session if you have any questions at
them on Twitter maybe if you want to and
yes thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
