&amp;amp; Wong thanks for coming this session is
collect real-time enterprise data with
raspberry pi java SE embedded oracle
event processing and again my name is
Hank Minh wang i'm from the java SE
embedded group from oracle and i've been
with the with java for a long time since
sun microsystems and working on Java ME
CDC and now on java SE embedded and just
by a show of hands could people tell me
how many people have heard or have
worked on the Raspberry Pi device great
okay so people have experience with that
and how many people have used java SE
embedded the embedded version of java SE
okay so we'll concentrate on making sure
people understand that and finally how
many people have used or heard of or
acquainted with oracle event processing
okay so i'll make sure to cover mostly
the details of the the two areas that
you might not be as familiar with as an
audience and so this is our general
disclaimer that we put up for oracle
don't trust anything you see on the
slides it's pretty much it and that for
the agenda today we're going to cover
first introduction to the Raspberry Pi
which as audience you seem to be aware
of that so I'll just touch upon that
briefly then we'll go into the
introduction to java SE embedded and
i'll give more details on that and why
that's advantageous now to run on these
types of devices like the Raspberry Pi
and then I'll go into the introduction
and give as much detail as possible in
this short amount of time about oracle
event processing and that in itself is a
one week course about how to fully
utilize something like oracle event
processing but i'll give you the
overview so that you understand how this
is introduced in the combination of java
SE embedded in a raspberry pi and then
finally we'll go over the use case which
is collecting real-time data real-time
enterprise data using that combination
of those three components
and then I'll give it code examples of
how that's used again though if you
really want to get into the nitty-gritty
of a oracle event processing and java SE
programming on these type of arm devices
then you'll you'll need to dig deeper
i'll just give you the introduction here
so that you'll get an understanding and
point you in the right direction of
where to find more details and then
finally I'll wrap it up with a summary
and this is a fairly small crowd so feel
free to interrupt me with questions
along the way it is being recorded both
the slides and audio so there's no Mike
out here so if someone does have a
question I'll just repeat it for the
microphone so the introduction of
raspberry pi most of you in the audience
have seen these devices it's a small
target board that has an ARM processor
on it that allows people to do
development for embedded devices and it
the background is it's a popular
electronic hobbyist device first
introduced in the UK by the raspberry pi
foundation and also their goal
originally was to stimulate learning and
teaching of computer science to school
kids but what everybody found out it's a
great and expect inexpensive way to
prototype and develop embedded
applications just because it's it's only
thirty-five dollars you can find it now
it's readily available online and for
purchase and they ship anywhere in the
world and it's a great way to run your
java applications you don't have to just
run c native or linux applications which
it comes shipped with but you could put
your own version of java that's free to
download from oracle and be able to run
embedded applications using java
programming and this is the typical
speck of a raspberry pi and so there are
other devices that are long the similar
line but the price point of $35 just is
this great for what you get 700
megahertz arm b6 chip and it does have
video core and opengl
es for doing 3d graphics along with 512k
512 megaman and hdmi with the composite
video core and sound but what we're
doing here is we're going to concentrate
on the embedded part of Java which is
headless so there is no graphics
involved in the talk i'm giving but
there is full video capabilities on that
raspberry pi and then there's USB ports
there's MMC sdio and of course ethernet
so that you can have that networking
that you would need for for running java
SE embedded and fully utilizing
something like oh AP which is the oracle
event processing and then on a low level
for connecting up with sensors and other
peripherals there's GPIO you are i
squared c and spi and this lets you
connect any type of electronic device to
the Raspberry Pi itself and have java
and oep interact with those type of
sensors and devices very low power 3.5
watts at 5 volts and again it's $35 plus
shipping there are two models you get a
rev a that has just one USB port and so
you need a serial line to talk to it but
then there's no Ethernet on the reveille
under and that's a little bit cheaper
that's $25 then there's the model B and
the model becomes with ethernet along
with all the other features in the model
a and these are the places you guys
probably know there there was a shortage
of them a year and a half ago when it
was first introduced but now there's
plenty places to buy the Raspberry Pi
element 14.com allied elect com or newer
calm and those places will will readily
sell them to you and ship anywhere in
the world again this is this is being
recorded so you'll get a copy of the
slides at the end this and see these
URLs if you need them and also when you
have that raspberry pi you want to jump
right into it and do things like run job
and it's great to run Python and great
to run see native but if you want that
cross compatibility and a portability of
Java and being able to reuse code that
other developers on the web are showing
how to do and you yourself might have a
bunch of code that you've written in
Java already you don't want to relearn
or or rewrite any of that code you can
just compile it and run that same jar
file on your Raspberry Pi and to do that
you would need a Java VM right now
there's a hard float version of the Java
VM that's very popular at first we came
out with a soft float version of Java SE
forearm and that wasn't as popular
because people wanted to use floating
point to be as fast as possible which
meant accessing the hardware accelerated
floating point processor that's on the
Raspberry Pi and so we came out very
recently with java SE 7u40 and also my
example on the bottom uses JDK 8 early
access both are hard float enabled and
both we're finding a lot of chatter on
the web that this is what people using
the raspberry pi prefer to use a hard
float version so on my blog at blogs
oracle com / shinkman you'll see an
entry it's a quickie start guide of how
to get java java SE with hard float
enabled onto your device and i'll go
through the steps here it's not that
complicated it's just that when you
first start out you need to image an SD
card that you plug into the Raspberry Pi
so that it boots and you can use either
win32 disk imager or you can do a pseudo
DD on a Mac or Linux PC and on that host
system you would want to burn the image
at the second link there the raspbian
weezy image and that one is the most
recent one I've seen that has hard float
enabled in the operating system in the
linux kernel so you need to first make
sure you have that linux kernel for your
Raspberry Pi and then once you have that
on your SD card and burned it in you can
plug it into your resume
beep I and boot it up and then you also
need the Java part to layer on top of
your linux kernel so here's a URL that
that I put for the JDK 8 early access
and that has a version that's meant for
Linux arm and that is hard float enabled
so you just click on the link or go to
that URL and you'll be able to see that
there's a hard float version that we
provide for free download and then in my
blog I explain the steps you would just
copy that tar bundle over to your
Raspberry Pi and then you would do you
would untie it and move it to a place
like user local Java you don't have to
put it there but that's very common to
do so that you can have it in your path
and just add it to your past in your dot
profile or your etsy profile so that you
can have it all the time on your command
line and then test it by just saying
java space dash version and user to see
it give either 7u40 or the JDK 8 early
access as the output line for the status
the the fun part if you get to jdk 8 is
this a full GT kate that's on your
Raspberry Pi so on this little tiny card
you have the Java C compiler you have a
full environment to do development it's
it's it's not the best place to do
development just because your headless
so you you're normally SSH into the
device or telnet into device and you're
typing on the console window so you
could if you wanted to just Network it
up onto hub and use a host PC to ssh or
telnet into it and then go ahead and
type in the VI or cat to helloworld dot
java file a system dot print line hello
world you're able to do the second line
from the bottom compile often on the
Raspberry Pi with our full JDK so you
say Java Sea helloworld dot java and
then just say Java CP for the classpath
and pointed to your current directory in
say hello world and you'll get that
whole world that
that you'll be able to find is very
quick to to get up and running on your
device so that that's the Raspberry Pi
in Java SC why would you do that it's
because it's a proven and stable
environment that that runs everywhere it
runs on Windows PCs on the mac on Linux
and now on these little tiny devices and
it's got a huge developer base so if you
run into a brick wall and you have a
question usually you could just go on
the web and find the answer very quickly
so I found that very very easy when
you're when you're stuck to be able to
just tap into all that knowledge that
people have on Java and it's a place
where you can do rapid application
development where you just saw you can
choose Java Sea right on the Raspberry
Pi and it's fully object-oriented it
runs a virtual machine so that you get
that memory management that comes with
the Java VM you get portability
cross-platform yet multi-threaded
support which is good on on this type of
device and also multi-process multi-core
support on other arm chip CPUs that are
out there that have quad core or dual
core and then you also have that
security layer from Java and a
networking layer from Java that's very
convenient to access and and utilize and
it also implements the full java SE
specification i used to work on Java ME
CDC which was a subset and every time
you worked with CDC you have to try to
remember oh is this API in the CDC
foundation profilo or is it subset it
out so here you have the full java SE
api you don't have to switch gears and
try to remember if api is there or not
and then you can utilize your full set
of tools like NetBeans or eclipse and
not have the worry about that either
there's also in the implementation of
our version of java SE we have
optimizations so there's things that we
do to reduce the use of memory we also
have more optimized ways of utilizing
RAM and ROM so that the volatile RAM and
the storage space or
are are not used up all by our Java VM
and there's other runtime optimizations
in our implementation in embedded
devices you find java SE being used in
many industries so if if since this talk
is more enterprise oriented you see
things like these raspberry PI's used to
prototype smart and energy healthcare
and industrial automation devices and
this raspberry pi itself can be
installed into a kiosk so that's a lot
of this enterprise use not just
hobbyists trying to turn on and off LEDs
but actual commercial use of Java on
these devices and that's taken advantage
of the smaller memory and the low-power
CPU like the ARM chips that we're
talking about then you get that
networking and networking in Java go
hand-in-hand you have very easy to use
Java net URLs URL connection and HTTP
connection and all these web services
that you can utilize and normally a
device like this will have a wireless
connection in my demo i'm using a
ethernet hardwired connection which it
has a ethernet port on but there's the
SD card port and the USB ports on these
devices where you could put a Wi-Fi
adapter on it then you get that wireless
remote workings and functionality of the
Raspberry Pi you you do have a
limitation with graphics so most of the
time if you're going to embed it inside
a medical device or some type of smart
energy device it's going to be headless
so either that or it's very limited LCD
screen that's a very small screen so you
have to remember to account for that
when you're doing your Java embedded
programming for raspberry pi then you
also have limited input there might be a
touch screen or a keypad only and not a
full keyboard on these devices so as
long as you keep that in mind then you
can take advantage of this environment
that raspberry pi provides here are the
examples of those limitations even with
those limitations
you can do things like embed it into
telematics which is automobiles
dashboard or the control center of a
engine and there's a mid-tier phones
that also can run Java and it doesn't
have to be these full-blown smartphones
out there now but you can run Java also
on feature phones and then there's TV
set and set-top boxes and and blu-ray
players there's also readers and spark
plugs and voice over IP phones and
kiosks so all these types of devices are
what's best suited for java SE embedded
and being able to run your java programs
and collect enterprise data from all
these devices and here's your typical
diagram of where the java that we are
talking about java SE embedded falls on
the very bottom you see that the common
layer that you have among all the java
devices is the java language then you go
up a level and you see that you have
java card all the way on the right and
Java ME on the right they're meant for
vertical niches that you have for smart
cards or for those feature phones or for
TV blu-ray players included that's very
niche and vertically oriented types of
AP is that you have for those certain
industries what we try to provide if you
move over more to the left is we provide
java SE for embedded in the middle there
that's a small version of java SE and
that's a general-purpose platform it's
not just specific to TV not just
specific to feature phones so that's
what we're trying to do is is allow you
to run on the Raspberry Pi any type of
applications if it's smart energy if
it's health care if it's whatever
enterprise that you want that's going to
have all the api's that you're going to
need for for running your program then
let's go over the best practices you
would use on the Raspberry Pi you would
want to manage your limited amount of
memory so what you do to watch for that
is especially look at your static
initializers in your static initializers
make sure you're
grabbing huge buffers and allocating
huge amounts of memory because you're
going to do that every single time that
you start up your application instead we
found if you do lazy memory allocation
where you only allocate and create your
objects when needed then that's much
much better when you're running on these
small devices and also you want to limit
your static footprint too so we look
into things like ahead of time
compilation and provide that as
technology for the Java VM that you get
with java SE embedded it's just a way of
pruning off any classes or objects that
you're not going to use and just have a
jar file that has the classes that you
will want to use already compiled into
your machine language or intermediate
language so that it's a faster startup
time and then you want to limit your use
of threads even though it's there for
multi-threading purposes it does take a
fair amount of memory away from your RAM
so you have to watch what you're doing
with your multi-threaded applications
and then you also want to make sure you
remember you're on a low powered CPU so
these arm devices are the typical ones
just like the Raspberry Pi and you don't
want to spin a lot of CPU cycle it's
just because if it's on battery it would
take up all the battery power and you'd
run out of the battery a lot more quick
than you would if you limit your CPU
cycles like polling or looping in a
tight loop that doesn't do anything so
now let's switch gears here let's talk
about Oracle event processing or oep oep
has a version that's meant for Java
embedded so it can run on a Raspberry Pi
normally when when you go over to
moscone center and you sit in on the
sessions for Oracle event processing oep
talks about running on these big huge
servers exalogic servers that are in a
data center and it's very powerful it's
able to do all kinds of predictive
analysis and all kinds of correlation
and all kinds of algorithms that you can
run on huge huge amounts of data
terabytes in
terabytes of data you can find patterns
and you can find all kinds of
interesting trends in your data that you
would never find by just looking at it
or a human ever looking through it just
because of the amount of data but what
we are figuring out is these devices now
are are generating data themselves even
a kiosk or something in a car in a truck
it's going to track your GPS coordinates
it's got huge amounts of data telemetry
data it's got sensor data that could be
light sensors or motion sensors all that
data it has a wealth of a value to it if
you're going to run some analytics on it
and the analytics that oep can do for
you is something that's been moved down
from the server onto the small devices
instead where it's closer to all the
data plus you don't have to do all that
network traffic back and forth to the
the back-end data center so you can
build applications to filter correlate
and process events in real time on the
device instead of having to wait for for
the exalogic server to process all your
events but it does allow all these
downstream apps and downstream apps
might be in that exalogic server running
data center business analytics to
process the same data that you get from
your embedded devices as long as you
filter and say hey these are the
interesting data points that I'm going
to send to the data center now and it
does this with a performance with high
level of performance high level of
reliability just because oep has been
around forever and they were able to to
shrink down the necessary parts for for
small devices like the Raspberry Pi so
now again it's the Internet of Things
that's driving this big data now on
these small devices to not just the
back-end data center and it's driving
demand to collect and process data on
the embedded device this allows for
processing of the streaming real-time
data that's happening so if your truck
is driving around town
and it's in real time process it's
producing all this GPS coordinates right
there on the device you could be taking
it as a real time stream and saying oh
the next left is where you want to go so
that you can go up the highway so that
you can go to your next route so that
allows for things like satellites which
need real-time data analysis factory
automation where you have a fast moving
assembly line that also does that
military use transportation and
logistics as I talked about there's all
that GPS coordinate type of data being
generated on the fly on on those devices
that would take advantage of the
processing of real-time data and oep
supports event-driven architectures so
the architecture itself is a listener
and event publish-subscribe type of
model where you don't have to write
rewrite everything drivers and and and
your own event listeners to do
everything you just plug into the event
listeners that are already existing and
adapters that already exist in OE p and
you're able to program very quickly and
rapidly deploy and develop your
applications that would be doing
real-time data analysis also you can
integrate your legacy system so if you
have fusion middleware so that got the
guys over in moscone center they they
run these legacy server applications
that are very useful run all kinds of
business intelligence analytics you can
still use that along with all these new
devices that are out there so just plug
in all these Internet of Things types of
sensors and actuators and and motion
detectors you just feed that up to your
existing database and feed that up to
your middle where that you already have
in your data center so I know this is a
lot to throw at you at once with oep but
just if there's any questions that along
the way here let me know just because
I'm trying to give you a broad overview
of it
and I know there's a lot of details that
you might want to take some time outside
of this session and look into after
afterward that that might interest you
so that the places that you could run
oep now oep for job-embedded include two
types of stacks where you would have
linux arm like the Raspberry Pi the
Linux arm b6 and b7 are the typical
types of target boards where you can run
oep and job-embedded sweet and java SE
embedded and then you also have on the
right column x86 where you also have
linux run what you find in common is
that the operating system kernel linux
2.6 or higher is found on most of these
type of devices nowadays and also glibc
29 or higher and that's the common at
least that's the minimal type of kernel
and library that you want to be able to
run then for floating-point as we talked
about there's a vector floating point
vfp and hard float enabled support and
you find different boards have different
variations of that support so you have
to meet whatever your requirement is
with whatever devices are out there and
then the RAM typically now is 256 meg
for Java to use and this is incredible
because you know pcs just 10 years ago
were shipped with less than that and
also rom flash and disk you would need
about 128 makes for Java just because
there's all the libraries and and the vm
would need some space and then you would
need other space for your application to
be stored now here's a diagram of what
I've been telling in general about oep
it can take on the left hand side edge
devices such as sensors very very low
level microcontrollers that have just
electronics for these sensors hooked up
to it like in the picture you see smart
meters and the smart meters all they
generate is how many kilowatt hours
you're using at that time and the
kilowatt hours and that'd be could be
talking a very simple local protocol
like zigbee and maybe that goes 20 feet
and that's all that type of data can be
fed nearby to a Java embedded device and
in the middle there you see it's a
gateway or a concentrator or aggregator
so there's all these different names but
what it is is really a Raspberry Pi type
of device that's sitting on a telephone
pole that's sitting in your house in
your router or in your cable modem or in
your blu-ray player or on your TV that
type of device has some capability like
having an ARM chip that's a v6 or higher
that can process all this data from all
these devices that are local to the
house or to the the hospital or to a
factory floor it can take that within a
hundred meter area that that type of
data and process it so you don't want to
send everything to the back-end data
center but these gateway devices can
take that data and do the first level
filtering and try to figure out what's
important what's what can get thrown
away so in the middle there you have
this funnel where you can filter out the
noise on these gateway devices like Java
embedded running on these devices like a
raspberry pi and then finally on the
very right hand side that's your data
center so it's important not to flood
your network it's important to utilize
your network in the best way possible so
only send the very very important
messages to your data center so it might
be hey there's a burglar that just broke
into the house now you know send a SMS
text message and call the police to come
to your house that's the type of message
you want to give to the data center not
that the wind blew a tree leaf against a
window that's something that you can
filter out in your gateway device and
and treat differently but that that data
center can take all this data from all
these different gateways and
concentrators among the neighborhood and
be able to spot trends that way too so
if they see that everybody in the
neighborhood is turning on their AC
because it's a hot day they can at PG&amp;amp;E
at the utility company list
the company be able to adjust their
their supply of electricity according to
the real-time data that's being fed
eventually to the data center from all
these gateway devices so the gateways
are responsible for their local area and
being able to process data there but
then the data center has a different set
of responsibilities of taking entire
neighborhood entire city entire country
worth of data and be able to crunch on
that data instead so any questions about
this this is just multi-tier programming
that you can break it up and run Java on
all the tears and so what do you do
specifically with oep to process this
real-time data well they do what's
called joining you can join incoming
streams or data that's coming right now
from a sensor like a motion sensor and
pair it up with persistent data so maybe
30 days ago you started running this
gateway it's collecting 30 days worth of
data into its local database so it knows
that it can it can read whenever it gets
windy then there's a branch that taps
against the window it's not really a
burglar trying to break in so it
compares hey I just sensed some type of
noise on a window does it compare
against every time the the leaf tapped
against the window and they can look
back and say hey I'm going to do a joint
to the persistent data on my database
and it looks exactly like that type of
event where a leaf tapped against the
window it's not somebody breaking into
the house so it doesn't need to send an
alarm so that's what it's doing it's
it's joining real-time data with the
database data that's that's on the
device then it can do things like
context-aware filtering correlation
aggregation and pattern matching and
this is the power of running oep on the
device it's doing this mini algorithm
that it can run to predict things
happening in your home on a factory
floor within respective of all your
trucks in a trucking company it can
learn as as it it runs on the device and
pick up patterns that are typical and at
any time that there's a there's a
abnormal type of event happening it can
send alert that hey I've just learned
over 30 days it typically the trucks are
driving in this pattern there's one
truck that's way out of its range and
you might want to take a look at that so
that's the power of OE p is being able
to do this context of where filtering
and and just event watching and pattern
matching so that you don't have to do it
as a human you can have a machine
watching for you and then there's
adapters that allow you to just plug in
something like a burglar alarm or window
sensor or some type of common device
that's out there now can very easily
integrate with oep because they use
typical event sources for sockets like
just a tcp/ip network socket for JMS or
java messaging service messages so if
you already have a system that does JMS
then it just plugs into 20 EP very
easily or even Java DB if you've been
producing all this table data on your
device it would just integrate in with
oep without any problem because there's
already Java DB adapters that are out
there and there's plenty of other
adapters and examples that you could
choose from you can go online and see
other people's it's examples to this is
leveraging all those developers that are
currently out there then what you want
to do is you want to capture analyze and
process that that data so that you can
anticipate opportunities or threats or
in other words you can predict that
something is wrong or something is going
to happen maybe there's a strange
vibration happening in a gear so you're
predicting that it's going to fail and
you're going to send out a service
technician to fix apart before it fails
saving you a lot of money so that's
where this predictive analysis really
has value on on the factory floor in
your home or in in a hospital and the
types of events that can happen
and are either correlated events or or
causal events and they're very different
the correlated events they could could
be happening one right after the other
so if event a happens then from historic
data event be almost always follows
within two seconds of it so if someone
walks in their house and they turn off
their dining room light within two
seconds they go to the living room and
turn it on so it's not that they're tied
together there's there's no causality
that every time that the dining room
light flicks that there's a string or
something that a pole that makes the the
living room light turn on it just so
happens that that that's a typical type
of event that hat are two types of
events that are tied together so even
though you shouldn't read into why
that's happening you should know that it
does happen a lot of times when the
homeowner turns off their dining room
light they turn on their living room
light the other type of event is causal
event which means that when something
happens like in the manufacturing
process on on your assembly line if
someone hits the stop button and stops
entire assembly line that will slip the
schedule of your shipment so there's
there's no ifs ands or buts it's always
going to happen that you hit the button
for stopping the the factory floor it's
going to cause your your shipment to be
delayed so that is a direct one-to-one
cork one-to-one happening that is tied
together if this happens then this other
event will happen because it must happen
so that's causal event what you can do
with oep is you don't have to care
whether it's correlation or whether
whether it's causal you don't need to
know the why of something of event be
happening because of event a you can
track both of these types of events and
you can do this with your inference
queries so we'll talk about that later
but you can generate downstream events
such as call the police if it's a
burglar alarm going off
or schedule your shipment to be late if
your factory floor somebody hits the
stop button so this is only when needed
so that you can combine this with your
upstream events so again don't send a
lot of noise over your network only send
very intelligent types of events and at
critical points and so that's the power
of what oap does any questions about
this okay so you know this is left as an
exercise for for everybody to look into
more of oep and for now I'm going to
show an example of this so that so maybe
as a concrete example you can you can
get a fair understanding of what we're
talking about here so in this code
example we're going to take a Java DV
table and this is represented just for
the slide here that there's a light
sensor in a house and that light sensor
is sensing the switch whether it's on or
off and over a course of three days from
September first September second
September third you can see the date in
in the middle column there that sensor
picked up that the homeowner turned on
the light or turned off the light and so
you can see that the string
representation that's on the right hand
corner a column is showing that that
action of either turning on or turning
off and so that's just your device your
Raspberry Pi or whatever hooked up to
your sensors and just reading in data
filling up your database with a bunch of
data that you don't know what's
happening there it's just recording it
maybe 30 days maybe 180 days maybe a
full year of data there's there's
something there's trends in that data
that you don't know about that you would
like to find out more about so what you
do is you can tie it to input events or
real-time events so in real time you're
getting your your light meter you have
light meters throughout your house since
what is the level of that light at a
certain time so today at seven-thirty
you notice that the light level is 25 so
it's low in the living
and then event number two says it's 28
all a sudden at 815 the light is turned
on so you've got real time real stream
of data coming in and you want to figure
out if that is something that was a
trend in your Java DB database and so
what you do is what they call a join and
the join results in this output the view
output that you see at the top here so
you join the database maybe it was 30
days of data along with what's happening
in real time right now and you can
figure out things like the
representation count there are things
that are happened that's very typical
and and it's only three days worth of
data here but you can see that there's
things that are sticking out with a
representation count of two that the
dining room light at seven thirty was
turned off and then the other
representation count of two you see at
eight fifteen the living room light was
turned on so it seems like there's
somebody moving through the house
turning off the dining room light
they're done with dinner and turning on
the living room light because they want
to watch TV for the evening and so
that's your analysis you're able to have
your final output your prediction as the
oep application is that at seven thirty
you could do this tomorrow for the
homeowner you can automatically turn off
the dining room light for them and then
at the 815 you automatically turn on the
living room light and you might be wrong
so he might be sitting in the dark
eating but but from the data from all
the correlation of the data you're
probably going to be right that it seems
like there's a trend going on and that's
what this oap software is doing is
spotting those trends and then making a
prediction for you so that's a very
simple type of code example here but
this is what it's doing it's taking
table of data it's taking real-time data
and then it joins it together to create
an output for you and your final output
is a prediction and I oh yes there's a
question here yes
yes so yes there's there's all the the
question was is there also a capability
of detecting absence of events within
that data and yes there's there's all
kinds of ways of creating and generating
your query and it is a query language
that they use for oep it's called cql
and you'll find that on a web there's so
many combinations and it's a whole
language within itself that you could
figure out with pattern matching with
expressions that they use in their query
language whether something is missing or
whether something is happening very very
often that is a trend and and you should
definitely read more about it because I
can't do it justice by by just talking
about it within our session but there
there's all kinds of training about how
to create those queries in their query
language any other questions yeah thats
cql is their their query language and
it's a course within itself that you
could you probably take an entire year
of courses on that now here here you
know I'm talking about cql here's the
example the see data that you see is put
into an XML file for oep to use and oep
is using this data by saying our stream
which means the real time stream is
going to select into your database so
it's it's doing your typical SQL call
into the database and then bowled you
can see that the pattern is searching
for is is something that starts with the
word light star so it's wild carding the
events that are called light as a prefix
it grabs all that that set of data from
your Java DB database and it grabs only
the the columns where it needs from the
table such as the sense of time and date
and and things like the event name so
this is just a query that's happening in
an xml code where your programming your
oep and then later on you want to
select for your your prediction the
sensor time so when will it be the best
time to flick off the switch in the
dining room and predict that it's safe
to do that and you do that by using a
processor view and that and in that
processor view you had that
representation count where if it's a
high representation count then you're
going to say oh that's going to be a
typical trend happening and so this is
just showing you how you would do a
query to try to do a prediction from
your data and then finally you want to
listen for that and in OE p you create a
stream sink or you create a listener and
in this case we have a light listener
class that implements stream sink inside
of there in a bold you see that if
you're getting an output event from oep
you should go ahead and print it out
that hey this is the prediction is to
switch off the light in the dining room
at this sensor time which was 730 from
the combined joining of the real time
data and the and the persistent data so
this is just a Java code that you would
use to talk to oep and say hey I want to
grab out for my java program now not
just programmed in with XML I want to
grab it to use in my application and use
these type of API calls to be able to
grab out that data for you from oep so I
know that this is kind of like a quick a
quick summary of what's going on but
there are a bunch of details i'm
skipping that you would have to read
more into and once you get started in 20
EP programming just to give you a little
flavor what's going on so in summary and
I do have a demo that over run through
to the Raspberry Pi is great for
prototyping prototyping enterprise type
of real-time applications and java SE is
great so that you can do it in a
language you're familiar with and OE p I
java SE embedded helps you collect and
process that real-time embedded data as
we showed in that home example and
collecting and processing real-time
enterprise data can be done with OE p
queries and you saw its complicated but
very powerful and i gave examples for
collecting that real-time data so i'm
going to switch over to my laptop here
and you'll see it I still have a yeah
you can still hear me on this microphone
you're going to see that um there's web
pages that i have here that you can also
see from the record recorded set of
slides and you can also search on the
web for this too there is the overview
of oracle event processing for java
embedded that you find at the URL at the
very top here is docs oracle com and we
have a lot of online documentation 40 f
either so what you can run through and
you see the section 111 1 dot 2 that's a
deeper introduction then i gave online
that you can see and there's also in
section 1 dot one dot 3 there's the
tools that you can use so you can do
everything in an ide so you could use
eclipse for instance to do all your
development and there's a nice
drag-and-drop type of visual editor that
you can use with oep instead of typing
line by line the XML so it's just one
way of doing the programming that I
found is easier just because the
representation is nice and Eclipse and
then you have what I'm going to demo
here is the first thing you would do is
configure your oep so i'm going to go on
to this is the raspberry pi actually so
you can see that if i do a you name- a
it's a little bit low but let me put it
up on the screen higher you can see
that's the raspberry pi there and let's
go ahead and look at these instructions
these instructions
say hey go ahead and fill out all this
XML those Java programmers we don't like
XML that much but you know it's kind of
a necessary evil so so there's a lot of
things that here that you can look at
offline about how to configure your oep
server know EP runs as a server it was
originally part of weblogic and part of
osgi implementation where it ran as a
bundle along with the weblogic
application server so it still has a lot
of that legacy where you you set it up
and you even see things like the be EA
name inside the configuration files
still what you do is you say what type
of server you want run and where you
want it to run so I did that over here
on the Raspberry Pi and you can see I
have the same XML file here and then I'm
going to go ahead and take that XML file
and I'll do this config SH command and
that's where you see it in instructions
you want to configure your device to run
oep just like it does in instructions
and I'll go ahead and do that so when I
do this it's going to report back that
the JRE i'm using jdk 7 is added to the
path and it's kind of turn away at it
and remember i'm going to hold up my
raspberry pi it's running the
configuration here in my hand and it's a
poor little you know arm chip it's not a
huge super computer that has a quad-core
25 way cpus on it so it does take a
while tip for it to turn out the
configuration that it needs and it does
take a while for it to start up the oep
also so that's just a heads up of what
to expect when you're using oep there's
a lot happening and it's a little tiny
board you can see the smoke coming out
of it it's trying hard but that's it's
done doing the configuration and if you
look in the directory for user projects
domains my domain that's how I set up
the
xml to to say hey configure it here
please for me you'll see that there is
called a start w lives SH file and
that's what starts up oep in the
configuration that you told it to just
now in the xml file so i'll do LS there
that is what you would run and that
would bring up using java SE embedded
and java embedded sweet oh you can't
really see it but that's that's in the
color on the screen here that's where
you would run the SH command and be able
to bring it up and this is all remember
this is all on your Raspberry Pi so
that's the it's just a short demo of how
you would run it and then it's available
while it's running for your java
application to query and say hey can you
give me the predicted time that i should
turn on the light in a living room so
that that was going back to the example
that i use is that server is now able to
either communicate with the data center
or to communicate with your on device
java application that wants to learn
about the data that you're collecting
all right so any questions about that ok
so there's other web pages out there
about oracle event processing about how
to use java with it and the job ap is
and here's an interesting diagram also
on the adapters that would talk to your
devices on the left hand side and the
processing that happens inside oep
server that's running on the Raspberry
Pi and then it talking back to your data
center or other applications and I'm
going to go back to the slides and then
I'll open it up now for any questions
you can ask any questions including
Raspberry Pi questions or java SE
embedded questions or back to OE p what
we covered here yes
the compilation for Josie so the
question was what's the tool for doing
ahead of time compilation in java SE in
our implementation of jdk 8 there will
be a tool and instructions on how to use
that tool to do ahead of time
compilation so you have to keep watching
what we're doing with the early access
version for now and then eventually in
the future will release jdk 8 forearm
that will do that ahead of time
compilation specifically for ARM chips
or for x86 depending on on which ones we
finally ship on but do you have specific
questions on on a OT on ahead of time
compilation yes
yes yes it does yes uh yes class loading
yes it's it's all related yes good
question so with aot technology does
that also still do class loading or is
that skipping the step in and helping
you with initialization it's skipping
that step because then it wants it to be
already warmed up and in a form that's
already in in the VMS view it's been
jaded already so you're really getting
ahead of time and presenting that data
as if it had been loaded and initialized
and all the static initializers I've
been run and and it's ready to go so yes
yes so so in general the question was
should it start up much faster yes that
and not only that will it start up much
faster but during the process of ahead
of time compilation you can figure out
with a transitive closure graph that
there's a bunch of classes you're not
going to need to ahead of time compile
so just throw them away and just do the
head have ahead of time compilation on
things that are in your transitive
closure of classes that you need okay
yes so so there's two concepts there of
removing classes that are not needed and
that's correct it's not really i think i
use the term stripping the jar down but
it's not really outputting a jar file
anymore because it's an intermediate
language or it's the machine language
that you're going to represent for ahead
of time compilation so there there is no
output of a jar but it does do the
stripping so that you're only going to
have the machine code needed for the
classes that you'll use
right so so the question was that's
right so the question was in relation to
footprints since you want to shrink it
down you don't have to ship a jar file
with everything you might need is it's
just ahead of time compiled with
everything you do need and that's that's
correct but in a way it's it's also a
corner you use so that you only have
those classes and you cannot be flexible
where if something gets downloaded or
something gets deserialized it might
have problems because it won't find
other dependencies that you didn't know
about during a ot compilation so yes so
it's a double-edged sword that you do
lock down your application and you you
have to know ahead of time that you
don't want it to be flexible we're a
normal general-purpose vm has to have
all the api's available in the specs so
that any possible application can run if
you know that your device will only run
one application then it's a perfect use
case for ahead of time compilation yes
any other questions yes in the back
oh that's a great question I I'm not an
expert in OE p but the question was when
I EP bird produces a prediction or some
type of analysis does it have a
confidence level associated with that I
don't know about it oh it doesn't so I
thought there's there's someone that
knows oh if you much better than i do
then then i would assume that you would
you would track it yourself and you
would try to figure out algorithmically
whether you have your your confidence
level okay so so the the answer out from
the audience is that you would use
regular expressions to do that pattern
matching but there's no associated
confidence level with that and you might
have you know something that you're
tracking on a side i would assume that
the if that pattern does match then you
know ahead of time that there's some
level of confidence that that you would
tag on to it as metadata so you know but
you know maybe you can look into it as
as something that you would track on the
side yes another question
great question I think I understood it
that you're you're asking does it need
to be connected to the network all the
time or can it just run standalone
disconnected from the network and and
sending it with OE piece ending to the
back-end data center okay so no it
doesn't need to have a connection all
the time to the back-end data center oep
when you're running it I should have
been more clear even though it's called
a server it's running as a background
process on your Raspberry Pi for
instance and other applications that
also run on your Raspberry Pi would talk
to it so you can unplug it from Wi-Fi
you can unplug it from the network it's
still going to talk all the applications
can talk to the OE p that's running on
your device and get all the analytics
that's that's happening on ODP so the
answer to your question is you don't
need to go to data center to do all that
oep processing you can talk from an
application run running on Raspberry Pi
to the oep background demon running on a
Raspberry Pi all that information going
back and forth without a network
connection so I know that the concept is
kind of strange because okay oh right
right so a store is the question was is
there some type of store and forward
mechanism so that when a network
connection does show up that it goes
ahead and pushes that out there's a way
to do that I'm not familiar enough to
know exactly how to do that because I
know JMS the java messaging service
would do that for you with a queue that
you can have running on the device and
then have it have it forward on but
there's probably other implementations
you can use also but that would be
dependent on your implementation of how
you would set it up yourself other
questions
I believe it's the same thing as with
all oracle software it's free to
download and develop but not to deploy
so I hope I get that right is is that
you can freely download it okay I feel
uncomfortable de koning prices but but
yes it's a low price whatever it is yes
for open standards is a low price so so
feel free to download it and try it out
it's there for you two guys to test on
the Raspberry Pi and kick the tires and
then come to oracle when you're ready to
deploy on your device and i think that's
that's all the time we have but are
there any other questions or you can
come up after the sessions over and you
can also ask me too but that concludes
our session so thank you very much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
