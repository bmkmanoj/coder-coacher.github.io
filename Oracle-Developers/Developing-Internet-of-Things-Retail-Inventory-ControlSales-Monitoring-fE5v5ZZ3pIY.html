Wong and this session is developing
Internet of Things retail inventory
control and sales monitoring and I'm
from Oracle I'm in the IOT group so I'll
be focusing in on the Internet of Things
and how Java applies especially
job-embedded applies to the retail space
and things you can do such as inventory
control and here's our safe harbor
statement and just a show of hands how
many were at the 8:30 tutorial this
morning on Internet of Things and using
auto join no okay that's fine oh you
were at so we're gonna cover some things
I'll I'll try to gauge if you want to
cover more or less of some things that
I'll repeat from this morning session
but it's a small crowd so you guys can
just stop me along the way and just tell
me if I'm going too fast too slow or if
you have any questions on any of the
materials here's the program agenda I'll
be going over first introduction to
Internet of Things and how it's being
used right now in the market then I'm
going to focus on the retail inventory
use case and how IOT is can be used and
especially used with Java in that space
and that's that's a pretty interesting
use case because if you walk into the
mall nowadays you could see retail
stores and they can directly use
Internet of Things right now instead of
all these theories of in the future
somebody's home is going to be a smart
home that that's something that's not
catching on as much but this inventory
control and and you'll see later on in
the slides recommendations and
suggestions that you can do with
Internet of Things has a lot of
potential for the retail space and then
I'll give a specific example using RFID
tags what you can do for the retail
space with IOT and then finally tying
that to the cloud so at Oracle we
support the the idea of using your
devices such as RFID readers and and
your inventory at your
store and send it all the way back to
your data center or the cloud so that
all that data can be managed in in a
very efficient manner and they could be
managed with cloud services instead of
your normal data center which is very
costly to run locally at your own office
or your own headquarters you can lease
this instead in the cloud and then
finally we'll go through some code
samples because this is Java one we'll
go through some Java examples of how
using a raspberry pi of an example
raspberry pi here and Java can be
applied to the retail space and just
says a update there's a URL here if you
go to java.net slash projects slash
Orbitz /pages slash
the code samples there and this set a
slide so you could get the most
up-to-date slides there and any
materials that you might need that come
up during the questions and answers
session at the end of this presentation
so the first agenda item is the
introduction to Internet of Things the
Internet of Things is the next horizon
so you've heard in the past at Sun
Microsystems and now at Oracle that the
network is the computer well what's on
the horizon now is network connectivity
of devices sensors and appliances the
Internet of Things makes the network
even more robust even more valuable so
that the network is the computer plus it
has sensors and actuators and devices
hooked up to it now so that's what the
Internet of Things is moving us into a
new direction a new horizon for
technology and here's that horizon the
Internet of Things has these
characteristics it's always on it's
always connected so there's the Internet
and being able to talk to a cloud and
being able to talk to those services in
your cloud and then it's all about
sensors and user controls now it's not
just about PCs pcs or
very old hat now and old-school you want
your sensors and your actuators and your
devices to be able to feed that data
into the cloud and you have smart
appliances everywhere so it's not just
your washing machine and your your dryer
and your dishwasher anymore it's a smart
washer a smart dryer smart dishwasher
and those devices now are connected to
your iPhone and your Android phone and
they're able to be controlled remotely
and they're able to be monitored
remotely too so those devices now are
smart devices everywhere and also you
have your personal information at your
fingertips everybody's carrying around
their iPhones and Android phones and so
it knows that it's authenticating you as
you and you're able to see how your
watch is doing how your security cameras
are doing back home how your your system
is running at your company at your
fingertips now and not just having to
get on to a VPN connection on your
laptop or your PC so that representation
of data is now so much and so abundant
you need it
presented to you in a meaningful way so
that's what's on horizon also and a lot
of analysts are predicting that one
trillion Internet connected devices will
be around and on a network by 2025 so
it's definitely something that's
exploding right now the first use case
which we'll talk about is home
automation that's the one then I'm
saying is you know it's been talked
about for 10 or 15 years now with all
the way back in the days of x10 and
being able to hit a button on this
extant device and turn on and off lights
and even the clapper was something that
was more of a novelty than anything else
that's where things were and things are
still forming in the Internet of Things
space and you'll see things like
real-time pricing with adaptive
intelligence for Carbon Reduction as a
way of your utility company saying hey
if you want home automation you should
have a smart meter and that smart meter
will monitor if you use
your AC or your heater in such a way
that you could cut down on it at certain
times of the day when the rates are
lower then the internet-of-things use
case is that it automatically adjusts
and turns up the heat when the the price
is too high and then turns on your AC
when the prices are lower so that's a
way to save money and that's not the
best motivator instead of making money
and especially later on when I talk
about the retail use case is a better
motivator for Internet of Things than
just saving money saving money you can
only save so much and then you stop
there's the limit and another example of
home automation is automatic water usage
metering again especially in the drought
stricken area here in California you
have to watch what's happening with your
irrigation if there's a leak that
develops in your pipes you want to be
paged on your on your phone SMS text
message on your smart phone saying hey
you might want to check your water
because the meter is going crazy right
now again that's something for that's
preventative it's for saving money again
it's great as a it's it's fancy new
technology that can do this but it's
about saving money not making money and
making money is the bigger motivator and
then there's intrusion detection and
that's the biggest saving money is
saving your electronics or your jewelry
at home from burglaries if there is
someone that's trying to get in your
house again you get alerted on your
smart phone so that's another use case
for home automation and Internet of
Things and when you have that here's a
diagram of what's happening in your
house and and this is good to understand
so that we can apply it inside a retail
store is that normally you have
different sensors in the case of your
house you have your smart meter that's
meant that's monitoring your energy
usage you have smart appliances of when
they're running like the AC is running
you have a smart thermostat to gauge
what the temperature is or you have your
Tesla or your your hybrid Prius sitting
in the garage and it's monitoring is
char
so that all that data gets fed into the
middle there which is the home gateway
and your home gateway can be a Wi-Fi
router it could be a TV set-top box it
could be your PlayStation game console
it could be somewhere where it's
collecting all this data and send it
back to the data center so that all
those sensors need to register with that
gateway and use it as a concentrator of
all that data so it gets all aggregated
together and then it's sent to the
right-hand side here and the right-hand
side is showing things like the utility
company the electric company might want
to watch for how to bill you and so you
have real-time online way of seeing how
much energy you're using appliance
company might see that there is a weird
vibration happening in your washing
machine so it's going to set out a
service technician automatically to
change out a belt so that's one way that
a preventative way of doing that that
type of IOT service without you having
to to touch anything or have a service
technician come out ahead of time and
then a security company might also tap
into that Internet of Things data if
they want to monitor against burglaries
someone's tapping out a window and maybe
trying to get in so they're gonna send a
patrol car to come around your house and
just check it out so all that is being
done by the focus on the Gateway as
something that can run rule sets and
triggers and events that could happen
based on certain events that are read by
those sensors so that concept of the
home automation can be taken and applied
to other use cases and let's first dive
into what is the difference of IOT
development versus regular software
development well the the devices that I
just listed in the previous slide there
are so many types of devices out there
it's not just three computers like a
Windows PC a Mac PC and a Mac laptop and
a Linux PC there are many many different
dozens of Linux distros of operating
system
of CPUs of platforms that you have to
use before you can hook up all these
sensors and devices to your network so
that variety of devices is a big problem
when you're developing with Internet of
Things there's I'm sorry there's a
volume of devices and the volume of
devices is just you can have so many of
these devices hooked up to your house
all of your windows all your doors
throughout your garage that you might
lose track of all of those different
devices and then there's no human
control a lot of times your washing
machine is just going to talk to a data
center that's at the appliance company
and it's critical in nature so you want
to get notified right away if someone's
trying to break into your house there's
information privacy which is a bigger
concern for retail if you're going to
have people pay for items and be
shopping in your store you want to make
sure that data is private it's not the
NSA that's saying hey why is that person
buying a pair of jeans it's all your
data and you should be able to keep that
private
and then there's limited functionality
these devices are it would be too
expensive to put a huge CPU on every
single one of these sensors that are
throughout your house or throughout your
retail store so it's going to have
limited types of functionalities and
limited ways of running software they're
low powered normally and they're hard to
reach and there's a long device life
cycle you don't just update and do a
windows update like you do every
fifteenth of the month they're there
there might be some type of device
that's tucked away that's measuring your
temperature that you don't want to touch
after you install it and so software
development must adapt to the Internet
of Things there's a complexity of
development of integration of a
maintenance and that involves all those
CPUs that I talked about on all those
different devices all the different
programming languages each device comes
out with their own SDK with their own
library it might be in C or C++ or
Python and each one of them have their
own operating system like a real-time
operating system maybe when River maybe
vertex maybe Mentor Graphics type of
operating system and then there's
proprietary API is already you have
silos forming with Google nests they
have their api's Apple health kit they
have their api's Belkin Wemo they have
theirs so they're not talking to each
other right now they don't want you to
use the others devices so they're gonna
keep this nice isolated silo for just
Google nest devices just Apple
healthcare health kit devices and just
Belkin Wemo devices they don't want to
play nice what Java does for you it's
forced them to play nice by putting a
Java abstraction layer on top of all
those different technologies and just
calling Java API s to each one so you
can have your Java apps talk to Wemo you
can have it talk to a health kit and
Apple and Google Nest and you don't have
to deal with all the different varieties
of CPUs programming languages are Tufts
are tosses and proprietary API s so
that's what you want with Java and
embedded you want something that's
highly productive and you can develop
with it and you can deploy with it
especially with the jar files that you
can drop into your gateways and onto
your devices that's right once run
anywhere because of the virtualization
of that environment you get a platform
independent binary a class file or a jar
file that is running on all those
devices and you and you're here at Java
one so you're part of the nine million
plus developers that are around the
world that know how to program in Java
and that's the largest community of
programmers in history in the industry
and everything is open standard space
you know the Java community process you
know that where opens our open
standards-based and open to comments and
open to suggestions on our Java
specification requests so that means you
don't have a vendor lock-in you don't
have to go to Google and bow down to
them all the time and say oh I'll just
program to Google Nest or the same with
Apple or the same with any other company
out there this allows the even playing
field for all those different IOT
vendors and you can influence Chavez
future
as you know at JavaOne you can give your
feedback and say no that api is wrong
you need to change it to this try doing
that with Google tried doing that with
Apple and you'll you'll get deaf ears so
what you get is that Java bytecode
that's right right once run anywhere on
the right hand side you get running on
the Java Virtual Machine on top of arm
running on top of the java virtual
machine on x86 and you get all those
devices from java card all the way to
the the automobile - things like the
kindle and tablets and even your smart
meters so making java run on all those
addresses the problem that you saw with
the software development for IOT so
that's your gold box in the middle there
java is the common platform for all your
Internet of Things programming so you
stop re-implementing recompiling
rewriting your software over and over
again for Google nests for apple health
kit for Belkin Wemo and you start
scaling your code instead so that you're
developing from your device all the way
to cloud services and talking about
cloud services of course we're we're
part of Oracle as we present at JavaOne
and we're going to show that on the very
left hand side you see devices that's
the stuff that I talked about in the
home automation case it might be your
temperature sensors and your thermostats
connecting to your gateway that's the
that's a little the hexagon that's in
the middle there and then that goes to
the cloud through an protocol gateway
and then these red boxes that's Oracle
software of course running in your data
center or in the cloud and that's going
to do things like event processing data
management big data analytics watching
all that data and seeing if there's
trends integration and then spatial and
GIS for information systems around the
globe and then that feeds in over a
service bus for the Oracle software and
this is all the backend software that's
usually hidden in the cloud for you
there's customer relationship management
there's
services and billing there's external
systems if you just want to be industry
specific maybe just health care or just
automotive or just retail those types of
services will run in the back end and
they might be doing your inventory
control maybe there's a headquarters at
Walmart that says okay I'm going to ship
out these inventory replacements when I
know it's running too low at certain
stores that's where you would control
your delivery from your warehouse out to
all your stores is some type of industry
solution for retail so any any questions
on this is the the big picture of
getting from the devices all the way
back to the data center or the cloud if
that's your data center and so you're
going to enable your products and
services across different market
segments including letting you have
wireless modules on different devices or
in our case it might be on your store
shelves gateways might be sitting in
your store back room where they they
have a Wi-Fi router and then your
gateway sits there and and collects all
the data that's coming from your store
and then there's industrial control and
telemetry that's more for the sensors
that you might find on a factory floor
or in your car that might be taking
temperature readings and and different
pressure readings so that might not
apply as much in the retail space for
smart meters and smart sensors that's
for controlling power and monitoring
power in the medical use case there's a
health and telehealth so you might have
different sensors inside your home when
you're sent home from the hospital that
might still take your vital readings or
your heart rate your blood pressure your
weight and feed that back to the
hospital so that you can go home earlier
and then there's general internet of
things machine to machine solutions and
that that's where retail Falls is that
the machines that are running inside
your store might talk to the machines
and you're in your headquarters back
office and so that's where we'll dive in
deeper is
use case for retail and that's next on
our agenda so let's give an example of
RFID and I have an armored fight I don't
know I think I'm statically charged or
something so here's a RFID reader
connected to a Raspberry Pi and a
Raspberry Pi how many people know or use
a Raspberry Pi good so the Raspberry Pi
has on it a distro of Linux called
raspbian raspbian wheezy raspbian wheezy
comes pre-installed with java and i'll
talk about that later later and you can
use Java to access things like the USB
port to talk to devices like this is a
parallax rfid reader and it's just meant
for near-field types of communication
with the RFID tag I have some examples
of RFID tags you might have this on the
price tag of your your retail items in
your store or you might have just a
payment card for a coupon redemption
that a customer comes in or you might
have a circular type of tag that's
somewhere hidden on your asset in your
retail stores and once it comes close
enough to the antenna then that antenna
is able to read it and and the great
part about RFID is it's able to read all
the devices all at once you don't have
to one by one scan them like you see at
the Safeway or at a grocery store where
they're trying to scan something
optically on a barcode reader instead
RFID lets you say all at once give me
everything that's on the shelf and you
get all the RFID tags all at once so
using a Raspberry Pi is a great way to
do prototyping and so in this use case
let's give an example with the picture
on the right here there's a store shelf
and you put antennas on each one of
those shelves so you can do this inside
your retail stores you can do this in
the back stockroom that you you keep
track of everything that's in inside
your inventory on stock too and you can
do this for example in the retail space
there's pharmacies where you keep track
of
single drug and that's very important
for especially when FDA is concerned and
and the law enforcement is concerned
about monitoring all these different
pharmaceuticals and then there's the
warehouse if you have just a huge
warehouse of all these thousands of
items you don't want humans to go one by
one checking off whether there's the
right amount of items on that shelf you
want to be able to read it all at once
with your RFID reader and so how does
that work well on the diagram we're just
concentrating when you saw the big
picture we're just concentrating on RFID
readers which are the red circles and
then the Gateway which is that hexagon
in the middle there and then talking to
some type of network and then we'll stop
there because if you're a store owner
that's really what you're concerned
about you're concerned about all the
different RFID readers that your RFID
readers that you would have to put on
your star store shelves and then what
type of Gateway would you have to put in
your store also and then you're gonna
worry about the connection to your
headquarters and later because then it
goes out to the internet and
authenticates itself encrypts all that
data and you'll you'll set that up later
but the RFID readers and antennas again
they sit on your shelves and just read
those RFID tags all at once and all
those assets have to be tagged but only
tagged once and then the Gateway
transfers that data to the cloud so
that's the general three steps that
you're doing when you're applying IOT to
your retail case and here's another
example beside RFID tags you can use
what's called Bluetooth eye beacons and
this is really interesting because this
is brand new technology
Apple came out with that standard first
and they said hey we want to promote
Bluetooth being used instead of RFID
because the the location you can get
from a signal that's active thatthat
says hey here's a
that's placed inside my store in the in
the jeans the blue jeans section and
here's another beacon that's placed in
the shirts section that type of beacon
is more active than just the passive
RFID tag and so that standard has been
taken by different companies there's one
company called esta mode which is a
really cool company that's creating
their own beacons and it's based on this
eye beacon standard so right now there's
Android applications and both Apple and
Google are supporting being able to use
Bluetooth to talk to these Bluetooth
low-energy
beacon devices and what they have in
them on the top here on the right hand
side you see what's called esta mote
beacons and they have an ARM processor
on them arm m0 cortex Bluetooth Low
Energy so it's not using very much
battery power at all it's got sensors on
it it's got a motion and temperature
sensor and then it's got a battery
inside of it and it's sealed up so you
use it once for three years when it runs
out you take it throw it away and you
put a new one on your store shelf and
that'll run you a long time for those
three years but if you don't want
something that bulky actually it's about
2 inches by 1 inch and it sits up about
one inch so it's kind of they try to
make it a fun shape but but still it's
it's not the smallest thing and if
you're putting around your stores you
kind of have to hide them so you know
people don't just walk off with them so
there's a sticker on the back that you
peel off and then you could put them in
different areas so that you can
determine your location within the store
by by using that Bluetooth signal they
just came out with esta mote stickers
and that's what you see on the bottom in
the right hand side and those stickers
can be placed on the price tag of
different items or it could be placed on
locations and inside your store so that
they can broadcast out signals and they
also have the arm m0 cortex
to throw energy motion and temperature
sensors so that's pretty cool in
addition to the location you'll get
whether someone has picked up an item
like a pair of blue jeans and is walking
around a store with it walked around the
store with it for 10 minutes and then
put it back so later on when you do big
data analytics you're gonna ask yourself
well why did 20% of the customers pick
up a pair of blue jeans walking around a
store and put it back without buying it
that's a great use case for you to study
and in a retail industry to say hey
maybe I could knock off 20% on those
blue jeans when that person is walking
around with it that way that person has
more tendency to buy it than just put it
back on your shelf so already you know
things that make it smaller make these
Bluetooth ibeacon smaller have great use
cases and great potential for the retail
space any questions about this ibeacons
okay so here's let's go through those
those use cases of what I was talking
about a little deeper dive into it those
are small wireless sensors that you're
putting on to your price tags or odd to
different locations within your store
and you can attach it there and they
broadcast radio signals or Bluetooth
wireless signals to give your micro
location not not really your GPS
coordinates because the GPS coordinates
say you're in the Gap store or you're in
a clothing store or you're in
electronics store but this will tell you
you're in the blue jeans section or
you're in the shirt section or you're in
a sweater section so you get a micro
location and contextual awareness so you
could see the different people walking
around that store and as they're coming
closer to the store maybe they're
walking down the the main the main
alleyway of a shopping mall then you
want to try to entice them to come into
your store so there's a sensor that you
can happen when you're using an ibeacon
and the first thing is that you would
have to opt in to use these ibeacons
you say hey because there's a chance for
me to win a prize or to get a coupon I
am going to add that application to my
iPhone I'm going to go to Google Play
and put that application on my Android
phone once you have that that
application is running in a background
and it's tease these ibeacons and says
who this one is Starbucks and Starbucks
says hey right now if you go in you'll
get five dollars off a latte or right
now if you go in my clothing store
you're gonna get 20% off of a pair of
blue jeans
so there's proximity promotions that can
happen based on whether you walk past
the store because your phone is going to
pick up that Bluetooth signal or there
might be approximating coupons hey you
haven't visited this location so so
we're going to give you a special credit
to come in here and use $5 any way you
want and there's context recommendation
I think this is the cool this is if you
pick up those pair of blue jeans that
the use case that I talked about and
you're walking around with them and
you're walking around with it for 10
minutes there's a chance that you might
be indecisive about it
so you might get a 20% off coupon to say
hey if you buy a sweater that that
matches with this pair of blue jeans
we'll give you that 20% off and we'll
give you a buy one get one free of that
sweater and also in that flash is on
your phone and you become more aware
that hey you've been carrying around
these pair of blue jeans you really do
want it because now there's a promotion
that you can take advantage of and so
those recommendations yeah it's it's
it's a old-style way of getting more
sales that Amazon knows about at Netflix
knows about it's trying to suggest
something to you that from its big data
analytics has decided well there's a
good chance you're going to want to buy
this scarf because you're buying this
pair of jeans or you know how in Amazon
it says hey we recommend also this
because other users have also bought a
screen protector when they bought an
iPhone so it's going to say here's a
bunch of accessories you might be
interested
and as long as you targeted right and
don't give extraneous types of
suggestions and as long as they were
pretty much on target like Netflix also
does the same thing as when they make
recommendations they're trying to make
it accurate then your customer is going
to be happy hey I was going to buy this
sweater anyway so I'm getting a coupon
and the last thing is payment so with
this application running on your device
you can use the Apple pay or you could
use a Google near-field communication to
apply the payment and you don't even
have to take out your credit card so
these esta boat beacons it will tell you
which items do you have in your hand
which ones are you bringing up to the
counter I'll just charge you that on
your account you don't even have to sign
anything because I know who you are and
and now with the Apple iPhone you can
use your thumbprint for even more secure
way of doing payment so that no one else
can just walk around with your phone and
buy things so that's what we we saw in
this explanation of the use case I
talked about the shopper opps in with
the smartphone walks around with the
smartphone and those signals are it are
giving you location within the store
whether it's it's stronger or weaker as
you're moving from section to section
and it processes the data sends it
locally to your gateway for promotions
but also to the cloud so if someone
bought out the last pair of jeans off
your shelf then headquarters is going to
send you five more pairs of that same
thing because it knows you're out
so that's automatically done you don't
have to press a button you don't have to
get online you don't have to be the
manager of the store and keep track of
all that so that's what we do in in
terms of retail inventory in IOT and
what can be done for anyone that wants
to apply this type of Internet of Things
technology any questions about that okay
so using those simple using those RFID
tags is that is the use case that I'm
going to talk about because you could
with a Raspberry Pi and again this
parallax rfid reader is from Adafruit
if you go to adafruit.com I think there
was something like $35 so it's very
minimal that you could prototype in a
retail IOT solution and be able to show
and demonstrate to a customer hey this
works you could start a pilot project
with just a Raspberry Pi which costs $35
and with this rfid reader so you would
set up your Raspberry Pi and again if
you burn it with the raspbian OS that
comes with RasPi Raspberry Pi org then
you automatically get Java on it if you
have an older version of raspbian you
can do a sudo apt-get update and then
sudo apt-get install of the Oracle Java
8 JDK and it just works that you'll get
the correct one dot 8.0 version number
if you type in Java dash version and why
would you want to use Java 8 instead of
you know there might be an old version
of Java laying around that might run on
these devices well Java 8 has the new
programming language features such as
lambda expressions and if you haven't
checked it out there's plenty of lambda
sessions going on during Java 1 I highly
recommend it because it's just a cool
way and a great way of a shortcut of
doing programming when you're doing a
lot of coding and especially if you're
doing a lot of methods you don't want to
have to use the overhead of new classes
and new methods every time you want to
instantiate that lambda helps you do it
in a more compact format and do it in
line and then you have method references
and default methods which help you again
be more efficient in your programming
and there's annotations or repeating
annotations and type annotations and
that lets you annotate your code in a
faster way too and then finally we have
compact profiles in Java SC embedded
that allows you to shrink down your
platform to fit on these devices that we
were talking about
which have limited memory now and then
you could use a predefined subset of the
Java SE core set of libraries that way
if it's headless you don't need a WT you
don't need swing you just need java.lang
Java dot util java.net and you're off
and running so that helps you shrink
down your your footprint also and then
the Gateway that's going to run that
Java that might your Gateway might be
this $35 Raspberry Pi it's going to
onboard devices so it's going to find
all the different estimate ibeacons out
there and it's going to register them in
that gateway and it's going to manage
them so you you want the encryption you
want the security right off the bat you
don't want to have to think about
security as something that you tack on
later because security is very important
nowadays for privacy concerns protecting
against snooping protecting against
hackers and also protecting your payment
and your credit card information and
then you want to use your gateway also
to configure your devices if there's a
esta mote that has gone bad or the
battery we ran out you wanted to alert
and say hey you have to swap that out
and then you also use it for local
storage you can have a local database
since it's Java you can have Java DB
running on your raspberry pi keeping
track of your inventory keeping track
how many pairs of jeans you have how
many times did you recommend that
sweater and how many times did someone
go ahead and use the coupon for that
sweater and then you can use local
analytics you really want to drive up
your profits and this is a better
motivator than trying to save money
because you didn't turn off your light
in your living room that's you know a
home automation having an app on your
phone to turn on and off lights it's
kind of silly it's like you walk up you
turn on and off your light but this
having local analytics of trying to spot
trends of shoppers inside a store that's
where a lot of people make money Amazon
is a great example of being able to make
money because they make accurate
recommendations people buy more people
are happier because hey I never would
have thought to buy a screen protector
with my iPhone right now
I didn't know there was a 20% off that
was running they they're happier because
you give them promotions and you give
them rewards and give them coupons to
use and so if you look at this this is
also from the morning session is if you
look at how you would set up your your
gateway you would need a lookup service
and that lookup service would have a
Java VM running and have all your
devices be hooked up to it it might be
this RFID reader it might be the
ibeacons devices and then you need to
match that device with a client
application inside the client
application is a proxy which knows how
to talk to beacons which knows how to
talk to RFID readers and that proxy will
allow you to use a Java API to get the
values off your devices in a consistent
manner not having to learn about
ibeacons
learn about Apple health kit learn about
Google Nest
you just know there's a getter there's a
setter it's going to use a typical
enterprise javabeans if you want type an
interface and be able to get those
values that makes the programming much
easier
inside that gateway you have the lookup
service which is providing a
service-oriented a service object
oriented architecture or soo a and that
means it's going to locate the services
that your device needs your RFID reader
might need it or your estimates might
need it to run and it's going to look
that up through a lookup service once
that lookup service makes a match saying
I know what to do with this esta mote it
will boot up the the service that it
needs because the service has contacted
the lookup service either using a
unicast or when it actually has the
location of your well-known hub or your
gateway it will contact the lookup
service and say hey I'm available right
now I'm want to monitor all the jeans
purchases in your store and then there's
the client applications and those client
applications to look that you use the
lookup services to retrieve a
Boxey object to get that value off your
RFID tag or to get that value off your
eye beacons and so again we bring up the
big picture we're gonna just gonna
concentrate on that gateway which is a
hexagon in the middle at the left and
then there's the red dots which are
either RFID tags in our case or
Bluetooth beacons and we want to be able
to take that device data and send it all
the way up to the cloud so here's an
example of an RFID reader adapter being
able to say hey you just connected a USB
device it's the RFID reader and now
connecting up to the oracle storage is
pretty easy you just need a line to say
cloud storage config it goes in a new
cloud storage config object and that's
being done by the Oracle storage SDK and
then once you do that you just set your
service name which might be your store
your the gap and then your user name for
your store in your password of course
you don't want to expose this in your
application so you would encrypt this
and properly store it in a different
file location than hard-coding it here
but this is just for demonstration
purposes that your username and password
will get you into the service URL on the
Oracle cloud and be able to upload your
RFID data there and so once you do that
you get the storage you get your local
file which is what the f is the file
input stream is doing its opening up
your local data that's on your flash
locally on your gateway and then it
sends it up by calling the store object
on your connection my connection and
puts it in the folder called my
container and sends up the file that was
there already which is called iot-cloud
- RFID - data text and it's just for
this demonstration it's just text the
flat file that you're sending up you
could send up a database or you can set
up anything you want to the cloud
service that's how you would get your
data up to the cloud
where
big data analytics can happen to it and
and all those red boxes that you saw
before would take over
so now let's jump into some code samples
so this picture is the same thing as
what I have in my hand it's running the
RFID reader that's standing up you see
on the breadboard there and it has some
LED lights to indicate it's running okay
and the Raspberry Pi which is sitting in
a foreground there so your endpoint or
your RFID reader it will need to check
the device name which in this case is
called slash dev slash tty am a zero and
that's the manufacturer set up the the
USB configuration and the Linux driver
to be recognized that way when you plug
into this Linux distro it's it's Debian
based and it recognizes that USB ID and
so if you check that it exists you can
set that led to turn on by doing a write
GPIO on right there and then send it to
your board and that's how that LED would
turn on if someone thought all of a
sudden plugged in the RFID reader onto
your Raspberry Pi and then it would just
give you a lock message saying hey the
RFID reader was discovered and then it
can do that lookup service call so that
you can register it with your gateway
and then once you do that then you could
start using our XTX which is a serial
communication library and it's it's it's
like a sdk that you could use as
convenient way to open up a serial port
ID which again was because the
manufacturer picked this for the linux
driver slash dev slash tty ama 0 and
your you want to use this this open
source project and it's all written in
java as a library that you just drop
into your project and be able to get the
port identifier and be able to if you
want you could show it
such dialogue or in this case it would
just log an information message a text
message on your screen and be able to
read that comport give it a time out of
500 and just get log the the baud rate
that you're seeing just for
troubleshooting purposes so the real
meat of this set of of code is that you
set your port parameters which the
manufacturer in their in their
specification sheet says it's 2400 baud
and it's going to be eight one and none
for the the parity and the data bits and
then once you set all that you can open
up an input stream and so getting that
input stream waiting until it's ready
you can start reading the bytes off of
this device and every time I pass RFID
tag in front of it it's going to get a
new set of 12 bytes there's a 0 X 0 a is
a hex that's the start by 0d is the end
byte so that you know it's consistent
and it came came across correctly and
then you have 10 bytes in between and
that's the RFID so then you're able to
just take that the bytes that came in
and show it as a new string and then you
can compare it to your inventory list
that rfid represents a pair of size 8
genes and then you know you know they're
501 jeans that you keep in stock you map
those bytes to something in your store
so that's pretty straightforward that's
how you would use java this is all java
programming it's not that crazy python
programming that the Raspberry Pi has
and Adafruit has a bunch of libraries
written in Python this is Java code that
you never have to do J&amp;amp;I down a native
it's just doing the right things to
access everything through the file
handles and the way linux has set up
those the the drivers for the rfid
reader so any questions about that yes
this is implemented for the Raspberry Pi
yes who and when calls this method this
would be if you go back to the Gateway
you would have a gateway sitting in your
store and that would have wires that
would go to the shelves that might have
this RFID antenna on it and then that
Gateway would have an application that
would be running on it and that would
make the call
to grab the RFID tags that are on that
shelf or it might be sitting on your
counter someone has brought up and items
and put it in a pile on top of the
counter ready to checkout at the cashier
there's another antenna there that you
could run this read all the bytes there
and detect that there are three items
there's three pair of jeans there and
they cost 49 dollars each alright any
other questions yes okay so actually
this is the section for Q&amp;amp;A so if you
don't mind this is it we could go back
to this if anyone has questions about
the RFID tags but the question right now
is on the beacons and it was there
something specific about the beacons
that you wanted to know because it gets
very involved they have their own SDK
the architecture okay so the art
architecture of ibeacons is that it's an
active way of doing a signal where it's
sending out a regular regular periodic
radio signal that it broadcasts out just
like a beacon it just says I'm beacon
number one two three and it's a unique
ID you have a database that says well I
put beacon one two three in my gene
section so it also has a way when you're
running an application that knows how to
detect beacons to tell you how close you
are so the closer you are the big the
more the more powerful the signal is the
the bigger the value of that beacon will
will give you so
walk around with your smartphone for
instance and you could triangulate
yourself in terms of what position you
are in your store by just having three
beacons at the minimum and you can
figure out exactly where you're standing
in your store by telling how much signal
you're getting from each of those three
beacons yes they are physical tags that
you place on your price tag or in your
store shelf what yes they are physical
tags and they broadcast a radio signal
saying I'm one two three I'm I'm four
five six I'm seven eight nine that's
right yeah the ranges is very short
probably about is the same as Bluetooth
about a hundred feet I believe not more
than that I think it's less it's more
like thirty meters yeah but you still
might get a line of sight signal from
this is radio wave so you might get a
line of sight signal that's a little bit
further than that but it's guaranteed
more for thirty thirty meters or less
that's a good good point because it's
using 2.4 gigahertz for Bluetooth so you
might have Wi-Fi that interferes 2.4
gigahertz is very overused right now
microwaves will affect it if you're if
you're in a back room and you're
microwaving a burger it might affect the
Bluetooth signals also yeah you know
from using your headset when it drops
out it's the same same thing same
frequency
yes it's very early on so you're taking
a risk because your early adopter but if
you're the first mover then good for you
because you're gonna learn things before
anyone else figures it out they're just
coming out with these be beacon tags
these stickers at estimate this month so
you can watch for that and ask for the
SDK they'll send it out to you
sm mode is the company if you go to s mo
comm you should see all this Oh either
the SM o beacons or the SM o stickers
available as an SDK for you to play
around with and they're very smart they
offer it for I think it's $100 $99 but
you get three of these tags and you get
an SDK but you can use it to talk job
instead of their SDK might be in C or
Objective C or something for the Android
phone but you can also layer on top of
this the the lookup service that I
talked about in these slides and be able
to use Java API stew okay so when when
you're talking about standard api's this
is up to the community it's not up to
Oracle to force these api's onto anyone
so right now we're promoting that Java
be used and you come up with your Java
API but right now there is no standard
for what that beacons API will be and we
hope that the community will you know
you can create a jsr and say hey I'm
creating a jsr for the beacons API in
Java right now they do have C API s and
other api's but this would be a very
first time that if someone wanted to
come up with the jsr for it I for for
the estimate beacons III don't have the
architecture for the SM o beacons that's
yeah this this is just the macro level
of what did I have I just have this for
rfid readers the red dots are RFID tags
if you can imagine instead they're
beacons then it talks to a gateway and
so the Gateway
would be able to track if their beacons
are moving around on a price tag instead
of your iPhone tracking it your gateway
tracks it and says oh this this beacon
keeps on moving around the jeans area
because someone's carrying an item in
their hands and they've been holding
onto it for 10 minutes and that's too
long we want this person to buy this
item and not put it back on a shelf so
we're gonna send them a coupon or tell
the sales clerk a go up to this person
and whoever is walking around with this
beacon tell them they get 20% off right
now if they buy it now so you know
there's a lot of use cases where you
make money instead of trying to cut back
on your energy use or you know protect
against burglars stealing your things
this is a way to make money because you
you can have more insight more analytics
to your customers if there's a question
in the back
yes yes it is yeah yes yeah
sure yes absolutely it's difficult
because yeah huh right yes
yes right
there's a
yes that's true but but if you want to
turn that buyer into turned that
potential buyer into a real buyer there
then you would need to track the workers
also and you you can have your workers
walk around with s emot-- beacons to you
just put a tag on their ID tag and then
you know a that's my worker walking
around that why isn't my worker in the
back storeroom you know four four eight
hours a day instead of walking around
and helping the customers so that you
know that yeah that's more of monitoring
and not not really inventory control
though okay okay that going back to your
first question that you know throughout
the years there's been absent flows of
RFID use you're you're right about that
I think it's because that it's so much
cheaper for a barcode if you're talking
about pennies for a barcode and you know
a couple cents or five cents for RFID
tag you're going to go with the one
penny for for the barcode and then have
it use it one of the laser optical
scanners instead so you still see that
in in the stores you still see that at
the checkouts and the grocery stores
I think it's cost that's true too
and in another use case in yeah that's
true in in in other countries and around
the world you see a uptick but in
Walmart in the United States is the one
exception they make a lot of money
because they're using RFIDs in your
warehouse so all that once they know
exactly what's in their warehouse like
you're saying but that you have to
invest more money than just the barcodes
the barcodes are very cheap to invest in
still after 10 years 15 years of when
RFID started coming out any other
questions
yes yes that's okay the cost if once you
get into the cost aspect of it then it
it's very early on in the adoption so
the cost is high right now and it's $100
it's $99 for the SDK for three of them
so you might have to wait for a
wide-scale adoption if your early
adopter and you like to ride the the
next wave early on then this is great if
you're waiting it for to be a wide
deployment then you have to wait a
little longer for the price to come down
but I think that it will eventually come
down just because the the use of it is
better than RFID tags because the use of
it is more active that it's it's sending
out a ping signal saying hey either
you're carrying this item with you or
you're walking around nearby a Starbucks
or you're nearby an item that we're
going to send you a promotion onto your
smartphone so that might be an
interesting thing for for being more
active in enticing your your buyers
yes yes yes that's true right
that's true that's true that's true
yes yeah that's true yep no that's true
yeah yeah that's where barcodes went out
it's just I just need the number and the
price and that's it but but yeah
something like a weapon a gun that you
know goes from seller to buyer or seller
buyer hey you want to keep track of that
really well and maybe the art RFID is a
better case of that yeah well I've come
to the end of the hour here so if
there's any additional questions you can
come up but thank you very much
and thank you for attending</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
