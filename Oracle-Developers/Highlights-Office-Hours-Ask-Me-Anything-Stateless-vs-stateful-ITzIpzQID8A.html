application is it's stateless and that's
the big difference with the databases it
isn't and the this is particularly a
problem when it comes to reversing
database changes so you put something
out and you realize something's gone
horribly wrong how do we get how do we
undo it as much as possible try and
separate the application release from
the related database release so if
you're adding a column to support some
code add the column first and then at
some point later deploy the code because
one of the biggest struggles you have
it's not just the fact that if you've
got to drop that column it's a it's just
a nightmare but what do you do with all
that data you know some people have
written information into there and okay
if you're a social media application and
you're just recording what happy people
wear doesn't matter if you're a bank and
you're recording I don't know some extra
information which is a legal requirement
you can't just revert that back out and
as Gerald says you know if you've
deployed a whole bunch of stuff together
and something goes wrong you don't know
what's caused it but if you've added the
column everything's fine
then you deploy the code and something
goes wrong you know it's not the
database change that's done it so as
much as possible if you separate those
so then that way at least if you do have
to back your database changes out
hopefully there's no new information you
don't have to go we've got all this
customer data which we've got to figure
out what we're going to do with while we
back it back out the change will fix it
so I think adding state adds a lot of
problems but testing early making
changes small helps on those issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
