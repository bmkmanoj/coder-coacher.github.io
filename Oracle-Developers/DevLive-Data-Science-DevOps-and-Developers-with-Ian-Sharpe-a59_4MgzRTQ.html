Oracle cloud London
I'm your host Javed Muhammad and I have
as my guest today in shark who is the UK
articles UK data science need for in
welcome Thank You Javed very good to be
here all right so uh what what I mean
data science it sounds like the fusion
of matrix and I don't know Blade Runner
what does it what does the data
scientist in first of all yeah it's
pretty much all those things well that's
a very good question actually because um
I think the Freitas first coined about
three or four years ago by the CFO of
Google described as the sexiest job
title of the 21st century oh the
evidence isn't out there yet but never
is I think you hear Sammy will be seeing
a picture of you in People magazine
sexiest man alive god forbid they'd know
I wouldn't be a house on that uh-huh
but on an interesting point of view but
a lot of us who who have been around for
a number of years as data modelers and
statisticians and that's my own
background we're kind of so then we grew
beards and we call ourselves data
scientists that's really where it came
from but actually other serious know the
technology and and and the the
aspiration which is find value in your
data has been around for a long time
it's just that what's changed over time
as as B awareness in the market and
branding of it okay so our friend over
at Google and so you know we're seeing a
lot of activity and energy in this space
I was Oracle for over 15 years and I
guess what my first project here was in
personalization with second generation
Amazon stuff and that was big data back
in those days but and we were very much
out of the limelight whereas in the last
three or four years we've seen the
advent of data science as something
people want to do as a very much front
front and center in primetime so hugely
exciting and events like this are great
for us because we sort of see the energy
we see the synergy between
developer community and and the datasize
disciplines as well
codebase so so in the Sun you're going
to be speaking at devoxx you came in
mate that's right what was a view what
are you going to be talking about over
there what we're going to be talking
about I mean it's an interesting thing
because one of the one of great things
about big data and data science and AI
and it's also its weakness and that's
the fact that it's caught so much press
attention and so much interest and
that's great for us in terms of
generating buzz and excitement and
people getting excited about it but it's
also quite difficult in terms of
managing expectations of as to what's
real at the moment so that presentation
is really about sort of a little bit
about let's say the nation in terms of
what people are really doing in data
science where it's come from the past
but probably more realistically a health
check in terms of you know where the
value really is where the struggles are
and where we're going in the near future
things like cognitive AI and keep
learning and machine learning and
machines taking over the world and get
back to you filming great yeah and what
is like Oracle UK doing in terms of
connecting with developers from a data
science standpoint yeah that's a very
good point actually I mean I think a
great thing about an event like this is
it allows us to solve really focus on on
a development community and raising
awareness but actually that there's a
huge pedigree from Oregon a legacy from
Oracle in terms of providing Java you
know that'sthat's our history and open
source of big data and data sizes
primarily built on those languages so we
recognize developers is very key and a
key community and an increasingly
influential community going forward and
we want to be involved with them and we
want to understand what they're doing
and anything that we can support and you
know it's very much the great thing that
from my point of view that and this may
sound odd as a technology person who's
worked for Microsoft and Oracle over the
years but I I actually think that big
data was a single and open-source is a
single best thing to happen to
technology business since the advent of
the UI it gave people choices and those
the challenge with big companies like us
it was probably necessary to do that and
so you know we're always seeing that the
importance of data science and these
kind of events
and the and the choice that people had
it's actually key and we just want to be
making people aware of what we're doing
and understanding what they're doing and
supporting that so it's great it's
hugely exciting for us and hopefully
give people a new perspective we were at
a customer the other day and then they
didn't realize the Oracle provided Java
manufactured Java where they thought it
came from so I think it's opportunities
of to conflate the past address the
challenges of the present and build on
in the future I think you get like all
right well it sounds like a very
exciting area and I hope people will
check out ends presentation both at
devoxx if you're around here he's a guy
to me so if you around that the article
called London stop him asking questions
I think it's a love to connect with any
of the developers who are here very good
anything else you kind of what it says a
final parting message
yeah to both the people who are
streaming and who might see this message
later yeah absolutely I think you know I
think we are at a hugely important time
in terms the advent of machine learning
and AI and there's a lot of stuff in the
press that some great literature out
there right now and one of the things
that we've hugely humbled to do is work
with the octave University Ethics
Committee data ethics committee and this
is historical so I work alongside
Microsoft and Google and Facebook and
IBM and others kind of organizations and
front and center in terms of every
ethical conversation that we have is
around machine learning and AI and
artificial intelligence and there's huge
amounts of press there's any number of
great books there's a very good one I
had point people too they haven't read
it so far called our Hama Dias by an
Israeli writer called a Val Harare oh my
dears
- by over her Ari over her Ari okay so
check out the book if you get a turn at
Bill Gates and Obama are both fans so
they okay it's a up words that you know
that I think the point that it sort of
talks about is the advent of machine
learning and we're were some way away
from cognitive
true empathic robots so there's a
hundred billion hundred thousand billion
connections
human brain I think we're getting close
to about half a billion for a robot so
there's some way to go but never where
there's a whole advent around that and
one of the things with the clever of
people the me talk about from the ethics
book perspective is that actually you
know Larry's talked about every
technology since the invention of fire
being used for good and bad and my
previous CEO in adalah over at Microsoft
talked about the democratization of AI
and so we have these conversations a lot
which is actually and how do we control
these things and the reality is we it's
very hard to it's important possible to
control these things and it comes down
to what Oxford are talking about which
is finding the ethical and unethical use
cases and making sure that you're doing
the right thing with this technology so
since the thing you're talking about
ethical and I thought we were going to
wrap it up but I have to ask you this
question I mean I definitely see there's
a need for it because what do you use as
your reference as a benchmark for this
of what is ethical what this is what is
not that it's a very good point I mean
one of the ones that they tend to get
thrown out there is obviously stem cell
research and cloning and and the use
cases are you know floating stem cells
possibly good cloning dinosaurs maybe
not so good the challenge that we have
though is the barriers to entrance to
those things are much lower you know the
real infection guilds even if one has
cloned dinosaurs it'd probably be quite
difficult for me to do so whereas I can
simply go and download the latest
libraries for AI and start building
these applications very very quickly
myself so although the use cases are
there's analogies between those two
sectors actually the barriers to
entrance are completely different so it
comes down to the potential thing which
is actually it's going to be down to us
to decide the ethical new bit and
unethical use cases of these things and
that's why these organizations would
leave these these objects talk and
connect to so key really certainly I
think that's my parting message ok ok
another later note what what is it
what's your favorite do you have any
favorite of machine learning movies many
movies oh my goodness you know big data
science anything I think I really like
she obviously yeah I have no oh it's a
great way to Scarlett Johansson and she
is a kind of
an empathic kind of robot that teaches
this really lonely dude to interact with
people it's very cool okay so check it
out so thank you so much in for coming
down and thank you very much for
watching article dev live and stay tuned
for more interviews here at article code
