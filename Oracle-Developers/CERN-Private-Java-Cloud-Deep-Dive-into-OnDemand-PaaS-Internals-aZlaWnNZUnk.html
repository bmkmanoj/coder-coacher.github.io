start so first in thank you very much
for let me come along in this Java 1
2014 with my presentation certain
private Java cloud deep type into
on-demand platform as a service
internals the title is pretty cool is
pretty catchy so let's see if my
presentation meets the expectations this
would be the our agenda for for today i
will make a quick introduction about the
cern then i will show you what were our
motivations for developing our own Java
cloud then i will show you this cloud
how it looks like how it works and then
we will see what are the next steps in
this project and we will finish with
some conclusions but first i think that
is very right that you that I tell you
something about me my name is rich
rodriguez and as you can guess from my
Spanish accent I'm from Spain I work as
a Java developer in the in the
infrastructure of middleworld services
of the database group in the CERN IT
department and I am an open lab fellow
this means that all of my work is in the
frame of open lab open lab is a
partnership between CERN and different
IT companies now when I'm not developing
I like to do all of these funny stuff
about bali board in our skating but we
are in the java one the biggest
developer conference of the wall so i
think that the right way to start is
making a demo so excuse me because i
have to sit down so the first thing that
we are going to do is go to our server
web services user portal and request one
of a one java side so
can you hear me yeah yes okay so we said
that we want our website is going to be
an official website anyway it was to
suggest a name now so will I go for the
classic for the classic java one demo
description whatever demo for Yabba one
we said that we want a java middleware
on demand side for the moment the only
band of that we provide is apache tomcat
and we just need to agree with the
certain computer rules and we create our
website and if everything goes fine and
the code of internet is good with me in
just a few moments we should have our
request creation if we go to the to the
main interface of our of our system this
is the middle worm this is the user
interface of the middle war on demand we
refresh the sides and we should be able
to see our java one demo web that is in
request pending status what is in this
why this state because for the creation
of the website we need to a lot of stuff
like register the site in our single
sign-on register the site in the dns
create the default container and deploy
the default application a many other
task so all of these we will take us
about 20-25 minutes i hope if everything
goes well so we can go back to our
slides
so sir what is sir cern is the biggest
laboratory for particle physics in the
world so our business is the fundamental
research info in physics this means that
our mission is to answer these two
really simple questions how the universe
works and what is made of for this we
have two main type of tools the
accelerators and the detectors in the
skin the screen you can see a picture of
the biggest and most famous accelerator
the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of
27 kilometers of circumference and it's
100 meter and underground it is located
between the Swiss and French border
between the month within the joke Ural
Mountains and the lemon lake inside this
big tube we have two small pipes of one
centimeter of diameter inside these
pipes with we have the two bins of
particles and we accelerate those
particles till they reach almost the
speed of light in four points of the of
the ring we have the detectors inside
the detectors we cross the two bins and
we can we create collisions of particles
so the mission of the detectors is to
measure everything what happens in this
call in Indian those collisions like the
how much energy the temperature are all
and also the directions of the yet of of
the yet of particles but overall I have
to say that the third is a big
international collaboration we are more
than 10,000 people from all over the
world working all together and what is
really the most exciting thing for me
about working at CERN is that I am
working in the same place as this man
was working 25 years ago in a project
called the war
why web so if you come and visit us that
is a thin really recommendable big
really recommendable because certain is
a really exciting and interesting place
keep in mind that this is the real Tim
berners-lee office it is located in the
buildings in the building 31 in the main
90 building so please do not do like
this guy because if you follow the
classic visitor secret probably you will
pass near by this corridor and in this
in this panel says where the web was
born this is not true this is this is
not the tim berners-lee office so please
do not fold it into the trap okay but
enough about CERN what is our what were
our motivations for developing our own
platform first I have to say that maybe
I can sound a little bit a little bit
old-fashioned but I think that the 90s
were there really good old days this is
a picture of our computer center in
Geneva in 1997 as you can see in the
picture the number of boxes that we had
by item that time sorry was relatively
small so relatively small that we were
able more or less to manage them
manually and as well the java community
by that time was young small and fresh
in the in the screenshot you have the
first application that was develop at
sir the electronic document holding also
known as ed 8 this this application is a
was one of the most critical and still
instill ities because it managed all the
implements sorry all the procedures of
all of the organization from request
your holidays to buy a component for the
XL for the accelerator and well this is
a personal opinion I have to I have to
say that in the 90s i think that the
music was really much better than now
with with bands lot like earlier but
okay
this is a personal opinion but we cannot
stop the time and leave eternally in
those glorious days so we are now in
2014 and everything is big very very big
web scale so nowadays we have two
different computer centers one in Geneva
and another one in Hungary in total we
have about 11,000 11,000 boxes but the
good news is that all of these for
managing all of these we have we have
the cloud we have a cloud base in
open-source products like OpenStack and
puppet but in the other in the other and
the other hand for managing all of our
Java all of our yellow applications we
don't we don't have anything like like
this we don't have a really platform as
a common platform as a service for
manage all of this and nowadays we have
hundreds of job applications and they
are not only in the administrative
department they are also in the in the
accelerators control room and they are
big in the screenshot you can see the
current version of the previous
application EDH now it implements more
than 100 workflows and it's about 1
million lines of code I don't know if
that it is a good or bad theme but well
the million lines of code are there one
of our motivations is that we have a
limited manpower like many other
organizations and like many other
organizations all over the world we are
suffering from this crisis so we don't
really have enough resources in order to
investigate how to integrate one third
party tools in our sir knight in our IT
and infrastructure saying that you can
think that this is a little bit overkill
and that we are reinventing the wheel
but the scene is that the certain IT
infrastructure sorry provides provide us
everything that we need out of the box
from the provision and the configuration
of the machines thanks to our to our
cloud to the registration of the
applications in the in our single site
in our single sign-on but also we have a
lot of expertise in configuring and
managing the middle work for our for our
customers and as well we have a previous
platform as a service experience in 2012
we develop another platform as a service
the database on demand for databases and
since 2006 we have the CERN gateway
public service this is another platform
as a service tool but the products that
with the path of the time it has become
a little bit own and it doesn't meet
anymore the user requirements so at the
end of the day what we need is something
for gluing all of these services
together and give them to the users and
last but not least at seven we have a
big community of oracle live of oracle
apex developers the web infrastructure
offer our of a lack of our oracle apex
is formed by oracle weblogic another
college it available with the mod pl/sql
module and of course we cannot provide
one of those installations for all of
our users so all of the users share the
same the same infrastructure but in 2012
I think Oracle released the apex
listener the apex listener is a java
connector the play that is packaged l as
a war as a war file so our I our idea is
to take this war file and undeployed in
our in our cloud so in this way each of
the user
we'll be able to manage independently
their environment and their applications
so the middle were manager our solution
also known as the middle were on demand
imagine this scenario Tim berners-lee in
person comes to your office and ask for
three environments and he wants David
test improper sorry and he wants things
like this he wants to integrate their
his applications in the single sign-on
he wants to have some volumes for the
permanent a storage because he's going
to is going to you narrative weapons and
he wants to store all the resources he
wants he he thinks that is going to he's
going to need third-party third-party
ApS connectivity so probably he will
need to import some certificates in his
key stores and as well he want to play a
little bit with this with a with a class
of assisting class path so he will need
to upload the different different
third-party libraries and he wanted to
to be able to make multiple deployments
this is a photo of me when i whenever
when I received the ticket in my inbox
excuse me
fook
well stay works now it works it works
but I think that we need a napkin I pour
the water okay sorry promise of their
life well okay but why panic because at
the end of the day is not so much work I
can it keep it simple and provide
something like this in the front end I
can configure my apache HTTP and apache
HTTP server and she will it for the she
wallet for the integration with a single
sign-on yeah sorry no appreciation even
for me this night I'm going to miss
Aerosmith waiting inside okay thanks
that's a short circuited yet so I think
okay well okay enough smoke starts
coming out of it well okay so the front
end apache HTTP server and she voted for
the single sign-on integration okay
let's keep it simple and in the back end
I can set up a Apache and a pad an
Apache Tomcat of course I will need to
to mess around with some configuration
files the key stores but I'm doing oh
and of course doing these three times
but it is not a big deal because say we
have a lot of scripts for doing all of
this stuff the real problem of this is
that these three environments they are
going to be are going to become pets and
you know what happened with pets at the
beginning they are a smile they are cute
they are lovely if we translate this
into IT language it means that
everything works from scratch everything
is Mary's everything is beautiful but
you know what happened when the past
time the pets they will become beasts
this is your star you are going to start
to mess around with your with your
configurations with the key stores with
the classpath and then at some point
everything will break you will have a
funny exceptions funny redirections so
we don't want pets what we want is
cattle because when the cattle is ill in
this case one of our environments we
shoot them and we create anyone so we
want to give the possibility to the
users to be able to configure to
configure and manage themselves the m
the environment and for the
administrator for the minister aters we
want to avoid all of this boilerplate a
hon minister hun main instil a
installations so at the end of the day
we want a single platform to rule them
all our platform works in a producer
consumer manner a user makes one user
makes a request like create a new set
and create a new site sorry and this
request is taken by the by the front end
and it transform transform it in a set
of jobs register the site in the single
sign-on for yesterday citing the dns
created a full container deployed the
default application and so on so forth
these jobs are a story in the init in a
database and at some point in time the
scheduler pick up those jobs and
transform them into into comments and it
delivers this this commons to our
back-end then the back end is the one
that is going to execute the commons
creating the creating the content in a
container deployment application
registering the site in the dns and in
the singles I know and with this
comments we built our our cloud the
front end is a java web application for
building this application i chose the
set cassette game framework the reason
was that in this framework become become
a kind of a standard in our group they
did the database on demand system and
another couple of applications were
developed also with this with this
framework the application provides a
common user interface for the regular
users and for the administrators and
also it takes care of all of the status
of the objects of the system like the
applications and the candy containers
and also it provides a REST API for the
integration with third-party
applications the scheduler is that is a
demon that is constantly running and
looking for jobs that are impending
state it picks the jobs and is an his
parameters pass them and transformed
into comments and then it says the
comment he sends the common to the back
end and wait for the and wait for the
result of the common once the command is
execute the result is storing the in the
job database I can show you the demo
there the demon sorry the demon the
demon is just a set of Perl scripts and
is constantly running as I said and as
you can see in the in the screen and
it's looking always for jobs that are in
the state pending so if we go to our
user interface
and for example i go to my advanced
experimental turned c8 and I said stop
the container at some point we see that
the yoga was created in the database and
the demon pick it up and executed let's
go back to the demo let's go back to the
slides the back end the first component
of the back end is the infrastructure
system administration also known as a
sis control insist insist control we
store the configuration parameters the
configuration parameters of all of our
middleware components like containers
Apache servers and even Shibboleth demos
it also stores the configuration of the
databases and store and volumes for the
storage but this isn't this is another
this is another story and here in this
component is where all the magic happens
because sysctl pick the comment and is
the one that the knows who is going to
who is going to implement and execute
the decom and all of this information is
a storage in an ldap oh sorry
the second yes question there I cannot
hear you sorry
the question was if sysctl provision the
virtual machines or just configure the
middle where we just store the
middleware obvious it is toward the
middle of the middle were obvious the
built on machines are provided by
OpenStack and they are also configured
using puppet thanks so the second
component of our back-end is the middle
wall controller the middle wall
controller is just the implementation of
each of the comment like a star
container stop container and we have two
types of two types of common control
comments like a start and stop and
administrative comments like registered
container in sysctl and release an
unreleased container for example and yes
question there
the question was if there is any reason
because who why we are not using puppet
as well for a foreign storing all of
this information it's a good question
the thing is that we were using this
component this is control since who I
don't remember exactly so we have we
have all of all of the information not
only the information of the middle were
but also the information of the database
and volumes so it was pretty hard to to
move it to to puppet that's there that's
wise and we want to release ability to
really a separate everything so we use
puppet for configuring the machines for
prop for profit for provision in the
machines and we want to use our our
in-house system for configuring what is
in the intima ended the top layer yes
thanks m the last component of our
back-end is the application server agent
this agent is just a servant that is
deployed in all of the in all of the
containers and this agent takes care of
the status of the container and the
status of all of the applications that
are deployed in the container using jmx
it is constantly acquiring the managed
beans container applications and estas
that inform estas this the state of
those managed beans in the day indicate
indicate in the database also it serves
the some JJ be m matrix yes question der
now is is a application deploy in every
in every container again I am going to
show you now with with the next slide
the infrastructure the the good thing
about the infrastructure is that me as a
as a developer I don't have to take care
about this everything is provision a
break up reconfigure for me so when I
need to scale my system I just pick one
match I just pick one machine from
OpenStack and registered in my in my
system all of the RPMs all of the
templates all of the binaries that I
that I need out there for answering the
question about the agent if we take a
look to our infrastructure
sorry I have here my cheat sheet with
the comments 0 is this one so let's take
a look yeah
so here we have
one of the containers that has been
created with our with our system so if
we take a look at the at the web apps
folder of the Apache of the apache
tomcat container we can see that apart
from the user from the users application
in this case this example that work we
have this middle manager agent dot war
so the agent is exactly that is is just
that it's just a cerebral it opens a
thread and is constantly picking up the
the matrix in day of the jvm yep thanks
and also if we take a deeper look
to this container if we take a look at
the lib folder we can see that all of
the all of the jars reference to these
already vs a budget on got seven of 54
if we
if we take a look at this folder
oh no it's not Lee knows sorry yeah if
we take a look at this folder we can see
that here we have all of our binaries
the apache tomcat the apache tomcat
deployer and we have all of our custom
templates all of these is probably she
is provisioned by the Leidenfrost occur
by open by OpenStack going back to the
slides and if we put all of the
components that we have seen before all
together this is the BC stupid this is
the big picture of the of the system so
in the in the right side this will be
the final the final result this will be
our our Java cloud with all of the
components Shibboleth up by apache HTTP
server the containers the agents deploy
it on the on the cloud the cloud this
provision by all the machines provision
is by OpenStack and configuring with
with with puppet and in the left side we
can see our back-end with sis control
the scheduler and how they are connected
with with with the front and our our web
application and everything that
everything that is all around our cloud
are the CERN ite IT services we use
Oracle Enterprise Manager for money for
monitoring we have a rip our repository
of rpms the single sign-on the dns and
the user and the user portal and now
let's see if our site is kicking anna
life yes question there
networking for
so you can
the question the question was is if that
we use OpenStack neutron I don't really
know because I just the developers guys
just provide me the scripts that that we
need for for attaching the volumes to
the to the to the containers we are used
AFS but I don't know exactly the tools
that we that we are using but I can I
can check it if you if you want thanks
very much so let's take a look at to our
site and see if he's kicking anna life
and is running and everything has been
has been done well so if we come back to
our demo we go to the UM to the main
screen we look for our Shah vidimo and
we see that the site is running okay
good and let's take a look at the jobs
that has been executed for this for this
side if we filter well it's not needed
to filter they are there mmm no I'm
going to filter Jabba one
so I'm not going to explain in details
what all of these jobs are because some
of them they are really a self
explanatory like if i zoom matter now
can you see from the back yeah because
some of them there are really in self
explanatory like the proton cat
application created a star tonk at home
but we have some of them like register
interface and register a web locations
that I think that they deserve a little
bit of explanation this register
interface and registered web location
what they are doing is stolen in our
ldap insist control all the all the
configuration for that is needed for it
for making the for building for building
the beautiful host in the apache HTTP
server as well you can see that we have
a several of those initialize DFS tomcat
application initialize DFS container it
should be this this jobs what they are
doing they are create a folder and space
in our in our distributed file system
based on web tab this is this is DFS and
again behind this folder and we have two
folders application and containers and
here we have all of the different
configuration files for our for our
solar different user configuration files
sorry for the photo for the containers
and for the applications so what we want
to do is to see if we are able to
implement the tim berners-lee a scenario
so Tim berners-lee wanted to have
wanted to attach some storage so for
this we go to the list of applications
and we said we say sorry that we want a
new bowl on a new volume we request the
system proposed a bully apple you volume
name for us and it recalls us that we
have to restart the container in order
to be able to use the volume we said ok
and the volume is created for us team as
well he wanted to be able to to manage
the runt I no options for the for the
applications so what what team can do is
to write write down in a file what are
their front line options I have a cheat
sheet here he said ok I need this option
one option two also I want to disable
the explicit garbage collection collect
collector and I want to increase the
Saudis taxes in half a geek because i am
using a lot of recursive algorithms so
he select the file
upload it
and we see that this file is spending of
approval of course we cannot pass all of
the different run tiny options that they
that they use that all of the users so
what we would but what we can do is to
set a world for award for approval so
here the administrator see that he has a
new resource that he needs to approve
and well as well in my in my email inbox
I should receive a ticket and saying
that I need to review some users some
users request but it takes a few it
takes a few moments sorry yeah so I just
take a look at the resource and I
approve it because I trusted Tim
berners-lee's a good guy and as well Tim
berners-lee
wanted to modify some of some of the
security policies of the jb m so we have
we have a set in place the same in the
same system we select the defiled with a
with it with the policies let me show
you for example this one pet clean
policy and tim says that he wanted to
give all the permissions for the for the
applications java one demo we save and
we upload it
as the yeah this one
and again so uh okay here we have the
request for service that I that I that
that has been created automatically in
our in our ticketing system by the way
we are using a service service now for
this so we can see that I have a new
resource to review and it provides me
the URL for reviewing the for reviewing
the resource so okay well I'm not going
to do all of the all of the single list
all of the singular steps that that we
need bye-bye the moment Widow as you can
see we don't have too many users we have
to still to migrate the old applications
that are in our all dat public service
entry public service system to to the to
the new system but we have some users
like this guy that works for the CMS
experiment and he has deployed his funny
applications his phone application that
is a CMS visually CMS visualization and
is a pretty nice application you can see
how the different collisions inside of
the accelerator looks like if you are
curious about is using this JavaScript
3d 3d library so come back to the to the
slides
so this is the final the final the final
result this is the environment that Tim
berners-lee is going to receive if you'd
if you take a look is very similar to
the previous one that I showed you beat
that I showed you before but the
difference is that this one is
cloud-managed is managed by our by our
system so if if Tim berners-lee screw up
his environment he just can request a
new one and who they are moved is his
applications so what are the next steps
in an hour in our project of course we
want to add new blenders to over to our
platform our first target is oracle
weblogic and the reason is that we have
about 200 applications deployed in
oracle weblogic so for us is it really
it really matters also our users are
asking for a cluster for a hub for the
possibility sorry of having cluster mode
in the Apache in the Apache Tomcat
containers as well we want to refactor
the scheduler because the XEX scheduler
was originally designed for the database
on the for the database on demand so we
want we want to create a new version in
order that all the third-party systems
are able to use this the scheduler and I
said that I provide a REST API for the
integration with third-party systems but
this is still not come this is still not
complete basically I am providing only
methods for registered and unregistered
asides in order to integrate them with
with the user portal and what it most
important to me is that I would like to
facilitate the developers life i want to
make the developers happy so if i
provide our REST API is going to be easy
for the developers to integrate them in
their scripts key learnings
this is what I call the loss the loss of
the cloud this is the cloud is as son as
any other ID product is unpredictable
this is let me explain you have to you
have to code keeping in mind always
there always the worst case scenario
this is this is a channel is a general
rule but I think that in this cloud
environment is especially true also the
second the second one is that the
shortcuts are not are not good but I
have to say that this is something that
is easy to say but is hard to implement
hard too hard to execute because at the
end of the day everybody everybody has a
deadlines and of course you have to find
come from compromises you have to be
able to move to move forward with your
point to push forward with your protein
you don't want to fall in eternal
discussions if we are going to convert
this solution or are we going to provide
this dysfunctionality and keep in mind
that your users are developers and
administration other miss traitors so
try to keep both happy and don't get
your hands dirty bill platforms that
will dealt with that bill machine sorry
that build machines this is automate
everything well I want to say thank you
to all of my team members especially the
members of my section as well to the TV
on demand team and thanks to all of the
people that support me for this
presentation and of course thanks to the
different partners collaborators and as
an associate of to the of the certain
open lab program because at the end of
the day these guys pays my salary so
thanks and thanks to you thanks very
much if you have some questions
so yes James tomatoes yeah question
there
okay the question was how we control the
deployment application versions I do it
in my in my code I just I you stole
referee reference today to the different
deployments that I upload to the two day
to the distributed file system and I can
I keep the three last versions of the of
the user the the diversion of target for
that we have our template so it's that
each time that that we want to upgrade
upgrade the containers we create a new
team a new template and we apply the
Kree they create home comment this
create discreet discreet home comment
take all of the user configuration that
is a store in the district of the
filesystem delete the old container and
create a new one from scratch just did I
answer your question 1 or less i think
more questions yes
well this is a different service
actually we can take a look at the
service may I have one mysql database
for my development this is the database
on the only matter but this is out of
the scope of my of my of my price but if
if you want i can put you in contact
with the developers of this of the
service but the but the idea is the same
as is this middle were on the inner
world on demand we have this web
interface that creates jobs that are
executed by the scheduler and with those
with with those jobs the the database
are created yep
eration server and the URL actually
jsessionid we use for doing single
sign-on and we use active directory
services sorry Active Directory
Federation services version 2 and for
the identity provider and in the service
provider and then the service provider
side we use reusable it and we are using
the sam'l to protocol for this no not
really thanks yes question there
well I have alarms all over the place to
that for send me emails when one of the
years is one of the jobs is failing but
but well not basically all of the jobs
are execute if they fail for for some
reasons the jobs can be the task can be
can be can be redone for example if
something happens when you create a
container you just we just try a second
a second second one and the container is
created
so that okay you mean what were what we
do with the abundant resources this is a
really good question because we're for
the moment we are not doing anything
like that but we are thinking about
implemented workflow for saying that
okay if you are not running your service
your machine since I don't know since
the beginning of the year or one month
any weeks we just elated because of
course is consuming resources okay yeah
you know it's AG is a really good
question yeah thanks very much any more
questions yes the metric yes
I can show you for the moment I just
offered to simple matrix is the is the
memory memory amount and the number of
threads now this guy is not running
no no is that is the agent that is
deploying the container they want that
the quad is gmx we have a symbol we have
we have queries oh this is the load
these are the logs sorry these are the
logs by the way here we here we are we
have the heap memory usage and the
number of threads so the agent is the
one that coordinate the JVM that is
running on that is running on it and
through our rest service the main web
application retrieve the retrieve that
the matrix for this i'm not using json
because the amount of the amount of
information is really little so i am
using a simple xml with there with the
matrix did I answer your question is a
per container are going to be purged a
vm for JPM process yes any more
questions also thanks very much thanks
very much for your time for your
patience so have a good rest of the
conference thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
