solutions for the cloud generation today
we have hopefully an interactive session
so please feel free to interrupt and ask
questions but we're going to have two
parts the first part we're going to use
Oracle application Express and we're
going to build an application from
scratch from absolutely nothing to a
functioning application we're going to
use our free cloud service Apex torkoal
comm to do it and then the second half
shy is going to show us application
builder cloud service that was featured
during Thomas Koreans keynote this
morning so let's dive in first safe
harbor statement saying that things I
might say about future products may or
may not come true and Mike Cottrell from
Oracle I'll be assisted with should keep
Raman both to keep an eye our developers
we both develop and code pretty much
every day maybe I do four days a week
and should keep those six but but we'll
round that off to five each next so we
got 22 minutes so let's build an
application so we're going to go to Apex
or Volcom to get started so if you're on
your phone and you would like to have a
free account free forever you can just
go to a FX or calm down I won't be
offended you can sign up and get it get
a free service so this is you who here
knows application Express a couple
people I'm going to go with 30% that's
good so application Express is a
browser-based application development
environment designed sort of a data
first style where you have data
typically an Oracle relational database
and you want an easy way to get that
data out of the database and onto your
screen and visualize visualize it charts
interact with it with reports update it
with forms that sort of thing we have
about four or five hundred thousand
developers worldwide there's a number of
dedicated conferences for application
Express and it's quite popular in the
Oracle community so let's show us how to
get started to keep if people don't know
how to click the get started button they
click there
and then you can choose to pay a service
or you can get one for free and then we
put the free one in the middle and made
it bigger to make it easier to find okay
that's how we sign up for a free service
so she keep already has an account he's
gone through the process takes about two
minutes and now with sign in and start
oh yeah sorry
um so it is this website a text adorable
calm / low code and it basically defines
sort of the concept of low code and what
why it's important when you'd want to
use it and it basically has this
spectrum so if you scroll up a little
more solo code kind of is is the middle
of the spectrum do you have no code
solutions where you don't have to type
in any code at all and and then your
little code we might enter a little bit
of conditional logic maybe some
if-then-else maybe a couple sequel
statements where you might have change a
selected list or a from clause and then
you have full control environments where
you might jump out and code JavaScript
or CSS or HTML or Java or what-have-you
so apex and in DLC a VCS they can
support the full spectrum but they're
oriented towards providing this low code
no code out-of-the-box experience so now
some people think that low code is for
those people who can't code so if you're
not capable if you're a manager you're
too old if you have different skills
well then clearly you need to use a low
code tool because you're not capable of
using a sophisticated tool like say
JavaScript but it turns out that for
many types of applications is actually
very beneficial to not have to build
something up from the ground on the
ground up it's nice to use something
it's already built something this has
higher productivity so Gartner refers to
it as the HP a high productivity
application development and that's what
this space is so let's just show that
first so we're going to login this is
four steps the first step we're going to
create a data model the second step
we're going to sorry the first eye we're
going to get get a server if you've done
that second step we're going to we're
going to create data model third step
we're going to velop an application and
worth separately and deployed so so she
keeps logging in to the Oracle
application Express and go back so
application Express has an application
builder where I can create my
application and it's got a sequel
workshop or I can design my database
object like create my tables things like
that so we're going to run this
application on the bottom left called
quick sequel which is distributed with
application Express and it's like a
sequel markdown because we only have 22
minutes we're not going to have time to
type in 2000 sequel statements 2,000
lines of sequel statements so we're
going to use a markdown syntax so she
keeps going to start typing over here
using an indented list so what he's
doing is basically just spacing because
we know spaces are much better than tabs
indenting employees and names and what
that's doing is creating a table so the
table is the higher level indention and
the columns become the others and so
there's a lot of robust syntax behind it
so he's telling me that he wants the
name to be of our car 50 and he's going
to want the email no you do something
nice could make it not know he can index
it the employee name he's going to make
it force it to lowercase and then all
that that sequel trigger generation
table generation is all done and so
names properly indented properly using
the proper oracle syntax he's creating a
higher date with a timestamp with local
timezone and now it's creating a
subordinate table so our data model is
quite simple it's got employees and
skills so so will solicit skills from
the audience you guys can tell us your
skills we'll put that those data in but
basically by indenting it even further
he's creating a parent-child
relationship and what you can see over
here is that you primary keys
automatically generated but now we'll
have an employee ID which references the
other table creating in sequel a
parent-child relationship okay so paint
an exit type to name all the constraints
to remember that it's you know the
foreign key syntax don't remember that
you just type this in
okay you put some check constraints in
you created a view which joins those two
tables so this by specifying two table
names it generates this view for me but
now we have just a data structure we
need to have this data so she keep if
you could enter insert like 50 that
sounds good
a couple hundred skills as well and so
that's going to generate random data and
the random data generator is reasonably
smart when it sees name or email it
could generate random names and random
emails but it's not smart enough to do
some of the other random generation so
we're going to have to hint it with some
values so so countries any countries
that people like to see Austria
wonderful country another country is
nice to Canada yes no other countries of
interest sorry Russia are you thank you
okay so now skills let's insert some
values there as well
who's got skills JavaScript Java C equal
what JavaScript tennis basketball
Fortran Fortran 77 anyway so so cheeky
if you could because it's randomly
generated just just just hint it and
have a couple extra of something just to
make the distribution a little bit
better all right that's enough
okay let's generate that let's look what
we generated that must be good okay
let's copy this and paste it and run it
as a sequel script so this tool doesn't
actually do anything we plan to open
source in JavaScript so you can use it
more broadly but what we're going to do
is going to take that generated output
and we're going to run it in sequel
scripts inside the sequel workshop and
inside the application Express
oh sorry yeah I forgot to tell you so
that we're going to add a prefix and
we're going to add drop statements
because we practice the demo before so
we have to drop the tables before we
start but you put the pound sign drop it
will it will actually execute all the
drop statements in advance
good catch what it made a demo go poorly
get a lot of table review already okay
so now we're going to create a sequel
script we're going to name it and we're
simply going to paste in that generated
sequel statement three thousand two
hundred lines I told you're going to
generate three thousand lines of code
okay lots of insert statements lots of
create tables triggers views lots
database objects so we're going to run
that it's going to parse it two hundred
sixty commands 45k we're going to run it
should take a second or two to run you
click the view results we'll see what we
got okay
one hundred we succeeded to two hundred
sixty we're successful so let's just
verify that site we saw but I don't
believe it I want to make sure I see
Russia in there because we haven't used
Russia before well we'll see that when
we generate the app so we're just
browsing the table we see the table
exists and we see some data oh there's a
Russian so it must have worked ok so now
we've got our data so we've signed up
we've got a free service free forever
we've got a database we've got some data
so now we're going to build an
application so we're going to go to the
application builder to build an
application and I'm going to hand it off
to Shakib and shiki is going to walk us
through the construction of the
application
I want to try to juggle my microphone
and my mouse and keyboard here looks
like I can hold it
thank you all right so we're down here
I'm going to create an application let's
click on the try new create app wizard
alright so I'm going to give my
application a name something keep this
right all right everyone people hear me
okay so I'll call it with the skills
I'll add a page and just to start off
I'm gonna create a blank page so click
on blank page and what I really want is
the home page so sorry says home has my
home I kind of continue if I like click
on add page alright you see that I have
my home page let's go add a chart so
I'll add a chart for the page name I'm
going to type in skill
table review I'm going again let the
brand new skills table that just traded
right now
label is going to be skill and what I
really want is account of all the skills
right I want to know which skill is most
popular among this new data that they
have and I think a pie chart is just
fine so let's go and add that page all
right so I got up I got a blank page my
home page I have a skills page let's go
add a report click on add page again
report call this employees
okay all right so let's do the employee
skills if you actually and classic
reports fine icon it's fine at this page
I'm add one more thing I'm not a
calendar just because I like calendars
so what's going here I'll call this
calendar it's actually quite hard to
type with caps and one hand right so
let's go do this I'm going to select the
employees table display column is going
to be the name and start dates to be
higher date right I only have one date
micro-fine my tables it's all good add
page so so far I have three pages right
here if I kinda like set as lowercase
just change it really quick cool so now
there's a whole lot of features we can
add to my application so I could if I
wanted to go in and hand code my ACL
have some it's activity or forwarding
I'm setting I can take in user feedback
but I don't really want to do all that I
just want to you know check a box and
get that feature and if I want to tweak
it later I can do that
so here's a bunch of features I like but
in fact I like them all so much I'm
going to click on check all and here's
all my features and then appear so I
have a blue look and feel a red ones
it's like a slate dark one kind of looks
like Oracle Vista so I'll talk sorry
I'll tell
so I'm gonna go with the slate lookin
feel I can pick what are one of my side
navigation or top navigation and I pick
an icon so alright here's something fun
let's try to pick an icon that you guys
like sorry which color first any color
no red orange okay got an orange alright
how about an application icon meter
years okay here's a years all right got
that I'm not gonna change anything else
it's all good I really want to try to
change to it see but all the people that
is actually change soldiers
click on create app and within a few
seconds I'm going to actually have an
app that's fully featured that has all
these features as a new data diacritic
so at this point all right application
created gives you the nice green check
bar I'm going to run my application
check for time I have eight minutes left
so here's my login page and understand
the login again with the same credential
to my work screen okay and I logged in
and here's my application so now I can
click on skill and let's see what's
going on so it looks like a 45 percent
of the audience knows in the table knows
Java if I want to take out tennis I can
see that it's actually 59 percent and
people have new tennis wasn't all that
important you can click on employees so
now here's a report of this data and
what I can do now is I can apply some
filters and change some data around or
if I kind of buff view my report in a
different manner so what I want to do is
I want to find all the developers in the
given country so let me see if I can
find developers in Austria so here's
which developers in Austria and I want
to know which of these developers know
maybe tennis
and here's a guru and tenant the word
Stepney is an Austrian tennis guru
that's great
so I'm going to do them to save this
report if I ever want to get back to it
it's going to report save report - all
right so now I've created to support it
saved I want to go back to the result
data set I click on reset if you all
might it again I can do whatever I
wanted in like I manipulate this
information I can dice it in different
ways and target and so on here's the
calendar I created as well right so
here's my calendar and this is all about
priorities so let me go back in the past
and you see that we have some recent
hires so I hired some people in February
some in January and the ones over so all
that from some data set that I just
created just a few moments ago and then
this is where the really interesting
stuff comes in so this is the
administration section and remember all
the features that I checked earlier all
those boxes so all those manifest as
features typically on the administration
page or in other parts of the
application so for example I can click
on application settings and just quickly
change the name of my application
without ever having to go into the
developer console so I'm going to call
this Oracle code employee
I give us a title too
all right so if I go back to the home in
fact you'll see it right there it says
Oracle code employees right very simple
change one thing I don't like is that
you know this place look and feel this
great skill is really working for me and
I think I like more bluish color stores
I'm an acid feedback says please me
yeah it's feedback he zoomed in that's
why the buttons don't show but if we did
a normal resolution you'd see the bones
yeah all right so I just added some
feedback saying hey can you make this
look blue so now I'm an admin so I can
go into my admin console let's click on
user feedback and here I see a feedback
item says hey can you please make this
look blue all right fair enough I'll
click out of here I can go to theme
selection new dialog pops up and I'm
just going to choose to read it looks
kind of that's the blue one apply
changes my application refreshes it's
all blue now so now I can go and address
that feedback and say hey close it's all
good so so far I've done a few things
but I wanted to do a little bit more
customizations to my application and I
have about five minutes to do so let's
do some very simple things so first off
I see that I have three items here and I
have a whole lot of space just sitting
there doing nothing so let's go and
change it's really quick so I'm going to
click on quick edit in the developer
toolbar I'm sorry go back here
all right that's the very bottom of my
screen then call the developer toolbar
or click on quick edit and then as I
hover over this region you'll see
there's a little small wrench icon I'm
gonna click on that and it opens up this
little dialog at the top and I know this
is a list component in a pack so I'll
click on this and now I can change the
way it's look so in fact I want it to be
a little bit smaller maybe and I don't
want it to be and three columns I want
to be I want to be for call maybe three
actually I like this figure before
the animation right now is a colorful
but if I want to make it like a raised
card so it kind of really hard okay so
it's really simple another thing I want
to do is you know I'm not really feeling
this blue in fact what I really want to
do is I go to developer Doral calm they
have a nice orange here and maybe that's
what my application should be so I'm
open up my color picker tool I'm going
to pick a nice shade of orange maybe
that one right there I'll go back to my
application right here and the very
bottom something called steamroller so
let's open that up really quick and
you'll see that I have the premotor a
lot of color palettes I just change a
color for example the entire
applications have changed I can do some
funky stuff with it but what I really
want to do is just use that orange it
picked up from the Oracle code site and
you know what you had like a reddish
kind of header for the logo and that
button so let me do that too let's go
back here the containers header I'm just
gonna find some red that I kind of like
not bad
I displayed on TV I called it Oracle
code
three minutes let us turn
so so far we haven't even gone into the
development environment of Apex right so
province is doing everything and run
time so I want to show is just a little
bit of it most preview into it so here's
my advocate and you can see that I have
two columns side by side and what I want
to do is because I care so much about
user feedback I would remove this
section from the right side column to
the left heights the very top so again
in the developer toolbar I'm going to
click on edit page and now I'm just
opens up something called page designer
so and here I see that I have my
feedback region right there just can I
drag that and I can drag it up to the
left side so I want to actually put it
right above configuration let's look on
save and let's just run the application
again and here's my feedback it's very
tough right I wanted to I could mess
with a number of properties but I like
what I have going so far took me the
user profile so that's a good point I
want to do one more thing I haven't used
a profile this application let's go and
see what that Republic one so right now
I haven't provided my name or anything
so it just has no profile photo and no
information so let's go and type in my
name and I'm going to upload a photo so
I have a photo right here click apply
changes and it's uploaded I can see my
name everything's all hooked up I didn't
have to code any of this right I just
check the box got some feature and if I
wanted to act like extend this a bit far
you know as much as I wanted to but for
right now this is a good start to get
going
the last thing and I have I think one
minutes left is you know hey I have this
application this is on my development
boxes on this free service called apex
rofl calm but I want to take it and put
it somewhere else
right how do I do that so all I have to
do is if I'm happy with this and this is
my production instance I can just share
this URL it's this your owner here I can
put up a new tab new browser go to it
it's on the public Internet and anyone
can access it
it provided they have like login
credentials or I can click on export I
can put I just click Next and I can
actually download the entire application
with all the supporting objects and
everything as a single export file which
I can then take from this this
development platform environment to
another production environment or
whatever you want
so all that
- okay and then just to wrap up if you
look at this website apex or comm slash
Glo code if you scroll up doesn't matter
there you go you're good there's
basically video so if you're interested
in anything that you keep showed you
it's all in the videos we have five
videos that lay it all out if you have
colleagues back at home you want to
share it with please do so thanks now
we're off to two shades gonna show a BCS
thank you for alright so you've seen one
approach of development and you saw that
we started basically from thinking this
is how our data is going to be stuck to
this these are like the tables and
relationships and stuff like that my
question to you is how many people here
are actually database developer know
sick well pills equals some key okay how
many people here are JavaScript
developer persona okay and the point of
build tools is that in a lot of cases
it's not actually fully developed it's
for someone who doesn't define
themselves as a developer and they do
usually don't think data source they
imagine what they want to see on the
screen and this is what I want to build
okay so a BCSO application with a cloud
service takes a little bit of the
different approach to building the same
type of application they're putting a
focus on UI first approach so I'm going
to also start by creating a new
application and and this is one thing
that ABCs does it allows you to build
two types of application the web
application or a mobile application
where application runs inside your
browser mobile application installs as
an icon on your device runs on the
device itself we're going to start with
the web application then we'll do let's
say a project planning application we
call my application the project
application I can choose the look and
feel they head Vista we have Alta it's
the same thing it lets the RT look and
feel we also have another one which
shows a little bit better on project
also I'm going to choose this one this
one is actually the same look and feel
that is used by the Oracle SAS
application so our enterprise
application and let's have a project tab
and let's have another one we'll call
the
one let's say the employee tab and you
can see that as I'm clicking and
choosing stuff it automatically shows me
visually how things are going to look
like and then it takes me to the visual
editor and I can show this to anyone who
used Microsoft Paint or PowerPoint or
any other visual development thing and
they'll immediately know what's going on
there's a bunch of things on the list
that you can drag and drop into the
visual editor and there are properties
on the right that you said so for
example I can start by saying okay how
do I want my page to look like I want my
page to look like have two columns and
then over here I don't like this project
title so let's just set it to project
planning option and though there's a
place here to upload an image for the
logo of the company so let's pick up
some logo this one would be okay and
kind of visually design how I want my
page to look like and then okay I want
to basically collect information about
project so let's have a table of
projects in here so I'm going to take
the table and drop it into and then the
question is okay what data do you want
in the project so I want to create a
project object okay a business object
and it's going to have a name for the
project and we're going to have the
budget but it would be kind of currency
field and the due date as well which
would be a date so again I am very easy
to basically define the fields own you
can see that as I'm adding them Mobile
Hill they are reflected over here in my
application and then I can go back not
black soil fold and say I want to enable
create and edit and actually to get to
the edit page I want to click on the
name ok so then this becomes a link and
the delete and details basically the
full crud application and maybe I want
to have a filter on a name I can add
advanced search capabilities I can have
sort options whatever
and then I click finish in this age I
can run my application and I just click
run and my application basically works
here and I can start to create project
so maybe there's a project to a design
database okay I'm going to take me a lot
of money even though that if I use the
other tools it might be easier it's a
done by tomorrow okay Oh in two days and
then I can do save and close so this is
me basically I'm inserting the record
let's insert another the code let's do a
most fun thing a birthday party and we
have a budget of 500-600 whatever it is
on the weekend save and close
so you basically got your application
working but then you're saying you know
what actually when I go and I look at my
birthday party there's no information
then that they need here so let's go
back to the visual designer and pick up
another field like this one and drop it
here okay and this would be our comments
on the birthday and then I click OK and
I run it so now when I'm looking at the
birthday I can come over and add some
comments big party balloons and so what
you need to think about is okay you saw
what I did I just dragged and dropped
over the field into my UI but if you
think about what's going on behind the
thing when I did this I actually went
over and I did an altar table ed :
okay I then expose this as the rest
interface and then I built the
JavaScript UI on top of it but this is
what you think is a developer and
someone who's building this application
all you did is just break them dropped
another field in close here okay alright
so this might be a little bit too
trivial of an application right now we
have the project what about if there are
actually tasks in the project so let's
drag over another table and add an
object that will call this one tasks so
those are the things I need to do and so
I need to like the name of the task so
we'll call this one the task and there's
the cost of the task
again currency and maybe there's a who
actually does it who does it this might
actually come from a list of values so I
can for example create a new list of the
members okay and who can do stuff where
we can do something okay that we can do
something join us can do something
bill can do something oh maybe a bill
should be the first on the list code we
want him to do the most stuff mm all
right so now when I run this application
okay I can also add tasks to em to the
birthday so someone needs to get
balloons they have a budget of 20 bucks
and Bill is supposed to do that one so
now if you actually think about what I
did behind the scenes I actually created
another table master detail and another
reference table all just by dragging and
dropping inside my UI so this is kind of
the different approach of looking at
local where we are focusing on the UI
experience all right so now we built a
little application by the way this
application oh well when I showed this
type of things to my manager they all
say okay we got a data but we don't have
time to wait can you get us some chart
in here so you can basically go over and
we have a bunch of child down here and
we're actually using the orchid jet
component to create those child so we
can drag a child over here and let's say
for project show us the budget based on
the project name so now when I run this
every little breakdown of our projects
and the cost of each one by the way this
is how it's going to look on a big
screen and if I go over to a small
screen it's going to adjust to a smaller
screen and I can also define behavior so
for example on a smaller screen I can
say that I want this table instead of
showing it as a table I want to show it
when I'm on a phone in portrait I won't
show it to the list like that okay and I
don't want to show the due date because
it's too much of data then when I show
it in a small scale
going to look like this when I switch
the bigger screen going to look like
that so this is rebuilding an
application about eight minutes right
what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to say you know what I so like this
application that I think other people
can benefit from it so I'm going to
telling on this application and then I'm
going to stage my application and I'm
going to stage it with the development
better so inside the tool we also take
care of the life cycle of the
application you created that the
development stage and then you stage it
which is the testing stage and we create
another instance of the application we
separate the instance of the database
with the tables and in this case with
the data that people can use to test the
application and there's another step
that you can do which is publish the
application which takes it into the
production mode so I'm going to also
publish the application and once you
publish the application this becomes
your production version of the
application and so if you now click on
the run published application you'll get
a URL again you can access the same URL
but you'll get a user and password and I
can tell you the username puzzle and get
the application working okay however
what I wanted to show you is that I also
turn sharing on my application which
means that I can now go and create
another application specifically for a
mobile device okay and this would be my
mobile project mobile pod application
then we're going to create a page that
looks like this and you can see that
what is available here is templates that
are much more designed for smaller
screen and much more appropriate layout
for the types of device that you would
build on for a mobile device okay so
it's not just responsive it's actually
with design cutters that we have built
in
so in application so for example I'm
going to create an application that
starts with a list of my project and I
click create and I go into my visual
designer folders mobile phone and then I
can say let's add some data and want to
show it in this type of list all sorts
of lists right and I'm going to pick
this data form another application so I
click the add application and I can see
my project application available here
and when I pick this one up m to do I
can see the project object I can choose
it and then I can say in my list I want
to show the name of the project and I
want to show their budget this is what
we are going to enter it I can also
click the live preview which would show
me the actual two records that I had
inserted into the database so the same
approach of thinking visually about what
do you want to have in your page for
example you have this tab here child and
you want to have a child in here so what
you're going to do is you're going to
pick up so you're going to click here
and pick up a child component and to do
a pie chart over here drag it over add
the data from the project we want to
show the name and the budget okay next
finished and now you have also the child
component in there okay and in addition
you can add for example a detailed
screen okay we'll do a an open-ended
details screen like that this would be a
form type of screen and when I click
finish I can now go for my list into my
details page and on the details page I'm
going to add again data about maybe the
project okay I want to show here I want
to show the name and the budget and the
comments and the due date
maybe I want to move the Judaic up so
again think visually about how you won't
tell you I to look like and design it
and then just go over and run it so this
is now running inside my mobile emulator
okay and I can click on the birthday
party and see the details hey by the way
this is how it's going to look on iOS
and on Android we have the Android look
and feel so you have this type of going
back okay the child works here and you
can also test it on your phone okay so
if you click on this one it would
actually create a package of the
application that you can download to
your phone and test it on your device so
this was building a mobile application
with a local application builder cloud
service and I'm going to show you that I
can go back to my project and I'm going
to create a new version of the
application so while my application is
still running in production I want to
create version 2 of the application of
version 1.1 and again I can just do it
very easily from here and the platform
takes care of it and then what I'm going
to show you is that our platform is
actually extendable ok so I can go over
to my application settings and look at
extensions and I can add all sorts of
extensions for example I can add a new
UI component so in application builder
cloud service we have a bunch of UI
components that we provide you so the
child and you saw all sorts of fill
types but right now we don't have a map
component however I have a developed a
friend who can actually create this map
component and he creates those
components using Hotel jet JavaScript
HTML and I can actually show you the
code that he wrote so what I did here is
I actually just imported the JavaScript
code that this guy wrote which is
available here and if you actually look
at the JavaScript files ok is the
JavaScript world
and right now the data is coming from
bonuses maybe I need the data to come
from project fake changes
so this is one type of extension I can
do another type of extension I can do is
I can do a business object extension so
basically again I'm going to import from
a zip file I have another friend that
basically took the data that was
developed in Apex
and was exposed as the rest service and
created a wrapper for me that allows me
to access this data from an external
system okay and bring it into my
application so now I have another source
of data in my application actually if
you go into the data designer so far I
worked from the visual designer and I
showed you everything visual but you can
also look at the project field for
example from here okay you can look at
the list of fields then you can add for
example expenses field so you can also
do some data designing from here and for
example the expense field might be a
field that actually does an aggregation
of the total let's total cost okay of my
tasks so in a project now I have a nice
field that gets me the total of the
costs for a specific project okay so
this is me working on my custom object
that I created but I can also connect to
external rest services including
specifically the apex employees object
pick it up and then look at them what
type of object are in there there's an
employee object if I click Next I would
see which fills they have there there's
names and employees okay whether there's
an authentication oops
and then I can even test my service to
see if I can actually get result
hopefully yeah those should be the same
names that you saw in the previous demo
but those are random so it's out with
those I'll donate em alright and then I
can click finish so now what I did is I
went over in into my application that I
created from scratch
also added data from other application
using rest interfaces and now I can go
over and extend my application UI so for
example if I go back into my page
designer remember that we worked on the
project let's work on employees we can
go into live mode click here invoke go
to employees I can split my page again
into two sections this okay and into my
left section I would walk the table and
the table would come with data form
employees using the get all employees me
so that they expose the other and I'm
going to show just the email and the
name so maybe we'll show the names first
that it would be it on the left side and
then if I scroll up
whoops you saw I have a new UI component
a map component so I can now drag this
map component and put it inside my
application just like any other
component make it a little bit bigger
okay and now when I run my application I
also have that about my employees and
where they are located in the US for
example ok so that's all the demo I have
time to show I wanted to summarize a few
of the things you saw one thing you saw
is that both product allow you to build
a complete application without coding
anything ok now the point is that both
products also have hook points well you
could go in and code stuff but for most
of the mundane stuff of how do I connect
with data how do I do master detail how
do I visualize stuff why waste time
coding you can do it with a loco
development approach do it's much faster
the other aspect is that both platforms
allow you to do everything from a
browsers develop everything from a
browser and deploy in the cloud so you
don't need to download install configure
anything everything is out though so
that's one key advantage of the cloud
and both of them are also extendable in
the in the essence that you can actually
go over and add additional capabilities
whether you see y-components or business
object or access to external systems so
don't think about it is if I'm using the
low code I am limited to whatever the
tool gives me it's important that when
you're looking in low code platform you
choose something that allows you to
extend and then which one to use that's
kind of depending on what you prefer the
development approach how you think about
things and in some cases some people in
your company would use one some people
would use the other and as you so the
two can actually work together and
communicate basically using the common
database at the back end okay so that
was a quick review of what you can do
with local development tools today and
we have about one minute for questions
any first questions yes yes
yes so in apex for example if you'll
edit button the logic that you like in
there would be PL sequel and in ABC s if
you'll edit button the logic that he
would write in there would be JavaScript
okay so that's one difference between
the two tools 8x is a tool that comes
with the database uses the same language
as the database ABC s is the standalone
tool and uses Java as the development
JavaScript as the development language
okay but here you can add the buttons
and logic and stuff like that if we had
more than 45 minutes we would show you
how to do that but you can come to us
basically after the session we'll show
you how to add logic all right and if
you have any further questions just come
over here we'll be happy to answer them
if no you are free to go to your next
session thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
