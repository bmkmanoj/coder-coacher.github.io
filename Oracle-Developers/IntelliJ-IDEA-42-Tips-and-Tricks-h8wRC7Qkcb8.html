I'll give a Java 100 okay great so I'm
gonna give you a presentation on
IntelliJ tips and tricks I set the bar
very low for myself when I do these
presentations as long as you walk away
knowing three new things I'm happy right
distributed in one hour that's about
well 6 divided by about 33 now 20 no I
mean maths isn't my forte
it's a few minutes here in there okay so
if you learn more great if you learn
less well ask someone for your money
back right having said that how many of
you know IntelliJ brilliant how many of
you use it even more
how many of you use eclipse netbeans
Emacs copy Khan's one person does it
have refactoring support yet or not well
I heard Windows now has pasted the
Windows terminal and Windows 10 you can
now pay something in the terminal if
this wasn't 2014 I would be funny no
show anyway
yes so am i my goal here is that you do
not walk out of here the going saying
screw this I'm gonna go and use eclipse
from now on also I'm using the latest
EAP of IntelliJ 14 so if it crashes it's
not my fault either
we'll just blame some foundation okay so
I'm gonna separate this into serious
parts what I'll do is basically I'll
give you one tip and then I'll wait a
couple of minutes for you to write it
down
then we'll move on to the next tip
you're probably not gonna be able to
write down anything I'm joking sorry my
sense of humor is really bad on from
Europe how many people from Europe here
right I always should remember to first
ask and then have derogatory remarks how
many people from Spain okay me um we're
the ones that you know basically made
the whole Europe crash financially yeah
and Greece Greece yeah Greece hell there
you go well people can have a drink
later celebrate right Italy um I hear
Paris is next I mean France so right
your time will come Germany don't you
feel so command oh how many of you know
commando right that's good
um who's been using intelligent more
than a couple of days three weeks years
five years 10 years 15 years 14 years
right
Wow really 14 years okay I'll make you a
deal
if you learn something new I'll give you
a license are we allowed to give our
licenses
probably not right so
oor see what does that it it looks for
something commando I'm using I'm using
the shortcuts of Mac OS X 10.5 plus
which is the equivalent of saying if I
press ctrl W it will close the window
and not select some text if you're using
another type of Checotah she keyboard
shortcut at the bottom here when I press
a shortcut you can see that it pops out
there right at the very bottom you can
see this here so that shows you the
alternative shortcut that is actually a
plug-in which is called presentation
assist right which you can find here and
you can configure it to show different
shortcuts and it's very useful if you're
doing like pair programming especially
apart from doing presentations if you
don't pair programming and the person
sitting next to you is constantly what
did you just test what did you hit so
they can just look at that right just
shut up and look at that right so
command o what that does that goes to
type if you are using the default
keyboard shortcut on Windows or Linux
where every time I say oh you substitute
that for N and it only works for that
shortcut but anyway operation reference
count that will take me to a specific
type okay so if I do shift command
and write for example scheduler that
will take me to a specific file so
commando goes to time shift command all
goes to file the first one goes to type
I said that the other way around
command one takes me over to the project
Explorer okay one thing that I always
say to people is when you're using
IntelliJ or teaching it unplug the mouse
seriously just unplug the mouse and
focus on the keyboard because we have
built intelligent form the ground up to
be focused on keyboard so pretty much
everything you can do with the keyboard
and as you can see I don't have a mouse
right the touchpad over here doesn't
count so if you're doing command or what
I'm doing a demo I can do that if you're
doing commando and then you do it for
example I can say I don't know test and
you can use wildcards right so you don't
have to do everything exactly like that
and of course you saw that what I was
doing in separating operation reference
count I'm actually using camelcase
completion all right so RC will take me
to that now who can tell me what this
does
oh yeah bloody obvious isn't it yeah
coming on us is it gonna do sync 240
times or repeat hello world forty times
yeah it takes you to command all now
I'll command Oh takes me to any symbol
so we've gone too far we've gone to type
now I can go to any symbol throughout
the project so if I write for example
some float that's gonna take me to
everything that some float now sometimes
I want to go to a specific some float
imagine it for example you're looking
for for a method called index we've got
thousands of indexes in your project
right so what you can do is you can
limit this down based on type name space
etc so what I can do is if I want to go
to the one over here at the bottom which
is green do you know why it's green
because it's indicating as tests right
so it says it's test so what I could do
is this is an operation some tests so
what I could do in fact is do OST some
float and that will take me down to that
type and then the methods contain in
that type or name space okay how many of
you knew that okay how many of you have
learned three things so far right you
can leave go okay so we can also of
course go to files so if I do shift
command oh and well sorry folders and I
say for example our X I will take me to
folder I can start with the bar the
slash and that will take me to folder so
those are the main things to go navigate
here and there don't use the mouse don't
ever use the mouse never never never
if you are in the project window you can
also expand things it doesn't work if
it's not expanded but if it is expanded
I could do for example big mighty class
and that will also take me to big mighty
class as you can see right now in
IntelliJ 14 I think it was from 14 yeah
we invented this thing called search
anywhere what we then invented it was
called search everywhere and if you
press double shift
you can search everywhere literally
everywhere right if I write for example
plugins you can see that it shows me
anything it shows me classes it shows me
files and I can tap to go through the
different sections right so the top one
is classes files etc right and I can do
things with this as well I
have to just search for this so for
example of course if I hit plugins and
say okay take me to plugins over here
that will open up the plugins and it
will show me the plugins right okay
nevermind so yeah it should I'll do it
later that was just that was just to see
if you're awake are you awake good so if
I do toolbar do you see that it says
show main toolbar and it's got like a
little flick switch right so if I hit
enter that will hide it and show it
right so you don't have to go to the
menus to do those kinds of things if I
press the right arrow so if I do shift
everywhere anywhere and start to go with
the left arrow what I will do is go
through the command history that I've
had okay so you can start to use that
for navigating to things I still kind of
recommend if you want to go to a type if
you want to go to a file etc probably to
use the the specific shortcuts because
it's more concrete to exactly what you
want to do but the search everywhere
also works and one last thing you can do
with this is if for example if I do run
or run have it I've got like you know
the run and debug configurations here so
if I do for example default package and
it shows me the default package runner
let me just there you go and you can see
that it's written debug you see on the
right its debug if I hold down the shift
key then it turns into run so that's the
fast way also to do run and debug from
there okay command seven shows me the
project structure which from here then I
can also do like ref count and go
directly to symbol okay now that's not
really most the most appropriate way to
do it what you can also do is press
command f12 and that will bring you the
pop-up that will show you how to go to a
specific symbol so for instance here I
could say count and it will take me
directly to the count okay going back to
the project window you can see that as I
change here nothing really happens
alright if I want to go to a file what I
have to do is hit enter for each one now
I can hit enter or if I want to but that
doesn't actually focus it to towards the
editor
if I want to focus on the editor what I
do is I can press escape and then that
will focus my cursor towards the editor
right what I can also do is instead of
having to go to its selected and press
Enter and then escape what I can also do
is just press f4 on the file and now
we'll do that shortcut for me directly
take it directly to that file and place
the cursor there now here at the top we
have this thing called gears which is
basically options because at some point
somebody in some world decided that a
gear means settings and we have this
Auto scroll to source and auto scroll
from socks right so basically if you
click that what happens is that every
time I change it will automatically
change for me okay and the reverse
process as well so if I go for example
to Operation ref count you would see
that it will automatically jump up to
the file if I were to press Auto scroll
front source okay how many of you use
that so that's how you kind of navigate
throughout the files etc now we also
have this thing called the navigation
bar which is at the top here if you
click on this when the mouse works you
can see that I can actually expand each
of these and go to all the different
ones right and even on these I can do
searches pretty much everywhere now
don't do that pretty much everywhere in
IntelliJ you can search if you just
start to type in a window you can search
I mean if I go to the great old window
over here and I do for example compile
example it will search there as well
okay always you can search now this
thing over here how many of you use you
shouldn't really in fact we can switch
it off show navigation bar we switch it
off ok if f4 one whatever reason I want
to get the navigation bar what I can do
is just press a keyboard shortcut to get
it pop up exactly where I want it okay
so maximize in real estate get rid of
your navigation bar and inside here I
can still do all of the navigation
so I can just bring it up and I can do
for example rx and do subscriptions and
on this I can even from there in that
specific point in time I can create a
new file etc okay any questions no great
function key alt left or out home for
Windows and Linux users how many Linux
users we fixed the font rendering
somewhat and we apologize for 15 years
No Oh apparently it wasn't our fault
okay now has anybody noticed anything
about my ID what yes brilliant you're
awesome but did you know that from
before no okay
so anybody else notice what he just said
I only have a single tab open right the
reason I only have a single tab open is
because I don't like tabs in fact let me
go to the tabs where are the tabs a
tabbed placement oh look I can just
bring it up there but let's go to
settings I'll go to tabs editor tabs the
best thing you can do with this is
either limit it to one or switch it off
you don't need tabs in IntelliJ and
there's a look I picked this up from a
bug report that someone was saying when
I reach 680 tabs then what happens is
that you rearrange things yeah I got
lucky I got a I got a very very soft
table now when you smash your head it
doesn't hurt you that much
you don't need tabs to be honest with
you I mean where times have inherent you
know that we've inherited the concept of
tabs from browsers pretty much right
it's kind of like also people that come
from sublime or you know other kind of
editor editors I say editors not IDs and
they say oh I want the tabs to be
numbered no computers memorize numbers
not humans right why do you need numbers
on your tabs you don't you don't need
tabs
you don't need tabs and IntelliJ because
if you want to navigate you use the
navigation keys that I've just shown you
if you want to go back and forth between
files a lot of people say I use tabs to
go back and forth between files press
command e okay command e will take you
to the recent files shift command e will
take you to the recent edited files you
don't need tabs and it's smart enough to
always alternate the two files that
you're constantly using okay so just get
rid of those damn tabs seriously and
don't file anymore bug reports for those
tabs then of course you know you can
like go with commanding in fact and I
kid you not I use command e so much that
four months ago the e key on my macbook
died and I was walking around with an
external keyboard fortunately I got it
replaced about two weeks ago so now I
have a fresh new MacBook - well keyboard
key key to destroy so you can also use
ctrl tab and ctrl tab is very fast also
switch between the recent tabs that
you've been using and also notice that
you can also go to the windows from
control tab so you don't have to do any
of the you know navigation with the with
a key Mouse anymore okay so let's go to
for example operation time-lapse alright
and I can go for example 2-0
subscription and I can press control B
and that takes me to what that takes me
to the actual declaration of symbol
serial subscription okay
now sometimes I don't want to do that
you
I just used command II I don't want to
do that sometimes I just want to see
what that declaration is in place
without having to navigate back and
forth to it so if you press command Y
you can see that in place okay and you
can extend that you can see that
decoration in place okay
so that's how it allows you to easily
quickly view things without having to
actually move around from your file and
lose your context right you can also of
course press f1 at all times you know
that key that we never want to use which
shows you something similar but this
time it shows you the quick
documentation and now let's go for
example and do some navigation between
types so let's go to a serial sub okay
and for example is unsubscribed let's go
to this okay now if I press control B
shift control B and control B doesn't do
absolutely anything but what does that
do who can tell me no it doesn't it just
says no implementation file so command B
goes to the actual implementation okay
right and shift alt command B sorry I'll
come on V goes to the actual
implementation doesn't it but there's no
implementation there let's go and find
it here so let's go to subscriptions
here now if I press all command B what
that shows me is all of the different
implementations right so here I can also
do searches so I can find something here
safe safe observer and do searches there
as well okay so that's quickly to go
from implementation to super type etc
and you could always navigate back and
forth by pressing the command left
bracket at left square brackets and
right square brackets okay that's very
quickly navigating back and forth right
so focus on using the keyboards for
navigation right and get rid of your
tabs open up your real estate now
talking about real estate
the next thing I want to focus on a
little bit is the actual editor okay so
here you can see that I don't really
have toolbars I don't have these in fact
most of the time I also hide this at the
top there so these windows I kind of
open now to show you but normally what I
do is just open and close as I want
those windows but if I have for example
the windows open and I'll show you this
in a minute
let's go to where's brett-o so I have
this window open what I can do is in one
click maximize my editor space right so
if you press shift command f12 what that
does is maximize your editor space
getting rid of all of the different tool
windows that you have open I so for
example if I have the terminal window
open here and I have some other window
on the sides just shift command f12
focus into editor mode and forget all of
the windows you can actually get the
windows back by going to this little
icon here and selecting the window you
can click on it as well and it will
highlight the windows on the side but I
told you to never use the mouse so what
you can also do is press command twice
and it will highlight all of the
different windows and then you can
either press the number which there we
do number the windows or you can just
click on it and it will show you that
window okay so that's how you kind of
like maximize the space now if you want
to go one step more we've got this other
thing which is called the presentation
mode which is shift control P and what
that does is goes into full screen and
completely maximizes the space of the
editor right so this is kind of like the
no distraction kind of thing and you can
also see that it makes everything bigger
you can actually adjust the size of the
font for that inside in the in the
settings you can set that the font size
it's great for presentation it's also
great for kind of focusing on just
writing code for some reason in this
version they decided to limit the
margins from left and right I don't
agree I like the whole space I'm gonna
go on argue with someone and maybe get
the whole space back or at least make it
configurable because us developers what
we
like most more than anything in the
world configuration settings right so
another thing that you can actually do
which I do a lot with when working with
multiple monitors is you can press shift
F 4 and extract that editor window right
and then what I can do is it drag it to
the side like that but I'll lose it now
so that's really really helpful for work
when I'm like I'm copying pasting
cutting I'm done joking I don't copy
base code but yeah yeah I should have
said that should I yeah anyway right so
good here's a question for you just to
make sure you're not sleeping I said to
you that everything is possible with
with the keyboard so who can tell me how
I can resize the project window with the
keyboard command
let's try command shift arrow
all right there you go who said that
right brilliant well done you do you
have a license huh
another one is always good you're trying
to sell it on the black market okay
right
now the editor as I said it allows you
to do you know focus you focus you on
editing etc now if you if you are um I
don't know the coop the exact word for
this but you know that IntelliJ is kind
of extensible so you can go to plugins
or other plugins and we have this
plug-in called idea vim right install
JetBrains plug-in idea go away idea fin
right if you install that you get two
things first you get basically pretty
much all of the keyboard shortcuts and
behavior of them right the second thing
you get is the
ability to never ever exit IntelliJ
which is kind of what happens with
people that start vim right they never
know how to get out
I thought you get that Joker the first
time but now how many of you use vim how
many of you really use it because you
wanted to use it and not really never
knew how to get up yeah I remember the
first times I used to play with Wynn
what it wasn't women was VI back in the
old days on the back servers and that I
was like I don't I mean like at home I
could reboot my machine if I couldn't
get out at university I'm like can you
just reboot that mainframe I can't exit
vim so yeah so if you like them it's
actually pretty good there are a little
bit of complaints and also notice that
vim and IntelliJ serve different
purposes one is to make you happy the
other one is to the personnel what one
is to navigate and have the semantics of
the project refactorings things like
that vim is very very good at editing
text right and moving between text and
things like that
okay so they complement each other very
well also how do you select text yes
what I are actually I asked that from
someone and they said well go like this
I said no don't use a mouse and then he
said to me well hold the shift key and
go like that no that's not exactly what
I want so if you're using the default
layout you would press command W which
we screwed up and the Mac users got
really mad at us they said why you
selecting text when I want to close the
window so what you can do is you can
just press alt up out down and as you
notice this is what it's doing is
semantically select anything so it goes
from variable to declaration to the body
of a method etc so if I come for example
to this method is going to select the
method name and then it's going to
select that sorry if I come to this
class it's going to select the class
name then it's going to select the
entire class if I go to a method it's
going to select the method and then
method name and then the method okay
that's how you use things and then you
know and then you can actually then use
the
shift keys and commands to move code up
and down right you select stuff and you
move code up and down don't ever go
around copying and pasting and doing
things like that you should yes I select
some code for example here and I can
move this up and down okay see let me
know when I can stop you good good okay
good so you know why you don't come you
don't like cut and paste here's why
because I'm like oh I need to take this
line here and I'm going to yeah I'm
gonna cut this and I'm gonna have to
come and paste it here and then when you
come to paste instead of control-v or
command-v you press command-c and you
copy an empty line now you can actually
go iterate through your clipboard by
pressing shift command V right and also
get all of the contents of your
clipboard so if I copy the line here and
then I come and copy this line here and
if I go to shift command V you can see
that I have all of my clipboard okay
so even if that happens we've got you
more or less covered now one of the
things that they really asked us for in
IntelliJ for many many years by the way
how many of you are using 14 who's using
13 hmm so if after this session you
don't upgrade I've done a really bad job
if you do upgrade let me know I'm gonna
get Commission joking I'm joking I'm
joking so let's go to some very bad
class no I don't want that class let's
go sis I'm very this is this one is much
for my dog the things that I come up
with when I'm writing demos it's just
like ridiculous I'll look factoring
methods create factories that's some
Java code for you
right let's go to me there you got yeah
this you know what this is this is
called Kotlin this is not any kind of
subliminal advertising okay
colin is an open-source programming
language that we're working on sorry
anyway yeah
colin is a is a as i like to call it it
but no i'm not gonna say that because
you know I'm being recorded right it's
me
for dumb it knows no anyway you're not
gonna get that joke right so sorry
how are you doing great okay so here one
of the things that they really asked us
for is this thing called multi karat
support right these were the hipsters
from the sublime users and you know
they're not and the other editor users
that they say we want multi carats so we
introduced multi karat so you can now
come here and you can get multiple
carats Wow
is that cool
now a little bit right
pardon okay so you can get multiple
carrots and you can escape it with just
pressing the escape no I wish you didn't
ask that so remember how I said you can
do everything in IntelliJ without a
mouse there is one exception it's um
it's the multi carrot we're gonna try
and get a keyboard combination for it's
just nobody thought of it just goes to
show why we didn't do it in 15 years
because nobody in Japanese uses it
either what you do is you press shift
out and then you click the mouse
wherever you want to position it
actually there's no real other way right
because you need to say where you want
this because this could be anywhere so
it's not because we just don't want it
it's just like you know this is very
weird right you can't there's no other
way to like I don't know maybe we can
make some interactive stuff with you
know what is that device that the Xbox
has what is it called Kinect yeah maybe
you can do that there there and there
go right you can actually if you want to
use the mouse what you can do is if I
press ctrl-g what that does is select
now and then I'll select all of the
instances of now right anywhere where
they are well no that's sorry that one
what it does is it selects on the exact
line right so now I get a horizontal
line so I can do things here if I want
to for example let's say can or with
what I can do is press shift command G
and that's what sorry control command G
let's see this okay this so control
command G it selects all of the dishes
okay so you can select the word and
select all of the instances of the
or anything in that sense there you can
use the mask when you have to select the
different places you need to use the
mouse okay so one thing also in terms of
editing and moving code around that
we've seen there's a shift command l and
ab command L alt command L and what that
does it cleans up code how many of you
know about this right so basically an
intelligent write as messy code as you
want I'm saying in terms of way you put
things not in terms of horrible horrible
code right you have to always inject
your dependencies you know they told me
that in kindergarten right so once you
do that then you can run your code clean
up and then what that will do is will it
will auto organize your code based on
alphabetical order or however you want
to set that you can configure that in
the configurations and just run it on
this specific file or run it in all
files in the directory or just optimize
your imports and stuff like that okay so
you can do that and you can do that on
anything so for example I can do that on
on HTML as well that's one of the things
that is good about IntelliJ that we try
and provide you with the same kind of
support independently of the technology
or the language that you're using okay
where it's possible okay in other places
we have to work miracles for things like
JavaScript how many of you like
JavaScript
what if I if I saw all the hands raised
in a Java conference I would be kind of
scary how many of you are forced to use
JavaScript right you know they always
say to me when I do presentations on
Kotlin which is the programming language
which open-source of X let's stop with
the Sybilla yeah okay I we are calling I
do a presentation on Colin and they
always say to me why another language
hmm we only have enough and I say you
imagine if they had asked that question
when JavaScript was invented and a
person hadn't invented it the world
would be pretty much a nicer place right
now then I realize that maybe he's right
now anyway so here's something that I
ran into recently right talking about
code organization single option single
report so that's under editor code start
you see that's the good thing about
intelligent when you're looking for
things don't go navigating just type it
right so code style Java there's this
thing here which is called the imports
use single import right and what's the
purpose of that have you noticed in Java
you import every type right and there
was a recent session at Java zone by a
friend of mine and he was asking this
question of like why in Java do we
constantly import every time and he went
looking for an answer
and the common most common answer on
Stack Overflow was well any good ID will
handle that for you right but that's not
the response that's kind of just like as
the title session title was called it
was you know sacred count so you don't
need to do that right you I mean
historically that's because list on awt
and list on somewhere else is going to
coincide in tec-9 namespaces but on the
whole
that really doesn't happen so if you
don't want to have all of that ugly
imports at the top of your java files
what you can do is click on use single
class import and what that will do is
import the entire namespace the entire
package okay if you I can see a few
faces in the crowd going that's not what
we do around here no no no no you're not
gonna change that you're not just gonna
come and change that now okay fair
enough
just do it if you wanna be like you know
you want to please everyone
you can like come to arrangement okay
you can plan a sprint and you know talk
about what how you're going to configure
IntelliJ and you can do polka planning
and save right we're going to set it at
three and once we hit over three classes
then what we'll do is convert from
individual imports to a star okay and
then you can have your retrospective to
see how that went I'm not taking I'm not
taking making any you know puns or
anything at a July I'm just nevermind
so have you learned anything who's bored
it's ok you can raise your hand why I'm
gonna remember you okay now how many of
you use live templates in IntelliJ
they're very very powerful right live
templates are basically what allows you
to not write code okay so you can just
select you have all of these different
likes snippets that you can configure so
for example let's go to let's go to
other for instance and P SVM
so what other PS VM does is if you see
it generates the public static void main
that's why it's called PS VM right and
we have this concept of placeholders and
is a special placeholder which means
this is where I want my cursor to be
right but you can have as many types of
variables as you want so for example
here I have var math.max var and
end so you can repeat
VARs right you can say when I type
something and every every dollar thing
you see here is basically a placeholder
so when you spit out this template what
happens is that it creates a placeholder
so if I come here for example to my
sorter for instance here and I write MX
that will create a placeholder for me
and you can see that as I type here it
repeats it on the other side right you
can create these live templates yourself
right so and then you can change the
scope and you can say for example this
live template is available in this
specific type of files etc and then for
each of these placeholders each of these
variables you can also give values right
so you can say for example this variable
of type double and skip if it's defined
and you can basically define a whole
bunch of macros right so for instance
when you create a new class you can say
that when I create the class it should
take the same as the file name right and
that's how we actually create classes
and intelligent right we're using this
concept of macros to do that and live
templates you really should be using
because they make you work much faster
right so here for example P SVM main
let's go Sun to something else for
example bacon 20 class over here and I'm
sorry I shouldn't name not that sorry
I might need that later so I don't want
to delete it
I'm just covering my rear sight did you
get that all right so what was that so I
can do P SVM and what that will do is
basically spit out the the template for
PSV I mean and then I get the static
method there okay and here you should
like just use IntelliJ the way it should
be used right use the completion the way
it should be used and I can say for
example buffer reader equals equals new
and then now if I hit that I'm gonna get
completion for everything right it's
basically saying I can create anything
there right so how do I get just
something that inherits from buffer
reader
that's called smart completion which is
really what you should be using an
intelligent okay don't get that
completion just use the smart completion
so I can say buffer reader and then here
it says oh you need something so I say
for example does it need an is a reader
so I'll go ahead and create a reader and
then I'll hit an Tilton and I'll create
a field reader and what does that say
it's not been initialized so it should
initialize it for me initialized
variable so let IntelliJ work for you
right to create from usage use the
templates let it work for you don't sit
there and do things manually yourself
okay and we've taken these templates a
little bit further so for instance let's
go over to the sorter sorter and note
here that for example I can do list of
string right oh let me just create new
list of string new list of string and
then I'm gonna introduce a variable
there I'll call it strings right what
did I do wrong what did I do wrong huh
ArrayList what did I do wrong it's so so
bad okay now I can do strings dot and I
say add oh and I'm like oh no wait um no
actually what I want to do is
I want to check to see if the string is
not not so what you can do is instead of
doing strings and then delete it and
then do if null we have now this thing
called postfix completion and I can say
for example not null and it does it for
me right we introduce that in a tool
which is called resharper which is a
plugin for visual studio that we have
and then we brought it over to IntelliJ
and then we define the roadmap for
Eclipse and NetBeans and I think they
have it now right it's good okay so you
have postfix completion or not now on
try etc a whole bunch of things allow
you to do that positive completion right
now you can't extend it it would be
great at some point if you could cut tie
that into life templates and be able to
extend that but right now you cannot do
that okay so how many of you work with
HTML right I'm in HTML here and if I
want to create a div I will do div id
equals blah blah right and I do it like
that no you do not do that you do blah
blah okay that's called Emmet how many
of you know that that's how you write
HTML okay now let's say for example I
want to write a bullet list so I'll do
ul right and I've got a entry let's say
I want five how do I do that
well there's a very good keyboard
shortcut in IntelliJ called command D
what that does it duplicates the line
right so there you go that's another tip
feet now I'm joking
well there is command B but that's not
how you do it you can actually continue
to use M it I could do ul and then I
want Li times o let's let's do I don't
know 19 okay
another so it's basically
shall I I've never done this before this
can crash and go terribly long Oh what
the hell Oh output is too big
haha well done you oh look 190 worked
Wow
whoa hold on no that wasn't a hundred
nevermind anyway so that's how you write
HTML okay that also works in Java no it
doesn't that is basically using the
concept of CSS selectors right and
combining these CSS selectors to allow
you to write HTML much faster okay so
also if you have for example a
calculator class note that a lot of
times you can actually use alt enter
which are running intentions or quick
fixes and they allow to also generate
code so I can directly create a generate
test for this right and IntelliJ smart
enough to find the route and place that
test in the corresponding file and name
it etc and the alt enter thing is what
you should always be using when you're
doing TDD right I write some method name
the method name doesn't exist I hit alt
enter it creates it for me now
when you want to do TDD or when you
doing completion you know that this
thing over here right that's green
little box there is telling us whether
there's any errors in the file whether
there are any warnings etc right so here
you can see that there are some errors
now if you right-click that you have the
option to say go to high-priority
problems only or go to next problem
if you unmarked that it will go through
tips as well right so all of those
little entries will show you the hints
and suggestions and warnings if you
leave it checked it will only show you
the errors ok and then you can navigate
back and forth through those errors with
the keyboard as well so I can go to
navigate I can go to next highlighted
error and previous highlighted error
using f2 right why does why is that
related well if you have that option
ticked and you're doing create from
usage right instead of then having to
lift the mouse and go to the method name
and hit alt enter you can just press
shift F to that will pop to the previous
error which is the element that you've
just written
and is not defined and here alt-enter
okay so you don't have to take your
hands off the keyboards
right any questions no yes
yeah fix it yes you just basically you
come here right there so you're saying
that for example I want this to span and
then yeah so you wouldn't do it like
that right what you could do is refactor
rename and call this span okay so the
refactoring which is control T basically
works in pretty much any most of the
languages okay if you're doing it on the
other way you're doing it span here then
you can do an intention and say rename
end act to div to span right but if
you're at the bottom just use the
refactoring okay so talking about
refactoring so you know I'm not going to
go through all of the refactorings but
if you press ctrl T we've got a bunch
load of refactorings you should all know
them off by heart they are based on
scope and they are based on language so
different types of languages offer
different options but one important
thing that you should note about this is
that it's again context aware so let's
go to some real Java code factory
factory method to create factory
factories okay how many of you have that
method in your code be honest hey yeah
so if I'm here and I press couldn't
command alt V which is extract variable
what it's gonna do is going to extract
the variable for me right so I can do
that and now I've got that sorry I'm
gonna do that now got the variable
extracted okay but if I select some text
here so if I select some text and then
do command V it does a different
refactoring for me right so it extracts
a parameter right in this case it's just
going to do a concatenation which then
we can go and hit alt enter and say
replace with string format okay so based
on
now this doesn't only work in strings
but point being is that based on what
you're selecting the scope etc different
refactorings are available so it's
intelligent in trying to figure out what
exactly the context is and making those
refactorings of available okay
there is also how many of you using Java
8 okay
so we've also got some refactorings for
Java 8 you can see that if the project
level is using lambdas and you're
targeting JDK 8 then you this is
underlined and you can hit alt enter you
say replace that with a collection and
here I can replace it for for each right
so it's great in teaching you some of
the aspects of Java 8 when you're
starting out and not trying to figure
out how to do things okay
one thing is we have this concept of
inspections so all of these things that
you see here are different inspections
right and sometimes you want to run them
sometimes you want them switch off etc
if you go to inspections here on the
settings this is basically analyzing
your code and all of these you can
switch on and you can switch off and you
can set the the severity level you can
say this is a warning this error
etcetera sometimes if you just want to
run a specific inspection you could just
run an inspection by name so there's an
inspection which people don't like to
run which is questionable name and what
that does it basically runs the
inspection to see things that are
questionable of a questionable nature in
name like for example I've renamed up
named of our variable of type our are
and things like that okay so it's kind
of notice that my code is part one is
this a my code this is rx Java which is
perfect code so there's no questionable
names but you can basically run names
manually okay one thing that people are
not aware of how many of you have used
this concept of structural search so
this is a very very very powerful
concept first of all note this shift
command a I keep pressing I can go to
any keyboard shortcut that I don't know
using shift command a okay and I could
just write the command name the thing
that I want to do and normally here it
shows me so if I do
structurally it will go to that option
and you can see here that it shows me
the keyboard shortcut so next time I
don't have to use it if you don't know
keyboard shortcuts shift command a is
your friend that's the one keyboard
shortcut you gotta remember so if I go
to shift command a I get this
window which is a structural search and
this is a really really really really
powerful concept okay well this is to
basically doing is taking regular
expressions to the next level it's
combining the concept of placeholders
that we just saw in templates with
searching for patterns in your code so
what I'm doing here is I'm saying look
for this kind of search this kind of
pattern in my code and for each of these
I can actually edit the variables and I
can say what the exception type should
be how many if it they should inherit
something you know all of these
different parameters based on the type
of inspections that are based on the
type of variables and if I hit find that
will now find all of these types of
exceptions for me which basically in my
case is saying look for all places in my
code when I have try catch empty blocks
right this is ideal for finding code
smells in your code right and what you
can do is you can combine this with the
concept of inspections so if we go to
inspections here we can actually add
structural search so we can actually add
these right we can add these and set
severity levels for them so now they're
highlighted in our code
so those 1,800 inspections that intellij
comes with you can actually extend it
with more using these types of patterns
and then you can also provide a
replacement and what the replacement
will do is then when you hit alt enter
replace that code for you
so you're basically extending
functionality of IntelliJ with custom
inspections which is great to find code
smells and patterns inside your code
base okay so that's something very very
powerful that you should be using right
now to finish off a couple of other
things I've shown you this shift command
a which basically allows you to go to
any type of command any type of thing
you want yes you have a question
debugging tricks wool yes but and it's
not in my repertoire hello yes one thing
that you probably don't know is this one
over here right if you click more you
can set a whole bunch of things did you
know that so here you can basically set
a condition log too far log to console
only stop on a specific breakpoint etc
also in intelligent 14 there's a plugin
that ships out of the box which is
called cronin and what cronin does it
basically runs your application records
it and then you can step back and forth
in time through the debugger and at
every single point in time to see the
value of the stack trace value of
variables etc okay that comes out of the
box yes Cronan
I would answer that but I don't have
time right now
I'll leave that as an exercise to the to
the public
control shift f8 well done who said that
thank you I learned something one thing
how many of you do pair programming okay
have you ever gone to someone else's
laptop and they're like oh where are my
keys it's all different right yep
press ctrl tilde and you get the quick
switch scheme right key map select the
key map done ctrl command 3 done ok we
keep that key quick switch always the
same so that you don't get lost it's
kind of like you know take a phone and
put it in Swami and you're like how do I
go back to English so we keep that the
same
and but it's very very useful for when
you're doing kind of pair programming
ctrl V is a very great little submenu
forget operations but these things what
is even more powerful is the ability for
you to provide your to define your own
sub menus your own list of actions and
you do that by quick lists so if you go
to quick lists you can create quick
lists you can create work quick I write
that wrong
quick list what I can do is I can create
my own custom little menus with my own
custom data operations and then give my
own custom little keyboard binding
alright so as you saw that get quick
shortcut menu or that quick switch you
can create these yourself okay then you
have alt f12 you have a terminal for all
of us that love terminal who loves
terminal I love terminal yes you get the
complete terminal here right if you're
doing any kind of like HTTP applications
etc you want to test your HTTP endpoint
we have a restful client built-in where
you can basically do get posts set your
cookie values response headers the
response set all of your different
here you can even pass in file uploads
you can pass in multi-part data all of
that is built-in and in addition to that
of course I haven't even covered all of
the things in terms of the different
technology so for example we have
JavaScript filter that's a JavaScript
debugger that allows you to do
client-side debugging and server-side
debugging of JavaScript okay so you know
we do have to do JavaScript once in a
while so that should help by the way in
14 also there's a built-in decompiler
right so you can just if you don't have
the code you can just decompile directly
to finish off one thing which I told you
at the beginning you probably would have
not stayed for the entire duration of
the session shift-command a I told you
that is when you don't know how to do
something look for it okay it's like
switch look and feel I normally used
Arcola I never use light cooler right
but it's not the best thing to do
presentations on what did I do look and
feel okay the other one is how many of
you have ever hit the Help button right
there's a help menu it's there for
something and if you go to productivity
guide you probably think some webpage is
gonna open up and say Oh IntelliJ is so
productive no but how many think that
something around those lines no actually
you get this and what this is is keeping
track of what you do right in a good way
not like
a couple of years ago this wouldn't have
been of any you know nobody would have
said what are you doing there nowadays
it's kind of like ah what are you doing
there yeah so what this does is
basically show you most of the things
that I've shown you and it tells you the
group of things that it belongs to and
it tells you how many time you've used
it when was the time you used it and as
you click things it tells you the exact
feature as well so what you can do is
you can sort this for example by things
you've never used and then go through
them and say oh look I didn't know I can
run in query database by just going on
the text and it excuse me hitting alt
enter etc okay so remember that help
sometimes it does work right yes that's
oh yes there's also the help and there's
the PDF which is the default where is it
default key map reference and what that
does is show you a PDF with all of the
keyboard mappings which you can print
out and stick to your table okay time is
up now exactly any questions yes
we put config files on the source
control the only thing that you leave
out is a couple of files one is called
the workspace and there's another one I
can't remember that you leave out but
the rest you check in because then you
get all your life templates all of their
inspection settings etc that you can
share across the entire team okay thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
