Toronto I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network we're bringing you a
series of interviews with some of the
session speakers from today's event and
in this particular case that speaker is
Herman fair Herman tell the folks at
home what you do for Oracle table so
saponin thanks for having me here
always a pleasure you don't know what
you're signing up for my name is larry
Baer I'm working at Oracle and product
management on the database side and our
group is basically responsible for the
upper layer of the database everything
that has to do with data processing that
we can do with the Oracle at home so
you've been you've been delivering this
session you've got one today you
delivered it I think the last time we
spoke was in New York City CDC give me a
give me a two-minute version of that
session okay so my session and this is a
shame shameless self emotions to 10p
right here folks you heard it here
simplified in for a fast for detection
recycle we will step you or I will step
you through using sequel to identify a
pattern in bank transactions to identify
the bad guys confusing sequel very
simple sequel and let me tell you if I
can do it you can do it so show up it to
10 and you will learn something yeah I'm
talking about how to use sequel as a
development language because sequel is
very often forgotten or or undervalued
as a development language itself are the
techniques that you describe in your
session applicable only to data in a
database that's a very good question Bob
no the short answer is no when we talk
about the Oracle database we're the
database is evolving into a system where
data processing and data management
doesn't have to be coupled together
anymore right if you look in the old
wave and people were talking about
databases they very often with
Kings about the updated you the whole
package that you have a system that
hosts you data that manages your data
and oh by the way it works with the data
as well so what we doing and what we
what we developed over the last couple
of years is building a platform where we
basically decoupled the data processing
from the data management and the
techniques that I will show later on can
be done on data that this inside the
database as well as data that lives
outside the data base and what's also a
in addition very cool to it it is it is
when you look at sequence equal is the
language for relational databases so
people always think right away they have
to have the data in tables and columns
to actually do something with it this is
not true when we look specifically at
data that is generated nowadays from
newer devices or so log files or whole
internet of things you will for example
see that Jason is a very very popular
data format how you store data with with
the metadata included and what we
introduce for example in a 12-1
databases that we can work against data
stored in a JSON format and we enhance
the sequel language and by the way this
is an system of since beginning of this
years is equal 2016 2017 the standard is
16 to work against JSON objects right
from within the database with sequel so
it's this schema on read paradigm that a
data access time you decide what the
data looks like and what your what
you're actually extracting from the data
whether you are interested in a customer
name or very interested in the balance
of a customer account which is embedded
within a JSON document so at data access
time you define the schema in the
attributes and the information you want
to extract out of it and this
functionality works coming back to your
question against data that is stored
within the database or store the data
that is stored outside the database
for example could access to our external
table framework so will you be
presenting this session or any other
session anywhere else in the future no
this is my whose is it you're doing it
this is it I'm gone yes then they hide
me again at headquarters but I thought
the session itself the content we have a
very capable people that will deliver
the same content in other Oracle code
events as well so we will have it next
next week in Berlin in German for
everybody who wants to hear it in German
and I think we have it in other events
as well in Prague it's there so yes so
if you'd like to attend any of these
upcoming Oracle code events in in
Germany or anywhere else on the
remaining events in the tour visit
developer oracle.com slash code you'll
find a complete list of all the upcoming
events along with information on how you
can submit a session proposal so you can
present your own session at an upcoming
Oracle code event for the Oracle
technology Network I'm Bob Rupert thanks
for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
