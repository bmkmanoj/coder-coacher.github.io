internet-of-things if you were the
keynotes yesterday the jawan keynotes
this is something you might have heard
quite a few times the term repeated it
was a theme throughout the keynotes and
you will see this through our cha won
this year and if you've been coming to
John one for over the past years you'll
probably have noticed that we haven't
spoken much about IOT in the past this
is kind of the first job one where we're
really emphasizing on the IOT message so
part of the reason being that we have
been doing a lot of background work
trying to figure out how does Java fit
into the IOT space what what are the
opportunities over here and just
studying this market and IOT is nothing
new I mean we didn't invent this
obviously it's been around for a while
in fact machines talking to each other
machines talking to datacenters has been
around probably since the beginning of
computing itself but IOT has really
picked gained prominence so the last few
years because of a few reasons and we'll
talk about those reasons different
companies call IOT different names
IBM calls that m2m or smarter planet
cisco calls that internet of everything
we thought of coming up with the name
ourselves we someone suggested internet
of stuff but you know the acronym was
already taken by us so so we decided to
just settle on IOT for now so let's see
where we go with this this is not a
marketing exercise yet I showed you guys
the cheesy video at the start but was
just to entertain you while you were
waiting but this is something we're
still investigating something that we
want to work with you guys to develop
and talk about more so with that let me
get started the obligatory disclaimer
that you'll see in all our code
talks basically which means that based
on this information don't go out and buy
oracle stock alright so this is a very
simple agenda we're going to talk about
IOT I'm going to talk about where does
Java fit into IOT and a bit about Joe
and Barrett but we have John Barrett
products that have been used in IOT for
a long time and then just quick summary
all right about me I'm a group product
manager in the Java platform team I've
been with the Java team for a while
responsible for our embedded portfolio
JME which includes Xiaomi embedded the
Java C embedded the same ji c platform
ported to embedded devices and then
another product called John Barrett
sweet I've been working in the
background on the IOT platform strategy
at Oracle so we've done a lot of work
and we'll share some of it with you guys
today
I joined Oracle to the Sun acquisition
I've been with or a Java team for a few
years now and in the previous life I was
a product manager and about know here
let me just thank you I'm an architect
in the embedded Java team at Oracle and
I've been working very closely with Jay
and others on the Internet of Things
platform strategy and I also joined
Oracle by the Sun acquisition I joined
Sun by by acquisition as well when Sun
bought a small company called savage
technologies that I was the CTO there
that we created a complete java
smartphone platform as it says out there
that the compliant one and and I've been
working with mobile and embedded
technologies for quite a long time all
right
okay okay so what are you going to talk
about in the next 60 minutes few things
we've learned like I said we've been
doing background work and IOT we're just
trying to understand how does Java fit
in into IOT IOT as you know is a very
new market at this point it's evolving
it's full of proprietary technologies as
of now there is no standardization of
course so we've been studying this
market so few things we'll share with
you in terms of what have we learned
from it
we'll talk about our vision of what is a
robust IOT technology stack that will
address a wide range of challenges the
biggest challenge is of course how do
you create a technology stack that is
horizontal it's easy to create something
that's proprietary and works for one set
of problems how do you create something
like Java EE that can address a wide set
of problems and that's something that
we're focusing on and we'll we'll share
our vision and it's not an offering just
to be clear it's not something that
Oracle offers today it's something that
we think that it should be where the
industry as a whole should go and where
the Java community should innovate so
it's basically seeding ideas to fuel
innovation in the java community so what
how do you guys fit in so you can come
back and tell us that we have this
technology that we think which can
really work over here and we would like
to work with you or you just go build
the same thing yourself we are not
trying to close anything over here which
is basically going to open up our ideas
to you guys so you can innovate on your
side as well
what is the session not about like I
said it's not a showcase of Oracle
solutions for IOT if you're not
providing a best practices or design
patterns for IOT it's too early
we're not there yet it's founded
technically in that presentation so if
you're expecting to see code and code
examples no it's not a ready to
implement recipe and we don't have any
demos here the reason being we have a
lot of demos at JavaOne we have a whole
bunch
for IOT at Joe and I'll talk a little
more about it we have if you are the
keynote yesterday you probably saw the
chess-playing robot demo which was a
great example of IOT in action and we
have demos in the Java demo grounds we
have a demo throughout the conference
which is the people counter demo which
which is counting people as they move
across different sections in the
conference and it shows you where people
are right now so if you go into the
registration booth you might want to
check that and see how many people are
there right now so that way you know to
avoid long lines so that's the demo
that's there right now and we'll talk a
little bit about that okay so as I said
IOT is nothing new it's existed for a
while so but it's now open in the sense
that there are a number of technologies
that have come up recently which has
made this much more accessible than it
has been before so it's in a sense it's
ready for business we see this in home
automation which is one of the first
areas where IOT has really picked up if
you're in the u.s. Comcast Offers
Xfinity home automation Lowe's offers
something called iris in the in Europe
there's Deutsche Telekom offering a
pretty unique device for Kubik on so
they're whole bunch of different options
everywhere with home automation
healthcare is another area where we're
starting to see a lot of innovation
happening in IOT especially with remote
patient monitoring I mean this is an
area which still needs a lot more work
because I guess there are lot of common
regulations involved and and the lag
time is much higher but this is an area
which is really really picking up as
well
industrial automation again a huge area
where IOT can make a big difference in
terms of productivity business
optimization efficiency this is a
research that beech and researched it
and they've kind of mapped out this fan
diagram it shows a number of industry
segments and I'm sure many of you have
seen this before if not you probably
heard of things similar
the text is really small to read but
basically what it's saying is like the
punch of industries out there building
management energy consumer and home
health care industrial transportation
retail security IT and networks just a
range of industries within each industry
there are a bunch of different segments
where IOT can be helpful and so the
business opportunity is huge
if you believe research it's somewhere
around like three hundred and fifty
billion dollars worth of Marquette by
2017 well that's this huge market of
course not all of it is technology it
includes value-added services it
includes technology but the technology
market itself is not small at all it's
like tens of billions of dollars so this
is a huge market I think it's bigger
than most of the other markets we've
seen in the recent times so what's
driving the huge growth in IOT many
factors in my mind they're primarily
three things first one connected devices
the growth in connected devices is huge
by again it depends on who you talk to
what numbers you get it's anywhere from
fifty billion to two hundred billion by
2020 again this is Moore's law allowing
devices to become more and more smarter
connectivity is becoming cheaper telcos
have had excess bandwidth in terms of 2g
bandwidth 3G bandwidth now they moved on
to 4G and LTE but this will have those
networks what do they do with those they
re deploying those for daily traffic for
him to n traffic and allow and creating
this special m21 channels that allow
companies to move data for a much
cheaper rate than they were to love
consumers to do so that's creating a
huge new wave in terms of connected
devices IOT data traffic so which
obviously because now you have all these
connected devices gathering information
what do you do with that information
you obviously send it to some place to
store and analyze so which is creating
the big growth in terms of data traffic
and again some of the studies show that
man of data that's gonna keep growing as
it's growing by 89% in terms of CRO
annual growth and this is in petabytes
the amount of information that's going
up the business opportunities the
business opportunities are growing
almost 30% the number of new inventions
or new in a weight of technologies that
are appearing in IOT is amazing like one
of our partners are sitting in the back
or Kesar they've done some pretty unique
stuff with IOT by connecting small
devices to the cloud and allowing people
to just track devices or track shipments
track cars a whole bunch of different
things that you can do at this point so
the business option is there amazing so
in summary what it does what IOT does
for you is you can gather data and
improve your business operations and
improve efficiency productivity and
revenue opportunities which you didn't
have before so it's the same concepts
but a whole new way of doing business
but what is it that makes IOT different
a lot of people just start so why is
this any different from client-server
you have a client which is get
generating data and you're talking to a
server
isn't that the same what's so different
about IOT there are some pretty unique
differences that make this field so
challenging and why it's not been
approached yet although this concept has
existed for a long time these are just
some other reasons the first thing the
number of devices in the enterprise
world you're really talking about
desktop applications or web applications
or mobile applications talking to a
server that's that's how much variety
you have pretty much once you go to IOT
the devices that are talking to you
there's there's it's limitless the
amount of number the thousands of
devices out there you may have devices
running an arm cortex-m zero
microcontroller or a core ARM Cortex a
15 or a PowerPC or an exceeded six
processor it could be anything so the
number of devices out there
this is amazingly large the variety of
devices some of the devices could be
battery operated other devices could be
always connected some devices are
running on an Iridium satellite network
others are running on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
some running on a long range network
some on a short-range network so the
complexity of how these devices connect
is again huge no human control most of
these devices don't have a human
operating them if I have a oxygen sensor
in my car there is no human operating
that oxygen sensor even I could have a
pressure sensor in next to a boiler in
an industrial automation - the plant
again I don't have a human controlling
that but I still need to be able to talk
to that device be able to issue commands
on to that device many of these are
critical nature again the pressure
sensor on a boiler you don't want the
latency of things happening after the
data reaches the server and it's
crunched and analysed and then a command
sent back you want things to be
real-time so again and but real-time at
the same at the same time you want it to
be controllable so that's one of the key
thanks information privacy healthcare I
don't want anyone else to see my health
care data limited functionality most of
the devices are running really really
small processors and they can't have a
lot of functionality when SSL is very
difficult in many of these devices so
how do you ensure security low power
most of them may be sleeping most of the
time they just awake whenever there is
an event so that's so how do you work
with that and then hard-to-reach
embedded somewhere in a you know on a
shipping container in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean how do you change that and
many of these have long device life
cycles like once you have deployed a
device in an industrial automation is a
big use case where you don't change the
device for the next 10 years
once you when it's once it's gone it's
gone you don't get to go back and
reflect and or swap it out it's these
things are very difficult with IOT so
you have to have a way by which you can
still add
functionality even though the device is
out there somewhere so these are the
things that make IOT much different an
example is a smart home so if you look
at a smart home the homes this is not a
futuristic concept anymore this is
happening already you have home switch
spots thermostats that connect to
utilities demand response system where
the utility might change the pricing of
energy based on the supply so if I have
a wind farm next to me and there's going
to be a nice big gust of wind blowing in
through the day then the energy company
might lower the prices at that time I
want my heat pump or all I want to do
all my laundry just to save on money so
that's the kind of stuff that a smart
thermostat can do or they might
automatic water usage metering to really
water tracking is very very poor right
now most people don't know how much they
consume so that's another area where
smart homes are making a difference a
real-time pricing again for electric
cars smart solar panels feeding back to
the grid that's the other one where we
keep track of smart appliances
communicating to services in the back
end and finally remotely monitored
security systems so now if you peel the
cover off of this and see so what's
exactly happening underneath so if this
is all good in concept we see the
functionality what's exactly happening
underneath its religious sensors
connected to some back-end system
talking to a back-end system gathering
data talking to the back-end system and
just understanding what to do so so in
this case so you might have appliances
like a refrigerator talking over
Bluetooth connection or a smart
thermostat talking something like z-wave
a security controller talking IP or
smart meter docking ZigBee these terms
are new to you they're basically just
protocols that exist today out there in
the IOT space and this is what makes IOT
so difficult there is no standard
protocol for communication for devices
it depends on which industry or n in
home automation these are some of the
protocols blue do this well
common z-wave and ZigBee are very common
in home automation they are short-range
protocols short-range radio networks so
how do you talk to this device obviously
you can't talk from a data center
sitting somewhere remote to this device
so you need to have something in the
middle which is the home gateway and the
home gateway I believe I have a oh yeah
Vega home gateway and a home gateway is
nothing but a gateway that allows you to
talk to the devices you may have devices
like the cha like the car charger which
is connected or IP to a utilities
company and a solar panel micro grid
again talking or IP but at the end of
the day it's really about how do you get
data from these devices how do you
transfer this data over here oops I lost
my laser pointer all right and then how
do you send data back when that's the
most critical part this device out here
might be sleeping
I want to issue a command to the
thermostat saying turn off the HVAC turn
off the turn off the air-conditioning or
whatever how do you talk to it when this
device is not even active at this point
or my home network is down how do you
talk to it you don't want the commands
to just get lost I mean these guys are
just going to say we should the commands
but they just got lost how do you do
that and that is what makes this whole
thing complicated and why we need a new
technology stack just for IOT all right
so what's behind an IOT connection so
I've been emphasizing connectivity it's
difficult managing this is difficult so
what's really going on underneath and
why why we feel that there is some this
is so important so connecting a device
requires taking care of number of
critical questions the first one it's
bi-directional communication this is
just the point I was emphasizing this
now how do you ensure that a device
which is running on Bluetooth can be
communicated to and actually I can
provision software into how do I do that
how can I talk to a device which is
Arden
shipping container in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean on on a working on iridium
satellite connection how do I provision
software to it how do I tell it to take
an action so that's the big one
bi-directional communication managing
into insecurity I think I have a slide
later which basically talks about
security statistics but today most
embedded developers don't think about
security it's not a topic that's at the
forefront it's almost always an
afterthought and many examples exist I
don't have to remind you of structure
and many people hate it when I bring up
Stuxnet but it's not it's one of those
examples of where machine security was
compromised and and some pretty bad with
pretty bad ramifications but so how do
you manage end-to-end security because
the key issue being here that when you
are when we are a part of an enterprise
to humans when we join a company we get
an identity when I join Oracle I got
issued an identity which is my badge and
user ID password which allows me to sign
on to applications access data and the
applications to send me data how do you
do that with devices there is no concept
of a device identity how do you enable
something like that how do you put
identity on a sensor that's connected on
a temperature sensor that's connected on
my home gateway so that's a big question
so after provisioning a lifecycle
management I've spoken about it enough
data acquisition from thousands of
diverse devices many of which are dumb
many of them may not even have
sophisticated software running on them
how do I still identify the device and
gather an example could be CRM right I
call up a let's say I'm waiting for a
critical package to be delivered to me I
call up this year call center and they
go into the CRM and say I see what the
location of your of your packages but
nothing beyond it let's say I need my
package to be in a it's a its
temperature sensitive its pressure
sensitive everything so how do I
actually go in and get the
all time data into the truck at that
time from those dump senses that a
measuring pressure so that's one of the
key challenges how do I do data
acquisition managing large volumes of
fast data so if you really imagine this
as the scales the amount of data that's
going to be coming in it's going to be
huge and the number of connections it's
going to be amazingly large we could
easily imagine a scenario where you have
like five hundred thousand concurrent
connections into a data center it's not
that unreasonable to expect if this IOT
thing really picks up so how do you do
that and how do you leverage existing
enterprise architectures for evolving
IOT needs the approach that some of the
other companies are taking is let's go
build this parallel data center we will
we will create something different and
will allow you to connect your
enterprise applications into our data
center and that way you don't have to
worry about scalability but is that the
right approach when you have already
invested millions of dollars into
scaling your enterprise infrastructure
and then buying something completely
different wouldn't you want to just
leverage what you have so that's one of
the big challenges we have today most
IOT solutions today do not address all
of these what we need is a horizontal
application platform basically that
addresses all of these challenges some
in some market information this is a
quote from one of the major US telcos a
senior product manager who basically
says that today most of the IOT
solutions are developed from scratch
it's it's almost like create going back
to the drawing board every time so one
of the studies that was done by Beecham
itself they asked people
Soha when you develop an IOT application
how many times you use a packaged
software and the answer was 85% of the
time they just start from scratch
because every application is unique
everything is unique so where we not
heard that before so Maya needs are
unique I need to start from scratch but
that doesn't have to be that way and
that's something which has to change
Beechum also ask people so what the top
priority was for Dell
solutions and the Welman response was
into insecurity that is one of the
biggest challenges today and how to at
go ahead and deploy I IRT so into
insecurity is a barrier for before IOT
gets completely adopted and again a
research quote from ABI research who
basically say that before m2m or /i or T
will get completely adopted
they'll have to be a horizontal security
solution just like today we have
Identity Management in the enterprise
world which is pretty much the standard
way of doing security there needs to be
something in the IOT world that will
enable that and as just some statistics
as measuring before 40 percent of
embedded developers today have not
proactively addressed security in their
development projects which is I think
for an enterprise developer that's a
pretty shocking number like you don't
think about security when you start
developing and but this is not lost on
most people this is a business
opportunity so the amount of security
solutions that are being shipped is
growing by 30 percent across a range of
industries but most of the security
solutions are very specific they're
security solutions for medical devices
security solutions were industrial for
consumer etc so that's the big evolution
that's happening the security area
everyone realizes this issue no one has
come up with a good broad solution that
works across everything the next big
challenge is IOT data management now
that you have the data in-house is that
good enough like how all that data
stored in a database can I make use of
it you need a lot more than that you
need to be able to understand the
context of the data where did it come
from
why was this data created in the first
place where was it created
so all that context information has to
be mapped into the data somehow and that
again requires a whole new range of
technologies to enable that to happen so
with that we get into
in terms of things with Java now that
really given your background of what is
IOT why IOT is so difficult we can now
transition into okay what can Java do
here to help and what are we thinking
but it's much better if no talks about
it this is really the technical expert
on this so so let's talk a little bit
about about how Java fits into this
picture and obviously you know what
we're talking about is the Internet of
Things with Java not just the Internet
of Java things so obviously we think
that there are you know significant
benefits to having Java in as many
different places as possible and you
know we've talked for a long long time
here at JavaOne about how having you
know common development environment come
and common management infrastructure
common security you know enables all
kinds of of benefits and you'll have
seen you know in things that were
announced last year and and this year
that we're moving Java more and more
towards making those benefits truly
available across the across a whole
range of different devices all the way
from the server down to really small
embedded devices so what are the
benefits of Java well Jay talked about
the just how fragmented the device
spaces and how many different kinds of
device different kinds of chipsets
different kinds of operating systems
real-time operating systems and so on
draw and I think the benefits of Java
are in that kind of environment are
pretty really obvious in terms of being
able to move code around without having
to worry so much about exactly what
device you're running on obviously
you're not going to entirely escape the
details of the device itself but Java
can can make your you would
job a lot easier than it would otherwise
be and javac also can also give you a
common platform that you can build those
applications on it can give you a common
set of services that that can allow you
to to build intelligent applications
that can be deployed around your IOT
network in order to to put the
intelligence where it's needed to solve
the problem that you're dealing with I'm
holding this thing wrong where I'm now
pressing the wrong button
sorry ok so what we're trying to do what
we can't been trying to come up with in
all the discussions we've been having
both inside the Java organization and
with a lot of different product groups
and customers is to talk about an open
IOT platform that is secure based on
standards so this is not just you know
an Oracle proprietary lock-in play and
we need to be able to seamlessly
integrate all of the devices that are
going to be coming that are already
there in many cases with enterprise
applications while enabling all of those
devices to be managed
managing 50 billion devices sensibly is
going to be a huge challenge and
allowing developers to write
applications that can run across many
devices and be scalable is also part of
the challenge that we have here so we've
come up with a conceptual architecture
for Internet of Things solution and what
we're so what we're talking about here
is not a specific solution architecture
this is kind of looking at the pieces
that we think need to be in place
conceptually in order to to have a
horizontal IOT platform where which
allows you to start building salut
based on a platform rather than
rebuilding the solution every time you
have a different IOT problem to solve so
over on the thank you
over on the left-hand side here isn't it
funny how we always to draw the devices
on the left hand side so from the left
hand side here we've got a range of
sensors and where I say sensor then I
also say I'm also mean actuator so
obviously you need the other sense
what's happening in the world you need
to be able to affect what's happening in
the world but it gets a bit tiresome if
you keep on saying sensor or actuator so
just pretend that I'm saying that place
so we've got sensors over here on the on
the left hand side in some cases those
sensors or devices will have the ability
to have a long-range connection so they
can connect usually in that case through
some sort of cell cellular connection
via the core network to your your
back-end in a lot of cases however then
we're talking about you know cheap low
power low you know low power in terms of
battery consumption low power and
normally in terms of CPU power sensors
which for a variety of reasons can't
connect directly or you simply don't
want connecting directly to your
back-end so in that case you're going to
have a gateway that will be managing you
know some number of devices in some
cases it will be a lot of devices that
are being managed by one single gateway
then you have to manage the the
communication in and out of your
enterprise back-end so we believe that
you need a specific IOT communication
gateway in the DMZ sitting outside your
corporate network and that can manage
monitor audit secure authenticate
authorize the the different traffic that
is going to be coming in and help
provide the pathway back to all
devices so and then on the back end here
we have you know a essentially IOT
derivation of a of a standard identity
infrastructure so we've got identity and
access governance how do devices get get
to be part of the system how do they get
an identity so that they're able to take
part in this and be secure authenticate
themselves and so on access management
which can take that identity information
and work out what things what services a
device or a gateway is allowed to
actually connect to IOT management so
managing the specifics of the
communication to and from all these
devices and then data routing analysis
so working out where where is all this
data going to go how are you going to
manage that flow how are you going to do
real-time event analysis based on that
data what's often called fast data and
you're not necessarily just doing that
here in your infrastructure you can be
doing that down down here at the Gateway
level as well and obviously they're in
some in some networks that there will be
multiple levels a gateway so there's not
necessarily just the one and then once
you know once you've routed your data to
the right place
then you know there's more stuff off to
little to the right hand side of this
diagram that is you know the rest of
your enterprise and application
infrastructure ultimately this is taking
you to you know business intelligence
yeah how do you actually in addition to
all the stuff that you're doing by
implementing the logic and being able to
control the oil pipeline or whatever it
is that your IOT problem is how are you
going to get value from all this data
how are you going to understand how
efficiently your IOT networks actually
operating where are the bottlenecks in
in your in your implementation how do
you help customers by being able to
process and and analyze all of this data
that you're there's that you're
generating here then we have a you know
we've developed a component view of this
which again looks at functional blocks
and how do we join those together and
where are we on time okay so this just
goes into a little more detail regarding
or but all the different pieces here and
obviously over here then you know our
answer to what should the application
framework be I don't think you'll be
surprised begins with J and everywhere
you know IOT communications is special
compared to most because of the large
number of different protocols involved
because a lot of the devices we're
talking about are battery-powered
they're because they're they may be
relatively inaccessible you don't want
to be going around them every few weeks
to change batteries then they need to
have battery lives of of years rather
than weeks or months so you need
I owe t communications agents in on on
your certainly on the gateway and
wherever possible on the device as well
you have the Gateway here that can
manage all the different protocols that
the devices need to be able to use and
we've got examples of devices that use
different protocols to talk to the
backend at different times the same
device so depending on the use case you
know there's no one-size-fits-all
protocol here so you can't simply say oh
the answers HTTP all the time or the
answers rest or bounce there is some
optimized form of HTTP you have to be
more flexible than that in order to to
be able to deal with lots of different
use cases
so being out you have to be able to map
a whole lot of different protocols here
and and be able to supply apply your
security and your authentication and so
on to all of those different protocols
so then over here in your Identity and
Access Management device access
management and device Identity
Management so again how the devices get
to be part of the network how do they
get to register how do they go
authenticated and then how do the
privileges that are associated with each
device get get set and unmanaged you
know a person with a USB stick in their
back pocket is not the right management
approach for for an IOT network then the
how are you going to manage all the
applications in this network how you're
going to provision the applications how
are you going to control the life cycle
how are you going to be able to turn
applications off when you discover that
you really wish you hadn't let that one
go out and there are all kinds of
interesting you know security threat
vectors that we have to think about here
and all kinds of interesting all kinds
of interesting scans that go on in the
real world and it's very interesting to
think about you know how do those map
onto the IOT world and just how bad
could they be if you let some of those
same scams happen you know there was an
incident not just very recently where
someone someone's house was due to be
demolished and they actually switched
house numbers with a neighbor guess
whose house got demolished when the when
the demolition crew turned up so two
houses and that ends up getting
demolished that day you know just if you
just think for a few minutes about okay
how how does that kind of scam begin to
apply to the electronic world and to the
world of the Internet of Things and
maybe you'll start to get scared and
think that we have a long way to go in
working out the security of all of this
so data outing analysis event processing
and then you know maybe you need a
distributed dated at this level too and
then the most of what's back here is
relatively standard enterprise
application architecture okay back to
you J I think all right so so don't talk
about the architecture and let me just
back up what's second on that point so
we this is our vision our thinking in
terms of how the how the IOT spatially
wolf and where's your Java I take it if
you look at most of the work that's
being done in IOT they have bits and
pieces of this and again we don't
anticipate that every solution out there
is gonna need everything over here this
is of course a much more broader vision
of what a full-scale IOT solution might
need and there might be components that
are missing over here as well which some
solutions might need but this is kind of
our vision of a horizontal architecture
and if you take this and overlay
different in vertical applications you
can see the parallels you can see that
how you can build a home automotive
application on top of this where I have
an on-board computer or onboard
communication unit in my car that's
communicating to a back-end which which
is getting provision services based on
who I am and what my preferences are and
how I want to work with the car if I
have multiple drivers using the car and
automatically switching the profiles so
that's something which which I can
easily bring on top of this architecture
I can easily take this architecture and
put it on healthcare where I have
patients walking out of the hospital
with the remote patient monitoring
device in their homes and now they're
getting provision and identity as soon
as they go home
turn on the device the device is now
associated with the patient so as soon
as the device sends data back which goes
here the day the the the database knows
where the data came from it came from
this patient because I have all that
association happening with the help of
IDM which is identity which is doing all
that stuff but so that's basically the
vision right now and how we can enable
this we are working on our end to
complete this vision and hopefully by
next year JaJuan will actually have
something far more concrete for you guys
and we have pieces over here we can
definitely prototype all this stuff and
this is what you've seen some of the
demos and I'll to walk you through some
of the demos that we have but in terms
of product offering we don't have
anything right now you're not doing
we're not trying to jump into it rush
into this at this point we really want
to see and involve the community over
here in building out this architecture
and by no means this is going to be the
perfect architecture we are talking to
people out there we have bounced this
across a bunch of customers a bunch of
partners developers so far we've been
refining it but we have a way to go
before we really formalize this and but
my vision is really that at some point
this becomes an architecture which is
similar to Java EE so we have a Java for
IOT and becomes a specification that
everyone else can build on so that would
be the ideal goal but I don't know how
long it's gonna take for us to reach
there before we wrap up I just want to
give you guys an idea of what exists
today today Java is deployed on
thousands of embedded devices it's been
inside job was started as an embedded
platform if you didn't know it was oak
we just started for a smart TV space way
back it eventually evolved and really
progressed in server space and there was
some neglect for awhile for the embedded
space because servers were doing very
well but we're starting to go back and
we really see the big opportunity now
and you heard about the unification of
Java moving forward where Java me and
Joe I see will start having common api's
and Joe me8
is the first step in that direction
moving forward you'll see lot more over
there were there is no longer a Java ME
developer or a Java C developer there is
a Java developer and you can reuse your
knowledge across everything and why do
we think that's important its code goes
back over here oops oh it goes back over
here if we want to build a common
platform that goes across everything we
need a single developer who can
understand the complete stack or at
least a common team one team that can
work across the complete stack and
exchange information reuse libraries
reuse technology and that is why we feel
that it is important to bring these
developers together combine them with
enterprise technologies so today we have
Joe Emmy embedded which runs on small
stack or small devices it can go all the
way down to 128 K devices running an arm
cortex-m processor
it can even shrink further if you strip
out some of the libraries and if you
don't plan to extend it with new
applications you can make it really
compact perhaps even run it on 64k if
you're really inclined to Java C
embedded is big in terms of Java cm but
it eight is big in terms of what we're
doing for the embedded space if you
didn't know a cm bed at 8 and by the way
I see embedded means the same Joe I see
optimized for embedded platforms so we
optimize it for the arm platform PowerPC
platform and x86 platform ACM Veritate
is really it's going to introduce a
concept called compact profiles which
will allow you to run Java I see the
same job I see that you have on servers
but a shrunken down version of it in
within 11 MB which is a full JRE takes
about 60 MB so really cutting it down
and making it far more accessible for
smaller devices when we have a whole
stack a whole middleware stack running
on a Raspberry Pi in many of our damn
demos so this is our and we have
products called john barrett suite which
is our middleware layer you actually get
an app server and an local database
and web services stack within or running
on an embedded profile and OAP for
Oracle Java embedded is a pretty unique
product it Allah it brings complex event
processing onto small devices so you
have a query engine that can work on
data in motion and analyze data as it's
coming in through the sensors in real
time and apply queries on it to filter
data correlate data to pattern matching
on the data do historical analysis of
data so you want to know if an alarm has
been on for more than three minutes only
then take action I just want warned a
random alarm to be I don't care about a
random alarm many of these just occur
but I want to know if an alarm has been
on for more than three minutes that's
the kind of analysis that oep can do
quite effectively so again this is how
the products are structured we have of
course Java card which is a specialized
VM for security it runs on credit cards
very small profile devices 16k memory
32k memory and then jeremy embedded
which is for small embedded devices down
to 128 K - 1 MB 2 MB and then Joe I see
embedded which runs anywhere from 11 MB
all the way upwards on top of Joe I see
embedded we have more value added
products Java C embedded suite provides
a middleware stack with with a web
container and rest client and a embedded
database and it's the building block for
bringing in your web applications or web
technology on to embedded devices so it
makes its really really accessible for
people who are not used to developing on
embedded devices and finally oep which
brings in data analysis alright so
summary iot technologies is still a
wild-west full of proprietary
technologies it's highly fragmented and
we see this as an opportunity we see
this as a huge opportunity for Java to
come back and make a big difference in
terms of unifying this we believe that
Java is the only way to bring in that
unification to bring that integration
to bring that abstraction that's needed
to to to really scale IOT beyond this
proprietary implementations that exist
today but significant innovations are
needed and we're trying to drive those
innovations from our end and we really
would like the community to participate
in it and good news is that Java is
ahead of the curve I mean we are we're
already there
on the device in many cases we know how
to do this we know how to do the backend
what we're trying to do is connect these
together we're trying to build that pipe
that can connect these devices to the
backend and do it in an open way in a
secure way and well in some ways deja vu
all over again because hey this is what
happened in 95 when you had all kinds of
servers wrong than the different
operating systems different hardware out
there and Java came in and just made it
all attracted very simple we're trying
to bring that same model this embedded
world is completely C and C++ driven
they're waiting for Java to come in and
in a white over there so this is a huge
new opportunity and opportunity to bring
in new developers to this space and
that's what excites us most IOT at Juwan
so I should actually it should be Java 1
and open Word so it's going to be a
pretty big theme throughout in fact one
of the keynotes at open world it's going
to be about IOT and chief architect for
Oracle Edward Scriven is doing a keynote
on Thursday the title is unlocking
innovation and value of embedded
intelligence on devices so Edward
screven who basically oversees all of
Oracle technology he's talking about IOT
in combination with dr. Thomas Keith
Lang from Deutsche Telekom who's the
head of m2m technology at - aleykum so
that's going to be an interesting one to
attend if you're interested in IOT we
have a bunch of sessions it's just a
sample of some of the sessions that we
have nodes going to talk about go much
deeper into security of IOT what can we
do more so again a throwback to the
reference architecture we spoke about in
a session on
925 that's Wednesday right at 1:00 p.m.
demos let's
quickly look at the demos that we have
this is the IOT in motion demo that I
spoke about so we have these little
people counter devices these are
specialized devices that can count
detect between people and other objects
so they can uniquely identify people as
they go in or out of a of an particular
area so these devices are talking ZigBee
I think to a local gateway which is a
eurotech gateway so you might see
devices like these these black boxes and
what they're doing is they're gathering
data from these sensors these sensors
are counting people that are entering a
particular region and these these
devices are running Java of course with
OSGi and applications deployed for
monitoring these devices and they are
then going back to a cloud platform and
which is then going back to a bi
application which which combines all
this information and then kurt maps it
to the spatial layout to understand
where are the attendees at this point in
the conference so that's something which
we're doing at this point and you'll see
displays around to show you and this is
in combination with Hitachi consulting
and with Eurotech that's supplying those
devices so it pretty exciting project
this is a project that we worked on from
our team it's called a wellness
monitoring demo it's a simple
application what we have is so this is
again in the Javad emigrants so if you
come to our booth you'll see this
application it's we have a Raspberry Pi
and well I'm assuming most of you have
heard of the Raspberry Pi if you haven't
it's a $35 device it's which runs a very
simple processor but it has Linux on it
and it can run shower really really well
so we have a whole middleware stack
running on it
we have a/c embedded we have Java but
it's sweet we have OAP embedded running
on it and we have a bunch of
applications on it what this is doing is
it's gathering data from these two very
dumped sensors and the reason we use
dumb board is which means
doesn't have a substrate applications on
it so that's why you use the word down
these sensors so are connected using USB
and this devices the applications on
this device are gathering data from
these sensors and when you walk in will
strap these devices on to you and will
show in real-time through a web
interface the data that's being read
from these sensors and that is being
done using rest rest services that are
running on this and we haven't this
application which is running over here
on a data center can read this data in
real time using rest web web services
and then once you have that data we send
it to a big data server and which sends
back a QR code and this QR code you can
just scan it and then you'll get URL for
this dashboard which will stay alive
throughout the conference session and
what it does is basically it compares
your data to everyone else who has been
using this system so the big data system
is going in and crunching the data and
comparing all the data that we are
getting and creating aggregate
statistics this is just a simple example
of how you can use big data but of
course you can do far more complicated
analysis using big data software but
we're just running a simple hive script
over here all it does is gathers data
and it just overlays your data on top of
the aggregate data so you can see where
is your oxygen level or heart rate level
in comparison to everyone else who's at
the conference and who's used this
system just a simple IOT demo but it
shows all the different components
here's the IOT server over here here is
a big data server here's a gateway these
are the sensors so the same architecture
that we showed you earlier is just a
prototype implementation of that and we
have another demo in combination with
free scale which is one of their top
semiconductor manufacturers and arm so
again a very similar to demo except this
is a smart home use case where you have
something called a one box from free
scale and we'll talk more about one box
in a session on Tuesday it's a very
unique architecture it said
complete and a hardware platform
designed for gateways if they provide
everything that you need if you are
going out there and building a new
competitor to say Xfinity home
automation or you want to be the
supplier to Xfinity for the home
automation device you can go to
freescale they'll give you a one box
reference architecture you go and build
your hardware on top of it they'll even
give you specifications on what kind of
software can run on it and then you can
just quickly get started with running a
whole new device for home automation and
they have similar reference
architectures for healthcare for they're
working on reference architectures for
some other verticals as well but using a
common hardware platform so they're kind
of doing the lower level of what we're
trying to do at a software level so
which is a kind of interesting
combination how we can work with
freescale on this one an arm is trying
to work on standardization of the
communication API they're working on
digits part a company called sensor node
and they will be here as well and you
should look at their booth as well and
they have they're working on a protocol
called co-op which is a subset of HTTP
but optimized for embedded applications
so we're demonstrating in this demo how
co-op can be used to talk from sensors
to a gateway and onto a data center and
also how you can leverage ome here and
to talk to sensor so in this case we
have a edge node which is connected
different sensors and this is running a
freescale connect as a board and this is
running one box which is an ARM based
board I was just talking to him to
insert one China okay so this is it so a
lot of good demos here so hopefully we
can see you guys at the boots we have
three embedded boots so definitely stop
by and if you have more questions we'll
be here thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
