the Oracle Developer Community and my
guest is Jeanne Boyarsky. Jeanne thanks for
stopping by here and talking to me.
What do you do at Code Ranch?
I work at a bank in New York City
as my regular job, and I volunteer as a
moderator and developer of the forum
software at Code Ranch.
At work I’m on the DevOps team, so we do a lot of automation. a lot of tooling, a lot of testing in Java and Groovy.
At Code Ranch I also do a lot of
coding and testing to keep making new
fun forum features. Like I made cow polls,
which are like voting except you get
more votes based on reputation and it's
way cuter because you get to talk about the herd and cows.
“Cow Poles.” When you said that I started thinking of some sort of rodeo implement.
Your session today is on mutation testing.
I gather that this has nothing to do with the X-Men.
So tell me about mutation testing.
Mutation testing is when you take your tests and then change the code a bit and run the tests again.
If the tests fail that means they're good tests
because they're catching actual changes in the code.
And if they don't fail the mutants escape.
And we don't want mutants running around loose, do we?
What tools are involved in mutation testing?
I'm gonna be showing Pitclipse, which is the mutation testing plug-in for Eclipse.
There are other tools for other languages.
But since I do mainly Java and Groovy,
and Pitclipse supports both of those,
that's the tool that I use for the most part.
What are some of the challenges for
developers in identifying mutations and mutation testing?
I think the biggest challenge
people are having is that
they're not ready for mutation testing yet.
If you don't have high coverage in
passing tests, there's really no point in
running mutation testing because it'll
tell you that a horde of mutations
escaped, but you already knew you had bad tests because if your coverage is 25%,
what are you expecting to happen?
Actually, I have a fun slide with the mutants.
It's not in honor of International Women's Day,
but it is a happy coincidence.
I have a girl cartoon green mutant on one of the slides, and when I get to that I
make a joke about how gender diversity is important for mutants.
It's a nice way to break the ice because nobody can be offended.
We don't have any green people here.
But it's cute and it's very timely today.
Indeed, it is International Woman’s Day.
If you could distill your session down to one sentence,
what would that one sentence be?
Write tests and write good tests.
I know that's not about mutation testing,
but if I could only give people one message,
that's what I would give them.
At dinner last night you mentioned that
you've written several books.
What are those books about?
I've written pre-certification study guides for the Java certification.
So there's the OCA study guide, the OCP study guide, and the practice questions
for the SCA and  the OCP study guide.
We weren't sure if there would be a market for them.
We’re pleasantly surprised.
How did you get into that?
I've been wanting to write a book for a really long time,
but I knew who how much work it was to write a book
from people that I've talked to who have
written books, so I was a little worried
about dipping my toe in. I did it slowly.
I tech-edited a bunch of books,
I contributed a chapter to someone else's books, and then two opportunities
presented themselves at the same time.
One was the project that I went with, the certification study guides,
and the other was updating “The Well-Grounded Java Developer” from Manning Publications,
a book that I had tech-edited.
But I’m a developer, how how do you not choose the greenfield projects?
OK, so you've written four books, you blog, you volunteer at Code Ranch,
you have a full-time gig —
I volunteer as a mentor for the programmers on a robotics team — very busy.
Where do you find the time for all of this?
I have really good time management skills.
I use Toodledo, which helps.
It lets me compartmentalize the things
I have to do by venue.
So if I have a little bit of downtime in the lab
I can find a small task that I can do online.
But it’s mainly just focusing my time,
not wasting time, and being really
aware of where it's going.
What's next for you? Do you any other books in the works?
Yes, we're going to be updating our 
certification study guides for the next
version of the certification,
which I think will be Java 11, but you never know.
It could be Java 10 or Java 12.
Oracle hasn't announced anything yet.
So while I don't work for Oracle,
I don't have the display
about forward-looking statements…
But I think it makes sense to do
it with Java 11 because that's the long term support release.
Jeanne, thanks for stopping by. It’s been fun talking to you.
Good luck chasing down mutants.
If you want the information on any of the upcoming Oracle Code events
you can visit developer.oracle.com and look for the events link.
You'll find a omplete schedule of all the events, all the agendas. So check that out.
You’ll also find lots of content and articles
by developers for developers.
For the Oracle Developer Community, I’m Bob Rhubart.
Thanks for watching, and stay tuned!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
