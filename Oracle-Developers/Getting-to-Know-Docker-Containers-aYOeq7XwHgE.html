We are coming to you live
from New York City at Oracle Code 2018,
the Manhattan version. My first guest for
today is Mike Raab. Your presentation, in
fact, is an introduction to Docker
containers. Tell me a little bit about that presentation.
You know, what's interesting
is that these Code events started
last year, and first one that I did was in Austin.
I had a more advanced topic on Docker.
I get in the room of 70 people
and I asked
how many people know about Docker.
Because you have to have
a general knowledge in order to
get the gist of an advanced presentation,
all right, level 100, 200, 300.
So anyway three or four people
raised their hands. So I said,
“How many people really don't know anything
about Docker?” So I almost scrapped the
whole presentation and instead did a
free-form talk which was the basis of this.
And still last week in LA I did
this presentation and had about 75
people in the room, and again asked,
“How many people know about Docker?”
Four or five people. “How many people know how to spell
it and want to learn something?”
Everybody raises their hand. So it has
really been a kick being able to bring
at least the knowledge to get people started.
What's the value to developers
in using Docker containers?
Well, the value is really a spectrum
between developers and operations,
this thing called DevOps, right?
Developers can put applications that they're creating
into the container that can be actually
run on the desktop. So let's say you're
working on a Mac, you can actually run it
on your Mac, Docker runs natively there now.
You take that same container and put
it on a server or VM in the Oracle Cloud,
it runs the same way. So the value
is they can rapidly iterate testing or
building and testing right there locally
push that out they runs the same on on
the cloud as it does locally.
And so it's the rapid development,
the rapid iteration, this thing called
continuous integration, continuous
deployment and then the
portability of a container running basically anywhere.
I don't know if you know him
Developer Champion Lucas Jellema,
he’s with AMIS Technologies
in the Netherlands, and he
tells a story about when he first
started working with with Docker containers,
how he he used it to set up a
really complex demo on his laptop that
was a massive headache before he was
using Docker containers.
So let's get into that a little bit.
Can you describe some essential use cases for Docker?
It’s funny. I have a slide
that I cover in my presentations,
basically five of the
best kind of scenarios,
applications that you can do with Docker.
One of those is exactly that.
It’s the packaging-up of a
more complex application that typically
might take it you know days if you were
to stand it up on a server.
You can do that literally in minutes.
You could take a whole WebLogic cluster,
bring it up in two minutes, where that
thing may take hours if you did
it in a more manual way.
So that's absolutely a great use case,
especially for DevTest.
You bring up a test environment,
it's a fairly substantial environment,
in minutes.
Do your tests, spin it back down.
Describe another use case.
I think the best use case is,
since you can iterate on the Docker
container very quickly, right, and those
Docker containers are ephemeral,
which means that they do work,
and if they go away they go away.
But you can spin up a lot of them, and another
one can take its place if
it does go away.
So front-end applications.
So basically the web front-end of any application
that your customers would interface with,
you can rapidly innovate on that
customer experience through the
front-end being maybe on on Docker
containers behind a load balancer, let's say.
Backends could be traditional
technologies, middleware, back-end
databases, that kind of thing.
So really, utilizing it, you don't have to
re-architect the whole application stack.
You literally could take the front end,
which is a great use case because it
provides rapidity and being able to
bring out that code more quickly,  you can
use great new technologies that give a
great user experience and the
portability,the scalability
everything that docker is good at in
that scenario.
What's the learning curvefor developers?
What aspects of working with Docker containers
are going to be familiar to them,
and what aspects are going to be brand-new?
Always the question is, “How do I get my
application into the container in the first place?”
There’s this thing called a Docker file.
It’s sort of a recipe of how its
assembled into what is called a Docker image,
which is sort of like the file,
if you will, and then the instance
,
0:05:27.520,0:05:32.889
when you run that with the Docker engine
the container runs, right?
But it's really getting over that,
knowing, okay, what base operating
system do I start with, layering on some
of the application, almost like you when
you build it in a server, you build the
recipe to do that within the container,
and it just runs there.
The benefit that provides is that the
dependencies that the application
depends on are in the container and
don't have to be on the particular VM.
That's what provides the portability.
The Linux kernel is
shared as it's needed,
utilizing the Docker engine that's
running on a daemon on top of that, and
the thing just runs.
But to go back to your question, the hardest thing is
understanding how to how to get it into that state.
Once you figure
that out it's pretty easy.
Then you can change the
recipe within the Docker file,
create anew image, and then test that
iteration very easily.
Can you share with us any resources that will help
developers to make that transition to
Docker containers?
Where can they find some content?
One of the best ways to get started is local meetups
around Docker.
It's pretty much where people share,
where you can interact with people
that are in all stages of the process, right?
I think that’s, you know,
besides just searching, if you did a
how-to on the internet you know you'd
come back with reams of information and how to’s.
But going to these meetups
is one of the better ways,
and every major city has Docker meet-ups.
If you want more
information on Docker containers or
particularly on the schedule for
upcoming Oracle Code events, visit
developer.oracle.com.
You'll see a little pull down where
there's an events listing.
You'll get the complete schedule of the
upcoming Oracle Code events.
You'll also find new articles and content about containers
and a whole lot of other stuff that will be
of interest to developers.
So Mike, thank you for your time.
Thanks for watching, and stay tuned!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
