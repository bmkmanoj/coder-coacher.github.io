those guys you know who they are yeah
javaone now if any of the people should
know that people that were is here so
who they are George blog and Neil
governor okay so that they were very
doing this show that Java puzzlers
starting oracle war 2001 not java one by
the way the first one was an oracle
world interesting enough not a java one
yes and they made a book out of it so
you probably heard about the book to
grow the java puzzles right so the book
was a written on the pastor that
represented on a talk first we are up to
groovy pastors books at some point of
time not yet but eventually we will get
there you have enough content for it no
after a couple of seasons will
definitely do a book and that's actually
the typing browsers are those guys who
know who they are car talk and though
they are there now click and clack are
those click and hack and those are click
and clack that drop it the
yeah Kyle talk exactly Carl talk is a
radio show that runs the yeah thank you
the trans from actually my birthday year
nineteen seventy-seven you want to show
off yes yes I'm yeah I'm old enough to
drink beer and all the parties right all
right okay so L there are two end up
failing guys on stage which of course us
that's Fred chief architect of Jeff frog
and a on Twitter and that's me I'm a
developer advocate and Jeff frog and on
Twitter as well so follow us by all
means a 208 guns of stage funny buzzing
questions hopefully they are funny there
for sure passing you thinking vote now
that's all the fun in this talk is about
cooperation with you guys so really
should what sometimes you don't know but
take a guess the good thing about taking
against that if you guess right twice a
row your neighbor will think that you're
really smart guy right so you can't you
get miss you can go around here just
vote for whatever otherwise it won't be
fun and we have a tee shirts like those
like cool t-shirts that we will throw on
you if you guess correctly and hopefully
can explain why if your can't explain
why but you're close enough we have
frogs to throw on you as well it will be
fun don't worry so that's about it and
we have official Twitter handle like
super official and dash group of pastors
and you can you more than welcome to
tweet about what's going on here if you
like it of course especially if you like
it
and if you have more of your own there
will be something yeah that's in the end
they will get to that all right so I'm
done cheat so if you use like if you
have a laptop open don't try don't right
there no groovy console no IntelliJ no
google just be with us and who knows
Cedric southwark shampoo yeah that's led
him there okay so um every time we do
those puzzlers I cannot make enough of
the disclaimers around it so who
actually writes groovy here okay most of
the people wherever you write groovy or
not what you are going to see here it's
not a real valid good groovy code
because you will end you will exit this
room hopefully enjoying the presentation
but hating grooving this passion this is
what this is what this dog does to
people you will hate it and and i want
to remind you but this is not the Guru
level I can use okay those are extreme
cases complicated on purpose to make you
suffer all right this is not something
that you write or read every day please
keep it in mind right and it's also
written in plain text and not and
IntelliJ and that's making even more
powerful puzzling but that's not how you
work yeah what's very puzzling is that
there are actually people that thought
about writing code like you're gonna see
no no that's the most disturbing so not
none of these coatings is a real
production code and every time I but we
show two new guys they likes it okay
these guys fired this guy's fire this is
filed whether that's that's rude so
that's not a real groovy okay just keep
it in mind em everything all the puzzles
work or not work as intended for the
latest version of groovy so everything
should be good
and should we start let's go okay so
friend I know that you haven't been into
the partners for more than a year so in
order to bring you to speed i will start
really easy for you with alphabet okay
some from if you didn't answer he's
quizzing me okay so further for starters
would start really easy okay so you see
alphabet A to Z and then three for each
and print it right told here easy I like
Google analysis looks good yeah of
course so what it will print it will
print range a to z new line for everyone
no such method error will print jersey
or 81 run it'll hmm or they say what a
okay so guys who thinks it's a yeah
right okay and we come here to see code
that works perfectly right that's why we
are you make sense okay who thinks it's
actually be be no one thinks it's be how
about see okay couple hands here and it
won't run won't compile won't run or
something will go wrong okay that's
that's always a valid option especially
in groovy right all right exactly so
Fredo the correct answer is C I oh who
knows why who knows why yeah go ahead
parenthesis you need to close the range
in parenthesis otherwise for the worst
print of Z yeah that's a seizure right
so we have bunch of scientists to show
you throw them we have two colors a
bunch of sizes so she didn't get what
you he got the desert he's got an so I
said okay Z dot println okay next time
next time we have a lot or just do that
right okay we have a lot of t-shirts so
if you even snot the correct size just
come to us later we will switch okay
it's a time or it's a tie okay sounds
good okay so yes yes and that's that's
the reason the parentheses and if you
didn't attempt the first season and none
of you apparently a soda first season
well there is a very good way to solve
problems okay whenever in doubt just add
pair of parentheses and probably it will
solve the problem and that's correct
here as well always remember computer
science is an exact science yes yes
parentheses are good okay so there is a
joke about Chinese guys that stole the
code in the source code of a nuclear
reactor and the problem is that they
managed only to steal half of it and the
problem was it was enclosure so all the
god is closing parenthesis all right a
and that I can cousin you probably know
who he is if you are into groovy great
guy and contributed tons of puzzles for
for our talks okay Fredo you want to ask
me about there I'll be back all right
so that's that's a that's a little bit
more fun code all right actually this
one I have to say that's the only piece
of code that is not completely
disturbing all right okay so let's see
what's going on we have a string back
and then we have a list of three
different ways to print this variable
back right we will do it with a with a
dollar we will do it with dollar and
then parentheses in a narrow the dollar
with premises without the the arrow with
bracket sorry it's called curly bug yeah
curly brackets and then and then just
with just with it with a plus okay and
then we bring this list and change the
variable to be back and then we print
this list again and the question is of
course how many box we will get printed
no box at all it all will be back twice
one buck two bucks and three bucks there
are four lines
there are four lines why I cannot say
fall back hey you know what okay so what
I say ok so it means that there would be
no fallback no for it won't be ok so
nobody nobody ok to / who thinks it will
be no box at all I correctly who's with
me ok Fred you have strong believers
here one buck one back yeah how about
two how about three and how about four
there is no such an answer no one wats
44 okay well Fred of the correct answer
is one okay well and who knows why
well the that's true that's closure but
I so why the other one doe two dollars
with curly braces there why the other
one don't work if this belt well so but
the last one yes that's a frog that's a
frog that's that's for yeah that's from
yeah and it's not that bad at the Frog
well the answer is of course only
closures are evaluated in runtime and
all the rest are in lines but the
interesting part is so this is obviously
closer but this might be a closure as
well but in g string this is not a
closure does that other times yeah so
other times it will be a closure but in
g string is just the separator between
the part that need to be evaluated and a
normal string part yeah but way in bed
of time bae way ahead of time yeah yeah
yeah well i know i think it's a light
it's a line completely time you quintet
it's actually it's it's a line
completely to string because those are
constants from jvm perspective so they
are all in line completely right good
you're good next one I learned something
and I hope you did okay so that's of
course the Greek and he has a lot of
t-shirts of hours already um okay so
Fred oh that's that's now it's a true
story now it's a true story and you
remember it because you were there with
me that's a screenshot of a video
recording from spring 12 years ago
spring 1 2013 we had a talk with Fred
about groovy plugins in a factory and my
computer crashed with blue screen of
death yes onstage recorded life that's a
true screenshot and since then this is
how is doing the groovy person
yes so I try to understand what's going
on and I learned that the problem was
that i typed 666 on my computer the
number of the beast and then I wit ur
spoiled it basically since then I cannot
type 666 anymore so I need a smart trick
to do that so here are my options what
can I do I can do that to bring 666 or i
can do that to bring 666 that's the
third option and here is another one so
you see what i mean when you have
disturbed people writing code ok Fred so
what I say which of those will print 666
ah-me I will go for see see ya ok that
makes sense minus one who thinks it's a
you are you sort of slide she doesn't
come you didn't alright so let's play
and i will give you a cool t-shirt
weather good who voted for a hey I
thought two hands mathematician okay
yeah okay how about we all right how
about see who still believes in Fred
yeah carl frey followers me yeah yeah
the Sun was and how about dee dee guys
some of you stop war to get a working I
don't like that girl come back next time
right and just vote for whatever looks
less bizarre well Fred are you ready yes
the right answer is a WoW there is only
one guy
no you know the only okay anyways why
it's a why it's a he got t-shirt all
right well for it okay he can get it all
right okay well so the answer is
actually we need to look at the code the
source code to understand what's going
on and here is the groovy source code
open source of course and you can see
here that multiply which is the exact
this asteroid this is what it does it
got the string itself of course because
its extension metal and the number and
first thing it does it converts to int
so actually this is this okay and this
is exactly why it works and now we have
a lot of frogs so here's the pop quiz
what's going on with the rest of them so
what do you think what's going to happen
here and areas now such method that's a
problem you know you will be you will
have a lot of frogs out of this stuff
well the thing is multiplied method is
not overloaded for string so it won't
find the correct method it's no such
thing as a problem yes as a barman of
course hey how about that
look 66 maybe no such method any other
ideas yeah yeah my ad it is a body what
it it's actually removing the cha 6 and
7 thank you very much why exactly dude
nice job great all right we're moving so
there is no one in string 67 so it won't
do anything it will keep 667 all right
how about that one what it will print
6606 and white one print 6666 why yes
why not the other way around how do we
fix it thank you very much right okay so
that's a frog zone gentleman over here
but also to Alan as well here you go all
right good job guys good job okay lre
contributed to that one and saying
slurry ok next one are we ready ok so
Highlander everyone know the movie write
a short story this guy runs around and
shouts there can be only one ok that's a
hard work and and so that's the code
that's the whole movie we have a class
there can be only one its own cups
because it means shouting and here's
class MacLeod and there is a gator there
can be only one that creates an instance
of this class returns it and then we
create new McCloud and invoke this gator
right there can be only one and print it
out ok that's the whole movie in slide
basically
okay we're good with the God Fred dairy
there can be only one okay they're gonna
be a little weight there can be only one
already up to four times you yes exactly
that's my point hey options it will pray
it won't even start it will fail or no
such property there can be only one for
class MacLeod it will print whatever it
tends to print which is to string of
this class we didn't override it so
it'll print whatever or something else
bad will happen okay there's no joke I
will hope it will not start because it's
really messy piece of all right so I am
for my home hey okay good who thinks it
won't start because it's a really messy
peace of God who's with me it's sorry
Fred you just lost all your followers
hey how about be a no such property
together for some reason would be one be
called here ok ok how about it will
actually work that might happen in
groovy pastors as well you can never
know no okay and how about something
else wrong going on ok so no one voted
for any other options so here I expect
to sleep fool for all the hands you
wanted ok now whoever water ok yeah so
you all right but something else better
will happen ok
and now the question is of course what
happened multiple compilation errors
exception stack overflow error
nullpointerexception something else
happened how about now who thinks a how
about we write couple of hands how about
scene of an exception that's always an
option right if you don't know what will
now go in there exception how about d
something else happened we've still have
40 minutes we can be able to we can go
on and on all right okay guys well that
right answer is slide / vo-- who got it
from stack overflow yeah yeah you
already got everything yeah why why
that's a frog okay hey now that's not
the whole frog a many other folks yeah
but buddy we need to take one get one
back hey sure a pepper pepper pepper
pepper here we go
no no
yes yeah thank you very much you you
already have a t-shirt Wow everything so
this is what heaven guy this becomes
together and it goes into itself
repeatedly all over again all right okay
so let's fix it how do we fix it a very
simple we have dot class over here okay
will it fix it who thinks it will fix it
are you lack of any any piece of belief
I pudding is it won't fix it guys you
support it I hate it I know come on I
found their lack of faith disturbing
exactly thank you very much yes so will
it fix it will it be good yes no no of
course not right hey why it won't fix it
will stage will do the same it will get
before that class ok now let's read now
let's seriously fix it how about adding
a cast that's like that's bulletproof
that's going to fix it who thinks is
going to fix it who thinks it's one
going to fix it why I think they got it
because of the same so how can we fix it
the only way to fix it is actually stop
shouting you really shouldn't call your
classes with all caps and then you will
be good all right following naming
conventions very good thing to do well
no don't don't create together which was
the name of a class i mean no that will
work with the naming conventions because
of the class starts with an uppercase
and property starts with the lower case
it will work everything will work except
of guitar and clouds bowls and cups yes
all right it's not the story of the
parenthesis in stories of the capsule
hey both yeah thats thats caps while
getting stuck alright good and dimitri
look who donated this Dimitri yep one of
ours okay so we have this podcast and
this is one of the residents of the
podcast that man okay so we had a lot of
maps going on in the previous season and
now we wanted to add a little bit more
of maps right to the mix so that's that
and maps are about pirates so that's
another pirate pirate story so we have
treasure how did select input in the
pirate speak yeah sure train them up
tourism oh yeah so we have this term up
which extends a hashmap it has the
inherit constructors st transformation
and we create here to a instances of
this treasure map a and B with a list
okay and then we print the class of a
and wither a equals B okay read your
good is that the trivial code looks
great alright so here are your options
it will we have four options and we ask
two questions decision matrix we can
cover all of them hashmap true treasure
map Falls has my treasure map too and
has no fault the good answer is B the
good answer is bit further map false
well I mean that's what it's supposed to
do that's what it's supposed to do well
yeah okay who's with me that for once
yeah when were second who thinks it's a
hashmap true hashmap and equals no one
all right ever did Fred gain any of his
believers back how about bt41 Scooby is
doing what it's supposed to do yeah I
good good amount event how about see
treasure map true turn my bad for but
equals how about hashmap faults yeah
couple of heads good good i like i like
that your burgers back in the voting
good job so Fred the correct answer is
treasure map true okay so five is equal
to six in movie yes any ideas why any
ideas why someone yeah you said why it's
false y 5 is equal to six
yeah yeah look at me in the eye candy
wife ok any other who is an idea why its
treasure map and true no
and what it actually does them a map no
they know their equals is going inside
no no wait wait wait don't don't give it
up yet any other in the tree map you you
extended yeah any other ideas guys you
see the frogs are easy hey no all right
okay so let's just roll with it well
read the manual okay it's all there well
we have this notion of creating objects
from lists and maps and there are rules
about how to do it so first of all the
type the type is inferred from the
variable declaration and the variable
here is treasure map that means that we
already know that all the hashmap
answers are incorrect now the
interesting part of course is this guy
this is a list literal as expected and
we and we even use it it will search for
a constructor that accepts the correct
type and this constructor will be
actually found its constructor that it
is inherited from abstract map and it is
constructor that accepts int and what
does it do it does the size the initial
capacity and of course equals couldn't
care less about the initial capacity
so we are comparing two empty maps and
that's y equals is true isn't groovy a
beauty yes it is all right okay so here
it's a problem of in crying and
screaming yeah yeah that's the usual
between the chair between the chair in
the screen the screen right yeah okay
Hey well okay now this is your favorite
right yeah but you all know those guys
right and I don't need to a to present
them and so here we have here we have a
very simple code we have a list and you
know I provide type and and and then how
do you call it how to call it the
generics thank you and it's all very
clear so we have a list of two strings
here our mall shark and sly and here's a
variable that you will tell me which of
the strings i could put here as a string
as a string doesn't matter yes as a
string and then we have a very simple
for loop it's not even for each or
something just for a loop if the one
that we are iterating over now equals
the one that we selected for here then
just remove it and then print of the
rest okay so out of the blue question
what did you do well what did you do
like a normal code always when we remove
something from for that we run over all
together now concurrent modification
exception all right okay hey well so the
question is which one of those want
cause concurrent relationships I have to
disagree
first early list so you should use you
should use the interface without the
know but this to be clear what we're
talking about but it is there a nice to
remember that fits in Java and evil
equal equal here yep the dot equal and
it's another string yes maybe if nothing
and expendable oh no but this is
grooving equals iggles works expected so
okay the question is which one won't
cause concurrent was looking for clicks
it good first option unavoidable it will
always drawn government if occasion
exception second Arnie shark or sly
those are your options what I say okay
which one to put to avoid this evening
yes yes okay uh so yeah see West oh it's
a sly yeah because he's lost apparently
alright sounds sounds reasonable who
thinks was with me wait a second who
thinks conquer magnification exception
is done avoidable by the book as it
should work and that's why we're for
right through those things that work out
as if they expect okay all right all
right on delegate good correction who
thinks it's Arnie that can be removed
without concurrent ification exception
no hands how about Chuck Chuck right
yeah of course yeah that that's totally
reasonable answer vote for Chuck hey how
about sly who is Fred guys who stops
with me yeah okay a lot of people it's
good good good perfect the correct
answer is obviously but obviously Chuck
okay hey I saw the answer I understood
who got it so why did you vote for Chuck
because it's Shaq right it's Sharky
another that was that was a stupid
question Fred why people vote for Chuck
all right okay anyone has any clue
what's going on that's a tough one so I
give you that that's electrical idiot
why it's jerk okay now with jerk you
don't have a concurrent modification
exception yeah okay drop okay so let's
explain let's explain okay so first of
all the concurrent ification exception
that we were all learned that it should
happen actually it not guaranteed to
happen the JDK guys mentioned they they
do their best effort basis you will see
now that this effort is not so big they
didn't try very hard but you will see
now why well the first thing is of
course decompiling it to see what's this
for in is looking in the index in the
real code and this is what we got so
what we got is for in uses iterator and
then the code is again very simple we
get the iterator from the least and then
a half next on it next and remove it so
that's very simple code and let such as
a code of the gugak oh yeah and the
question is what's happening so let's
first understand how it should work so I
coming to doubt the remove that should
throw a contar modification exception
let's learn how it should work in the
following way so this is the contents of
method next it does a lot of things but
it checks for modification first and
then add the incremental last and here's
the has the next implementation it
checks that the cursor is not equal to
the size if cursor is equal size that
means that it's time to leave okay so
modifications are only checked on the
next cycle plus one prepares for has
next
and has next checks that we already
exited the index and now it's time to
leave all right this is how it should
work now let's see what happens with a
normal operation so Sylvester cursor is
3 because it's too he's the last and +1
it's three and now size is three as well
because we have three elements in the
list and everything works great now
let's mess with it let's bring the
remove back after Chuck the cursor is
too now we remove the element and the
size is to health next returns false and
it will never loop again to get to the
check of the concurrent notification
exception no this is eight well the
question is why didn't work for for
Sylvester and now let's see what's going
scare e1 by the way no yeah yeah so
Martin Sylvester's the cursor now is
three you remove system now we remove
Sylvester and the size is 2 and 2 is not
equal to three and then it continued it
goes again and now it goes against of
three who had it actually is of two it's
two indexes out of lease and then while
loop again to check it and now it fell
to the con government of cage and
hopefully there is a check for computing
modification oh that's no doubt the cme
whew that's hilarious
I don't know yeah ok so anyway who could
like that by the way the end of their
tests with not equal size I don't me I
do always greater that's yeah so the
greater their would would fail on
Sylvester as well and sly as well
greater than equals fails anyhow this
has nothing to do with groovy by the way
cheer up this is a purely Java Butler
has nothing to do with groovy it works
in Java in the same it felt in Java is a
well yes ok so now
well Sheldon things that 73 is the
greatest number other options obviously
for dt thank you very much yeah you get
the idea the next pastor is about funny
interesting numbers so here we have
couple of release of undressing numbers
those are what those are my prime those
are even a Fred look at them again where
r 6 thank you very much Alan powers of 2
and those are interesting ones even is
power I will power of two are available
what six there there is no six in there
there is no six in their friend there is
no six its powers of 2 a.m. when the
panels to are not even numbers okay okay
and and there are interesting numbers
like 4273 max value window John 0 all
right and then I print them so yeah well
you don't know how to write code why
what's the problem it's missing commas
you all right okay it's missing commas
ok so it's missing commas ok so M it
will print that without the comma
without the comma it will put back a
common or it won't run because you're so
smart and missing commas or it will
bring now now on 5 or it will bring now
all right it's either a or b ah so I I
don't know why why groovy will add come
on when I didn't put Commons I mean it
add semicolon when I don't need
semicolon so that's a good observation
at the odd Kanazawa night they add
commas all right so who thinks groovy is
smart enough to manage without commas
and it will print whatever it would
print whiskers fresh with me all right
yeah got it lands good good how about it
won't run because it misses commas yeah
that will be too obvious right and
boring how about now on all five in
double list
yeah I love those guys you're
interesting yeah that's good let's go is
that and how about low it'll just print
now because why not right okay okay well
which one you good for okay good choice
it is your choice see okay so why why
you voted for that's a frog he got the
pattern he got the pattern is restored
good job you have any idea where any
idea why hey no no no so anyone knows
what this operator is doing is the
stranger sound sort of all of them okay
so let's try to understand what's going
on you want to see the code once again
really
no it's not multiplying what was this
back in the end ah ok no it's not well
there is a great feature of groovy that
it's called least sub-index you can
create sub list by mentioning which
items of the first list you want to keep
that's a very handy feature by the way
that's so what we have here is out of
list of two three and five we have
element 2 which is five we don't have
element four and eight so we will end up
with the list of five null and now out
of this list we don't have an element 40
42 we don't have element 73 we don't
have element valves value but we
definitely have 11 0 and that's why we
will get now now now five disturb guys
ok so unfortunately this guy was asking
the question if any of you know who is
in a less puzzling way on stack overflow
and we don't know who is so no t-shirt
for this guy all right it was you all
right hey we know you and stack overflow
and don't cut a true lies ok Fred this
one is simple we need to relax right we
have 20 minutes to go it was intense
talk let's take it easy very simple
puzzler what do say string 2 equals
false here you need to fire the guy that
wrote this code next line the guy that
fight this first line ok
okay and then you actually cast it to
boolean and and print it okay first
answer a where is my first answer a
groovy smart enough to understand that
this is actually false and then in print
false it brings true classcastexception
you cannot do that convert string to
boolean or a it one compiled because of
one of the arrows so I know it's good
good so it combines a goofy goofy never
never do plus cos so yep yep so it's
false ay ay ay who's with who thinks
groovy smart to understand that folds
actually means false yeah all right no
you know I gave it away how about be
four things it's true how about c and d
yeah so I it's just simple when I are in
its yeah so the answer is of course true
well I was equal to six force is equal
to two why why why why why why why
huh not now string yeah that's a t-shirt
plain and simple those are huge ones
here you go that's a good one yeah
that's that simple of course read the
manual again not empty strings our
careers to true and that's all and there
is not much more smartness into it for
example like understanding it falls it
falls because if we open this Pandora
Boxx will never end how about cops
Fulton caps how about zero how about one
how about yes and no and we there are
French so probably they will want we in
the mixes well right so we will move on
there not with that so not now is true
period yeah now of course now now on all
empty that is deep people speaking
French I heard you a couple of times so
don't try it with me yes so angry it's
his path there nice and easy very good
in the middle of a talk okay now this
one I love this one I love or I don't I
collect all the elements so as you know
we have at least three ways in groovy to
collect a collection into something else
into another collection one of them okay
so first of all who recognizes this line
Sheldon again right okay good so here we
have a list of objects kiddies and each
one of them have property fool in every
one of them and then we just go and
collect them with collect it will refer
to each and every object and four will
return the value of the property and
here we will get a list of software and
poor this how we do it with collect the
same with spread operator and the same
with just relying on groovy
understanding that this property does
not exist on the list so it will
delegate to the object in the list okay
you're giving super power to KU v you
okay so let's check it out how many of
the printed lines will be the same all
different to similar one different all
the same and it won't run so me I will
go for B just because the last one
doesn't it will yeah we'll print nothing
oki printer doesn't all right okay but
what he does not exist how about a who
thinks all the lines will be different
in some way right how well be too
similar one different like Fred yep
people believe in you especially if they
work for you hey how about sea or the
same a all the same yeah good amount of
hands how about d it won't run for some
strange reason yeah it definitely will
arm ok so you remember I told you that
it will be partners everything works as
expected that's the guy it works as
expected so wait how I the last one
walks yeah because this is how it works
so if he doesn't find a property goes
into the elemental exactly yes and
collect them yes that's cool super power
super power now the question is except
of impressing friend here is where the
heck is the puzzler right it wasn't the
puzzle now it comes it's the same code
but I didn't instantiate the collection
here
same question same answers yeah so now
it's all messed up I mean your your
kitties is not my kiddies is now that's
a good observation what they make out of
it you have not kitties okay I'm
miserable what else can you make out of
it they have no fur okay okay so the
last one for sure okay oh there is a
slight twist from the previous one it
won't compile not want one yeah I give
it a little bit away everything compared
with cookie it's alright so that's not
the last one let's talk about all the
rest okay eh eh with all different okay
so who thinks it will be all different
like Fred yeah couple of hands good how
about two similar one different that's
the answer that covers most of the
options so you don't know statistically
that's a good bet how about all the same
all right people think that it will
won't go back I'm and one compile it's
groovy everything will go pal that's a
good choice well good your friend oh all
the rest go like this anyone have any
idea why y'all going on was with me who
was with me yes so oh that's not the
Frog that's a frog for sure that's a
frog yeah okay any other no clue that's
a good option right now that's awesome
we will keep our young just a wine
no no they're not that's exactly why
there will be different we are going to
save a lot of t-shirts people have no
clue that's good all right so let this
is obvious okay who knows what's going
on here guys guys come on me thank you
very much now boys official t show no
not for now pointer exception that's all
this guy's what's going on no different
absorption thank you right all right how
about how about this one this one yeah
yeah no he's with me here with me oh
yeah all right so no kitties is no no
collect so the answer is it would throw
null pointer exception as well if if
different place if collect was actually
a method of java.util.list but it's not
it's an extension method extension
methods are implemented as static
methods so they want their own our
pointer exception because they accept
this string here this or whatever this
object here as a parameter so so good
you see we have this method we have this
method okay give him a teacher okay so
we have we have this method as they have
this method that returns this object and
try to convert it to collection it will
be now and it will be now it will be an
empty list so we have no longer
exception empty list how about this guy
no such probably the spread of it well
here you just need to do what we always
do read the manual and manual is very
clear about it is not safe operator so
it will just return now right so what we
are going to hear here is empty list
from the collect now from the dot spread
and now pointer exception in the end for
just calling for on now object all will
be different Tolstoy once said that all
the help all the families are happy
alike but miserable in different ways
that's this is it good all right so then
Tanner did a great job here good job ok
here is another one I guess it will be
the last one probably a animal farm you
know all about it right it's about
animals that are equal but some are more
equal than others yes right so let's do
that very simple code again I have long
equals one as a cert and then one long
equals one as equals method a assertion
failed first line won't pass true first
line passes but in second one is true as
well false first of all passing the
second films and missing method is very
just mean foods ok missing methodic ok
it's B it's be okay sounds good both of
them are correct okay assertion failed
one as long as not he goes to one as int
whose foreign fav a no hands alright how
about a evils be a be who's with me who
thinks that this through and these two
as well how about see this through these
false a lot of hands and meet a metal
exception yeah that's just to feel the
force unto right you got the idea good
good they learn the patterns pretty well
ok so the grave tons of red is see okay
so any idea why you didn't get the
digital yet okay last chance equals why
because I go signal doesn't do any magic
it calls method which method no no ah
sorry about that you can get a third
frog uh-huh yeah that's a good job well
in the manual it says that the behavior
of equals equals it's very strange it
will try to go to compare to the object
implements comparable or equals if one
does not and what we have here is that
compared to which compared between
numbers don't care about the type
doesn't care about the type but equals
do care about the type very much and
that's y equals equals in this case
particular case will behave differently
from the equals method so be careful
with your compared to
how many vendors compared to that return
0 for 2 object that are not equal is
very making a mess yes right with that
so I mean yeah when when you compare
object to order them in a comparator and
you don't have the equal that follows
just to make sure that they are both
equal if the comparable to yeah yeah
yeahs mess up okay so no for at least we
won't have time apparently so let's just
talk a little bit about the conclusions
and what's going on next and you put
Elvis currently no yes I didn't okay so
let's talk about a conclusions noel
response is there an visa parade or
everybody knows what is dl be so kind of
goofy yeah now that's for another time
okay so this picture actually means it
all groovy is extremely powerful by far
more powerful than java and with great
power comes great responsibility not to
write code like we just so that's your
responsibility right right readable code
not what you just saw sometimes you can
do a really beautiful trick like really
beautiful one but then please comment it
right because you beauty is in the eye
of the beholder the one the you that's
going to read it a couple of years from
now once probably find it beautiful at
all so comment if you do something like
that and sometimes just a bug you didn't
see any bugs here we encountered couple
of passers which are actually bug in the
language in the compiler in the lexer
this kind of stuff good news they're
being fixed very fast and in previous
seasons last year we have like three of
them all got fixed and a week after a
show so that's really how that's why you
cannot write a book about it it's a
relevant anymore oh yeah i need to
collect more of those which are not bugs
right a static on analysis helps
dramatically most of the parcels of you
so here if they were written in IntelliJ
and I
do screenshots of the of the code you
will notice immediately what's going on
right like straight away M yes please do
and of course always always always add
parentheses alright so we keep going
that the second season we are definitely
going to do the third one and we also
have our t-shirts will think about more
advanced costumes for a next season
probably if you encounter something like
that please please please by all means
send it to us we will send you t-shirts
as we know how to do pastors at Jeff Roe
v dot com is the email address or add
groovy pastors on Twitter works as well
and we send t-shirts to people and they
are happy about it right so please a
please do well if you liked what you saw
the green button outside fill the
feedback form which is actually press
the button a praise us on Twitter
hashtag and the account of groovy
puzzlers and if you have any negative
feedback we will be more than happy to
see that as well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
