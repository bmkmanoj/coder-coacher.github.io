here at Oracle Co Sydney I have as my
guest and I'm Javed Mohammed by the way
I have as my guest
the Tindall who is the director of AIPAC
product management and auto cook of the
Oracle cloud platform so Steve welcome
and thanks for a great keynote full
house yeah okay
you want to give us a I will make you
repeat the whole keynote but you want to
give us some of the highlights of your
keynote at least for the benefit of the
folks who are live streaming in our mr.
session yeah all the previous turkey
night safari Aki night were really
totally looking at why how the cloud is
useful and then for development and then
Microsoft architecture and what that
looks like so our session was then
following on to that all about what
capabilities is Oracle having the cloud
to help developers implement those those
capabilities so we talked about DevOps
in the cloud an Oracle developer cloud
service and what it can do for
developers will talk about how you can
design a CIS with an API first approach
is it a product for our product called a
principal that now you are design from
government and then we talked about the
point
anton built implemented in safety i
remember do i deploy that we run it okay
so can we just taking those each of
those things and passing it a little bit
so looking at api first I think you give
the example of an apiary of a help
integer kind of defined and can manage
ap is going to talk a little bit about
that a PR person a context where a
methodology or a mentality to like that
basically says why aren't we before we
invest large amounts of money our
development side
and start implementing a service let's
very quickly design an API and the tool
allows you to design and documented that
very very quickly and have done a PR
firm running you know in a mock type way
to see data flowing in and out of an API
even they haven't written any code and
once you've got to that point we can do
that just in 20 minutes of idea region
ideally I mean you can begin to share
that ideal without every organisation
mistake on the part of consumers you can
develop what do you think about this API
does the payload work and reader face
give you everything you need the day
that contain all the right elements an
excellent so you can fine tune that
conversation without investing anything
any time developer time writing code
that allows you to promote the API get
buy-in from all the stakeholders have a
greater understanding where we are today
is going to support the business et
cetera they are making a huge investment
kermin and then moving on to that tool
that the continuous integration
continuous deployment pipeline for
DevOps I think you talked about the
developer cloud service going to talk a
little bit about that form so two
components in that like developer
classes which is where you can pull
develops together in a collaborative
team environment and they can with all
of the elements you really need that Co
ICD pipeline which we just talked just
like more for like workflow management
issues and bug tracking events because
code repository the continuous
automation continuous build there's an
agile and less is a fine spring and be
reporting on what's great to learning
took their jobs gone today that's the
whole collaboration tool
built around built for developers to
implement or help them do DevOps and
then what about from a deployment
standpoint so in terms of this is what
container cloud service or some of the
other ones that became a platform a
little cumin and an explosively ogives
out to the people that you want to
consume you go
and then there's of course the actual
runtime containers but apart that's
running the API running the service
implementation for you and we talked
about a couple of severely Oracle
container cloud service in the Oracle
application container conference and
they're both docker container based
services or you can very very quickly
either upload your own container or just
bring the your code so no jeaious api
people just bring your node code upload
that directing the Oracle player choose
how many instances and how much memory
you want to that container run and we'll
unpack that application run it in a
container for you directly matter of
minutes and this can be for like testing
staging production any of those kind of
environment I would say very very
well-suited to general test and I would
say even small production applications
as well because larger and more mission
critical production applications we
probably came towards the Oracle
container classes codify live balances
and you can define the poll mm-hmm I
know you're a little pressed for time
over there
is there anything perhaps you wanted to
share and perhaps you didn't get a
chance you you'd like to yeah I think
that the part where you can share
looking at is really around chat box and
my Oracle's believe in that space so
Oracle has a checkbox builder
cloud service coming out like the surf
that allows you to define how you know
what the or the entities that intend
in Cantonese we say say 50 keeping
office of chat pod alleging intended we
want to sell the person configured but
different entities intent and
instruction that you can define inside
the chat builder and you can define what
are the questions should trigger those
different responses and then of course
system AI compel component where the
chat wat learn blank needs at a time and
so the idea of that service is allows
people to get a chat bot up and running
very quickly without having to write a
huge amount of code in fact no code on
the serve on the chat box side of course
you write some code to implement the
check that application yeah the idea
chat one itself can be completely
defined itself the technical descent
nikhil it sounds very exciting
well okay as we said okay no it's an
exciting time to be a developer tools
out there to developers to use and get
the hands-on play and more and most
important to be able to pick something
up prove it to successful file very very
quickly
okay are you local from from city I live
in Sydney I work for the cloud platform
chronic management organizations report
up through Europe leaking article but I
live and I'm by Stinson okay so for
those of us were new and just visiting
Sydney is there one place to visit you
would recommend or one food you would
suggest for anyone to try interesting
questions Australia doesn't really have
its own food because it's a young nation
and a caucus but Asian food generally
illustrate is very very good very large
aging quickly Chinese population in the
Sydney and so I would say Chinese and
Thai food MC which are exceptional
incident but here find yourself bored
and need something to do or highly
recommended
during the Harbour Bridge rule you can
actually walk up over the heart of
region I don't just mean across it you
can join a tour where you actually climb
up on the bridge itself with
unmissable community well if I wasn't
scared of heights I might check it out
Steve thanks so much for dropping by
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
