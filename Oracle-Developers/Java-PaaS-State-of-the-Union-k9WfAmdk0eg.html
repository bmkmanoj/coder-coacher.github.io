union so you know how is the state of
our union like the defs problem what the
US is going through still US economy
strong if you look at the stock market
is still going strong the housing market
is strong so the fundamental of the
economy is strong similarly there might
be a lot of clamor going around Java but
Java is still strong and thriving do you
guys agree great and as you know the
application world is becoming cloudy
that means everybody is trying to go
into like they are trying to adopt cloud
in their environment whether it makes
sense or not and you know there is still
chance chance of raining meatball no and
for vendors chance of raining money and
for all the developers and and all the
different guys would deploy java based
application there is still some hope
that the cloud is going to solve the
wall hunger of all the problems related
to java that true so let's go and look
at the agenda for today so what are you
going to do so i'll just give a quick
overview of cloud so it's a advanced
talks so you guys probably know what
club then why pass for the pass makes
sense or not then review of some of the
java pass platform we have then i will
give you some best practices based on on
my finding working with some of our
customers who are trying to use my I've
been trying to use pass for the past
couple of years my finding and then wrap
up the talk with some questions and
answer so you know like there you can
like
categorize cloud into like three in like
pass sass and ass or infrastructure in
service so last year I made a joke last
year so I'm going to repeat that you
know in Hindi and like us asus means
wish so everybody wish like all the
developers like I you should have a vm
somewhere sitting in the cloud so that I
can play around and sass means
mother-in-law everybody has a basically
love and hate relationship with their
mother in law including myself so SAS
developers hates us because they think
SAS is going to take away their job and
pass pass is like close actually the
platform where services are not there
they're still closed they are coming
closer so that it can be used by
enterprises okay so you guys know
software is in surveys like salesforce
com or or gmail or whatsoever
environment you might be using for using
your application as our infrastructure
as a service it's pretty popular in most
of the enterprise's today if even if
they are not using for production many
of the companies are using this for
testing like for example they do not
want to have dedicated up environment or
machines for testing they are just using
Amazon or X space or some
infrastructure's as in service for
testing their environment many of the
companies have are using infrastructure
as a service in their production
environment instead of building their
own virtual machines and systems in
their own environment and platform is in
service is still kind of maturing and a
lot of people are trying to use how many
of you guys use pass at this moment okay
one or two great so that's that's my
finding too so it's still people trying
to use it try it out in their
environment before they jump into the
band organ
so some of the value proposition the SAS
has is like for example whenever you are
trying to use your application you do
not have to buy the hardware for example
or na then you do not have to buy the
actual application operating system the
actual middleware infrastructure the
database all this infrastructure
whatever you want to need to deploy a
build and deploy your application and
when you have this you basically install
everything and so there is a lot of
initial investment for making your
application in developing your
application deploying it testing it so
the one of the primary value proposition
is there is no initial investment so you
just subscribe to your service wherever
you have you are just paying in in leg
up for our bases the utility pricing
model so it's you can roll out your
applications very fast so you just focus
on your applications and not the actual
infrastructure so if you are an
administrator or you might be thinking
my job is online and so and and then and
if you are a CIO this is the big sense I
don't have to build this let's just jump
into this band work and so that I do not
have to purchase all this hardware and
all this thing I don't have to employ a
weblogic admin and all these kinds so we
will just use everything from the past
environment and there is no ongoing
administration costs like for example
taking your database backup or backup of
your applications everything is
available and and the other thing is
that dynamics killing or elasticity that
means like when you pull a elastic thing
then use biggest like stretches out and
then you leave it is shrinks again so
similar to that so whenever there is a
lot of load and applications the pass is
supposed to automatically grow and able
to add scale based on your load and then
again scale back when there is load is
low so that's from some of the value
proposition
a pass and the the actual Java pass
market is very crowded like it's not
just one or two or three vendors so if
you remember the early application
server days so there are from 20 30
different application servers in the
market space and if you look at now the
Java pass market is similar there are
lot of vendors even a stopped by the
microsoft booth yesterday at the Java
one exhibition hall in this is we also
have Java Java offering as a part of our
is your mark so everybody is like now
trying to jump into the crowded market
space but you know whatever there is
competition there is choice and it is
good and then probably is going to
stabilize in last in the next year or a
couple of years so there are many of the
things many of the vendors are going to
go away but competition is good so the
lot of companies are jumping into that
means there is a market for for a pass
java pass so they are like the some of
the examples i have and the slide here
so i like if i try to cover everything
probably i'll take pages and pages so i
am a because there are so many vendors
so this is the top six or seven vendors
i have here in there and i'm going to
cover a little bit more detail on each
of these pass vendors but there are lot
of pass vendors there like for example
engineered also launched like yesterday
they i was visit going to engineers
booth they told that they have also now
a pass offering starting on yesterday so
everybody has passed so I had this like
changing pretty much every day so as you
know like many people think like if you
are using like a like traditional
process model so i gotta grease great
shot in the google images so
if you look at if you like if you are
using sequel people think you are this
guy studies now okay it should use no
sequel always like for you ample if you
remember like about 89 year ten years
back when ejb one was jump oh you are
not easy using ejb man then you are dumb
it's kind of that so it's like similar
thing like traditional versus modern
like and if you and if you are avoiding
a shot you are modern and if you are not
my daughter things and if you are
worrying if jeans any poly or our
traditional so that's not like sometimes
things big so there they think we think
about like the traditional enterprise
application are always deployed in
inside enterprise it's all maybe a lot
of customer facing application external
customer facing some of them are
internal customer facing always use java
ee technology if you know like like I
work for a monitoring vendor like BMC
software and pretty much we see most of
our customers using Java e heavily so if
you compare with dotnet pretty much I
think any person of the customers use
Java vs tony tony person dotnet now
similarly like there is heavy dependency
on on database like relational database
deployed on on on this mornin people
still like say Oh monolithic application
servers like weblogic an and websphere
use our mi soap jdbc all this kind of
technology and when you talk about the
modern application it doesn't have to
all the modern applications should be
always deployed in the cloud and areas
you know there is a new terminology
called polyglot means then have to speak
only one language not java you have to
use a little bit of a languor skala or
whatsoever or you can mess it up with
for example groovy or so people think
that though you are kind of modern our
hips technology it should be able to
using than then it should be always
external facing you honey you're
building this technology
and use lot of different kind of
services in the cloud like caching
storage persistent whatever use like
mapreduce but this is not always true
because you may be using a lot of
customer-facing applications putting in
the cloud passed must be using a
relational database because it probably
makes sense to use a relational database
for your application so you have to look
at the reality whatever the things are
required for your application so not l
applications are suitable for pass so
there are several Apple there might be
several applications which has a lot of
complexity depending all I for example
them anymore if you look at for example
the insolence sectors and lot of telecom
and healthcare people use a lot of
mainframe technology still in the in
their environment and you try to take
this application in and try to put in
the past thank God I am NOT such a
developer so if you know like so Java
pass is great for stardom so if you are
building a startup you do not have to
invest anything on on your hardware or
even in and like any software anything
just try to leverage some of the
services now from a past vendor because
there is no initial investment lot of
services available in the cloud and in a
lot to a lot of customers during these
conferences and during my customers
widget me being a product manager so
customers are like trying out now to use
pass for for their some of the newer
generation applications they are
building which is not like associated to
their like lot of back-end private data
they're trying to and and then bud so
the pass is great for development and
test
you do not have to invest on on this
thing and some of the pass vendors are
now production ready I am NOT going to
comment who is production ready or not
but you can try it out yourself so like
saw the vendor like large size vendor
even I couldn't do it deploy an
application it like I got a trial for
for a month and I was able to log on
only three times and I don't know thank
God how the production they are pitching
that their customers are are using in
the production environment and the
actual authentication what only three
times in a whole one month for me at
least and I was able to deploy the app
and and but it is never wrong so they're
so so you have to try out which what are
the things make sense so there are
platforms are great for development but
not yet production-ready many of those
and if you are really try to things do
in the cloud I would rather jump into
the infrastructure in the service band
organ so how easy how difficult to
configure a tomcat in the in the cloud
in your environment it takes only five
minutes so if you are just trying to use
a top pass for just for tomcat we
deploying a nap it does not make sense
you can have this in a what about Anwar
and you want to use so what you are
trying to leverage a lot of other
services what the past vendor are using
then probably make sense but you have to
look at your applications and see
whether the past makes sense or not and
and also vendors like like pivot oh I
which was earlier a wing of VMware like
Cloud Foundry has like private pass so
lot of companies are now like vendors
are coming with the like private car
pass kind of in
structure so they have you can do not
have to install the services whatever
you are getting in in the cloud and you
can just enable this private pass in
your enterprise and then we can try out
and testing and then if you are ready
for example you can deploy in a in a in
your either either in their public cloud
or or in we can deploy that proper ample
in your ass and infrastructure
environment too so there are several
pass vendors so I'm going to go a little
bit on each of the thing because a lot
of vendors are there so this is one of
the earliest pass vendor is google app
engine so it initially eat got a lot of
traction because from the developer
community because it was a new way of
building application so it provides like
for example servlet like very limited
api server jspn and google web toolkit
for building applications and it uses
life example with provide ability to do
other JD u j do or jpa for database
persistence and it provides different
database engine but it didn't eat it the
limitation is that it uses it like you
have to use a lot of proprietary api
google api for this application so you
cannot just take your war file for
example and configure the database and
then run it so you have to use a lot of
proprietary api so they actual
portability as an big issue so at least
for my testing so I and for testing all
this say as you know who do not know pet
store application anybody so I use
basically the pet store application took
the pet store application the which was
modified by spring and the I Betty's gas
to just to make a web app and try to run
in this all this different environment
and
like where what the changes I have to
make were so I the two and environment
basically where I make had to make a lot
of changes was one of this google app
engine was like was over the place I
couldn't run just a bit okay it's
alright so something is an example up a
Google exposed K so he can have an for
ample it let's login to push your
application and then you have to make
for ambles some of the changes here to
the specific Iginla for example if you
want to write into the database so there
are so Google App Engine one of the
earlier stop tan and being Google
basically they have a pretty good
infrastructure this table and sorry yeah
yeah yeah yeah so that's this that's
another limitation yeah imagine binstock
so I I'll not call it a real pass but
they initially started with what I
haven't seen much progress in the last
few months or so at least in the
Beanstalk so it but good thing is that
this glamazon is is one the leader can
say leader in the cloud environment so
they're lot of large companies everybody
cannot use Amazon ec2 these days for
infrastructure pipe as an service and it
provides a lot of other like example so
it is based on tomcat the container is
based on tomcat and you can deploy your
application directly there so I didn't
may have to make em do not have to make
a lot of changes for 40 ample whenever I
try to deploy my
petzl applications the only thing I have
to make changes was to use the database
so it was only the jdbc road properties
file that I to make changes so it is
very easy to deploy the application into
into binstock and it provides a lot of
database mechanism like for example
databases like Oracle my sequel sequel
server they have a no sequel database
called DynamoDB it has it provides
caching mechanism like elastic cash so
it also has a Eclipse plug-in and then
some SDK to deploy the applications so
if you have a standard wore a penny much
that deploys there because it's a tomcat
container so if you have so it is very
easy to deploy your application but if
you are really using Amazon you can just
have your own version of the Tomcat
there rather than using binstock I do
not see a lot of so it have provides its
but some of the stuff but if you look at
if you really want to just try out your
deploy Europe simple application having
infrastructure so easy to imagine
infrastructure in service is a better
option because you have your own version
of the tomcat whatever you want to do
own version of the library you have the
full control of the container and nvm
binstock limits some of the stuff
without a lot of benefits so but if you
look at basically it makes very easy for
people to deploy an application so you
can just provides a nice UI to deploy
your app and as soon as you deploy the
app it makes it available
let us talk about so then read at
openshift supports like for example it's
a polyglot again like supports Java Ruby
node.js Python PHP probably everything
in the art so it's based on on jboss so
it allows you to either jboss ap sixth
or one or jboss s7 or two so if you have
any jboss based application you will be
able to deploy the app without making a
lot of changes and it also provides
different cat regis like for example if
you want to monitor something or you try
to use the data please it provides
different up cut religious based
technology you can enable it and and
most of this pass environment if you
like like 4am rope on ship you can use
it for free form law or limited period
of time if you are using less than three
categories for example so you can try
out yourself to see how this and for
persistence is provide my sequel
database and mongodb s as no sequel and
again the it Eclipse plug-in is good and
also they have an SDK to deploy and
build and deploy application and it's
the actual monitoring the actual
management of the web application is
very limited and again whenever I look
at openshift still looks very developer
centric there is not much monitoring you
I for example if you deploy applications
in a production environment you probably
want some visibility into the
applications so they are they have
recently I think partnered with New
Relic to provide some of the monitoring
capability so but reddit is for example
openshift is like you can deploy any
enterprise application like for example
EA are file user
using ejb or some of the additional java
ee api is that was not supported just by
using tomcat so this is an example
screen of upon shaped so if you look at
there so i deployed the pressure
application using the 61 platform cat
region the cloud foundry the cloud
foundry was part of earlier spring
source and and then DM are required
spring source and then vm were fourth in
two different company called p photo and
they support java ruby-on-rails can read
ready 10 an order can whenever you can
download the slides you can download
from there it provides different
persistence services like my sequel
Prost Chris MongoDB all this kind of
thing and and then for development it
has a this eclipse plugin the STS of the
spring or so till developer toolkit over
all that type forgot the full form for
the name that tool this spring source
developer to whatever it is so that has
a cliff's plugin basically how to help
you deftly law the applications are 22
cloud foundry so we're similar to
variable the google app engine so you
just provide you user ID password and
then can push the application to the
cloud or are they also provide a vm
which can for example if you want to run
the cloud foundry on your laptop and
then you have vm player for example you
can bring up the actual cloud foundry
private pass on your laptop has a
similar functionality what about the
cloud boundaries forum for testing if
you want to test your application and
they are in your local environment
before you pushing it to cloud foundry
com and then you can use this
environment and interestingly
even yesterday I saw like I the cloud
foundry com if you go to CC beta for an
ID shows beta for the last two years and
I've stopped by it at their booth
yesterday to inquire about that why he
does so their production I do not know
why this what as a developer view or or
a guy who want to deploy your
applications in a production environment
probably will not get a good impression
if your whenever you go to the site and
says beta but Cloud Foundry has other
partners who provides also cloud private
path or paths based on the cloud foundry
software so active state is one the
company which provides private pass
offering so they have taken Cloud
Foundry basic they made some changes and
resell it or as a private pass offering
so supposedly they have added some
monitoring on SSL all these things which
are which lacks in in Cloud Foundry to
make it more Enterprise ready so I
haven't tried the private pass form
active state but probably that's what if
you are looking at cloud phone to
providers what is looking at and so
again if you look at the cloud foundry
it looks very developer focused so there
is no monitoring API so and then you
look at this is the their spring the
developer tool that you can push the
application and to into the cloud and
angles they have a command-line tool to
push your applications and into the
cloud foundry cloudbees so cloudbees
also provides Java pass and then they
support java Grails scala primarily Java
platform and and again this based on
tomcat and they have different
persistence services based on my sequel
and they form o and no sequel if you are
looking at no sequel support they
provide MongoDB
and then have a lot of partners
providing other kind of services and
again their development tool and an SDK
looks great and they provide also some
of the monitoring you are monitoring and
management in their UI and this Wharf
again being in based in tomcat so it is
a war file just you can deploy it and
the list changes I made in cloudbees
basically whenever I took my pet store
it the only thing I made changes was in
the JDBC properties file and their UI
looks pretty good the new relic and they
have partnership with different
monitoring vendors and other vendors for
example for monitoring limitations is
very limited access to Hawaii and there
is no full support of Java EE yet so
this is an example for the cloud base
like in just deploy and a pan and you
can look at some of the monitoring
aspect of the app like how the app is
doing like how much memory heap used and
so this is the example of their
developer tool so if you are actually
using some simple application looks like
his production ready because they have
some monitoring UI and and they claim
some of their application customers are
are using in the production environment
j elastic so this is another company the
supports java primarily java api again
they provide two solutions one other
application based on tomcat or in
glassfish and persistence is they have
maria DB is a my sequel fork and post
grace and mongodb is no sequel
eclipse-based UI and sdk similar to
other vendors and one thing is that for
you they provide full access to the
actual like the GlassFish console for
ample if you are using glass fish so
it's like looks like an hosted service
so you just can log into the actual
glassfish console and deployed it says
so it can say it is a full hosted
service rather than like other passband
also they're trying to do limitations is
i think is limited database support and
whenever I tried my application so the
the GlassFish server which I was using
at least crossed multiple tires so
that's my my own experience but I
stopped by at their booth yesterday and
the last one year they have they told me
in that basically they have worked a lot
on improving the stability so I have
been tried in the last four five months
so you have to try out Heroku so Heroku
is is pretty popular in non ja non Java
passer world but they also have a Java
offering Jeong Ruby Python everything so
as you know like Heroku is like an hour
subsidiary of Salesforce oh and they
provide Java API based on JSP yours or
the based on openjdk and one thing of
their like I'll so if you are building a
social kind of application hiruko is
seems to be pretty
pretty compelling and they have a they
have like they have like for example
add-ons or the actual services seems to
be very very comprehensive in Heroku so
they Heroku the actual ecosystem system
is very comprehensive than other pass
vendors that but very limited control on
the vm and the actual size of the normal
process or our so he is example whatever
i had try to deploy a nap and in Haruko
so then oracle public cloud so and has
anybody tried out of public cloud okay
so no comments so i tried oracle public
cloud my experience was not that great
so that is so I i use a free version so
it took for them for example two weeks
to give me access and in a one month i
couldn't try more lot more basically i
was the identity management service
seems to be down pretty much of the time
i don't know whether you have the same
experience but i was able to only log on
three or three times in whole month so
and but they saw the UI they provide
seems to be pretty good so for from and
they have full control of like with
their and if you are using oracle
databases like for example and you want
that isn't service that test that's the
only place you have the oracle databases
also as an service this yeah beside
amazon amazon and and here you have a
weblogic and as it is the primary pass
platform so what I think the produce
Oracle is working to improve that so
this is a comparison whatever i have
here pull like so you can learn download
this i am not going to go through this
but so if you see the one comment they
are basically not production yet for
cloud foundries because that they say
still their website still say para but
active state has programmable production
offering from air
no so if you are using a public pass so
they provide everything so you just
deploy the app yeah everything so the
public so yes so that what we cover in
the beginning so infrastructure a
service you get a vm somewhere and then
you have to do rest of your stock so
whatever you do so you get a vm and
Amazon life example like the way you are
doing getting a vm inside your
enterprise so you get a vm in the cloud
that is what infrastructure is services
yeah so whatever whether you are putting
a cron job there or putting a tomcat
amazon doesn't care sorry yes a benefit
of pass is that basically we cover to
the beginning is that it simplifies you
the goal is to simplify your life means
everything is configured so what do you
care about from a developer perspective
is just the app build the app and just
deploy it there and rest of the thing is
taken care by the pass vendors yeah if
you if you if you want flexibility and
not simplicity then pass is not yours so
we are going to cover or some of the
thing here there so some of the issues
in pass is like very developer centric
so far so and and many of those has very
limited Java API support if you are
building a comp pull placed using Java
API to the fullest extent then then some
of the pass vendors even you may not
even use it there is no standard so lot
of have their own profit or API so if
you are trying to depend on so you have
cannot just deploy the application
program PO let's say you if you are not
happy with oracle weblogic for example
and you just have an web app then
is very easy to move to tomcat lot of
people are doing that our or else pv if
you are not happy with tomcat with the
nanny can go to weblogic if you want
like better monitoring and that kind of
thing but it's not that easy if you are
trying to use leveraging pro patria p I
for example in weblogic and trying to
similar to that if you are trying to use
proprietary api in leveraging the
services like pajama service a database
for example is a service from from a
pass from a Java perspective similarly
caching or anything you are trying to
use is a service so if you are trying to
use any kind of pro patria p I to
leverage the services let us say are
trying to use with google app engine and
you want to move to let us say cloudbees
it's not that easy you have to make code
changes for that doing that so there is
no standard yet and then and then you
have as if you want flexibility let's
say you want flexibility of let's say
tomcat 7 with log4j 3.2 you have you
have tested in your application and you
know for sure that lock for j 3.3 does
not work with your application and and
the past vendors has everything
available for you so you cannot just
dictate those kind of things so if you
want flexibility then pass is not for
you if you do not worry you do not open
depend on you focus on the application
and what about the services they provide
then then passes for you and a lot of
other things like for example if you lot
of available I I met a lot of like I was
a product manager at Oracle earlier so I
made a lot of developers in
organizations they use leverage for
example properties file outside the ear
file or war file in the actual because
they wanna make changes so that whenever
the deploy and production they just may
go and make this changes in the property
file itself instead of bottling that
property file inside the or or war file
so if you are trying to do that
general work because there is no access
to the underlying vm so whatever you are
trying to do our packaging everything in
the ear file of war pile and uploading
and there and and similarly I am believe
you are most of the application user
slogan will email functionality so the
past vendor for example out of the box
they do not support email you have to
subscribe to email services outgoing so
second thing is third thing is that
testability so you always have to be
connected to the Internet to test your
application unless you are using a
private pass somewhere or a or a private
pass one version of their public bath
and most of the public pass vendors do
not provide that and lot of enterprises
have security and privacy concerns for
ample for the data you are so are you
ready to put your data whatever in the
past or many of the pass vendors are
providing a VPN support but you have to
convince your IT department to do that
so main thing is that whether you it
depends upon the maturity level and what
you want to do and most of the have our
our production of like whenever you are
trying to deploy an application and if
you are a very large organizations it
depends on different services / example
I my application depend on the active
directory for my single sign-on and then
it makes some rest call to get it
validate my web services somewhere sorry
my security car social security number
all this thing you Europe if you are a
larger organization that depends on
different services which are offered by
that it's an and so the is very
difficult to implement or replicate that
in a pass environment so it's what's
trying to an ayah to try out pass within
isolate a tap or newer generation app
which goes on do not depend on lot of a
services inside so here is an example
for example how you
use a database service in a platform so
you like for example this is cloud v's
example how you use a like I have
defined a JDBC you resource call for
example they will store and then you
want to use that doing a database called
day busto of database service called a
bust or so to be or not to be is or your
decision okay to pass or not is based on
your application not just like as a
developer you care about your business
you should always care about what are
the value you are reading to the
business so don't jump into the
bandwagon just to try out pass like okay
it pass makes sense for me so you
examine carefully whether pass really
makes sense for your application look at
the application need business read not
your kind of passion for a new york
platform so that's the first best
practice and then then try with a simple
application first and then see whether
it makes sense for for your application
so and and probably if you are a
start-up or a small organizations or
your have an isolated app which is a lot
of customer facing it makes prolly make
sense and and build for and settle for a
platform which is more stable and and
portable so you know the primary region
java got become popular is right once
and run anywhere so if you write once
and crippled everywhere then that make
sense so try to make an appt is so right
so that he can port for ample you are
not happy with the platform you can port
somewhere if
examine the security privacy concerns
what your application may have and look
out for the private pass for example if
you really care about simplicity whether
the private pass make sense for you but
again like for example the primary
premise of pass is like some elasticity
in the cloud and and if you are using
private pass you are again still limited
to the actual resources in your
enterprise you are who you host itself
was the point so lot of organizations
basically say do not want to deal with
fur ample configuration of tomcat
configuration of the library's
configuration of the database so they
want to do by the platform and run it in
internal yeah yeah we'll take the
questions at the end okay so you know
like this is so it's like for example
you go and your java developer and say i
want java says this guy said no we don't
have java body have mocha Java so there
is like you do not settle for a non
standard Java or proprietary wherever
you are trying to replicate so you there
is no standardization yet so there are
some work being and was planned but I I
was talking to some of the guys so they
say still think some of the jaw like
it's still a little bit new to be
standardized or are not mature enough to
be standardized so Java is tries to
standardize some of this thing like for
example the pass user roles so who is
trying like for example of how to auto
provision the services let the actual
service definition elasticity for the
butt multi-tenancy for the deployment so
all these things are but not even not
included in in java ee 7 so they are
going to try out later on but one thing
is that for ample even if you are trying
to use power
like you say like Gardner says that
worldwide platform as a service revenue
is going to be 1.2 billion dollar and
out of this why got only two hens rage
so I don't know where this is they got
the number from but many times basically
they predict the annales predicted
number life example hours I work for a
startup called event process a
technology called event processing and
the primary that I jumped into the
startup because Gardner says in 2011 the
event processing market is going to be
more than two million dollar or 1.5
billion dollar something like that and
every there you saw there are so many
event processing company and most of
them basically gone somewhere even can't
find so it's it's not always is they try
to predict but some of the things they
it's kind of hit animation depending
sorry yeah so similarly Oracle Oracle's
like they call cloud computing in a box
you know exalogic how much that cost
left around a million till so this is I
did some unscientific survey we did like
posted some in some of the environment
and and talk to some of the customers
when I widget so this is based on the
enterprise adoption of pass we have only
this is like six percent so maybe it's
like looking at this crowd is still
lower so it's about six percent of the
people i started using pass in the test
their production environment and then
12-person are are evaluating and then is
trying out for just to see where they
are going and and 12% they are are they
are planning to do in 2013-14 time frame
and seventy percent of the people they
say absolutely no plans now so the
conclusion is like there are several
Java pass are available from many
vendors is a very crowded market lot of
vendors and jumping into them java
position is still like i think in the
third year or for fear there are still
in lot of being are still in early stage
and have portability issues choose your
platform so that you do not get locked
in and for the timing if you really want
to try out move into the cloud then
consider using infrastructure is in
service until the pass dust settles down
and private pass is still emerging so
then they are my contact details and i
used a lot up for graphics and and all
the credit goes to the guys who built
the graphic i didn't build any of the
others graphics so all the credit goes
to the guys google images and all those
guys have built it and if you have any
questions
III so I tried the cloud foundry stop
the cloud foundry the private pass yeah
so i haven't tried like for example
exalogic for example if you add exalogic
they call it kind of a private pass but
it's not really the cows they put cloud
computing in the box and similarly iBM
has has a box for example so I haven't
tried on so they are again those are
there a way to like make your life
simpler for but it's not like the one of
the primary premise of the pass is also
hourly pricing model and elasticity so
like if you use everything in a box so
you are putting a lot of initial
investment yeah yeah so they're here
this is a very expensive so the primary
region passes popular is like you do not
have to do anything you just go and like
give your email ID register like if you
have it like if you want to use their
paid service just use your credit card
or and try to use it so I my credit card
fraud he has not enough limit to buy
such a box so I haven't tried the Java
part of the issue so I I have tried the
dotnet but I haven't tried the Java so I
yeah so I stopped by at their booth
yesterday that I came to know that
processing the day also for java
okay yeah that's what they told me I
specifically asked them that whether
they have passed platform this yeah so
Tory they launched it to refer that yeah
for a year so I have you tried as your
SEO this pretty good from afar using.net
application sorry
oh I enormous can you repeat your
question on database yeah you could yeah
so the only thing is that you have to
see that basically you can invoke those
services you should be able to if there
is a way to access this application from
your application data from the
application then you should be able to
do that what you have to do will deal
with multiple vendors and then also
connectivity between your application
environment and the data environment
yeah so yeah if you want to use for
example awx explicitly you like a vm and
then you are you want to use the RDS
preamble the Oracle database and sequel
server yes you have people use that
so if you if it is a very like a simple
application using tomcat for example and
if you just to web-based application and
then you can test in the pass
environment so you do not have to like
for them if it is a very complex
application then you're going to have
challenges like like if it is a simp
complex application then you have
different libraries for example you
might be using leveraging and services
it might be using so in the price in a
in a public pass environment if you are
using let us say from yeah if you build
your one pass then you have your own
flexibility whatever you can do you are
limited to your pure infrastructure
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah it didn't go through this
fiscal as a developer aspect I cover the
developer respect yea though you are
definitely put ample let us say you are
using a private pass vendor and they
decided sorry public pass vendor and
they decided that is not worth our
business and they can shut down that
that unit so you are nopee you have to
choose your alternative within one month
or primarily they give 60 days is the
standard
so I I did not actually use load
balancing or this kind of I you try
mentally use try to use from the basic
applications testing so so I didn't try
the actual load testing and then how
they scale and at that aspect so so you
have whenever you are trying out you're
trying to roll out to production
environment you have to look at all
these aspects of readiness supposedly
they automatically scale and other
things so that is from their brochure n
yeah so that is apply one of the
elasticity is one of the primary premise
for four paths so and as a passband of
this would be able this would be doing
that okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
