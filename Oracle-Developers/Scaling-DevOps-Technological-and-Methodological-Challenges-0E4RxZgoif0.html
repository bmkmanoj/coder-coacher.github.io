I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle Developer Community,
and my guests for this segment are Baruch Sadorgursky and Alena Prokharchyk.
Tell me a little bit about your session this morning.
We did one of the keynotes this morning, and we spoke about scaling DevOps.
The example that we actually invented shows what happens when company goes from
a development team of 3 people to 100 people in R&amp;amp;D,
the pains they experience as they go, and  the solutions that might ease this pain.
You've delivered some version of that session at other Oracle Code events
with your alter-ego Leonid Igolnick.
Is there a common question that you've gotten from the audience during those sessions?
A conference talk, I guess, like any pitch that you repeat a couple of times, evolves with time.
We keep adding answers to those  questions that we hear.
So for example, one of the latest additions to this talk is the part
about the importance of data, and being data-driven.
That's a direct feedback from one of those repeating questions,
when people asked us,
&quot;OK, how do you know what is the right amount of a certain aspect that we need?&quot;
So we have those examples of resource allocation,
and we spoke about how important it is to pay attention to that,
and then people come to ask, &quot;OK, how do you know?&quot;
Right, right.
And this is how we evolve this talk and more and more.
But usually people ask those kind of
questions or ask for some pragmatic tips
on how they can start today.
And that's actually a much broader question,
than something that we can answer in one particular talk.
So our answer was just to build another talk which contains practical
answers to those questions.
Your keynote focuses on technological and methodological challenges to scaling DevOps.
Can you describe some of those challenges?
What's a dominant methodological challenge?
I'll start with a question.
I had a question while prepping for this presentation.
Is it possible to avoid the pain?
Is it possible to learn from everybody else's mistakes
and make the path smooth?
I think it is not quite possible.
You have to make your own mistakes.
You have to go through this pain in order  to learn.
I think that's got to be the biggest lesson.
You learn based on mistakes and based on the processes in your company.
Because every organization's situation is specific to them.
Yeah, and it's all moving, too.
So it's very hard to predict.
There is a Russian proverb that...
There's always a Russian proverb!
Right! For everything!
You have experience with us, you know how it goes.
That dumb people learn from their own mistakes,
and smart people learn from other people's mistakes.
As with most  Russian proverbs I consider
this is one wrong.
Because probably there are some obvious truths that you should or shouldn't do.
So probably you can learn from other people's mistakes.
Then when you jump from a roof you'll probably fall down.
Someone tried it before and you can make your assumptions.
But that's right for a very small subset of
self-evident truths.
Most of the problems are so complex that when you evaluate the experience
of other people, of other teams, you usually conclude that this experience is not 100% applicable to you.
Sometimes you're right. Sometimes you're wrong.
But you have to try.
Let's look at the technological side
then.
In your experience, in your estimation,  what is the dominant technological challenge?
I think it is, as a developer sometimes
you want to be a jack-of-all-trades.
So you want to do everything by yourself.
You want to write your code.
You want to deploy it.
But sometimes you just have to hand it off to the people who are actually more familiar
with the infrastructure than you.
And that's the hardest part sometimes.
Stay within your lane.
Yeah!
That's interesting because it almost contradicts the basic principles of DevOps,
which is about having more of a common, and not having silos,
that people only care about a part of the process,
but instead only that the whole software development process,
from the idea to actually maintaining this code in production.
This is an interesting dilemma that is kind of addressed in our talk
about two extremes, of not having DevOps at all,
and you developers only write code,
and once it's code complete you don't care about anyone else,
and the operations guys that don't want to
introduce any changes in their system,
and hate developers for ruining their
stable up times and this kind of stuff.
From on one extreme and to, OK, there are super software engineers that
are complete professionals in every
aspect of development operations,
QA, security, and any other of the adjustment disciplines.
And the truth usually is somewhere in between.
There is this golden line or middle road in which we behave as t-shaped engineers,
in which we know the broader aspect of what we are doing,
and we are really good in some narrow part of the whole thing.
And this is how from one side we achieve this common goal
and common incentive of moving
forward without being separated into silos
and from the other side we still are professionals in something that we
do and we can specialize deep enough to
provide additional value and not only
knowing the basics or you know some kind of a common a common knowledge.
On balance, between methodological
challenges and technological challenges,
which one of those poses the greatest
problem for most organizations in your experience?
I think it's methodological, it's people and methodologies.
Technologies change, and people adapt to technologies.
But people skills are something that is very important always.
You  have to work as a team.
You have to remember that you have common goals.
And even though you might not be participating in some parts,
it's very important to know what other people do.
So it is people, and it's communication between people.
It is knowledge sharing.
So the biggest challenge is is posed by those
components that need coffee breaks and vacations.
Yeah! Those bugs which are between the chair and the keyboard.
Yeah, absolutely!
Working with people is the worst, right?
We love the technology, we know how to go around it,
we know how to improve it,
and people are something else.
It's very hard to change behaviors.
The incentives that you introduce are usually obscure to you
when you do it and the results are unpredictable.
And comparing software engineers to behavioral scientists or people engineers,
you know, their job is so much harder.
We are lucky to only deal with zeros and numbers.
What is the most important thing a  developer can do
to thrive in a DevOps environment,
and to ensure that that DevOps environment will itself thrive?
You have to write your code keeping in mind that
it is going to be deployed somewhere.
And you have to write your code knowing
that the problem will always happen with it.
So you have to make this job easier for the DevOps
to figure out where the problem is.
So, monitoring, logging,
basically adding all these extra layers on top of
just bare functionality to make this job easier for them.
I would say that the biggest challenge is,
back to our discussion about behavior,
is to interact.
It's extremely hard, especially for software engineers,
who aren't usually the most extroverted people in the world.
And making this additional effort to interact is very hard,
especially now when we are seeing this trend of working remotely.
It actually makes it even harder, and open communication is the key.
It doesn't go so well,
and we all speak about how with
important open communication is,
and we have tons of tools to help us with that stuff,
like Slack and interactive video conferences,
virtual presence, and what not.
It doesn't work.
Well, it works to some extent,
but there are no magic bullets here,
Because it's a very, very significant effort
that people need to make to interact with each other,
and not a lot of people are capable or willing to make this effort.
I would say that's the biggest jeopardy for DevOps
or any other communication process,
and DevOps is about communication.
If you'd like more insight from Alena and Baruch,
they were two panelists of six on a recent
Oracle Developer Podcast called
&quot;DevOps in the Real World.&quot;
You can find that on developer.oracle.com.
Click on the little navigation aid up in
the corner and scroll down until you
find &quot;Podcasts,&quot; and dig around in there
and you'll find it.
If you're watching this on YouTube,  look down there in the description.
I'll put a link to that podcast in that description.
Baruch, Alena,  thanks so much for stopping by and talking to me.
Always fun!
Thanks you for watching.
I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle Developer Community.
