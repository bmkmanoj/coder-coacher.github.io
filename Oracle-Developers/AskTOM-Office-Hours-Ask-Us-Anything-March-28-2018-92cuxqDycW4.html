thank you for joining two days
ask me anything or later with office
hours just for a quick introduction I
have here with me my colleague I so I'm
Chris Saxon part of the regular answer
team and Steven Feuerstein is developer
advocate team it's our job to help you
get the best out of Oracle database so
excited to be answering questions now
today so back over to you gerald thank
you Chris and my name is Joe pencil I'm
a senior principal product manager here
at Oracle headquarters and I would like
to offer
Chris's time and my time for an hour to
answer any question about or regarding
Oracle database that you may have
obviously Chris will get the hard
questions idea first - that's also ready
everything that we have with the slides
so we don't want to want to bore anybody
with slides but really answer any
questions and I think with that Chris
would you like to kick it off with some
questions that we already had from the
audience or would you like to announce
anything say anything first before we
take off nothing particular I think
we've had quite a few questions coming
in and in in advance I'm tripping over
my words here today so I think we've
probably saved people have got answer
similes and then see what people have in
the chat we already have the first
question which is more of an admin
question should we open up the mic to
ask questions or do we take them in the
chat if you if someone's brave enough to
chat over the Internet and then I guess
we can do that if you want to go ahead
okay perfect hi this is Jim can you hear
me yeah hi Jurgen are you again hi guys
one question I guess - gerald probably
when we get 12
very good question when the answer is
never
[Laughter]
the reason for that is that we have
moved our versioning scheme to to 18 C
as most people probably know now right
so there will be no 12 - or - there will
be no 12 2 or 3 you know if an 18 and
the 19 and the good news though is that
Oracle XE is scheduled for 18 see
and actually for every subsequent
release so this is one change that we
did this time we actually launched XE
with every database version that we're
going to launch a teensy 19 C 20 C and
so forth you will always have an
Enterprise Edition version
you also have an addition to version and
you will always have an X version the
other change that we made and actually
you can notice I believe already is that
actually also we have changed the the
type of what XE years before with 10 g
XE and 11 g XE it was database version
with limited functionality available we
have actually changed this with a teensy
you will get a full-fledged Enterprise
Edition single installation XE version
that is resource constrained to two CPUs
to foreground CPUs two gigs of memory
but you have all functionality available
that you would have with a single
instance Enterprise Edition and to
really answer your question you and when
do we get I just set the scene here so
for everybody else
to catch up like we did it's currently
or it is the the release cycle is a
month after the windows release so
usually how this happens with Oracle is
like when we launch on Prem Linux and
Solaris goes first about three to four
weeks later we have the Windows port
ready and then after that a month later
you get a XE for Linux and Windows and
just the question it also popped up here
in the chat is the JVM also included yes
Oracle JVM is included in XE
as well as all the other features that
you have an Enterprise Edition so you
can use your charles ii procedures you
can use spatial and graph but also
partitioning security etc and going
forward this will be our model for XE
because we believe that the times have
change
from where XE was originally came out
from in the 10g timeframe it was more
about Internet bandwidth and giving a
small quick and easy to download and
install version of the Oracle database
we believe now that actually most people
are better served off with the bandwidth
that we have to give me a full fledged
free edition of the Oracle database that
constraints itself in a way that doesn't
confirm construct ridiculous and thing
so you don't have to worry about
anything
it's resource constraint by itself you
will never go over those limits and it's
fully free for you to use 18:18 means we
get one this year eighteen means we get
one this year yeah so we'll get one next
year so that's the good so this changed
as well you will now have one what one
follow-up question Gerald on this right
now when I don't have an exhale it's say
I want to have I want to start the
development for a customer and I can't
download an enterprise edition from OTN
and do some development stuff without
license yet
without paying any license when do I
have to pay license from Oracle database
so the OTN license when you e through it
it essentially says as soon as you use
it for production production use so if
develop yourself then it's free to use
it also has actually some restrictions
and you cannot just take it and roll it
out through your entire organization and
have thousand developers using it for
development that solar from the from
from a licensing perspective from ot ot
unlicensed qualifies as production use
also production use but as a single
individual you can download it you can
use it one thing that people may not
know the OTN license has changed I
believe two years ago in 2016 it also
used to say you can only use it for 30
days only now that was them more
prototyping and development actually
that's gone from the OTN license now but
as with always with licensing software
and licensing you know it's it actually
is important to read
license and see what it says because it
may change as well and I personally
never do yeah exactly I think I'm not
the only one right but you know it's
like everything a license is there to
grant you rights to use the software and
which way to reduce the software right
Oracle is not the only one you have
licenses everywhere Adam open-source
license let's do the same you just they
say you know you can use it for free etc
so read through the LT Ana license you
know make sure that you understand
what's in there it's actually not that
long but in a nutshell this is what it
gives you you can download it you can
develop stuff as soon as you go
production you will have to buy a
license and actual Enterprise Edition
license osc2 as soon as you you know if
you go like hey Gerald said I can use it
for development I roll it out of my five
thousand people or well you will find
out that the OTN license will classify
this as production use as well for your
in-house development okay thank you
okay sign your questions here again oh
yeah anything yeah cool it's good enough
thank you guys hey great great great
idea any way to make this office hours
thank you very much thank you cool
all right then okay then so if anyone
else has any questions that they either
want to put in the chat or they want to
ask us live welcome to do so or
otherwise I think we'll go to some of
the questions we've had in advance as
that sound okay so should we should we
start the top end and kind of say
exactly okay actually just before we
start there's one question it just came
up on the chat maybe let's state take
that one first and that is hello I have
a question about invalid DB objects
under what circumstances the database
objects will get imbalanced
it's basically in the database objects
are invalid because you've broken
something
so the classic example is if you've got
a package and then you drop a table that
refers to that it refers to well it's
that trying to access something that
doesn't exist
so it's going to be invalid now there
are some changes which will seem which
seem to kind of break that rule so let's
say you've got a select star querying
in your package in your procedure and
you add a column to it
well you're potentially changing the
behavior of what's happening in that
procedure there and so the database will
invalidate it and say you know we don't
know what's going on here with over
versions we've got much much better
about controlling the dependencies and
minimizing what actually causes
something to become invalid but
essentially basically you've changed
something which might cause your code to
break
so we've invalidated it hopefully you
haven't broken you know hopefully it's
just something like adding a column and
you just need to recompile in you're
fine worst case it's something a bit
more drastic and you're gonna have to
change all your code but that's the
basic principle no perfect another
question are we having a chat is there
any possibility to have query only
access to the Oracle knowledge-based
papers currently available only to those
who have paid for support license I'll
take the question myself if you would
like me to Chris so the knowledge base
in general's which is available under
support or at accom it is a part of the
support platform and therefore requires
you to have an active support contract
also what we sometimes say will be very
equina maybe here a CSI a customer
support identifier to access that now
that being said so that this won't this
won't change not that you know there are
any plans to to open this up as it is
really for customer support mostly or
mainly a lot of things that we do take
here is to get in more information out
into broader audience like these ask our
Tom office hours or you know have
interest in Connor
Maria answering questions on ask Tom and
chat
cetera so you will see that we try to
get information more information out to
the broader audience but to your
particular question I have heard of no
plans and I don't think it's likely that
the support platform will ever open up
to people that aren't customers paying
for supports or having a support
contract okay
so questions from that we have received
a couple of days ago before the starters
you want me to read out first Chris and
then give it to you yeah go on
I start at the bottom because I looooove
ask first get their answer first
so in a data guard environment
consisting of snapshot standby database
can I enable maximum availability
protection mode so I'm not too much of
an expert on this stuff but I believe
the answer is no on this unless you've
got any further insight Gerald yeah
that's correct so maximum protection
mode essentially means synchronous data
replication so you make sure that your
data is maximum protected when you
commit that actually makes it to the
other side to the standby it's written
there to disk as well it gets
acknowledged back and then your commit
is completed the snapshot standby
approaches there's three types of stamp
pass that we have there's a physical
standby which is a physical one-to-one
copy of your database so the block
structures on disk etc everything is
identical all the way down through the
to the bytes on disk which is normally
what you were used for for maximum
protection mode for example there's a
logical standby which use a stamp a
database that doesn't do physical
replication of the reader stream as such
this is how we do it if the physical
standby but actually execute the same
sequel statements so rather than having
the reader stream going over there when
you do an insert statement we sent this
insert statement through the other side
it's executed there as well that means
that logically it's still the same the
data is still the same that you have in
there but your physical structure may
have changed you know maybe we found
there a block that we could still fit
the row and maybe it to get a new block
which is different from your from your
active database on a snap
shot standby what we do there is that we
actually say I have a stamp our database
now I take a snapshot of the database
and now we're gonna open it and do
things to it SN you know testing so you
can actually manipulate the database
meanwhile all the reduced stream is
captured in the logs on the standby size
site but not applied and then when
you're done with your testing for
example you will essentially say okay
disregard this snapshot all the changes
after them and let the standby database
catch up with all the reduced stream
that has come in and because of this
mechanism so once you open the database
you cannot have maximum protection
because now you essentially not having
this maximum protection of the Rideau
stream has been applied on is physically
identical on the stamp I the locks are
there but if in case you would have a
failover now now it will start that you
know database fits over the snapshot
stamper will say okay there's a failover
at this regard and i have to apply the
archive law the reader stream the
archive logs and that can take a while
depending up for how long you suspended
the applying of this and so therefore
it's not maximum protection databases is
there the data is there but it's not in
the sense of like I committed I made
sure it's over there great nice thorough
description there gerald lot of detail
ok another question
hi Gerald's we creating Oracle database
with archive log option from first two
till now but now we have lost the system
data file how to recover the system data
file hi you got backups right isn't it I
believe the question is we we have
archive logs we lost our data file can
we not just recover the data file with
our archive logs the answer to this is
no you needed backup at least off the
system data file so doesn't matter from
when the backup wars as long as you were
running an archive log but you have to
have the data file as a backup first and
then you can apply to redo on top of
that and the reason for that is simply
when you create the database and enable
the archive log the system tablespace is
created first in order to get the data
dictionary of the database up and the
archive log mode is enabled afterwards
so therefore you actually do not have
this creation of the tablespace of data
dictionary in your archive log so you
need to at least get through that stage
or further on than 10 with the system
change number etc we know from when to
apply the registry might recover
hmm okay so well next we've got a
question so if people who are on the
smart DB session we go two weeks ago we
talked a little bit about how they do
continuous integration continuous
deployment using PL sequel and I know
this is something people ask a lot about
and I think understand you've got some
thoughts on how to enable this Gerald so
I think it'd be useful if you could
share what you think about it all right
absolutely so in the last couple of
years we've actually spent much more
effort into making it easier to get an
Oracle database up and running in many
different ways so you know if the
current situation itu-r we are there's
many many different ways of how to
provision software mostly or more more
as being in scripted manner and not so
much anymore people you know the good
old days when you still put a CD and
your cd-rom and then started installing
and some of the things that we have seen
popping up is containerization
aka docker is one very nice way of doing
CI CD where you quickly spin up a
container containing a software and then
run through example 3-year regression
tests and tearing it down so we have
done this actually since now since now
August 2016 I believe was the first
iteration that we had this so we're
going to two years there now it's very
popular but we have them a lot of things
we've just very recently actually -
three weeks
perhaps four weeks launched another
github repo provides you vagrant files
so vagrant files or vagrant for those of
you don't know it is a nice way for
getting a sample
environment in a VM like VirtualBox and
what that does is essentially a script
that will create you an Oracle Linux VM
and install an Oracle database
full-fledged Oracle database inside it
with just one command you type a current
that up and it will do everything for
you so those are some things that we do
to actually enable more people more
people to apply to a CI CD pipeline sort
of things now of course there's a huge
variety of different ways of how to do
things and we haven't covered all of
them just yet
either but you know we were we have
started with it we continued the effort
we also actually have seen some good
work happening in the community space
out there as well as the tools like
liquid base
fly fly base fly way I think you can fly
way adding more support for Oracle to
kind of get to the stage and we will
continue this effort to do so as well
we actually get some questions now in
the chat popping up so I think we should
or the chances those are logical so yeah
there's someone following them from the
other question we had about the
knowledgebase articles and they're
asking that yeah even on last Tom we
like to tickets we report that refer to
support notes and I think okay that's a
fair point that sometimes we do that you
know we do try and kind of get the
salient points and sometimes we take new
relevant points and put them in the ask
tom thread obviously it's something we
have to take on board and make sure that
we make it as usable as possible and but
you know I don't think that's going to
change the situation Gerald mentioned in
that I don't see you know general access
to support changing anytime soon
another questioner regards so it's just
filtering through chat here I learned
about open apply online recently does it
mean you can abstain from shutting down
the listener and databases of an Oracle
home and applying a PSU I had that
question to you Chris it's be honest
installing or patching and installing
databases is something I do
almost never so unfortunately I have
minimal insight into this so I don't
know the answer to that either
I do reinstall quite a lot of databases
those stalker scripts but I don't really
know right now what's on the top of my
head will opt apply online actually
implies what it's done online and
whatnot yeah so sorry for that one but I
know that the person who asked will
probably test it out himself anyway and
blog about it so maybe in a week's time
we can just google it from his blog or I
can also so this is another thing on
this ask Tom office hours we have a lot
of them with you know also subject
matter experts and we do have one for
upgrade patching and so forth we do a
forum for wreck coming up just we have
actually one for my memory coming up off
the distillate then one for for wreck
coming up and though I got somebody else
sneaking in here so now we have three
experts yes you like so yes I'll see you
in thinking that we just try running
this at least you guys know it's life so
so yes so we have those office hours and
you know such questions if we cannot
answer them and certainly like the Oh
pet reply it's probably asked again in
the in Apache and upgrade one we will
pass the ball on as well through the
team so that they can prepare for that
one and two Frank so that you get an an
answer there
okay then another one as smiley smiley
it starts with a smiley face yeah it's
always a tough question when they start
it's like so set the scene and now it
goes down their life recovery during
off-hours okay half related question I
like the vagrant box over the doctor
because I get rude with the vagrant box
but no longer with the or I want to to
docker image okay I think I think the
question as I'm the D what's the word
for this like they do well although of
both of those like they behind all of
that
yes so the there's a and you know for
people who haven't come across stalker
yet and vagrant the difference there is
or what it is a blocker is a way to
containerize your software subset before
if you've ever dealt with Solaris cells
is pretty much like that just on Linux
and with a nice tooling around it so
that you don't have to type 50 different
commands to get up and running vagrant
is a nice way for provisioning VMs and
you know basically basically just say
take this VM spin it up and an executor
script for me and that script happens to
install an Oracle database enough that's
done you have a VM up and running with
you know everything that a VM is the
difference there or the subtle
difference there is now container so
docker is much more built to just get
software up and running not to
necessarily administrate and tinker with
what's happening inside the container so
you know whether that's an application
whether that's a database it's just like
containerized my application this is
where dorka started and not just run
this container every realm the big
benefit you get is because you
containerized it you can run this
software wherever you have this
container technology running without
having to know how to run the software
it's very similar to what we did with
pdbs and CBeebies right I have a PDB and
I plug it into a CD B and now the CD B
knows how to run this database I don't
have to know how to install a schema and
so forth but that being said containers
don't expect you or don't aren't even
designed to you to actually go into your
container and change things and so forth
you just don't do this with containers
that they are not VMs full-stop because
they are also known through and you
throw away a container anything you have
done in the container is going away it's
always been up from an image again and
then there's ways around to make sure
that data is persistent for databases by
keeping the data outside with vagrant on
the other hand you just have a VM your
field access you have Oracle UNIX access
you have everything else so if docker
you can't come back to the database and
of course you can do everything that you
would like
you within the database setting database
parameters bouncing it creating users
etc so you have to add admin control but
actually going through the physical
container no you shouldn't that doesn't
make it necessarily a great platform for
you know just trying to learn the
technology for example - you have a
sandbox environment where you can play
around with it and so forth and that's
exactly the reason why we launched a
maker into scripts so that you know if
you just want to and you know I for
years and years and years built my own
VirtualBox VM every time a new database
version came out and you know it was a
good exercise for me because I kept
remembering how to install an Oracle
database which is something that we do
as Chris said way less than you out
there but vagrant now allows me to it's
all scripted allows you and mostly to
just type in this command and will do it
for you so you know 20 minutes later or
something if we am up and running and
you good to go
so that's the difference on there not to
get too elaborate on that then there is
I think there is a follow-up question
is it possible to use docker and/or
vagrant on the Windows platform vagrant
on window actually yes the answer to to
both fit is yes you can run docker and
vagrant on windows so vagrant is just a
binary you install on top so you would
install VirtualBox you install vagrant
and then off you go there's ports for
for Mac for Windows for Linux and so
forth docker slightly different there
doctors started out on top of the Linux
container technology which itself
started out as a reimplementation of
Solaris zones and Windows didn't
necessarily have to support yet and for
a long time they used the trick there to
just spin up I always find this funny as
a Mac user or a UNIX user they when you
start a doc on Windows they essentially
spun up a tiny little Linux VM for you
and and then in there they basically
spun up the container they made it look
like it runs from Windows this has
changed recently when this also has
containers now more native integration
so you can do this the one thing I will
say though we see some issues with the
volume mapping on docker
where you then can no longer login a
slash assistive ietters an outstanding
issue right now that I personally cannot
debug because I
I'm a Mac and I don't have a Windows
machine so we just made some progress
actually two days ago with some folks
offered some help to try to to test this
out more so you know be careful when you
run it on Windows it should all work I
mean we certainly have no constraints or
restrictions on there but with docker
and Windows there are a couple last
couple he has always been some issues
that came up there because it wasn't a
native thing
now obviously I'm pretty sure that
Windows sooner or later will just be as
good as Linux because Microsoft is
putting more effort in there as well but
be aware of this one thing we got some
more docker related follow-up questions
so they're asking when they're an
eighteen docker image might be available
yes so you will get an 80 and it's good
that they say $18 X docker image so we
continue this as soon as there's an
on-prem Linux release you will have two
docker image as well so last year we
actually Co launched at the same day I
think it was the first of March last
year that we launched 12 to on-prem on
Linux at the same day you had the docker
files in in the github repo as well and
the the images on a container registry
and took a bit longer to get up there
but with the docker built fast you can
already build your own image so yes you
will get this and we will continue this
as well and for the folks of you who
haven't seen it that's a good way to
announce it as well we have just added
rack support on our github
docker files as well that happened I
believe last week pull request 800 we
got a right nice round number for the
full request 800 I was very proud of
that
completely random of course not
deliberately London so I was just like
how cool rack support then it's 800 how
nice you know could I use can say 200
for something couldn't come up with
anything but you know maybe should have
waited for 1800 but so you have rack now
on docker there as well and actually and
yeah and we will have the images coming
there as well so we will continue this
and somebody's already saying you
noticed support but very much a DIY
build so I guess
even though actually as there there's a
lot of talking question this is great
because I know everything pretty much
instant out there and I apologize for
the others but I just would like to just
finish up with those follow-on questions
as I think it's only fair to you know
get all those answers or questions out
of the way and then follow on with all
our questions so one follow-up question
is regarding daca as well do you know
when rec will be supported and then
another follow-up question not this
direct support is very much it dude
yourself built so the we actually follow
a methodology here that we said okay so
we're gonna put it out on github first
as bill fast because that has proven
tremendously valuable for us for the
single install installation to get
feedback back so actually before we even
had an image out there I think for a
year or so we had the github files out
there you know we saw back then it was
even a question do people even care
running oracle database and talker and
me being the guy putting it out there
was like yeah you know how does people
were like we don't believe you now we
all know that people care so did you use
those but coming back to the point so we
have this out there now we actually
running through the support cycle right
now to get the support done as well and
then based on the feedback that we see
is to please open issues when you have
issues roofied the bill files and so
forth on get up let us know all that
feedback will actually flow into
provided image that we roll launched
later on and there again the same thing
here happens that with 18 see we will
have 18 see docker build for our bill
files and images as well and so forth
now the other one thing that I want to
point out because that question came up
a couple of times is like you have
single instance why does req take so
long it is not easy to take a technology
that has been engineered to talk as
closely as possible to the operating
system to the unity process do as much
as I can to guarantee performance high
availability and so forth to put this
into an container which is all built
around abstracting everything from the
operating system and making sure that
you know you cannot compromise the hosts
you cannot do anything
the host and so forth so there's always
this layer in between and that was one
thing that took some engineering efforts
actually on the Linux kernel side as
well as on our site that we actually
gave back to the community now so the
upstream Linux as well to enable to have
such concerts like Iraq and for an
infrastructure talking close to the OS
but still remain within the remit of a
container yeah so that was am i you just
just saying that if we could have a
beginner session sort of like a basic
101 I guess on how to get started with
darker and yeah okay so I try to follow
up on those questions so we have
actually here just to point it out to
everybody who folks who aren't following
the Chet found a good note on Moss about
applying patch online our DBMS online
patching aka hot patching doc 76111 1.1
that is on the support platform so it's
not available for anybody but for folks
that do have a support contract or their
company is to support countries you can
look that one up then let me see what's
the next question
follow up follow up we addressed all of
those and then yes actually I think
maybe you said this from the chat Chris
so you said it by yourself but there
isn't a chat I think it would be nice to
get you a special session for beginners
in which to explain the basics of docker
versus vacant post VirtualBox yes we
will absolutely think about happy to do
it at any time so we will we will
perhaps to resist not ask office a
office our ask something then so we've
got you know people are saying that
conceptually rack and doctoral
anti-patterns
mmm right postdoc do you agree with that
gerald are you yeah so it's actually a
little bit more complex and there
there's like drak and cluster
orchestration layer for for docker like
kubernetes sort of conceptually
anti-patterns but yes i mean
it is correct that one thing that we
have to remind ourselves is like wreck
is around since nine and you know when
you go all the way back there there were
no real clustering click no there were
maybe a few clustering technologies out
there but they were not mainstream as
and everybody would use them a lot of
things were built into grid
infrastructure we you know started out
as a general clustering technology of
hosts and highly secure reliable and
performant clustering technologies or
you know we do special things of like
making sure oh we lose contacts you know
but you might think that something goes
going on we will make sure that the
first thing we kill is i/o on that notes
would avoid any data corruption and so
forth so a lot of engineering has gone
in there and now with docker container
izing everything abstracting it from the
host and so forth and now actually also
with something like kubernetes or locust
swarm or maysa just to point out the
three but kubernetes has pretty much won
the battle we I personally believe and I
think the industry has come to
conclusion as well you now have this
clustering technology that allows you to
cluster those containers and it's all
about not having to know what's going in
inside there I just spin up up there
again and so forth and to spin is just
one level further then I will move on
because I think everything else is
better explained in and actually a full
hands-off or separate talk about this
but to just finish one level further you
know the docker container ization thing
came out of the application space at the
application space is what we call
stateless so you know the idea was I
built my application wants container
eyes it up and then I can run it
anywhere and I don't care whether the
guy is running on red-haired Linux on
Oracle Linux Solaris Windows now as well
these days and so forth right like it's
all abstract I don't care whether it's
running in somebody's cloud or on Prem
because everything is just done by this
containerization layer but that's very
easy if you have a stateless application
and you go again as a bunch of binary as
well it you know it gets the load
balancer in front where requests come in
and it's lost data in a database and so
therefore if this thing dies I spin it
up somewhere else and I just continue
the work there right
it's not no state that have to lose in
2/4 that's what doctor came out from and
then you know to make databases around
and work that actually took a while
there was the first three years you
couldn't even do it because you couldn't
persist any data outside the doctor
contain and you would lose two cents
before so yes conceptionally this sort
of our anti patterns now we'll say that
as well a lot of people are asking for
it and I think the and from both sides
not only our customers and you guys out
there but also from the other side you
know it's like hey we have applications
no wrong to databases so I think the
technologies will sooner or later you
know get in in synergy and then
complement each other and that's
certainly what we do with rec right now
where I said you know we we've had some
stuff back into the Linux come to make
things like that happen so I wouldn't
just you know go and say if somebody
comes along and say we want to do is
doctor necessarily turn around to them
occur like are no way it's like there is
momentum behind it then there's
certainly things changing to that world
there was my last thing of vodka so
sorry for those who've talked of it I
think a lot of people have a lot of
questions about it so everything is good
that's good yeah so there's another one
and I believe this is like two times hit
enter one question not from just a
developer but from a database developer
point of view who is copying with the
data schema coping sorry with the data
schema problems when it comes to see ICD
well so this probably now gets me on
another 50 minutes around DevOps and how
we all just work together to make things
easier you know no love happening all
the time so from a developer point of
view and you know for folks who don't
know what the ICD means it means
continuous integration continuous
deployment it is a new way of thinking
where people say you know whenever you
change your line of code
some people go as extreme and a lot of
their minds and internet companies where
they go you know whenever you change
your line of code or some code and you
check this into your code repository it
will spin up all the regression tests
you know check that everything you first
unit test regression test is met so
forth make sure that everything's fine
that's just how it's done these days and
a lot of environments and
we wear so that status quo but the next
step is this continuous integration
means and then we ship it to production
because you're not testing everything
went through and we ship it out there
and you know for a long time people were
like you cannot do that I mean are you
crazy right so there's companies out
there that ship 10 to 14 15 times a day
into production and the way why this
thinking came up is sort of also for
similar things that you see with shorter
release cycles and so for some people
and say alternate or those companies
turn around and say well listen if I
gonna update my application you know I
have a code change happening everything
went through testing and everything went
fine I push this out to production
I know exactly that if something breaks
it was exactly that line of code and I
just easily roll back on a web-based
environment you don't usually turn over
your entire production estate either but
they do something that is known as
canary deployment or Bluegreen
deployment where you basically you start
some services getting the new version
and then you gradually move over traffic
to until you reach 100% so that in
itself as there's benefits there so they
know very quickly whether or not
something is broken and even more
important they know actually what course
to break because you know it's one line
of code change orders it's one code
change in there may be many rights but
it's one commit one times actually ended
in one life and then with the groobly no
canary a blue green or canary deployment
they don't usually take the entire
ecosystem down either right they start
the percent or maybe even less depending
on your scalars and so they go like hey
you know what 99 percent then you
noticed this we found some issues we
just killed a new version of the app and
we just redirect the traffic to the old
version so this is actually also another
thing that they start doing now it's
like they spin up always new versions
they don't migrate applications they
spin up a new version and again if you
don't have state that's easy
now you know big benefit there is so
it's just trying to keep all my my
thread here
big benefit here is of course you don't
have one big or
nothing upgrade anymore right so they go
like we know exactly okay well changes
Kostis break but also you know so you
don't end up in the situation anymore
that you go like okay so we had 1500
changes and 30 different features you
know that we now rolled out because we
did a yearly upgrade so what cost the
issue it was a debt code change was it
that code change with that code change
and so forth so that's what people are
more going through so this is what sort
of the CI CD means in a nutshell now for
a database developer point of view in a
in production so you know a lot of CI
CDs also to do with having a spy plan in
development and I believe that data is
not important there in development
environments it shouldn't in any case
anyway you should always be able to
trash your development environment and
build it again from scratch or your test
environment in some way or the other for
the production I believe that if this is
where now my thing goes on into DevOps
you know I don't believe there is this
distinction anymore or well there is
certainly is this distinction out in the
world of whom's job is walk through
who's doing what but I also believe that
you know we have to get over this and we
have to realize as a whole and in IT and
I'm you know if you heard me talk or
spoke to me probably noticed I'm a big
advocate for this there's like you know
at the end of the day we all here to
provide some value to through if you
work for companies for those companies
all right and it's like political
battles in companies or like I do this
and throw it over the fence and then you
guys look after it they can be nice some
people like doing them I personally hate
them but at the end of the day they
never ever help the company achieve
their goal which is you know making
money or in some case or getting the
product up so from a database developer
point of view if data changes and so
forth when it comes to CI CD you know I
believe it is the in a true DevOps
manner the database developer as well as
the guys who are the OP side and so
forth together figuring out what's going
on because only the developer knows
where those changes came in the first
place and what they're trying to do
and you know potential issues that
costed and so forth and the Ops guys
have probably dosed that will that will
spot it for you right that something
went wrong so and then in the end of the
day you really want to have this
feedback cycle right I mean ideally you
want to get to your stage where you know
you don't just go like problem in
productions mixtape done but you want to
get to your stage for a problem in
production fixed it at this cost it and
this is what we did to prevent it and
there's actually a very good paper out
there in the world that's I don't know
what it's still easy to find but it's
from NASA that talks about how they
programmed the software for the space
shuttles in the 80s and that's actually
very interesting and a lot of what we
call DevOps now goes back to that point
and you know it's I cannot share what
they said back then and the paper was
whenever there was a park or you know
some tests have failed it was never ever
a question of who broke it who did wrong
it was almost a question of why did we
not catch this earlier but what didn't
work in our testing what did not work in
our unit test etc right why did we not
catch this earlier it was a team effort
because they knew we shoot people people
into space and it doesn't matter if you
screwed up or I screwed up people and I
if anybody of us screws up and you know
that gives you a very different view of
how you write software but I think this
methodology was thinking of why did we
not catch this before it actually got to
production or you know what can we do to
remedy this for the next time it's a
healthy attitude and working together
with the teams around everybody plays
their part in the company otherwise we
would all just be single people
companies out there doing our own thing
there's a reason why we have different
people doing different jobs and I think
working closer together there is a good
thing so a long question a long answer
for your question I want him I will go
off on that one it's good points the
array said I've got a couple of thoughts
on this as well because I think one of
the things you say about with the
application is its stateless and that's
the big difference with the databases it
isn't and the this is particularly a
problem when it comes to reversing
database changes so you put something
out and you realize something's gone
horribly wrong how do we get how do we
undo it and so a couple of things
that you mention there I think it's
important like you're saying making sure
you can easily be rebuild your tests and
development environments so if you can
do that and you're pushing these schema
changes into tests and dev regularly
then you can pick those up and if there
is going to be a problem hopefully
you're catching them way before you even
get to production so I think that's one
big step to help mitigate these problems
the other thing is something that back
when I did actually do you know real
work in support production stuff is as
much as possible try and separate the
application release from the related
database release so if you're adding a
column to support some code add the
column first and then at some point
later deploy the code because one of the
biggest struggles you have is not just
the fact that if you've got to drop that
column it's a it's just a nightmare but
what do you do with all that data you
know some people have written
information into there and okay if
you're a social media application and
you're just recording what happy beware
doesn't matter if you're a bank any
recording I don't know some extra
information which is a legal requirement
you can't just revert that back out and
and as Gerald says you know if you've
deployed a whole bunch of stuff together
and something goes wrong you don't know
what's caused it but if you've added the
column everything's fine then you deploy
the code and something goes wrong you
know it's not the database change that's
done it so as much as possible if you
separate those so then that way at least
if you do have to back your database
changes out hopefully there's no new
information you don't have to go we've
got all this customer data which we've
got to figure out what we're going to do
with while we back it back out the
change will fix it so I think adding
state adds a lot of problems but testing
early making changes small helps on
those issues and I think there's a
follow-up note on that one from the
person asking a question saying the
trick doesn't work with mandatory
columns which I think means not more
columns hmm I'll be tricky oh and you do
that right obviously yeah now on that
note though
always would like to highlight addition
based redefinition for its purposes and
what it does and you know if you haven't
come across EBR this additional history
definition yet Britain is actually the
go-to person for that but in a nutshell
it allows you to version it started for
allowing to version your PLC quo but it
can also version your data model in a
sense then you put fuse on top and
instead of triggers and that not maybe
not works always either but the you know
what do you see then once in a while you
see sometimes happening there it's like
yes not null constraints foreign key
constraints and stuff like that
they are obviously a yes or no kind of
mechanism which sometimes the answer is
just pragmatic it means we cannot make
this column not null until you know all
the apps are at this new version or you
know we put a trigger in place to fill
it or you know many different
workarounds and yes they are workarounds
right there's not a single easy solution
or an answer to this at this point in
time and you know certainly this also
flips the other way around I mean a lot
of times you could have not null
constraint down there because you don't
trust the apps to actually you know give
you the right data and that's that's
legit right I mean that that's why we
have constraints and so forth so you
know again there there is some ways
around with and over the years this has
changed a bit as well right so with
default values triggers etc then you can
use their or you know even some
constraints where you can create them
but not enforce them and so forth
mmm-hmm good points I Gerald ok so
there's another one that when working
with an ASM incidence sometimes you must
log on as sis TVA sometimes it's just
ASM do you have a good mnemonic to know
when to use which the pragmatic answer
take their answer on this one so my
proto antic answer is stop blogging on a
slashes to Stevie as much as you can and
the reso what I mean by that is like
always try to log on with the least
privileges that you need and I notice
like a pain right I mean we all been
there done that still do it like /
assist you a let me do everything right
and I don't have to worry about which
rights and so forth but the reason why I
say it is because those things usually
don't tend to trickle into production
right and they usually so what a for
example right my previous life before
insufficient privileges are more
privileges do we need that I will them a
right grantie be able to user great it's
only for test don't worry it's only for
test no no we will catch this before we
roll it down in production yeah of
course we did right and was actually on
the customer that said yeah you guys not
installing this update and I said well
you want DBA rights to your user rights
must be insane big issue then because we
were like hey we're rolling out this
update now we have a showstopper and so
forth right and you know in today's
world where securities is more more more
more more more more critical I think you
really have to to actually pay your
active part I believe you know it's like
least privileged users let me do this
and only the things that I need to do
and you know on the same line it's like
they may get you ran off a bit of
headache while you develop they usually
cost way bigger headache and way bigger
revenue impact and stuff in production
that you know you could maybe as cost
you half an hour now another thing for
the Swiss TV asus ASM I believe may be
wrong there with 18 but 18 is not on
premiered only in the cloud so you know
some people can correct me perhaps I
believe Swiss TV is the only privilege
that allows you to start and stop the
instance as in to tear down the entire
instance started up again I think you
have to be such DBA you cannot even do
this as system if you know the system a
role I know that this was at least the
reason I kept other way one of the
privileges Swiss TV had a couple of
years ago now again this might have
changed you know one of the changes
obviously is that we don't no longer
have Swiss TV a and so soap but it also
stated guts to say SM and so forth so
you know I'm not only are we not only
preaching yeah you should use the
privilege as you have but we actually
playing our active part
say you know perhaps we need more roles
that are more fine-grain for those
things as well I hope that helps now
when are you going to have some apex
office hours many things to ask I will
take this personally for words i
copy-paste this now if you will forward
this too we are hoping to have some apex
office hours I mean so Joel is the man
in charge here so if you want to hassle
him and say give us some office hours
but I know they are they're very busy
trying to get the latest release of Apex
out so thing that tends to work great
with them is just public shaming on
Twitter yes when do we get apex office
hours I think that's a good to get
approached but the nice thing is so I
think we have spoken with Joel and Joel
Kalman is the development VP for apex
actually not even the product manager
who actually is often I'm so even you
know closer to the source code if you
have any questions or announcement
requests today as well so this will be
good
and there's actually had such tweets
keep tweeting yeah need to be tweeted
and retweeted okay what else we got um
asking about how to rename a schema that
contains applications data on a
production database I think why there's
actually just how do we am a schema this
is also something that we have from the
database ideas forum since a while it's
very interesting just seeing the world
out there arguing about it as well
because some people you're like well I
want to rename the schema you know
schemas the wrong name whatever a type
of people go like but surely you should
have spotted a typo in your development
environment or lose your test
environment and not in production right
it's like why do you need this
renaming a schema may sounds easy to
begin with
and if you don't care about consistency
it's all so easily done but renaming
ASCII
has implications on consistency because
obviously the objects go to to another
owner and therefore you know data
dictionary changes and so forth and as
long as you can guarantee that no later
is actually occurring so it no data is
no DML is actually occurring then you
know renaming is pretty simple it just
you know have moved table and so forth
and you can write some PL sequel scripts
to do so manually even right and we
could either easily wrap this up and
even an alter schema rename command but
you know we are in a world where
everything is 24/7 or at least you know
we in Oracle database engineer a
database for a world for 24/7 constant
workload and so therefore you never
really can get this guarantee that there
is not a single DML happening and you
know that now trade was over there and
so forth now there are some ways to to
go around this to remedy that with you
know for example since a while now we
have online table or we they finish
ended up belief or the love you you move
it to another schema again there it very
quickly becomes a bit trickier if now
you need grants on the other schema
right through your application now need
surf the ground on the other scheme and
so force its again and again you can you
know everything is sort of scriptable
and PLC code very nicely you just create
a data dictionary views you know figure
out your grants you give the new schema
or the user's grant so that schema move
the stuff over or after you moved and so
forth so but there is not an a lot of
single commands many ways of doing it
you know transporter potatoes bases and
other way it's just like create table a
select and stuff like that but you will
always come back to this consistency
question so can you actually guarantee
that you know theta hasn't gone in there
after we moved it or should have come in
there but didn't because we moved it and
so forth so that's a tricky one and then
you know it was Chris said to begin with
you know before going down a rat hole
why would you want to do this in the
first place it's like you know think
spend some time thinking about your
schema names I hopefully catch it in
tests now I know that there are
legitimate reasons why you want to
rename it it's like the database is
there for 20
yes right and if we were in constraint
to that schemer name and we would really
like to use a bigger one
yeah that's legitimate but it's also
sort of I want a one-off effort that you
probably have to work a bit and think
about a bit how you go about it because
again it is more about the applications
than anything else how can you guarantee
that you know your workload will
continue and oh hey I don't find this
table anymore insufficient privilege
yeah and where you mentioning the
application and source also worth
bearing in mind that your application
might have hard-coded some schema
references in there so you know many
many years ago we had an application
which someone tried well they did rename
the schema and everything broke because
there was a lot of code that referred to
the old schema name so you know it's one
of those be careful what you wish for
particularly with these legacy databases
that have been got sprawling code and
then clients accessing them from
everywhere yeah absolutely
another question if already at Apex it
would be great if a presentation could
be prepared specifically for Oracle
forms developer aka explaining the apex
basics by pointing through the different
thinking patterns between the two that's
a very legitimate and good point and I
will take this away and send to our apex
guys yeah I think I believe various
people have done them at use group
conferences I can't think of one off the
top of my head but we can have a look
and quite often this slides available
but you know I think that would be good
month to make take up with the apex team
but there is content out there which of
you dig around you can find okay
somebody had to ask it in they
soviet-era first I say my feature from
last to this one but you go first okay
so I think I mean there's a lot of these
kind of I guess you call schema on read
or flexible type schema changes have
come in in 18 so we've expanded
Jason with enhancing the functionality
there we've got anyone who's come from a
sequel server background will probably
love private temporary tables so table
table tables that literally only exist
in your session but I think my favorite
one is probably inline external tables
so rather than actually have to create
an external table you can just create
have a query and define the external
table on the fly so it literally doesn't
exist this is particularly useful I
think if you've not got a
straightforward CSV file it can be
really tricky to figure out you know how
to get the columns to line up or how
about what the terminators are and it
you can just prototype in a single query
and so I think I think that's pretty
cool so Geraldton with you oh the
question came up and a month ago as well
and back then I believe my answer was
private temporary tables as well I
changed that of every feature and 18:1
obviously and they cannot pick but know
one thing that I like a lot and I'll
tell you why is that we now have the
sleep function in DBMS session mm-hmm
and there's a couple of reasons why I
like it so much so number one this was
come this came from the community on the
database idea forums out out there so if
you don't notice yet the few Google
Oracle database ideas you get a forum
where you can put an enhancement
requests and so forth and this was
something that actually also bucked me
years and years ago when you know I was
still working outside or a total of
eight nine ten well it's like why is the
sleep function in DBMS lock right inside
and I only can grant through our
execution rights on the package not on
the methods of package all I want to do
is you know pause for a second or
whatever or a minute whatever it may be
right but now I and we actually have
this really in in this scenario where
you know we needed execute rights on
DBMS lock because of the sleep function
that we used in there and our customers
didn't like it at all because there are
other methods in there that you know you
don't necessarily want to expose to
everybody or to applications to use and
so this came in from the community we
took this feedback and
the Deaf team was immediately yeah makes
perfect sense it's like yeah why did we
no think of the Sunnah right it's like
they are since ages obviously um and
they literally just gave you a TMS
session sleep that calls the same
underlying code of see eunice Locksley
so nice thing there it now allows you to
or you can easily migrate from DBMS law
sleep to DBMS session sleep because it's
actually the very same code there's not
a real implementation or anything and
DBMS lock sleepers them there for
backwards compatibility and so forth but
I think that will just make a lot of
things easier and I actually bring this
question that just came up here back to
you Chris on top of the hour but life
secret does not allow access to DBMS
session either I know well I think I
mean it's says DBMS session does allow
you to do things like trace and
potentially someone might decide to
trace the whole database which would is
it opens up a potential way to attack
the thing that still it's I think you
know if you've got things that you want
to see we can review those put them on
the feedback say I really want this we
do review those and try and push back
you know we start this it's the thing we
start out with a security lockdown try
and give us a few privileges as possible
and then slowly work it back and I think
that's just general was like Gerald was
saying earlier start out with the
minimum privileges and then gradually
pull them back as you identify a use
case or um
verify that it's safe right so we on the
top of the hour to actually I would
personally like to thank everybody who
has been on realize it's not morning
time necessarily for you guys but you
all over the world so thank you very
much for sticking with us for for an
hour and I hope you enjoyed it and Chris
thank you very much for trimming in here
for the bouncing off the difficult
questions anytime Gerald it's alright
it's great
note this down okay yeah great and thank
you everybody
rest of the weekend happy Easter to
those of you celebrate Easter yep
thank you all goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
