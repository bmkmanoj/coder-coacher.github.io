developer for a long time I did flex
developments quit at some part in the
last years I'm more interested in mobile
stuff iOS Android I used to work in
iteration as principal mentor which most
of my talks in Java one was about
actually this is the fourth talk this
year I recently joined Intel as a mobile
app developer I'm an eclipse committee
on eclipse Libra project I have nothing
with Eclipse or wine which I am going to
demo today all I have is the nice
t-shirt I'm a user group manager at
Istanbul we organize GDG stumble Google
developer group I have some folks here
and also I kind of conference speakers
this is my charger one is a speaker so
this talk will be about eclipses all
right which is actually a web based IDE
but as I'm going to talk about it's not
like trying to run the full-blown IDE in
just one tap it's it has a different
perspective and it's not bad
so what's alright it's software
development in your browser the initial
focus was developing HTML Javascript and
CSS in the browser since those are the
stuff that run on the browser so you
don't need another compiler or
interpreter you are already in the
browser and you can just run those top
as far as I know it was initiated by IBM
Oh Toa and the first demo was at Eclipse
Con 2011
so why in a browser actually if
just look back to our tools and products
we use they're all browser-based our
repositories are on the browsers if we
are if you are doing web development the
debuggers are also in the browser the
code review or you should checkers are
on the browser we don't install anything
to use those and also the documentation
czar also in the browser the Java Doc's
wiki's or Apache sites they all run in
the browser so actually the only missing
part is coding we just do the coding not
in the browser so to go back and make
the browser suitable for coding we need
code editing we need to compile the code
we wrote or just interpreted we need a
kind of project structure since we are
all familiar with that it from IDs we
need search capabilities and of course
we need to commit our projects to some
kind of repositories damage it SVN or
anything but we need to share the code
so let's me eclipse all right it's a
browser-based open tool integration
platform for developing web applications
it's written in JavaScript and runs in
your browser so if you have a tablet or
a Chromebook which you can't really
install full-blown applications ok you
can install applications on your tablet
but it's not like installing a fool idea
with SDKs and the compilers so if you
just have the browser you can just
develop apps
it's not an ID in a single tap it's not
trying to do that it's actually rounds
each file in a new tab so each file is a
unique URL and you don't have the
multiple files just like you have in
regular Eclipse it's up and running on
Orion hub which is open to public you
can use Orion hop or you can just
download and install alright on your
local server and your development team
can use it from your server and are the
nice thing about eclipses plugins we all
use plugins and even the very basic
simple use of eclipse needs several
plugins and Orion also works with
plugins it has you can just throw up
your own plugins or use the existing
plugins so it basically has a plug-in
architecture but still why by minidom
web-based IDE the nice thing was
actually other than all those stuff in
this slide yesterday I did this demo
with a friend and he didn't even need to
brought his laptop to Java one with him
he was do all he was doing all the
coding from his nexus 7 so even a nexus
7 without a physical keyboard and a
small screen was enough to prepare the
demos so it doesn't need an installation
on the clients so no setup no
installation which means lower cost of
ownership and also scalable computing
power it's simple and you can easily
share your files via links you can
bookmark or it's just simple links it
says a powerful engine because the
modern browsers are powerful
and if you have a modern browser it will
just run and well it's on the cloud
which is a fancy trend the tinge so it
just sounds good if you just are wonder
it's powered by Java which actually runs
on the equinox which is the core of
regular Eclipse it's running on jetty
and on the client side it's pure html5
JavaScript and CSS nothing else there is
an experimental server which was written
in not Jas if you're a JavaScript and
not jazz fan it's fun to download and
play with the code so how to start using
Orion the easiest way would be just
going to or ein hop you don't need to
install any or download anything you can
just create your account and start using
your EIN simple well if you like it you
most probably don't want to leave your
projects on Orion since there will be
your private stuff so you can always
download the zip file extract it and run
it in your own server so you will just
have your own or ein server instance the
download size is approximately about 30
to 40 megabytes depending on the
operating system I recently downloaded
the version for Mac which was I think 39
megabytes for Windows and Linux it
should be around 33 megabytes so it's
not really big you you can just download
and run it the the installation process
is also it's not even exact their
installation
so I'll to start your points to Orion
hub you can create your account or if
you have already you can log in it has
its also integrated with Google accounts
and some other stuff
next you will end up with a simple easy
to use screen there's a top menu and
below the top menu you can just create a
new folder or a new file which is just
pretty simple commands nothing fancy so
actually there's a different approach on
Orion you don't have the project
structure you have folders and you can
create folders in folders or files in
folders so basically everything is just
like your file system this is the basic
page you can see you can there are some
actions you can create new stuff you
have some actions on the files or
folders you can always navigate up and
there's a navigation menu which you can
navigate through your editor or your
published size sites or your git
repositories which I'll show you later
there is a user menu where you can log
in log out or change your settings this
is the main navigation menu it consists
it your git repositories the Navigator
some search capabilities the shell and
the sites you published and on the user
menu you can have your shortcut settings
or you can just sign out
on the actions you have several actions
depending on your choice but you can
copy move delete or do the comparison
between files it's very similar to your
regular Eclipse installation you can do
side by side or just one in one wheel
comparison importing your project is
also easy you can just import from a
drop-down box and you can just click
import local file and choose from the
pop-up or if your browser supports it
you can just drag and drop which is kind
of cool and when you are done you can
just export your project as a zip file
so you can just take it where everything
and you're done
currently Orion supports JavaScript
html5 and CSS development so as you can
see on a JavaScript editor you have a
very Eclipse like style you have markers
for errors also it uses jacent in the
background
it marks the problem area and gives an
explanation so it's quite similar to
your Eclipse installation
it just works on the web and it has code
completion of it works in either CSS or
HTML or JavaScript which is also very
similar to regular Eclipse and as I
mentioned before it also supports HTML
developments
I mentioned before Iran supports plugins
it has a plug-in architecture basically
all plugins are html5 and JavaScript
files so it's actually running your
javascript in the browser as a addition
to the Orion there are some ready
plugins which you can just install to
your Orion and start using JSP to fire
is one of them and it works pretty well
it just added at its own or comment in
the top when you press the button it
will just format your JavaScript just
like in Eclipse we are pressing ctrl f
it has search capabilities you can do
search in files or search within files
so it can just show the search results
you can see here it can search in files
or within a file and also since each
file is a unique URL you can make use of
your browser your browser's history you
can just because usually you have a file
name which is which makes sense you can
just find the file from your browser
history by typing the file name it will
it would be nothing without some source
control integration so Orion is
integrated with get out of parks you can
just add your git repository and commit
your code or check out your code from
yet
and you can see the status of the files
here we have some on stage than staged
files we can see the comments to the
branches and you can also see the status
you can make comparisons oh by the way
you can just compare site by site is two
separate file windows or just in one
window so it's basically what you used
to having regular Eclipse once you are
done with development you you can launch
your site again on Eclipse or on site
the Orang hub what you need to do is you
navigate through sites create a new site
give a name for the site and do the
mapping the mapping is actually a path
and the project you want to run on or
ein hop so by the way if you are
planning to write a plug-in for Orion
you can also write it in Orion and just
make it online as a site and install it
over Orion so it's kind of cool
yesterday when I gave this talk for the
first time one of the questions was one
of the popular question was how to run
it in local because ok everybody is
careful about their called to share
their codes and committed to committed
it to an external system so it's pretty
easy to run it in your local server I'm
using the name server because yesterday
a few people told you download and
install Orion on your laptop which
bitch you can do it's not really running
heavily and consuming a lot of power but
that's not the whole idea it's it should
be on the web so probably you will
prefer to install it on it launch it you
know in a server and just connected yeah
your laptop or desktop so you can just
download it from Eclipse orc the current
version should be 4.0 m1 which I took
the screenshot two days ago and
downloaded the file as I mentioned
before it's roughly about 30 to 40
megabytes the Mac version is a little
larger it's pretty easy to start running
or eine on your local device computer
you can just download unzip the file and
launch it on Linux you just type Eclipse
or ein and it runs and on Mac OS or
Windows you just click the icon and
neutrons maybe at this point I can just
show you how to run or Ryan I have one
extracted here yesterday since this is a
Mac it's the application is here I just
need to double click and if it's not
running already it will just pop up
there yeah so Orion is running right now
let me fire a new Eclipse instance and
point to localhost 8080
so now I'm just running on my local
laptop so if I just create an account it
will create the account in my local
installation there's nothing going to an
external server or something like that
maybe I can continue with my own
installation instead of Orion hub let me
go back to the slides plugins plugins
are an essential feature of Orion as
other browsers Orrin comes with some
built-in plugins and you can install
some other plugins there are a bunch of
plugins some of them somehow I use some
of them like J's beautifier you can
easily write your own plugins I just
wonder how many of you ever write plugin
for eclipse the regular Eclipse goal
like three or four people so writing
plug-ins for Eclipse is fun but it's
different you you need to know SWT and
if it's extension points it's it's just
another world it's easy to learn but
it's just a little different the nice
thing about Orion is it's plain
JavaScript and HTML so for me when I
coded some Eclipse plugins I had
difficulties with SWT understand how to
build a UI with this one it's just HTML
if you did web tour often before all you
need to learn is the extension points
which are available from the Java Script
so it's nothing relating a lot of heavy
weight on a Java Script you can easily
become a plug-in developer
so it comes with some plugins file
service jslint you can easily install
your own plug-in the it's it's it's kind
of cool
the plugins are just webpages so to
install a plug-in you click install and
give the URL that's all from the web
from the HTML file or iron loads the
plug-in and just add the commands or
other functionality to the editor or
other parts of Orion so how to do or
plugins you need to create an HTML file
which is the main entry point of your
plugin the first thing you need to do is
importing the plug-in J's which you can
find from around wiki I just created the
file on my desktop so while I'm
developing to plug in I'll just show you
the file and how to import it then you
write your service your plug-in which
will just execute what you want you have
services you have service registry to
access libraries you can just get the
registry and ask for a service from it
here you can just just using the Orion
page dialog so I can just open dialogues
and ask for confirmation or that kind of
stuff there's a plug-in provider where
you can register your service your
plugin so you can execute your plug-in
actually this Oren execute your plugins
and shortcuts or the button is
clicked so I'm going to demo and show
you a basic plug-in which was actually
taken from the Eclipse wiki this flight
doesn't make sense anymore did all the
talks took place previously so let me
skip this part just in case you want to
email or find mount you can find me on
Twitter so this is all right hope I have
them this is the example from the web
site from the Eclipse wiki here I have a
folder called X which has a basic plugin
which does reversing the string it's
pretty simple
I'll just do one from scratch now first
let me show you how a Ryan works these
are the menus I mentioned before you
have the editor git repositories search
capabilities sites where I'll leave the
page where I previously published this
plug-in as a site oh I need to reload in
nice so this is the login page
hopefully I have internet connectivity
yeah so you can see my site here I can
just stop it or restart it I can just
change the properties I will create a
new one so it's okay I can use the
browser controls I can just click back
and go back I can bookmark this link so
it's really nothing of like heavyweight
something heavyweight in your browser
it's pages which are linked each other
it's very basic web application my site
is published on this web address since
it's a plug-in if you click the link
you'll just see the contents but if you
click the html5 you will see nothing
because it can only work in Orion so
let's start a new one and oh not this
one sorry I'll just go back to the
editor oops
ah
okay I went back to the editors but I
think we have a little connection
problem let me refresh at first I can
just do it on my local installation
yes I'm psyched not working
let me try here yeah okay
I think this tap is broken
okay I'll just create a new folder which
is kind of like a project let's say
comment out plug-in I need an html5 here
HTML file here let me get inside the
folder
I mentioned before I need to have the
plug-in Jeff I already have it on my
desktop so let me just import it from
here we are drag and drop if I can find
it yeah here so okay
so now I have the plug in Jess which I
just copied from the eclipse wiki Orien
wiki so let's go back to our sample
plugin I'll just take this code and
modify it the way I want so the first
thing I do is importing the plug-in Jess
so I can get the service and the
registry other kind of stuff which I
need in my plugin I have a plugin named
version let's change it comment out
plug-in version one I don't want to
reverse this drink anymore it doesn't
make sense but what I want to do is I
want to comment out the line which was
selected in the editor so it makes more
sense than reversing it so I'll just
change this one comment out
let's find another shortcut let's say T
and that's all I'm going to change I
register my plug in as a service which
my plug by the code I'm running in my
plug in is this object the service
simple which has a run function which
will run and do execute to think I'm
going to do so I just registered this
the input code with the properties to
the provider and let the provider
connect to the Orion
so basically that's it for the very
simple use what I need to do is now I
need to make this plug-in life running
on a server you can just deploy it in a
server but I'm just going to do it in
alright I just make sure it's saved now
I go back to sides
create a new site comment out plug in
submit
okay so now I have the site with the
name but I need to do some mapping so I
say comment out plugins will be mounted
at this address and yet basically that's
it so now oh where did it start okay
here so now I'll just start the site so
it will be live and I have the URL I
copied this one now I can go back to not
this one sorry now I can go back to my
settings and install new my install my
new plug-in installing the plugins are
pretty easy you just click install it
asks for the URL you entered the URL but
you also need to add HTML file name
which I was about to forget
it's called plug-in HTML so I say
install oh no sorry submit so yeah it's
installed if the site is not live then
you'll get a response that Orion cannot
connect to the plug-in so just in case
you have some troubles installing your
plug-in you can see my plug-in is here
it's loaded so now if I go back to the
editor it should be live let's go this
one and let's comment out this line yeah
it works
maybe I should add support for any
commenting god few lines because I'm
pretty sure it won't do that with that
god yeah so that's a very basic sample
but what I wanted to show was it's pure
HTML and JavaScript there's nothing
really fancy about it and if you're
familiar with Eclipse plugins then
you're good to go if you're not you can
still easily get the main concept and
start to Wapping and you can also just
use the Orion as a editor if you're
doing html5 and JavaScript development
so I'm my talk is done if you have any
questions on happy trying answer yes the
question was is it coolant to our CP
definitely not our CP first our CP is
targeting something totally different
it's for developing desktop apps by
using the core Eclipse this one is it's
not even you can't even really change
the way or ein works you can just add
your plugins to add functionality in our
CP you can change the whole Eclipse no
one may even realize it's about Eclipse
anymore so it's definitely not in my
point of view I'm not from the Orion
team but in my point of view it's not
really equivalent to our CP but we can
say it's it's a modern IDE which is
hosted in web and you can use it for web
development
any other questions oh yeah
let's see leave this page I don't have
any repositories right now let's say you
get so now I can I don't have any files
right now but I can navigate it through
here and also not this one let me go
back I can add new stuff I can see the I
can pull from the repository to be
honest I didn't really use that depth or
ein but yeah you should be doing that
otherwise it doesn't really make sense
maybe I should just try that one yeah so
we don't have a lot to do I am ticket
yes yes it does actually it's a nice
question
that's the bark it's fun oh yeah the
question was does it have any debug
capabilities and yesterday in the demo
our plugin did not work I don't know why
it was the same code but it didn't work
actually even the reverse plugin did not
work so on the demo with debug the code
it was fun a guarantee let's say I don't
know if the reverse plug-in is active
but I can just
start the let's see my I can find my
plugins here I'm just using the using
the active or not active sorry a chrome
developer tools well you can use any
browser I have my plug-in here where's
my plug-in
the name should be something similar
about well I couldn't find it not right
now
let's see if I have it from yesterday
yeah I couldn't find it right now but
actually it's a the JavaScript file is
loaded so if you just if you just debug
it in your browser you can debug
everything yesterday we just try to find
out what was wrong and we could just
debug line by line and we found that
actually everything was working and it
was returning the text we reversed but
the editor was not accepting the return
text so basically probably there was
some problem with or ein hope but we
could really debug the whole javascript
in the browser so you can also just find
the source file of your plugin here and
you can debug everything you coded and
usually it just lists it here with the
same name as you saved it but I can't
see it right now
maybe it's because yeah nevermind okay
any other questions yes
again I'm not from the Orion team but as
far as I know Joe is on the roadmap
which should be pretty easy because on
the server side it's running on Java and
it says Equinox so it shouldn't be
really very hard well when we moved to
Java in Java there are different
versions and you have different
libraries you may need to use maven and
other stuff so it's more complicated but
basic Java compilation shouldn't be that
hard so I know it's on the roadmap but I
don't know when it will be available and
what other languages will be available
but current it's quite good for basic
web development if you're not using some
server-side stuff any other questions
yes
let me see if I get it right the
question was to see your webpage as a
preview or I don't think there's a
preview I might be missing that but I
haven't seen that but the nice thing is
for example here I have my stuff and if
I just if I just save it here and open
it in a browser it will be just a live
preview all I need to do is just a
refresh but yeah I need to do that
yeah I mean okay I'm saving it on or
I'll hop and this one is pulling it from
or on up because the site is live so for
example this one
I don't let's see let's put something in
the HTML file
save it and it's just here so if I just
change something all I need to do is
just do a refresh but yeah it doesn't
have a live preview as far as I know but
actually it shouldn't be that hard to do
that either maybe we can write a plugin
for that yeah that will be a nice talk
writing your plugin for a trivial and
eclipse all right
any other questions
that's fun I never tried that we can do
that if anyone I can share this one with
anyone we can try
so basically what I need to do is share
this file and any of you can start try
at it again well we can see well let's
see if any other questions later we can
just try that out and other questions
okay yeah it's fun so let me see how can
I share this file or folder
actually yeah okay I got enough yeah
it's it will be just the same as working
in your bra in your IDE because this is
my workspace
I can't just even if I give you the link
you should be it has my name in the URL
so you should be logging in with my
account so we can still work on the same
project but we need to use git so it
will be committing to get ant it will be
resolving the issue yeah we can do that
okay yeah yeah probably one tap will not
realize what's going on but yeah let's
use the body hey save yeah oh the moment
I clicked it realized it's changed yep
it's not automatic but you can use ctrl
s or save both works it doesn't try to
save the whole page to your desktop it
just
I can click ctrl s and it saves and when
I move this one it's still the old
version but when I click here it just
gets the updates so yeah it's pretty
fast
so if you are interviewing with a client
with someone not locally you can just
use it it should be fun
better than coding in the Google code
any other questions okay so thanks I'll
just look for my plug in JavaScript if I
can find it maybe I can try to debug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
