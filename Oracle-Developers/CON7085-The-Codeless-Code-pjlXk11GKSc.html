normal talks I do this is a bit of an
experiment if you hate it
you're free to leave out the back door
because I'm in I'm comin I don't worry
about criticism anymore rate has been
put away of course this is a moment
weekend sales on the remote we go so
here is your read me in the morning for
the stalk anyone remember the story of
flat land and the people who lived in
flatland this is this is going to be a
similar experience
just some disclaimers and maybe some
slight depictions of violence bad things
happening no not really I'm joking a
feedback on this slide deck whose is
most welcome
myself and the original author of the
coldest codes and men gucci is likes to
hide away and not to any public speaking
we're we're very conscious we don't want
to offend cultures etc so there is an
amazing website if you've not seen this
already called the countless code guided
Kochi has written up about two or three
hundred coenzyme software development
and all they're all beautifully
illustrated and I approached in about
two years ago and asked him whether he
would mind we both spoke on some of
these killings together he is a retiring
person by nature but he very kindly gave
me permission to adapt his materials for
this talk but all of the praise and all
of the good comments should go to him
and that is completely my fault in the
office
this is me is you don't know me I home
run the London Java community I'm a job
a champion for my sins I am now a CEO as
opposed to a developer at a performance
company founded a charity do visit us
and spend money on your todo seria so we
will begin so these stories come from a
land far away with a good monks and nuns
habits of the laughing monkey clan
elephant footprint clan over XML clan
and the Java class or work on software
development projects using Java
technologies to help poor and poverty
villages of the region and from this
time long ago some fables and stories
tales of wisdom he will come out this
talk is about going back to the very
basics of software development some of
the very basics of Java you will have
your heads filled this week with
advanced topics that hot spot
optimization how to use job great
streams correctly how drinks or is going
to make your life
also hopefully will so on and so forth
so this is a nice gentle introduction to
Java one
first few coding contact section one and
we will start with master who had been
looking at page A 40 sheets ocean sale
of code eight days sitting at the top of
the shack curious young novices work
their way up the hill and one of them
timidly knocked on the door open the
door and said come on in the novice
novice we shall call him right you've
always told us to concern yourself with
the big picture than 30,000 foot view
why he spent eight days trying to find
this one little issue and will the
source code master turnarounds and
bought his staff cracking down on Roy's
little time struggled
for it is the little things that matter
job or a software developer in general
it's the small things that matter if you
get one of the little things right the
big things will take care of themselves
and we have a classic example here in
job apps something small that you should
probably get right back may not be able
to see at the bottom there but we have a
nice looking statements which is the
intent is to tell us what the sum of two
numbers are but can anyone tell me what
the result of that looking statement is
going to be unfortunate isn't it
this poor developer and I've actually
seen code like this store number of open
source products out there wasn't
thinking about typing correctly wasn't
thinking about how string in particular
types and jobs would quickly just little
things little things that costs one of
my customers who did this couple hundred
thousand euros
Nick story comes from the laughing
monkey gland where one of the young guns
these cases all have crazy numbering
schemes
case to you can look up on the color
code for in this valley mister Covelli
there is no visioning ski holidays team
lead and been complaining to master
behind holly's back that he had this
preference for making all of him in the
variables public invited Holly in for
lunch and they sat down at the table
with a bowl of rice in front of them
master reset to Holly I believe you been
doing quite well in your studies and
Holly went to reach for the rice with
chopsticks and to bring the rights to
him he'll know why would you do this you
do not write software like this holy it
must go indirectly through your stomach
repair shop night so we can get this
good wholesome luncheon to you
cancellation and Java a very important
thing here we have a stomach which has
been declared as public and you can only
imagine what the poor naive developer is
going to do with this a lot of people at
the moment have been complaining that
Java doesn't have properties like
donation other languages where they
complete the fields that you were
declaring to be public by default and so
avoiding those cases in cities but these
things have dangerous consequences like
trying to force feed lunch through your
stomach as opposed to going through you
can see here that the naive develops
we'll try to feed the monkey directly
through the stomach and the results you
get a food meshed into Rome's exception
when the more violent vision to talk you
get open stomach surgery which is also
not a good result
next one noticed numbering scheme is to
empty collections are better than no
master were two monks bought a piece of
code had thrown in jail pointer
exception on a very important water well
down in the village villages were most
upset No threatening to take away the
highly lucrative three-year software
development contract for master plan
master who just been saving up for his
new Apple iWatch was not pleased as this
news two monks one was a senior monk
senior Java developer the other one was
a junior job developer senior monk said
the junior was in fact the junior
developer should have checked for now
before he referenced my collection
junior developer found it hidden shame
ready to wear a way to master was
punishment master would turn to the
junior monk and said you were still
junior and we have not operated using
Java thx for you have not learned the
ways of optional going down to the
village big forgiveness from the
villages and right out
compartments I will use optional
thousand times he then turned to senior
monk and saint who are fired leave
one should avoid at all costs
having default selections variables it's
interesting to know who you are putting
the user review API with the User of
your collection and grave grave danger
and not many of us get the joys of being
able to use job able some other sort of
optional framework for optional language
and we had no exceptions even try and do
simple things like locusts size of a
collection with a collection of snow
there is danger of course there are many
people here are lucky enough to be using
Java act happy how many of you are using
optional everyone else to do knowing
anyone wow ok protest from optional is
your friends there's some good examples
up on the Oracle documentation site as
well as the blog posts on how to
effectively use optional to lessen the
chance of having no pointer exception
blown up in your face because the senior
monk was fired in time
sailors about evolution should stand on
the shoulders of giants but not
necessarily follow those blindly this is
actually a table came out of one of our
customers
one of our customers very keen
consultant II and so they went and
visited master moon said master woo how
may we improve all about Java code base
and master we said well as Java it has
been recently released an app offers the
enlightenment of landers and that is
perhaps a place you can start the
consultants Julie went away maybe even a
way for six long months converting all
of their existing collections code and
collections access code two streams and
the consultants read blog posts and look
at stackoverflow and went there are
giant here in stackoverflow if we use
things like the magic Dr Carol Stream IL
code will be faster because the Giants
on Stack Overflow
unfortunately those particular
consultants young monks we're running
all of the applications on single core
CPUs anyone guess what happens if you
try and make multiple threads running a
single-core CPU you get context
switching you get slowed down to six
months of incredibly hard work they
delivered a solution to the customer
which was on average 30 percent slower
than the previous solution they lost the
total cost of six months with and
development if for a team of five young
monks they also lost the contract
so that is a good idea to utilize new
features and job language works new
software development techniques do not
follow Stack Overflow blindly to look at
things like the javadoc any parallel
streaming understand what it is doing
and then you'll be enlightened
footprint clan the leading EDS sure we
certainly cannot be with us here today
we're setting high in her chair of
looking at her garden at peace when
several months ended up the hill all
arguing amongst themselves they reached
for sure said mister is it is impossible
to work with the quartermaster the
quartermaster has designed and I strange
numbering system system I'm using my
cases there is a number for every single
item and combinations of numbers for
every single item in inventory and we
are not allowed to ask for those items
by the name or description we must all
memorized the numbers instead of sending
shovels and hoes and pics to the village
we sent a flamethrower by accident and
villages still burning up and sides and
her way down to go see the quartermaster
quartermaster was sleeping interest was
kinds and so she simply left a small
piece of source code under his door for
him to look at
after the seven days of penance
quartermaster no longer use magic
numbers numbers are evil I still see
magic numbers and a lot of source code
but I run across there's another subtle
evil that job introduced as well use of
streams and switch switch bad naughty
bad naughty penance for penance strains
have no semantic meaning ok please
please please convert those strings to
something which has semantic meaning and
Java the closest thing is probably cost
you wish to do that and why you get
situations like one customer he had who
had some so we say calendar calendaring
holiday issues because they had some day
and Sunday 12 cases in the extremes and
switch things around here
probably the hottest thing in computer
science so for sure once more heading
chastise the quartermaster was just
climbing her way back up the hill to sit
down and have a peaceful look at I've
gotten another bunch of young guns came
rushing out of the kitchen yelling at
each other and looking very unhappy
purchase I turned around and made her
way back down to the kitchens and
wondered into the kitchens to see the
new crop of enthusiastic young monks
calling things I think they made up
their own language to be very clear that
you see they thought they'd formed quite
a nice little tribal group language that
only they themselves could understand
how busy throwing pots and pans across
the kitchen to each other through the
thingamajig read to number five
dog and they were all laughing with you
said this looks like a fun game please
power may I join could you please pass
the balloon thing on the way and so she
probably passed him a pension pot
infirmary where is the monks learns to
name things quickly once more jobs we
are typically writing some sort of
object-oriented code along where people
sort of invest what job was originally
sort of designed to do and they have
classes inside actual classes a method
which naming things and now this is kind
of goes counter to what job was
originally intended to do so one of the
things you want to do when you're
looking through your source code and I
do this myself actually run announced
check out my class names and all my
class names pretty much should be
announced in Albany that should pretty
much good as opposed to having a working
class of the human in it including the
walk on the human subjects you have a
human loss and you have an extra make
human conduct which is to walk from
artists not many people here in the
united states seem to do this a lot of
controversy here was walking along the
highway the other day and people have
beaten him you'll understand why a lot
of you who were in university and I i
see a lot of university students doing
this and scientists scientists love
during this particular you've ever
worked with an academic or any
scientific program as variable names
always top of things we need another
variable you just add a number to it X
2304 you didn't perform something that's
not very important like a calculation on
how much tax I have to pay the IRS and
of course you do 6 1/2 because you know
what those mean
last year I was at London Imperial
College which is one of the leading
universities in the UK if not the world
and help them fix the software that was
running the adjoint Malaysian being
which was putting exxon's and making
atoms bounce up and down and atomic trap
some reason the laser beam comparing
holes through extensive experiments the
back we discovered was it was because
invariably 3232 radius diameter and
stage and in the field of you know that
level of physics to move and then our
micrometer and you've gone and blowing
up tens of thousands of pounds of
expensive hardware it was recalled
watching the laser sort of just fire off
around the room watching people die they
are still reflected in the codebase also
shows in the joys of IntelliJ cause of
course I just go to invite me makes it
was wonderful thing called reflected
very variable name which seems to be
quite popular with the scientists
actually one of the worlds of things you
can give back to your community
maybe once a day of volunteering going
up planting trees or helping kids
kissing you sports equipment maybe just
go visit your local scientists say you
know what
reflect your variable names do some good
in the world
my favorite topics I'm gonna keep
harping on about it
Brian guts and some of the other people
who show lands on slides or tutorials
and things they seem to head this
absolute love doing things like in in
what is the case in happens to be a name
so we don't need to be shy hey we're not
gonna save her character's his job post
deliberately call it and if you are
yourself doing lenders work and you're
reading I Stack Overflow blog post
yesterday called for a team in please
don't do that
exception aiming to hear just gets the
aidid fill out the try catch block your
left a minute and then you just get
exception named e if you have some more
exceptions are you doing JDBC or
something you've got fifteen different
types of exceptional you can have is
called me and he wanted me to maybeee
execute feeling special TV throwable
sort of thing you can be a lot more
descriptive a new exception aiming to
actually have named the types of
scenarios or things that you were
actually going to expect to happen
a little sick on testing does pretends
he pretends to do TDD hotels it
teammates a duty who's actually a true
software craftsmanship is and does
Realty across the room that's really
died and different movement hasn't it
was just too hard really wasn't it right
away right after monkey man had a
problem with this methodology will
finally make you a process just just
wasn't delivery manual testing with you
know hiring a whole bunch fresh junior
monks and junior numbers come out of
university and a keyboard was laborious
slow couldn't be repeated and quite
frankly some of the numbers and some of
the monks they got out of university
could really use a keyboard so how many
we get perfect code is monks who sat
down with his senior most monks
perhaps we could write the perfect
documentation should one senior monk
help with the tasting said we could have
100% lying code coverage yes we can use
Java reflection to achieve that will be
covered and it'll be complete the oldest
most senior monks for what we've been
sitting in the corner quietly gathering
some spider webs and US said I believe
ahead the answer the other senior monks
going to his long long wisdom of Java
how long do you think it'll take for you
to formulate the sponsoring it to us
about a thousand years
before trash became the address of her
particular clan he was a young nun
working for the laughing monkey clan
under master and one of his very first
time along with a young monk
money to clear up McCoy palms because
the Empire of the Sun was due to come
and visit and master giving these two
young program is not responsible he said
you have two days which declared the
coupons out clear out the week's figure
out the months in new plants and make
sure that the court erred in their
happiness first water Miami monk
television program immediately sprinted
off down the hill to go figure stayed
the trial of watering can
wrote some seeds and all the other
paraphernalia what he needed to do and
he began to work about 15 minutes later
boris leading away from taking away the
weeds and plant new seeds sweat pouring
down his robes the Sun beating on his
hands
surrounding area and smiled to herself
and sit under a tree to tree with the
book the book
JSON confederation
and I school of jasmine tea a day later
master room by to go see what progress
they have made money and still not
slipped away upon looked a little bit
clearer sluggishly and look like about
half the weeds have been cleared she
patted me on the back and said we're
very hot I'm most impressed keep it up I
know you won't need to sleep for at
least another six hours don't forget the
coupons are not ready
improved take your head in wonder at
Rush said you have done no work the
Emperor cut off your head and I will not
be able to save you stood up and down
respectively respectfully and say it's
always an order master be really
tomorrow the following day came past
Manny was still digging away looked like
he was not going to finish in time he
was in tears
hours ago
me and asked if she could borrow his
spade a channel from the nearest fish
flowing stream into fresh water came
into the palms right away all of the
mugs what other channels and the whole
exercise was repeated 2.0 Eclair past
Grand Pavilion he nodded and smiled and
complemented master efforts to keep the
quay Lai
using some sort of hip-hop's tooling
these days not enough of you the tools
such as Chef and civil so on and so
forth to automate to leave test
environment to automate the deployment
to production even to automate speeding
up development boxes for new developers
joining the organization will save you
an enormous amount of time in a slightly
sad thing about give up to the moment in
terms of the tooling space is it mostly
tours are written in Ruby if you do wish
to do a great service the Java community
I would love to see the quality was tall
has written a groovy DSL or even perhaps
a Java DSL so that we wouldn't have to
head out tooling polluted by Ruby which
was quite nasty but these these tools
have been very very successful J clarity
the company I run for example we
actually really only have about one and
a half to full time engineer for months
and yet we managed to maintain an entire
infrastructure servers around the world
for a software-as-a-service products all
over Ontario build service or their
internal development environments
machines we host so on and so forth and
the only reason why we can do that is
because we go away and we ought to make
clearing out tests deployments to go
away and suffer from Ruby and do start
taking a look at some of these give up
stalls will save you a lot of time and
effort it will also help you get those
annoying system administrators fired
once you can automate the deployment of
your Java software you don't need to
write a word document with release notes
to the system administrator who doesn't
understand java script to run or heaven
forbid
you run the script yourself here is not
allowed to deploy to production wow ok
stop by doing this on your development
environments and your test environments
show the palace that baby how easy it is
to automate the stuff easy just to
repeat deployments and then start having
a conversation about we should go do
this in production and you talk about
the sort of cost savings and the savings
and you know pulling your hair out
people come around to the idea pretty
quickly
case in the backwoods
young monks and three out of four monks
always bullying and teasing the fourth
month for tonight called steve steve was
her diligent Steve had been lured into
their cultural software craftsmanship so
Steve with robert has dismissed but he
did quite often take a little bit longer
to produce a final piece of software
that his colleagues so the other young
and young monks called him slowly Steve
Steve Steve boring Steve in order to
teach young monks listen master weird
took them swimming on top of a high
class and he blindfolded them all and
said there is a pool below if you write
your swimming like you write your
software you'd simply jump off best we
can worry about the testing later
three monks dutifully following the
massive structures jumped out over the
cliff and immediately landed on a bunch
of course pushes you have got here in
Aus course is a very New Zealand and
Australia think think of a small pool of
incredibly spiky nastiness is a plant
poisoning was allowed to take a look
over the edge and see that there were
spiky plants as opposed to blow and the
three young monks were enlightened
happening can be to actually think of
the negative case first when you doing
TDD but you always want to think of you
think of the case as well as the true
case proven that something's going to
work I always start with a false
assumption fist just a small example
where
motorists in the latest release of
database configure they had released all
the villagers had some significant focus
on it and so he went down to go see the
senior nuns and the senior monks in
charge of the project to find out why
these folks had occurred and why the
tests had not come of them senior nuns
and monks replied but we have written
unit tests which cover all of the code
we have 100% coverage we even used by
testing for mutation testing this is how
advanced we are so we know that all
branches all data types everything is
covered his head in silence and said
come with me he didn't walked to a chasm
and said
you make will build the planks and old
perfect unit tested planks and of course
because you have built planks you will
have a perfect bridge now go until he's
perfect planks and when you have safely
cross the bridge come back to me the
senior monks and nuns were never to be
seen again
actually gone full circle myself I speak
quite an advocate of being quite diehard
about unity thing every little bit and
piece of my software system and I have
learnt through hard lessons such as
falling into many cousins along the way
but the reality is you actually want to
probably focus more on the tests the
intervened test that uses all the
systems using your system sort of
follows the path that will actually
follow so again at J clarity we we do
have a number of unit tests but by the
way I love justice week so I guess what
you call integration system case style
testing and it has really really saved
us because when you deploy to production
the sort of mistakes that we we were
predominantly seeing had to do with
connectivity between two component and
system some sort of confederation to do
with the environment that we were so who
here has done the classic will go to
deploy our software to production we got
the port yeah and in the system
administrators call you up and say you
stupid developers you've given us bad
software I know it's just the
Confederation fall where is the
configuration file it's inside the job
file
is what the hell is the job of what is
Java crap how do you know you can just
under 20 K
the configuration file by the way is an
XML not properties files so even with
but if you are looking at that you're
sort of testing philosophy or testing
approach then I would think more about
the whole system would be concerned
about you Unity's to say
story is about the monk was very
diligent and was always very concerned
about his code got more and more
stressed as the monthly passes he worked
on software within the joint footprint
of doom elephant clan
voted against his fellow program is no
matter how much documentation he wrote
somehow somewhere other developers were
always able to break his code breakers
systems and so he went and saw a base
for sure said what more can I do I write
the units lists I defensively kurd I do
not return knows I provide Java dog and
get my fellow programmers always break
occurred how can I achieve perfection
and replied
achieve perfection software development
you don't write any code is a liability
all code is risk missing you can
actually do to minimize the damage on
yourself and your colleagues and your
poor customers is actually to write as
little code as possible
sounds counterproductive if we had a
saying in my own consultancy that we
used to pay the junior developers for
the lines of code they wrote and we
still paid a senior developers on how
many lines of code they removed from the
codebase my chief scientist my my lead
engineer as such he goes away happy he
says he's had a good day when his
get commit status could commit metrics I
have deleted more lines of code today
that I bet it so I think about this next
time you lasting 30 or 40 classes in a
day you've got headphones on listening
to the latest trance music thinking you
are the greatest program on the planet's
you've just created thirty classes of
liability and danger try to be efficient
in the code that you are writing in do
as little as possible
over the nature of this is an infinite
loop it will never end
argued things always in this is not
really an infinite loop but they could
not come to an agreement and so they
called master weaver is asleep truly
influence or not replied the person
being mauled does not care how many
clause of the beast I mourn him for he
is dead
we have a lot of production that you've
been given form that I get anyone being
part of it
Tiger Team you feel good about special
you part of the elite they gave you the
night vision goggles dropped you know
the blackhawk helicopter said you'll go
fix this problem
save us all forty the nature of heroism
will being part of a dick tiger team in
those situations that you die young
prevention is much much better than
flying in a Blackhawk helicopter every
single time with it I'm getting so if
you find that you were in an
organization that rewards Tiger teams
and pats on the back after you've
heroically work 72 hours with no sleep
to go fix a problem that is a culture
which needs to change and change fast
because you are the ones who get burnt
out your boss is the one who gonna take
their pets on the back and get the bonus
at the end of the year based off your
blood sweat and tears and a lot of tears
if you have this post on your wall
you may need to go find another
organization to work for
we have
decided he would explain what it does
follows it makes it good for one day he
was walking with master and he wanted to
get to the village so yes master boom
boom pow may actually next millage for
I've heard rumors that Apple is holding
the developer event and they might be
heading out some free I watches master
weaver appliance well as self-insurance
you follow the 13 footsteps in the dark
has walked in front of us and then
follow the flight of the small D going
past exactly the right time and using
the shade of the Sun to discover the
angle of the hill you need to walk out
and then follow the small river which
hopefully hasn't deviated by the time
you get there and then when you get to
the crossroads and the list of
instructions with young monk said he has
to not come back from this trip
is an example of where documentation
actually Metis your current cannot
explain absolutely every single business
or the main problem in hand right
drivers not in itself a DSL for
explaining the entire world we have a
lovely example from one of our products
called since it is a garbage collection
log analyzer has anyone looked at a Java
garbage collection is a bunch of
meaningless magic numbers thank you son
oracle engineers in order to be able to
actually reason into Pazos longs you
have to use a whole bunch of techniques
to go get the line trace bits and use
regular expressions and blah blah blah
blah blah
there is no way you could express it and
source code alone a simple comment at
the top showing what the main problem is
you're actually working on so despite
the current trend to say coach be
documentation sometimes you need a
documentation to get to the village we
don't watch
the same story
and since young monk we've had here 15
years things he said his variables to NO
x 18 x two early codes and as hot and
then throws source code and a big pile
of paper across to his colleagues and
you know what I can do with them how can
I permission master way said he'll be
punished for not teaching the young monk
correctly leadership technical
leadership especially in your team's you
actually need to be the person who leads
by example you cannot be the current of
you is who says oic haven't run any
tests there and then say later on the
team leader I'm in too many meetings I
don't have time to write test myself so
here's a bit of code that that does this
part of the application but maybe one of
you juniors can write the test to clean
up after me and I've actually seen this
happen in a number of organisations
excuses excuses you've really got a
clampdown how it's just a quick patch
just need to get this new production
tomorrow and the next week we'll try it
out please visit that one yeah we're
gonna fix echoed next week old technical
did it and it sticks around forever and
always always always cheaper to fix it
there and then as opposed to deploying
the damn thing and then try to fix it
later so make sure you yourself and your
teams are very very disciplined don't
tolerate those sorts of excuses and you
need to lead by example this is why I no
longer I software
does code interviews interview people
for cutting so this is a story about how
a base pressure was interviewing two
young graduates to join her clan one
graduates was a genius a PhD in physics
and quickly scribbled some algorithmic
solutions on the board and said QED I
have the correct I'm so young graduates
computer science student scraping
through with B&amp;amp;B pluses for companies
wanting one more easily buybacks work
through the problem
commenting refectory trying to test out
the algorithm and unfortunately it means
not quite senior monks gathered around
every so often we saw the results from
the first young graduates the answer is
most correct he was fast we are hiring a
second graduate from second grade
understands that it is the hot to
enlightenment which is as important as
reaching enlightened itself
with engineers working with people who
actually work through solutions on a
state-by-state basis and can explain
each of the states and communicate those
tips with their fellow programmers is a
far better and easier engineer to it
with the lone genius in the corner who
comes up with solutions that only he or
she can understand so we do some pretty
bleeding and she died stuff at J clarity
and so we do tend to interview people
who do have PHD's and things and we are
extremely careful to only hire the
people who walk through things step by
stating can communicate the code to
other people and don't just come up with
the clean room so if you're in an
organization such as an investment banks
etc they have his policy of only hiring
the top computer science graduates with
super a plus plus plus plus degrees they
tend to be the smart algorithmic people
who can't communicate their ideas as
well partly because they just get a new
head to work through step by step it can
be a better choice for you and your team
to actually look at that one level down
and talk to the graduates in the juniors
who have had to work state-by-state to
come to the arms and perhaps understand
the nature of software development a
little bit better
one of these classes in here from
pivotal spring rehearsing for the
community keener this morning and we
found one of the old beauties and spring
object creating factory abstract and
pool interface big thing of beauty
find in this spring's pride in their own
logging framework and JLo back they
would quite good enough with a few here
in dayton time card money in currency
code popular who here tried to write
their own DSL
a group of monks clan who followed his
philosophy of we will build everything
ourselves or we have headmaster was
teachings and therefore we are smarter
than everyone else and they don't
logging framework they built their own
applications through an extension to the
Java language they never delivered any
software clarity
and needless to say it's cause us pain
ever since
if there is a decent decent enough
solution out there already and
especially if it is open source just go
in use at solution and if you need to
adjust it you need to provide some fixes
new features going upstream that back to
the open source projects and then
yourself and all the other man monks and
nuns living in your belly can benefit
clarity for example we spend 20%
engineering time working on the open
source projects that form part of a
stepped-up streaming patches and things
back and it's paid paid us back time and
time and time again and one day one day
we're going to refinish
codebase that's another pro tip if you
know that you have fallen for the sin of
pride make sure you put into action
started your class so you know to get
rid of it leads I actually finished and
hopefully it provided some enlightened
roots movement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
