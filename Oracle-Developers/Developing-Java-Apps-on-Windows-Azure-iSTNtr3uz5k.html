coming it's great to be here this is
actually my third javaone I started back
in 2005 so it's really great to be back
and today we are talking about cloud we
are talking about Microsoft we are
talking about Java and I plan to do a
couple of things today first of all tell
you about something that you may not
expect a Microsoft angle that you may
not be that knowledgeable about and the
other thing I want to do is to talk
about cloud in general now I have seen a
lot of presentations about cloud I've
seen a lot of training about cloud the
one thing they tend to have in common is
that they degenerate very quickly into
passwords so since I don't want this
session to become a buzzword bingo or a
drinking game about cloud and trying to
keep it very practical and the first
thing that may surprise you from a
Microsoft background noise lights so
there are no slides today we are going
to see some code we are going to see the
azure management portal in-depth i'm
going to show you all the alternatives
that we have and i'm going to use that
as a way to explain you all about our
vision on the cloud why we think that a
sure is a great place for you to try
first of all however i should probably
introduce myself my name is jen you
gotta Bellino kinda hard to pronounce it
but I learn to cope with all the
difference variation of that so feel
free to call me anyone and I work for
Microsoft open technologies Microsoft
open technologies are wholly owned
subsidiary of microsoft corporation it
was founded 15 months ago give or take
April 2012 and what we do is that we are
an engineering group that produces a lot
of code that helps put together
Microsoft and non Microsoft technologies
and all that happens under the auspices
of openness so the idea is that
Microsoft open technologies we care
about openness and we phrase openness as
open source open standards and
interoperability
we believe that when having a discussion
with engineers what really matters is
called especially when it comes to open
source so the first thing that I want to
show and I want to somewhat worry about
because i'm actually very proud of that
are the 60 70 projects more or less that
we have been working on since one here
they span everywhere cloud devices and
they have one thing in common they are
all related to openness a lot of them
are open source and all of them one way
or the other make it easier and make it
better to use the Microsoft platform
together with other technologies now of
course being a company that is focused
so much into building those engineering
pieces well one of the places where we
are focusing a lot of our attention is
the cloud and today what I want to do is
showcase a particular part of the cloud
there is the Java part which may not be
intuitive and at the same time dispel a
couple of mins of preconceptions about
Microsoft so what we're going to do let
me give you a quick overview of what we
are going to see today what we are going
to see is a lot of things about Asher
and the management portal and the
services it provides and everything will
be sent around this very simple
application that I cooked in in a few
minutes and that we are going to de set
to understand what it means to build an
application in the cloud and most of all
have choices so first of all let me talk
about Microsoft and the cloud because
too many the idea having since Microsoft
has such a huge brand on our client
devices windows in office etc etc this
idea of Microsoft in the cloud may not
sound familiar but if you stop and think
about it you think about ding you think
about msn you think about Xbox Live you
think about skype we have been running a
service of two that are fully at
internet scale and we know what it means
right that puts us in the
same ballpark as others who have done
the same thing taking their experience
in building internet scale services and
bringing them into what is called a
public cloud but there is something that
tells us apart and that's the fact that
we have a lot of experience with the
enterprise we have a lot of experience
with the on-premises work we have a lot
of experience with the IT we all know so
we do understand how the conversation
today cannot be a conversation about you
either are in the public cloud or your
high or you are behind the firewall it
needs to be a conversation about the
journey to the cloud it needs to be a
conversation about the transition the
cloud it needs to be a conversation
about how do you move from A to B from
having things hosted in your data center
to having them in the public cloud and
our answer is that you do it
step-by-step our answer is you may not
eventually get all the way there because
it make me sense for a number of reasons
for you to keep some work loads of
yourselves and we want to make it easy
so to us the vision of what we call the
cloud operating system jdl transforming
the data centers and putting the
boundaries away is important now be
humble this what it means is that we
need to give you a choice we need to
give you ways to get in a cloud in the
easiest possible manner which means
being compatible with your current
workload and at the same time we need
you to empower you to use what the idea
being out there being able to spin at
servers at will being able to connect
them together can provide to your
business in terms of ease of development
in term of ease of deployment in terms
of well not having your pager going off
at 3am which is something that i lived
in my previous life as when i was
managing a data center so i really feel
very strong
about that so the other point is that
when you think of azure we really want
to thank you as a very open and
comprehensive cloud as you is not built
for windows services alger is built for
more than that it start let's start from
the technical support of languages we're
talking about Python we're talking about
Java we're talking about PHP we're
talking about nodejs we are of course
talking about that right that means that
we have all those technologies available
for you and by the way all those
technologies are supported using
software development kits that are using
SDKs that are open source and our base
on rest ap is that are open and
documented and by the way when it comes
to the SDK if you think that you have a
fix if you think that you have a feature
to suggest you should feel free to just
go on get up and suggest that we do it
and give us the code we are more than
happy to accept contributions so the
degree of openness of azure is actually
massive and when it comes to the cloud
you will see that there is a ton of open
source that runs on top of asher now the
way it works so we have what we have
here is a super simple application i
don't want to focus on code today or
well that may be asked you to let you
know what we are looking at so super
simple application a variation on on
hello world they just say all right who
are you I just tells you who you are all
right sorry stop in the session very
easy super simple does nothing fancy in
fact the incarnation of this is just
this simple JSP or what we have is a
forum and little more
let me navigate through this okay now
this is an ordinary application this is
just the same application that you can
run everywhere starting from your local
machine as a matter of fact I can run it
on my tomcat server here and it won't
make any difference so this is running
locally it doesn't have any special code
doesn't have any specific things is just
a normal job application written using
JSP packages of war five running tomcat
running on top of a JDM on my little
motion so what's the next thing well the
next thing without going too far is the
idea well I have my local machine what I
usually do is I deploy my workloads to a
server so this server that used to be in
my data center may well be now a virtual
machine so here we go on to the azure
portal and what we are seeing in the
azure portal is a list of services that
we can use what we're going to do is
we're going to see them one by one and
let's start with the easier one brutal
machine so miracle machine is a concert
that I think everybody grasps is your
good old virtualization it's an instance
of an operating system that works in a
cloud accept any workloads runs any kind
of operating system that you want to
throw at it and you just manage it all
you don't manage the hardware you don't
manage a good chunk of the network you
manage the vm itself so that basically
means that you have a lot more control
but at the same time you have a lot more
to do because all of a sudden you have
an operating system to manage you have
an operating system to operate you have
an operating system that you need to
keep secure you have a lot of stuff that
goes into your money
during and then by wake up at 3am on a
Saturday night because something has
gone wrong having said that this is
super flexible and very easy to do what
I have here is a very simple virtual
machine that runs ubuntu yes we run
linux in a cloud so you can come to
azure take your in linux workloads and
bring them to us and running virtual
machines is really as easy as going to
the azure portal and say I want a new
virtual machine I'm going to choose it
from a gallery I'm going to say well I
want windows I want to induce 2012 I
want windows server 2008 I want sequel
server I want Oracle images those ever
been announced today please consider
going to the keynote of Brad engines and
this afternoon where we will talk more
about those images and by the way we are
going to talk about them also tomorrow
in another session that me and Martin
are going to have so what I have here is
a gallery of image where I can choose I
choose to create up on 12 image before
let's do another one we just guide you
quickly into understanding how easy that
might be I need to choose a name I need
to decide how big I want it to be I can
decide a local user I can upload an SSH
certificate yes that will work just fine
just your normal Association certificate
nothing fancy there's plenty of guidance
I mean want to provide a password
and I'll go to the next steps and here
we start to see something a little bit
more advanced we start to see that this
is not just about a machine this is not
as symbolized okay i have my machine I'm
going to shoot my were close to the
cloud I can do something more I can
create pool of machines I can decide
where they are and just as much as I can
launch my service in a data center in
the west of the u.s. because this is
where my users are if I see that my work
clothes are starting to get hit
somewhere in Asia well it's super easy
for me to just go here and say hey I
want more the same I want more the same
machine just this time I want it to be
in Asia I also have the concept of
affinity groups I can create virtual
networks I can connect my applications
that are behind the firewall with my
applications that are front we're going
to keep it simple just launched the
machine I do have a firewall of course I
need to open end points I'm going to say
that this machine is going to serve web
workloads this is done for me I can come
back and change it at any time and now i
am creating my beautiful machine of
course this is a bit like a cooking show
where we put things in the oven and
magically the coupe version appears so
that we can give you more demos or what
we got and this is the virtual machine
that i created so what I can see here
from that virtual machine is that I am
able to monitor I can get some very
important ideas on the actual users
what's going on in terms of CPU what's
going on in terms of network and from
that that is the starting point to start
doing some fancy stuff like auto scaling
like the idea of hey I'm getting too
much load on this machine it's time to
scale up so build a bigger machine
instead add ram hard hard drive or
scale-out build more of the same and
they're a load balancer from then on
there's nothing you to learn what I have
is just a UNIX machine I'll just copy my
war file into web apps here i have
installed a tomcat server over there and
then of course sorry about that when we
were experimenting anyway okay so this
is now it was supposed to copy my app
Tyga now we really are there and that's
where I am that's the same app nothing
more nothing less the same app that I've
been running locally and now I'm running
it remotely in the cloud all of your
bull machine now let me tell you that
this is actually very useful because
it's a very easy transition there is
nothing new to learn there are no new
concepts to learn you take your app area
sees you lift it and you move it to the
cloud you have the choice of operating
system that you want you have the choice
at that point to install whatever
technology you want on top because it's
your vm and you can be up and running in
minutes the new concept that are there
to learn are just incremental you don't
need anything to get started but of
course when it comes to the cloud we
really want to be able to do something
more I mean the whole reason of getting
to the cloud is so that we are able to
solve some very peculiar problem we want
to be able to scale our applications we
want to be able to respond to our
business cases more quickly we want to
be able to build applications that are
richer
and connected among each other that work
with many devices etc etc so let's see
what we can do to make it a little bit
better we saw the virtual machine part
that is it's just your vm in the cloud
run linux run windows now what you want
let's now talk about cloud services now
cloud services are a way to build your
infinitive ly infinitely scalable app
they are packages that asier runs for
you you can think of cloud services as
blueprints as a package of all your
application your configuration file your
deployment instruction and something
that you just shift to the cloud they
are hosted inside a machine and this
machine is actually managed by the
windows azure team what that means first
of all you don't need to worry about
maintenance you don't need to worry
about security everything is taken care
of so there is someone who makes sure
that your machines are healthy that your
machine are updated with the latest
level of fixes and security patches etc
etc more than that however if that
wasn't important by itself the other
part is that those applications are
truly scalable and the reason for that
is that what all you need to do when you
have a cloud service and it's rapin
running is to tell windows azure that
you want one to ten a hundred a thousand
instances of the same cloud service and
you will be able to duplicate use it as
a blueprint and let them grow with your
traffic the way it works of course is
not by using some sort of black magic it
does come with some compromises those
compromises however are actually best
practices
and we are talking about two main things
that you need to change in your
application just do the first one your
application must be inherently resilient
to the fact that it may be wiped out and
reinstalled all right so what happens
with cloud services is that we can come
at any time and update the Machine and
reboot the machine and then we will
reinstall your cloud service your
application needs to be able to survive
that now that may seem tricky but it's
actually one of the best practices out
there if you're into DevOps they are all
about repeatable bills they are all
about automated installation and what
you end up doing when you package your
cloud service is actually building
something that can be repeatedly and
reliably install over and over and over
of course we don't upgrade the
willy-nilly when you have a cloud
service it is expected that you have
more than one instance if we will never
take your instances off at the same time
we'll make sure the downtime is minimal
but the point is that the price that you
have to pay in order to have those
services that are resilient is really
relatively small and it appears to what
are the real best practice is to build
applications in the cloud it should be
nothing here that means avoid access and
dependencies on local file system other
than for temporary storage that means
making sure that durability is taken
care in a third-party repository beat
the database or one of the many options
that we have to deal with data and we
are going to go through them as well but
the real point is that you basically
need to package your application the
good news is that we have a plug-in that
does that for you and we will showcase
that in a moment right so
that's the the first thing that you need
to remember when doing cloud services is
that well you're really building
stateless applications and that helps
you with scale go read every pattern
around scalability and they are all
about making sure that your application
can scale because they don't depend on
local resources because they have very
little dependency on state all right and
the other one is that you're basically
building automated a repeatable built
now how do you go about it so we looked
at our deployment here again a very
simple Java service it's a JSP is little
more doesn't do anything fancy what does
it mean to deploy to washer it means
that we have our Eclipse plugin that you
download on a vanilla enterprise edition
of eclipse that you can download freely
the plug-in by the way is open source as
you may have expected and what it allows
you to do is to provide the basic
instructions so that we can package this
application for you so if I want to do a
new deployment and I have one here that
is existing but i'll just do one for you
by the way I should have mentioned that
we have here the horse's mouth the
author of the plugin so if we have
questions so the interesting thing is
that what do I do is I decide that I
want to run my application with a
certain version of the JDK all right so
i know that i want to run it on jdk 7.0
point 25 there's an example i decide
then the server and for me the idea is I
want to use Tomcat so I'll just go here
and tell him that's his docket
and this is a tomcat server you can see
that the plugin is actually pretty smart
it understands version it does your wife
knows how to work with the different oh
my god this is you can barely see her
huh don't you let me do this but I swirl
around all right now what I need to do
here I need to tell a sure I need to
Delhi eclipse plugin what projects I
want to deploy alright so what I'm going
to do here I'm going to remove this this
is the fact and I'm going to tell oh
well I have an existing project that i
really want to use and it's this one so
dick whatever that project outputs as
its ultimate output according to the
Eclipse rule so that's a normal ordinary
eclipse project are you haven't done
anything fancy and import it and what it
does again the plug-in has the smarts
when they sent that hope that's a that's
a web a project so it's got a war file
and I'm going to deploy the war file
going on in the wizard I can see that
now I have some functionality is pretty
neat I can configure such an affinity
here if you are configured in pump and
you know that it may be tricky we can do
it for you that means that once a user
hits your load balancer and it's
directed to a machine it will still be
directed to that machine so that the
session stays alive but we also have
passion here and the ideal caching is
that it's just for a protocol
perspective it's a memcache compact
compatible protocol that gives your
local cache again another piece that you
don't have to deal with see it's managed
for you it's provided by the instance
itself and another interesting one is
remote debugging so you can debug your
applications straight from eclipse set a
breakpoint in your religion application
and off you go let's go what's going on
here
all right and we finished so this is my
new deployment the interesting bit is
that I can do a lot of stuff directly
from here if I just try to inspect the
properties i can see that i can control
many aspects such as an example remote
access I can do rdp into those machines
will see that in a moment and I can
manage roles this is what you need to
understand when it comes to scalability
so what I have here is a package that
I'm going to deploy as a service as a
role on Windows Azure think of a role is
a dns name this is where your app will
ultimately live all right this is what
I'm seeing here on my browser on this
one
I so what I have here is a service that
is called j1 a boom do and I'm so sorry
about the screen this makes it really
difficult for you to see all right but
this server this name that you see here
all right is actually what I will find
in my a show portal now you say it's
right here
let me so far so what I have is a public
service that I decided to call j 1 i'm
going to and now either from the portal
or directly from the cliffs plugin i can
decide how many course are many
instances do I want to have of that
worker of that role so think of it as
you have a service and then you have as
many machines as you want that I'll
contribute to that surface they are
fully load balanced they are monitored
for you there waited for you they are
managed for you etc etc so that's the
ultimate convenience that's what you get
when you finally get your application to
the cloud you get something that you
basically set and forget yes that is
something that you configure on top of
this so this is in in cloud terms is
what it's called complete so this is
where your code and then what you
generally do let me go here you have a
bunch of choices for your data by the
way I would have gone in there in a
moment but let's just let me show it to
you what you basically do is you
configure as an example here at simple
database or you can configure a virtual
machine with Oracle as an example you
have my as the option of using MySQL you
have the option of using an added value
services such as MongoDB or KGB I will
show you in a little while an option
with actually using the actual storage
so I'm sure that work at storage so the
idea is that again you build an
application that doesn't have any
dependents your local data because
that's the key to scalability you don't
have any local data because if you have
local data then you need to replicate
them on every machine and you don't have
dependencies on local state
the database is not sitting on any of
these advanced it's not yeah or actually
it is its own service so it's something
that you can get as a service you don't
even know that there is no yeah
somewhere else is managing it for you
okay so where were we so what I wanted
to show you here is that I have this
machine and by the way something that I
can do from here is look at the various
instances so we were talking about roles
this is the public endpoint and then
what he tells me here is that I have one
instance behind i can easily bump into
two to three etc etc and they will still
be automatically load balanced and they
will still be automatically scalable
okay and when i look at the actual sorry
i need to go on cloud services that's
what i want to show you as this is it's
still not like I don't have control over
this missions it's not like those
machines are out there I don't know
anything about them there is no way for
me to access as a matter of fact I can
easily connect to those machines using
just rdp so I can use my remove that's
the protocol here it's coming the
network is being a little slow but we
should be him in a second
okay Here I am this is my remote desktop
that will come up in a moment and
basically from here what you can do is
see the status of your application as an
example take a look at the log file take
a look at events you have server manager
for you and what you will see is that
what what actually happened behind the
scene is relatively simple we have a
hard drive which is the e.r drive of
course this zoom doesn't work here we
will folder there is upward what you can
see in this folder is that we install
Eugenia install Tomcat I'm gonna stall
your application configure it all for
you you have to see it but if you want
to understand exactly what's going on
with your tomcat well your logs are here
I don't advise you to do anything here
in terms of change in this configuration
because again it will be wiped out as
soon as it gets reinstalled but you do
have access to it and you do have
control over it
oh so you won't happen frequently but
you need to know that he may have if you
change the configuration let me know
that configuration will be preserved but
this is why we recommend and again it's
not even just us that's just the best
practice of how you do things recommend
to do your configuration in the app and
then you ship it as an installer package
that contains all the instruction on how
to configure stuff is it clear ok but
what is important to understand is that
this is actually a feature this is
actually something that it's a basic
rule abiding idea that you really don't
want to muck with production servicing
production what you really want to have
is something that you can do on your
development machine test it in staging
and if everything works uploaded in
production that's the way an LT
application would work and that's what
we allow you to do by the way because
when you look at the cloud service we
also have this concept of staging so you
can decide that you want to upload your
application on staging so you have an
update you don't want to mess with your
production environment you just go on
staging and what happens on staging is
that it's just the same thing let me go
here but it's got an obfuscated that URL
so this funny URL that you see a doctor
is something that we auto generate and
it's different for every deployment so
that your customers don't hear by
accident all right so this is the
concept of staging so the idea is that
you develop your IE using your tools you
don't need to do anything
fancy you don't need to use specific
libraries you don't need to change your
programming style then you take your
application you pass it through the
Eclipse plug-in which will then generate
a deployment for you and you deploy to
usher that's really as easy as it gets
and the payoff from doing this is
however incredible because at this point
you have an application that by the way
still doesn't have any single dependency
or not sure you can take it as it is and
we'll bring it back on premises you can
take it easy tease and bring it
elsewhere we are not up until now asking
you to build anything that is specific
all right so what we are basically
saying is that we are taking well
established practices and the word of
deploying java enterprise apps and we
are putting them into the eclipse plugin
so that you can build infinitely
scalable services now let's look at the
storage part and that they add the value
part because this is where the fun
begins so now you have a service it's
the way well pretty little is just
saying hello it's persisting stuff in a
session let's see if I can do something
fancy and that may answer your question
about storages so in our you have
different kinds of storage different
choices to persist your data right the
basic one is what will be more akin to a
disk based storage key value pair we
call it blob storage and it's just what
you probably are familiar it's a big key
value store you can store as much as you
want sorry bad click there it is
and that's what you get now the
interesting part about as your storage
you have the ability to store raw data
in buckets just like a blog you have the
ability to serve them as stables so a
tabular store and you have the abilities
to use it as skews so something where
you pick and poke you pop things from
the stack etc etc and it's just the same
just the same storage different URLs and
you interact using rest your interact
using HTTP and your interact using our
SDKs which just takes those or si vis
and packages so that they are very
convenient so when it comes to blob
storage which is the one that i've been
using here for the for our examples what
the API is really pretty simple and it's
what you would expect so let me go to my
project and open the one java class that
i wrote that implements that okay so why
we have here again remember the basic
application what it does take something
over here
just wait here all right
alright alright sit here right now does
it by putting things in the session what
if I wanted to be more persistent well
all I have to do is implement the
persistent mechanism that is based on
blobs so that's the same application
it's writing to a remote instance on a
blog let me show you how it works this
is a very simple Java class that does
three things first of all it creates a
connection to the blob storage right we
have the concept of an access key
everything is in pretty good the traffic
is highly secure we are the idea that we
need to create a client so that we can
access the blob again it's the
networking service and inside the blob
we are the concept of a container which
is the place where you put your stuff
now the interesting bit is that you can
set permissions on your container you
can decide whether it is public or not
and then you can put arbitrary stuff
inside and stuff that you put their
first of all is incredibly safe it's
replicated three times in the same data
center you have every single time you
write the body to wash your storage it's
replicated three times in the same data
center and in certificated or different
data center for C so that means that you
can be safe you're not going to use you
to lose your data you basically have
this as to recovery built-in into the
concept of azure storage but it is more
than that the interesting bit is that
for free what you're getting is also the
ability to stream your content from
Azure storage across the world that
means that if you enable the content
distribution network functionality what
do we hit my service here in the US I'm
going to get the data from the West US
data center because it's the closest to
me but if someone in Japan does the same
they're going to get those data
from their data center so basically what
you get here is knowledge with your data
are safe knowledge that your data are as
close as possible to the customer users
users is again straightforward all I
need to do here is to a pair of simple
API calls to right into my container yes
this is the person that we are looking
at the address the case of the api's
that we are providing all right what's
interesting to note is that when you
even when you use this you're still not
having a hard dependency desire as a
matter of fact you can run this API on
any plan we will connect water storage
and fetch the data from there so they
are truly open meaning that they can be
used from anywhere
all right but you can still get the data
from our storage it is really simple at
the end of the day it's a very intuitive
ready that there's nothing fancy here
you get a reference to a container you
right to the container and that's all
you get same thing for reading from the
container again it's not that different
get the reference download stuff use
input streams and Apple streams and
that's really all you need okay so that
gets you to a point where you are truly
used server you are using this
application to the full extent that you
are using value-added cloud services to
get stuff done there is way more than
blobs though it's not just about blob
and we should probably go back to the
azure portal and see all the goodness
that we can get to so let me give you a
cursor look because we are going to run
out of time if I going to spend a lot of
time so we saw your commissions rental
machine again to recap it's just your
ordinary ripple machine that you bring
to the cloud you deal with your grading
system you're good to go max amount of
flex we saw called cloud service Sun
cloud services what you have is your
package your application as a repeatable
build is something that you can install
where we we didn't take a look a website
web sites are actually pretty name with
website with any this is such a step
further and we are all
the thing with website is that this
report dot map PHP anoche gasps partner
the no support java s okay and what you
have here is also mobile services now
this is something that we are pretty
proud of the new mobile services is that
if you build an application that is
built for mobile devices you probably
need the backend and usually back tends
to do a bunch of stuff they do use
organization they do storage of data
entry pushing education you can do that
with an API service is managed for you
all you need is called your mobile
application hours days in other states
are available for Windows so much what
they expect but also for iOS and also
for anything so you can use the services
from where everyone the other part is of
course chart patent
LaForge media provides or something
interesting me I think it's the it as a
personal connection it's a service that
that's encoding and streaming or in the
media industry you can take a check of
an effective data going to answer as you
will do all the region coding for you
we'll go we'll do all the absurd thing
down sampling splitting into multiple
part to tell their children serving to
your user through the CN right I think
that's really a demonstration while he
needs to that value added services in
the car because it happens i'll be
participating to a starter that was
doing exactly that and I can tell that
one of the reason was that anything
point to start doing the services were
so hot we were talking millions of
dollars in hard labor cent store wasn't
the same concept the same business
landed i wrote to 11 years ago if i were
to transpose it today it would mean
while an experiment running in the
hundreds maybe thousands of dollars in
terms of just putting a credit card
subscribing to services and see if it
was the other interesting part for java
developers is service bus which is what
you would expect with your building
enterprise application you know about
messaging publish-subscribe cues etc etc
the interesting bit is support amqp
which is an open standard which happens
to have an open implementation which is
cubed which by the way gives you
interoperability with JMS so again it's
not something you don't know about it's
not something you never heard about it
wants something that to learn about its
reuse your skills all the way and then
we have a bunch of other services super
reporting is actually pretty interesting
is business in damages in the cloud you
have to pay you can do a lot more with
data and big data we have a service that
provides you with Hadoop as a service
again if you've ever been into the
business of setting up at a Duke cluster
yourself you know that you don't want to
do it again so that's probably where
you're going to be and we have a lot of
abilities to do really interesting stuff
with your networks again I'm going back
to our vision is that where it's not an
either one it's not probably part of
private time it's both sigh it's in
between so they give that we can do run
VPNs between your services and the idea
that we can run the connections between
your different machine is very important
to us but
there is more they are a bit that we are
not going to go in detail today because
we just don't have time but I should
remind you that it will totally be my
pleasure to see you again tomorrow when
we are going to have a double clicking
on the concept that we exposed today
there is another session on Azure is as
your Java tips and tricks it's here it's
in embarcadero and it's tomorrow
afternoon at three you should be my
colleague Brian bands doing this session
unfortunately had a medical emergency so
i'll be happy to proxy for him so if you
want more of the same and something more
in depth tomorrow we'll be there and
marketing will join me to do a more
in-depth demonstration of the Eclipse
plug-in and what we really would like to
show you is also the integration with
active directory which is Jules and
especially the incarnation that provides
you with the ability to secure your
application using directory using
federated login etc etc I want to spoil
the surprise but hopefully tomorrow we
will have some fun but there is more I
sure it's all about partnerships as your
is all about a consistent because
Microsoft is all about it system if you
look at the partner ecosystem of
Microsoft is by far the biggest of the
work if you look at the model which
Microsoft make money well it's all about
partnerships those partnerships are here
those are all apps that you can install
in the cloud and there are services that
you can run and there are some very
interesting once you want to send an
email you got sendgrid you don't need to
set up your own smtp server you want to
run cloud platform service on Ruby well
look no further you can go directly to
engine yard which a lot of you I'm sure
no one love you want to monitor the
state of your application you can use
New Relic you want to use MongoDB or a
couch TV or solar well you have
all those available and services that to
me is a developer is ultimately Rihanna
because that means that I have to use
the technology and I don't get too bad
someone else is doing that for me I'm
paying a monkey I should hear your
storage amount of queries in severe set
up but that means that I'm up and
running and this is what one and again
most of these what happy to give us the
case for your job applications and you
can put them all together and if that
wasn't enough remember we talked about
VMs right so the ability for you to
build virtual machines that just run
whatever you need well chances are that
if you don't find a virtual machine on
the undercard you may find it here so
this is via Depot I'm pretty proud of
this because it's something that is
almost a year now the deviant people is
being a catalog of open source images
that anyone can come and download modify
reupload share with others etc etc the
interesting bit is that it contains a
metric ton of open source software here
recently passed 500 images so that
basically means that if you have
something that you are you really care
about it's probably here just to give
you an idea this is the latest package I
got an email tonight I don't know if you
know what secant is it has to deal about
open data and what I found out that
someone actually uploaded an image of
secant on your deal so you know you have
500 ver con images
machine template issues where you get
all the ripple machines of the analyzer
once again please do example to the
session of redundancy because we are
going to talk a lot about those you get
to choose the language you want to
develop your application on me java the
net pointed PHP no Jay guess it really
doesn't make a difference you have SDKs
for them they are all open source you
get to choose how you want to run your
service you can run it by yourselves as
a as an image that you run in the cloud
and you control or you cannot flow a lot
of the management headaches and get the
incredible scalability in return by
running it as a cloud service you can
mix and match that's the other
interesting part there's nothing
forbidding your complex application to
have parts that run is a cloud service
maybe the front end and they connect to
need appears that work on virtual
machines and maybe those really
machiners are actually no promises why
not maybe there are regulatory issues
that require to do that maybe their
convenience maybe they are part of a
transition we fully support that we
fully support connection among the tools
we fully support single layers of
management that allow you to manage your
private cloud resources your public
cloud resources in just the same way
with the same tools so that at the end
of the day you can build your complex
multi-layered application the way you
want using the technology you like and
using a cloud technology that is as less
intrusive as possible again
implementing patterns here we are not
forcing technology as open as you can
possibly can starting from the
interaction the ladies of Rancho surveys
on open source SDKs basil open source
solutions and add-ons that you run on
top and they can help you grow your
business by using value-added services
that would normally require huge
investments to be put together what this
is all true this is how we see this is
how we want to call developers to use it
my happiness making it better by
understanding that it's one of the most
powerful cloud platforms out there
because it does reach the gap between
public cloud and public and private
cloud between what you know and use the
day if you're not in the cloud and what
the public cloud the idea is and because
it gives you the technology the tools
the management layer the operational
layer to make things happen so we hope
that after this you're going to go and
build some awesome stuff I will be again
here tomorrow I'm having a panel this
afternoon at Oracle ward and I will be
here tomorrow at 3pm so I'll be happy to
take some questions now I'm sure
marketing will be happy to trim in if
you need more information about the
Eclipse plug-in but you're more than
welcome to come over tomorrow when we
are going to talk more in depth about
all these features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
