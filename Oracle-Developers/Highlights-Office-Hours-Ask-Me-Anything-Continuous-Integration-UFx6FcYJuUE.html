view if data changes and so forth when
it comes to CI CD you know I believe it
is the in a true DevOps manner the
database developer as well as the guys
who are the OP site and so forth
together figuring out what's going on
because only the developer knows why
those changes came in the first place
and what they're trying to do and you
know potential issues that costed and so
forth and the Ops guys are probably
those that will that will spot it for
you right that something went wrong so
and then in the end of the day you
really want to have this feedback cycle
right I mean ideally you want to get to
your stage where you know you don't just
go like problem in productions and it
stays done but you want to get to your
stage your problem in production fixed
it at this course there and this is what
we did to prevent it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
