will go through some of this basically
there's my contact information in case
you want to get a hold of me at any time
there's Mike Mike one person company is
cousin IT Incorporated or as my wife
says cousin it it was her idea yeah what
are you gonna do
so I a few years ago I wrote a book
called making Java groovy it's a manning
book and then back in 2016 I wrote a
Riley book called Gradle recipes for
Android and my current book the one that
came out last summer is modern Java
recipes that's the one where I have a
couple of copies to give away for
anybody who happens to want that I've
also got a bunch of videos and stuff at
Safari Books online but let me move on
okay basically I like that theme of why
I code as as pretty much what we're
going to be talking about so this is
more or less my history with Java and
related technologies like so many people
in IT I was actually a career changer
you know I started off in something
completely different in fact I was in
engineering now originally I thought it
was going to be a professor I was a
physicist kind of thing and I decided to
go at it from two angles from mechanical
engineering and from math and then I
went to graduate school and I was just
one of those people who'd never really
wanted to go out into the real world
seemingly and it was expecting to become
a professor but of course what happened
is the whole academic market collapsed
and that's much worse now now as it
turns out that was a good thing for me
I'm much happier doing what I'm doing
now rather than I would have been as a
professor but it's ironic that I've now
entered a field where academic advanced
academic degrees are actually viewed
with a healthy degree of skepticism it's
like oh okay I get it you're gonna tell
me what to do but can you actually code
you know so I don't generally talk about
it that much but it just shows that I
switched over now when I was a when I
left school I joined United Technologies
at the time they were the parent company
of Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney aircraft engines and
Sikorsky helicopters and Otis elevators
and carrier Air conditioners just a
whole series of of things like that
and pardon me so when I was working
there I was working in an area called
aeroacoustics of jet engines which meant
that my coding was largely Fortran
afraid to say you know it wasn't my idea
I tried to avoid it but all the
numerical libraries were written in
Fortran I had no real choice we worked
on workstations you know back Sun
workstations and IBM AIX workstations
all those sorts of things I had an
office mate I used to work on the giant
supercomputers and he would run
simulations of computational fluid
dynamics that would take months on a
supercomputer and produce gorgeous
pictures which may or may not have meant
anything you know when I look back on
that I realized that I worked on
programs that had somewhere between I
don't know 50 and 75 thousand lines of
Fortran and I now realize that I don't
think I ever saw anything that I would
currently identify as an actual test
case I know darn wonder nobody ever
wanted to touch the code you know
because it's such a potential disaster
there so I decided to switch from
Fortran to Java C Fortran 90 came out
and I thought that was cool and all the
engineers around me were like why do you
care about that and I knew again I was
in the wrong area you know I always
wanted to be more in the IT area and
it's Bruce Eccles thinking in Java book
that made that possible for me that was
quite a member reading the first edition
of that book I think I have a link to
the fourth edition and of course he
could seriously use a fifth one at this
point but that one made the big
difference for me and then I had a
friend who ran an AI group at the
research center back then this is
roughly the mid 90s so we're talking
about 96 97 I started off in Java at
version 1.0.8 something like that not
doing anything very good at it but I
that's where I started off and he ran a
group that did genetic algorithms and
neural networks and things like that and
I thought that was cool but again I was
looking for an excuse to use Java
wherever I could and one thing I did and
I
that I probably am the only person in
this room who has this distinction I
actually wrote a program to put a job a
swing user interface on top of a Fortran
program now that I said that than
anybody in here ever do that really my
condolences yeah I have yeah and we had
the C viola idea was they had these
sensors that were monitoring elevator
behavior for Otis and we're collecting
all this data in these massive data
files see as big as six gigs you know
they were huge right and back then that
was big and of course the statistical
algorithms and the AI algorithms were
either in Lisp which they weren't using
at the time or Fortran and I decided to
put a Java swing GUI on it and I have a
couple of conclusions for that first of
all don't do that okay secondly is it
turns out Jay and I really is a thing or
at least it was then and then of course
the third one is well it worked on my
machine you know I was never able to
deploy it anywhere else but it did work
for a little while and it was fun and I
learned a lot but that was the sort of
thing I was battling at the time of
course what I finally realized when I
moved over to this AI group is that 10
12 years of coding and Fortran hadn't
really taught me anything about software
development I tried to use good
structure and everything but Fortran had
these things called common blocks and I
don't know if you're familiar with
Fortran but common blocks is basically
global data in other words it was
exactly the wrong thing to do and of
course anything could change anything
and it was just a disaster so anywhere I
decided it was time to go back to school
at that point and I wound up getting a
master's of computer science at night
and also I wound up getting that son
certified Java developer thing now that
back when getting certifications was a
thing too you know when that was a big
deal that again I owe a debt of
gratitude to Kathy Sierra and probably
Bert Bates as well not for the thinking
and not for the head for his job about
business before all that but for the
fact they created Java ranch and that
was a great place to study for
certifications some of you may remember
that if you're back then back in the
field at that time eventually I got the
son certified web component developer
and the biz
this component developer the head first
EJB book was the first time I understood
EJ B's at all so that was very very
helpful and unlike being in in in
academia or in a research area suddenly
I had options you know I suddenly I
could actually move around see this was
roughly 2000 and the the bubble had
burst but we didn't know it yet okay so
I had options and I decided what I
really wanted to do was teach software
development training classes because
this way I can always learn the newest
things you know learn what was going on
and then tell everybody about it and
that's what I liked the most I've never
been as interested in being the person
who comes up with an API I'm much more
interested in learning about an API and
then helping other people use it that's
much more fun for me so that's what I
got to do so when I wound up back in
2000 becoming a trainer I guess you'd
say back then you teach an intro java
class a month and they would fill every
month i mean it was it was a big deal
for a while there and a lot of C++
people a lot of VB people I remember vb6
I think it was it was a mess and I wrote
a little applet and like like we all did
back then to start playing with some of
this job of stuff now I that's so many
hard drive crashes ago I I don't have
the code for that anymore
but what I was able to do was to
resurrect that as an actual swing user
interface I actually have it here I
think so if I if I run this I'll give
you an idea what it looks like you like
my little nyan progress bar by the way
anyway so what would happen now again
this was an applet in class but I'm
writing it as a desktop app now they
said it would take a bunch of terms that
would come up during class and just
shuffle them and grab the first nine and
build a bingo board and as you heard
them during class you would click on
them and it would just change color and
disable the button and if you got three
in a row I actually went to the trouble
to find the old Windows 3.1 to dasu to
put in there and of course the best part
is you would win fabulous prizes at the
I'm the fabulous prizes I used were wild
cherry lifesavers
as I recall so this actually now that I
mean I wasted so much time last I
actually built this again in Java and
swing and this is in a github repository
that I have so if you want it now I even
have a menu now that lets me reset it
and restart so you know there we go get
and I can mute it too by the way so
that's good but that was the sort of
thing I was doing finding an excuse to
use the Java coding to help other people
learn this stuff because the real battle
in an intro Java class is learning the
oo part especially the terms because
it's you know whenever there's a choice
between a two syllable word and a ten
syllable word they always went with a
ten syllable word we can't say wrap we
have to say encapsulate right we can't
say make we have to say instantiate or
even creates not enough and the worst
part is you start talking like that you
know so any rate that was a mechanism to
help people learn that stuff so there's
a picture of that for example so it used
to swing you I and as I say it's in my
github repo I used the collections API
this was pretty new back then 1.2 and
everything and of course I had the
resources in a wav file and basically I
could give people now of course I
generate a jar file with main method in
it so that you could just double click
on the jar file and start it up
but back then of course it was an applet
so I would run a version of Tomcat
during class and people could access the
URL and just refresh their page each
time play with it that way now another
one that was a lot more ambitious yeah
the fabulous prizes of course I wrote
this thing called I called it jeopardy
death desperately trying to avoid that
is that trademark or copyright
infringement I'm not sure which one but
I was trying to avoid both I suppose and
this was basically a game where I would
put a game board in the front of the
room and then each person in the room
would get a little buzzer on their
machine again it was a jar file they
could just double click on and start off
a buzzer and this used RMI so remember
when that was the thing to so that when
you join the game you could access the
game board and all the scores were kept
by teams and at the time
I made the the database was everything
was on Windows at the time so I was
using the dreaded son Jay DBC ODBC JDBC
ODBC bridge driver remember that monster
so yes slow but who cared I didn't need
an actual database driver I just needed
to set it up as an ODBC data source on
the instructor machine and everything
worked fine
well I again so many hard drive crashes
ago but I actually found the code for
this one as a jar file and then I had to
go through the battle of downloading it
because gmail didn't want me to download
a zip slash jar you know but eventually
I got it and I can't really show you
that code because I'm embarrassed at
this point I mean you know if you
haven't if you look at code you wrote 15
years ago and you're not embarrassed I
guess you haven't learned anything I
suppose but you know but to give you an
idea how this worked so let me go to
this one here so I ran it with an ant
build and if I start up ant now I did
switch the driver so I'm using this you
access driver that is still accessing it
the same database that I made at the
time so I can get the categories and
it'll give me some some categories to
grab and when I select it I can create
the gameboard and this is what the game
board looked like and there's all the
different buttons and of course I was
using inheritance for the buttons it's a
question button that extends a J button
etc but even better if I go to here then
I can run let's magnify that a bunch I
could say Java dash jar and then I think
it's in the dist folder and this would
be a client so the client would get a
player and a team name so let's put in a
guru from Oracle of course and of course
the server's on localhost so there's my
there's my first button and no reason I
can't run another one so if I go down to
downloads again let's run it again s jar
just Jeff there we go and let's put this
as a newb and I'll put that I guess at
Google right that makes sense
so here would be the buzzers on the
machines around the room and then I
could switch over to the game board in
fact why don't I move that over to where
the buzzers are just so you could see
the whole thing like that and you see
how the scores were kept by team so the
team would come up here and whenever I'd
open up a question then somebody could
buzz in and there was a sound and
everything and and I'd say whether it
was right or wrong you see that the
scores could go up or down and I'm
really shocked to tell you that this
still works
you know I really can't believe it I
again I have to clean up a lot of the
code but man I'm thinking I might even
use this again sometime of course the
best part is let's see where's my IDE
here the Daily Double is at 1/4 here so
that would be 0 1 2 3 I think it's here
nope the other one
let's click give them a score to 0 1 2
there it is there's the Daily Double so
then we click on it and then of course
you'd wager up to whatever your score
was and then actually had the wave file
in there and everything so hopefully
that was right
so anyway play that game and that was a
lot of fun and eventually that'll be in
my github repo as well if you're
interested but again it's all working
with an ant build at the moment so it
could run RM I see and everything I'm
just shocked that it's still working
after all these years
the most fun I had with that by the way
or maybe not the most fun but the
weirdest situation I had with that is of
course I would make a separate table for
each course I was teaching and this was
the job a table and I'd make different
tables for different courses but one
time we were having an open house at a
training company and there were a lot of
salesmen coming through so I made a
board just for the salespeople or
whatever and I learned something
interesting about salespeople the
salespeople didn't care at all about
getting the questions right they just
want to be first so as soon as I bring
up a question you hear
he's everybody's banging on the button
to try to get a hold of it and you have
scores of - 500 - a thousand - twelve on
and they didn't care at all they just
wanted to be in there first of all so go
figure but it was a lot of fun and again
it was an excuse to to write something
Java related on all of that so let me go
back here now of course in 2005 you'll
probably remember when the good old Ruby
on Rails meteor hit the Java world
shaking everything up so dramatically
and at the time I figured fine I'll go
learn some of that as well and
unfortunately I wasn't really able to to
learn Ruby very well at that time now I
probably could look at it now and get it
much better but at the time it was much
harder so a year later I was in a I was
attending a spring users group user
group meeting and they had a
presentation by Jason Rudolph who was
talking about Grails and Grails involves
spring and hibernate both of which I was
reasonably familiar with and of course
the ideas from Ruby on Rails so I jumped
into that of course jumping into that
man I had to jump into groovy and to me
it was like it wasn't really leaving
Java because groovy is about as close a
language as you can get to Java and in
fact Ruby's never designed to replace
Java's designed to supplement it every
groovy system I've ever worked with
eventually has Java in it as well so I
could leverage all my job in knowledge
and had a lot of groovy stuff so rather
than look at any of the the Grails apps
or anything like that I do want to
mention something groovy related I wrote
an app called groovy baseball and what
this one did is it consumed a restful
web service that one being provided by
Google in the form of their geo coder
you send them an address and you
download either XML or JSON and you
could parse it and get latitude
longitude data out of it and then I took
the data for the stadium locations and
saved them into an h2 database so that I
could distribute this to people and
parse all the data to get the scores of
the games out of it and I use Gradle
with Gradle for the build tool with a
gret e plug-in to allow me to deploy it
so as an example of this this is
let's see here you know I've got all the
team names and everything and I'm able
to grab the stadiums out of there and
create all of this is going to wind up
matching patterns and and doing the
Jason slurper to pull the data down and
all of that but the neat part is is that
I can actually run this by saying that
could say Gradle W and then can't
remember this app run or run app I think
it's app run from the Gradle plugin what
this will do is it'll deploy it on jetty
interestingly enough now they this
plug-in allows you to allows you to
deploy on jetty or Tomcat or a cluster
of all the above and there now it's
listening on port 8080 under groovy
baseball so if I can go here so if I
open this up and paste that in this is
what it does it brings up a Google map
and it's downloading the scores for a
given game and it starts with yesterday
and you can see these were all pulled
out of the Major League Baseball data
that's available online so again this
actually isn't a github repository this
is for my making Java groovy book so all
the code is there in case you want that
I've been updating that and pushing
changes to that as well
and it was a nice illustration of the
sorts of things you could do with groovy
and therefore underlying with Java as
well so that was a lot of fun okay okay
now this one the vampire movies one what
was happening is I was writing this this
making Java groovy book and I wandered
into my local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble remember
when that was a thing you know and I
noticed that there was only one shelf at
the time that was labeled computer and
there were three or four labeled teen
paranormal romance so I thought the only
thing I can do now is I'm gonna need to
you know clearly what my book needed was
some groovy vampires you know so I had
to add that now what I wound up doing is
I consume data from the Rotten Tomatoes
API turns out that had a restful web
service as well and because that was all
Jason data I would store it in a Mongo
database so it gave me a chance to play
with no sequel as
well and then I could actually take the
data and serve it up myself using either
rat pack or Grails I don't know if
you're familiar with rat pack at all
it's a micro service framework in the
groovy world that's based on the ideas
from of course Sinatra from the Ruby
world I mean just the fact it's called
rat pack I thought was sufficiently
amusing I had to try it out you know and
of course Grails does it as well now
that one unfortunately I can't
demonstrate I was playing with it and it
turned out that Rotten Tomatoes has been
acquired by Fandango I think and they
have their own API and they now say
right on the site they no longer permit
unrestricted access to their data you
actually have to fill out a form
proposing what you're going to do and I
figured no that's way too silly you know
so I haven't done that but I still have
the code in everything interestingly
enough now of course I I took my book
and I got my local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble to
actually get a couple of copies and I
put it it was in the IT section and
after a while I figured well you know
it's got vampires in it so I took a copy
of it and I moved it over to the teen
paranormal romance section but
unfortunately it just sat there for a
while and then one day I came in and it
was actually gone and I thought oh boy
somebody actually bought it I couldn't
believe it so I went to the info desk
and know they just moved it so
apparently the overlap between say you
know fourteen-year-old vampire you know
fan fiction fans and Java Ruby
developers is not as big as I was hoping
so so much for that okay now later I was
on the the no fluff just stuff tour I'm
still on that now and we needed somebody
to do some Android presentations and of
course androids Java right except that
depends on whether you which lawyers you
talk to I suppose and I'm not going to
get in the middle of that one but it was
certainly easy enough for me to learn
because it was Java based you know the
whole idea so I'll about stick with Java
based and hope that doesn't ruffle any
feathers the wrong way but feel free to
let me know and in order to play with
that I decided I was gonna go grab yet
another restful web service and for that
I went to ICN DB calm which is the
internet Chuck Norris data
but it's one of those serves up Chuck
Norris jokes and you have to be careful
with that because unfortunately not all
those jokes are really suitable for
public consumption you know so I have to
be dicey about it but if you restrict
them to just the nerdy jokes then you
get the good ones like I think my
favorite was Chuck Norris can make a
method abstract and final but there's a
pretty good skill so at any rate I have
that over here no the other one so this
one as you could see I put Brian gets in
there for the for the actual name and I
have it in Java here let's actually go
to the Java version and the Java version
is using well javis basically retrofit
and an async task and I'm also using
retrofit either synchronously or
asynchronously if you ever do look for a
library to do restful Web Services
retrofit is an excellent one by the way
it's from Jake Wharton at square well it
used to be at square now at Google okay
and I used a lot of that and I can go in
and I could change the actually let's
let me run this one because I think I'm
looking at the other one so if I execute
this one course it's taking a while
isn't it there we go
now okay this has a tiny bit of a story
as well I made this whole app and I use
it as a teaching app again to present
how to write an app that did restful Web
Services and save data and and did
networking in asynchronous tasks and all
that all of that and then I put it in
the Google Play Store because why not
you know and a little while later I got
an email from patent Boggs LLP the
attorneys for mr. Carlos Rey quote Chuck
Norris did you know Chuck Norris's first
an actual name is Carlos Reyes I had no
idea
anyway it was claiming I was infringing
on his intellectual property and I'm
like I don't get it I'm consuming data
from a public website I'm giving this
away
what's the problem so I ignored it and a
week later Google's suspended my app
right now normally I'm way too much of a
coward to do anything about that but
this time I got annoyed so I rewrote it
as the Internet Carlos ray database and
if you actually went to Google Play so
if I go to play google.com and I look at
the I got to go to the apps section so
here's the apps section and I search on
I see NDB I think that'll do it
then here it is see the and you see I
even put the lawyers name right on the
icon there you know what that why not
right what are they gonna do make me
take it down again you know and you put
your pictures up there when Carlos Rey
throws exceptions it's across the room
or you know when Carlos Rey writes code
with bugs the bugs fixed himself a court
and by the way I you know I gave it a
five star rating you know I mean why not
you know and I have a few others and see
it's got you know best Carlos Rey app
ever that's phenomenal I love that you
know I tried them all and this is the
West one you know so again I gave it out
then I did the one thing you can't do by
the way which is I lost the the key you
know because you have to you have to
sign it with a private or with your
public key you have to put a digital
signature on the apk and it's not for
encryption purposes it's for
non-repudiation so if it goes wrong they
know who to blame you know and I lost my
repo or whatever it not the repo and
trying to think what all the certificate
and therefore I can't update it anymore
but of course I have much more update
versions this one like uses retrofit
this is using hans doctors the head of
the Gradle project you know and I can
use synchronously and asynchronously
I've got Tim O'Reilly in there so I have
a whole series of them now so that code
is all available if you're interested in
might github repository as well as I see
NDB underscore a s for Android studio
and of course recently I've had to get
into Kotlin a little bit here's the
shocking part this is pretty pretty much
the entire app in Kotlin I do have this
file which contains the classes that map
to the Jason structure coming
back see I like this JSON example
because it's small and it's funny you
know hopefully but it's sufficiently
small that I could just write a couple
of classes and get back see there's my
type as a is okay and and my rapper has
an an ID and a joke and a list of
categories and then inside here it turns
out in Kotlin you can extend app compat
activity there's the base URL that I'm
going to access and I can actually use
Google's jisan and they even have do a
sync and then UI thread to get off of
the UI thread to do the networking and
then back on the UI thread in order to
execute it and this is the one where of
course I decided to use Bryan gets as
the person we want to deal with so
clicking there never has to build
program to machine code machines have
learned to interpret Bryan gets go
that's not bad let's see that's dated
see if we can do better yeah you do
better than that
okay that's not bad I mean it depends
you know and you can play with that as
well so I spent some time playing with
Android and now I'm using that as a way
to get into Colin somewhat mostly
because I do Android and also I do
Gradle and Gradle adding a Colin DSL as
well so I need to learn some of that so
any rate back to where we were so
there's your pictures these are some
pretty good ones can spawn threads to
complete before they're started that's a
good one or can't test for equality
because he has no equal I like that yeah
yeah alright so at the time then I wound
up writing this Gradle recipes for
Android book so it talks about Gradle as
part of the build tool lots of tips and
tricks and then just to kill all the
sales entirely if you were to go to
Gradle dot-org in the book section you
can download this book for free they
will ask you for an email address and
they you know they want to find out if
they can mark it to you for Gradle
Enterprise but if you're willing to give
them an email address they'll send you a
link and you can have that book for free
now so there you go okay now then of
course Java eight finally came out and
we'd been waiting four years for that
speaking of Brian gets of course it was
instrumental and and all the the
functional changes in job
eight or se8 I suppose I finished the
cradle recipes for Android book and then
I had this foolish notion that hey I
just wrote a recipes book for O'Reilly
how hard could it be to write another
recipes book for O'Reilly not realizing
that this one was going to be you know
three twice the size and much more
complicated and everything but this gave
me a chance to play with the streams and
lambdas and Method references and all
these different things as well which
need no introduction for you I mean for
this audience I'm sure you're quite
familiar with all of that of course Java
9 has been out so I have a chapter on
Java 9 that does minimal not a whole lot
of stuff but talks about private methods
and interfaces and and additions to
various classes and and some and a
little bit about JPM s as well so some
of that stuff is in there I thought I'd
show you one unusual example this is
they say you can tell a developer by
whispering in their ear the word
timezones and watching a shudder go down
their spine ok and this is the picture
of time zones in Antarctica ok so
there's a scary picture now in fact the
funny part doesn't even jump out at you
until somebody points it out here's the
funny part you see the South Pole here
the South Pole is part of what they call
the Ross dependency and that means it
follows the timezone rules it turns out
of New Zealand and what this means is
that the South Pole six months of
darkness followed by six months of
daylight is actually on daylight savings
time believe it or not well now of
course that they now that the Javadoc
time package has been added to Java I
can actually check that sort of thing so
I can go over to IntelliJ let's see this
is here and this is my sorry this one
this is my Antarctica time zones app
which gets all the available zone IDs
turns them into a stream filters them by
Antarctica map's them to zone IDs by the
directly and then creates a own
date/time using now at zone now is just
local date time now
and I sort them by their offset from UTC
in terms of seconds and when I execute
this you can see the time zones in
Antarctica here listed one by one this
trolls got to be a joke I don't know
what that I mean taking that literally
and I have another version of this app
in the book I'm not showing it right now
that actually checks daylight savings
time and yes indeed
the South Pole currently is on daylight
savings time believe it or not I have
one other somewhat amusing app from that
same idea if you are I'm sure we have
some people from India or people who
have had conference calls with people
from India or been there if you know
anything about India you know that the
India Standard Time which of course
there's no such thing right it's all UTC
offset and region IDs any rate Indian
Standard Time is UTC plus 5:30 see there
half an hour offset from GMT
interestingly enough so I thought well
that's interesting and then somebody
said to me did you know that there are
time zones in the world that are 45
minutes offset from UTC and I'm like
you're pulling my leg so now in fact
this is based on an example in the Java
tutorial but the one in the Java
tutorial doesn't use streams so of
course I had to clean that up so this
one gets a zone date time and then maps
them to zone IDs and I filter them by
ones with an offset that is not an
integral multiple of 3600 for the
seconds okay so again sort them and now
I'll print out the offset and the zone
ID and the localized day time and of
course my favorite method here is the
width own same instant so you could find
out what time it is there and when I run
this then you'll see for example that
there's a bunch of half-hour offsets
even in Canada Newfoundland apparently
st. John's is half an hour offset there
you go there's Katmandu and with both
with and without the age turns out all
of Nepal is UTC plus 545 go figure this
one I got it I gotta ask one of my
Australian friends you Club I had to
look it up in Wikipedia it's a an old
railway station population 600 okay go
figure
8:45 and then the Chatham Islands off of
New Zealand as well so again just trying
keep things a little bit entertaining
and their examples in the book as well
so okay now I have to of course talk to
you about cat pictures right I mean
that's the reason we have the Internet
at all
and what I wound up doing is again I'm
using Java now but I'm still using
groovy to an extent and Kotlin to an
extent as well so what I did is I went
to Flickr and Flickr has what we would
well what they would call a restful web
service but that real rest advocates
would be appalled by you know cuz it
actually has method names in it and all
of that by the way you know what those
rest advocates call themselves do you
know that yeah they call up those Resta
for ian's you believe that yeah I I
didn't come up with that one you know
oh speaking of jokes I didn't come up
with a million monkeys that a million
typewriters will eventually type a Java
program and the rest will be Perl
programs
feel free to reuse that yeah oh and I
suppose if we have time at the very end
I can give you the worst sequel joke
ever told so but there's no going back
after that so I have to do that the very
end but I do have a good no sequel
variation so any rate I decided to
consume this Flickr API with a get
request and parse it and use groovy to
do this and what I want to show you is I
actually have this app called parallel
kitties so that I can actually use Java
eight streams in parallel to download
all the pictures ostensibly at the same
time so if I go to that so oh it's
actually that's the same one here
so this is groovy code I've got my
flickr key and you know that meant i had
to go and get a Kia Yahoo and boy that's
painful so it's in the repo try not to
do any serious damage you know whatever
and I search on kitties and here's the
API I'm gonna do a Flickr photo search I
want JSON data back and photos only once
six per page and this is going to take
those parameters and build a query
string out of it and I'll print out the
URL and then groovy will let me convert
that to a URL and the string
representing a URL into an instance of
java.net URL and then download the data
at that location so I'll get back to
JSON data I write it to a file pretty
printing it and then I parse it and grab
the photo elements inside there there's
a root element and it has photos and
then inside each photos inside the
photos block pardon me
there are photo elements and now here's
where I'm going to use my Java eight
parallel streams so I take my photos as
a collection and I use my map method and
I could print out the thread to see
which which thread each one is using but
right now I'm not printing that at the
moment this is the URL Flickr uses for
the actual image so I pull data off of
the JSON structure and plug it into this
URL and that'll give me the image and I
go turn into a URL and get the bytes so
this will all in principle happen in
parallel collect them into a list of
images and then this is a swing builder
using on the events dispatch thread
where I make a J frame and I put each
image and an image icon you see how
groovy likes to mix Java and groovy
pretty much line by line pretty much the
same now I'm gonna run this but I have
to warn you I don't know what I'm gonna
get once I got tractors and I might
track to Oh caterpillar
I get it you know once I got dogs I got
monkeys I have no idea if it's it's just
gonna be the latest six images that are
tagged with the word kitties which I
figured is as good as I can get if it's
totally inappropriate I'll just close it
okay so you know you're warned let's see
what happens here so if I run this guy
you'll see that there's the
Aysen data coming out and then it's
downloading the images ah looks like I
got cats how about that and I even put
in the mouse over I think or did the
mouse over not working well any rate I'm
declaring victory you know that that's a
win right the fact that they actually
look like cats is a pretty good one
so there's your concurrent or I suppose
parallel kitties couldn't you design for
concurrency you implement in parallel
right and this was trying to execute it
in parallel again if I uncommented this
line I could see the individual threads
running out of all of that so now of
course I mentioned the past and this is
getting pretty much up to the present
the president of course is that Java 10
comes out today yay you know so that'll
be good
right yeah feel free go get applauded
that except that's you shouldn't be
applauding me for that right that'll be
a lot of other people but there'll be
talks all day long on that of course we
have our outline of our our agenda of
what's going on today and there'll be
lots of opportunities to learn these
things and I guess one of the messages
that I feel like is that Java has
basically been the background music to
my career change you know to the second
half of my career I was a very unhappy
person in engineering working on things
I didn't enjoy in a company I didn't
like and as the first time I saw Java
I'm like hey I like that remember when
it was small you know that was fun I was
like wow this is really good I like this
and over the years I've just found
plenty of things in the Java ecosystem
that I've always enjoyed doing and when
Java kind of stagnated for a while with
Sun then I was able to move to the
groovy ecosystem and see a lot of
innovation over there and find out about
all the functional ideas etc and then
when Java came out with se8
from Oracle then now I'm able to boot
back into that area also and I'm really
looking forward to whatever happens in
the future as well so enjoy the rich
ecosystem around Java I mean there's
plenty of stuff there there's always
something that looks appealing to me any
rate I really like
good of course you based on the fact
that I I negotiated a royalty on the
book that I just told you how to
download for free you don't want me
negotiating your next contract just
letting you know on that particular one
so what I will say is I do have these
books to give out I don't have a good
way to do it so I do want to say one
thing that we're having that Women in
Technology luncheon right so why not any
woman who's planning to go to that or
whatever here give this to one of them
yeah okay right up front that's perfect
I mean if I can help support women in
computer science I mean that's a good
thing and then the rest can go to
anybody so here you're gonna pick
somebody I'll do I do I pick so okay
there's one back behind there and then
somebody further in the back sure back
in one of the last two or three rows on
the left there yeah and if you didn't
get one you know talk to me I've got
some ebooks too I can I can work
something out but there that's basically
what I wanted to talk to you about I
wanted to give you a little bit of my
history in the Java world and how Java
has really enabled my career basically
you know I'm now this Java champion this
Oracle Def Jam it's just it's funny how
that has evolved and oh I guess I should
show you in case you are interested
other way no here's the github
repository I was mentioning so the
github repository is kinda get rid of
that picture but any raid is on my last
name okay kou Sen and I have several of
them the making job a groovy one I've
got the ICN DB one in there the bingo
app is there and the job eight at Java
nine recipes is also in there that's
from the the actual book itself this is
a reactive spring because you got to you
got to follow the buzzwords right so I
saw that they had the buzzwords up there
for blockchain and and all the others
but I'm looking at reactive as well with
spring five and a handful of others so
you're welcome to take anything you find
there and good luck with it so I'm gonna
basically leave it at that
point and say thank you very much and I
hope you enjoy your day today
you're really you're gonna regret that
I'm telling you this is a bad move okay
worst sequel joke ever told you ready
sequel query walks into a bar selects
two tables says mind if I join you
that's really awful in it here's here's
though no wait wait a minute I got a
better one the no sequel variation DBA
walks into a no sequel bar can't find a
table so he leaves that's okay alright
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
