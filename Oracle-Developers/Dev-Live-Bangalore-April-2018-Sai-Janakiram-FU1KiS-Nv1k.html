in minutes also the key considerations
and also I've spent some time on live
demo but one of the thing is you know
normally as a DBA or a developer if they
want a database up and running it
requires a lot of effort and time
especially for example when you talk
about steps it takes almost 88 steps but
when it is an Oracle public cloud 88
steps just 88 steps so in Oracle public
cloud it is matter of three steps and
you know just blindly provide your
database name passwords and select what
database portion you know it's easy to
select and submit and within 30 minutes
time your database is up and running so
I'm just actually interested here I mean
so you actually showed a slide you
showed me this earlier the slide of the
88 steps
versus the three steps just interested
what the reaction was to that yeah and
so it was Lea I think the first time I
think I got around 200 people attending
my session and I asked you know how many
you guys are really excited about so
many people are excited and they think
that's a way of moving forward and so my
wherever I go my conferences you know
you less focus on admin job and focus on
your innovation right so you forget
about backup patching all the stuff you
should actually concentrate on perform
and security all the other areas yeah
even for developers whenever they want
the database so they need to really
depend on DBA team and operations team
to get the server but here as a
developer you can actually you know just
clicker in three buttons and you'll get
a database up and running in minutes so
this is that easy then the substantial
amount of work a substantial and matter
time is freed up for developers to do
other things yes that must be create
huge value on their side exactly that's
the the whole idea of automation right
so if you look at the graph you you have
around you are saved around 60 percent
of your time
you know doing this admin job so you can
use that 60% of the time for driving
your business requirements and you know
as a developer you can actually you know
you have to really understand your
business requirement and drive towards
your you know towards the development
and also I think I was talking about
today morning in another interview so
you always write a simple readable and
reusable code don't write a code which
is complex and nobody understands so you
always write a code with is easy
readable and reusable okay okay so I
just want to actually switch gears here
a little bit because when we spoke
earlier you mentioned that you were the
president of the oil all India Oracle
user groups yeah
and you're not from Oracle you're from
yeah so one of the constraint if your
Oracle employee you could not be part of
leaders group board of directors because
it's a conflict of interest but again
that's we have a lot of Oracle employees
supporting our users group so we started
this users group in 2007 it's almost 11
years now and so we started you know the
famous guys like moral evil earth and
sati Andhra and the couple of guys they
were there for short period of time and
they left now it was very difficult to
good reach out to the whole India
because the community is too much so we
have cha started in local chapters like
we have a local 8th city local chapters
running they are they follow the same
procedure what we follow so every every
month they do local events also we do
quarterly tech days and also annually we
meet our annually event it's called
Sangam Sangam is the Indian term which
is actually meeting of minds so that's
where we actually invite so many
international speakers so last time in
Bangalore it was 48 international
speakers 130 sessions 7 tracks
thousand
nice so this is stuff some significant
growth since you know 2007 yeah so
actually I used to do a lot of community
development work myself and I'm just
wondering what your observations are in
terms of the building community and this
is a developer conference there are
obviously about a thousand developers
here but I mean you're out there you're
building user groups in the grassroots
basically what are some of the issues
that you're seeing actually and in terms
of actually building a user group from
scratch yeah I think the from day one we
have the same problem you know because
for example look at the India's
community I think if you count it maybe
a few thousand people the message we
don't have a single platform but again
when you join a users group event or
something like or a peacoat event and
here is a place where you actually
interact with the saying minded people
from other organizations right so what
happens you can learn anything from
internet you know you have videos
youtube videos technology documentation
everything is available even if you pay
something extra you can actually get
some trainings from online but this is
the one of the forum where you can
actually talk to face to face you feel
that that the community right so for
example you talk to a new developer and
they're also using the same tool set and
you learn something different than you
know maybe you are having some issues in
your organization's or in your project
maybe the person can help you right so
even in my session I was talking you
know don't sit with your friends always
sit with the new people talk to them
introduce them and and also the
speaker's they look at the some of the
international speakers they come all the
way from you know look you know you know
about uniting your traveling it's more
than 24 hours I think this is the time
you need to use interact with them you
know yeah so a lot of things you can do
as a part of users group it's really
interesting I mean
human social issues are very very
important I mean they're the basis of
building a community you have the
technology but without the human beings
they actually interact yeah
so I'm also interested in so you
mentioned you know how number actually
actually what was the number of cities
you mentioned so eight city safe cities
okay so are they all growing in fairly
substantial rates like equal rates and
again that is a again coming to the
breadth and depth of India so we see a
lot of a lot of users are coming from
South compared to North but again each
city culture is different you know for
example Bangalore Hyderabad is the best
place you know where you can actually
host any event you get at least 500
people easily but when you go to
different cities there are very few
people attend our events and they are
really good in terms of quality but
there are some people in terms of
quantity but there is a less interaction
so every city is having a different
culture and we are trying to solve all
the challenges through our learnings and
now I think we know where to take which
speaker what time we need to host but
the good thing is I have around 35
volunteers from each city like for
example total number is 35 but each city
we have around 3 or 4 people they're all
like minded people so these again you
know they sacrifice their family time
personal time and they all excited about
helping community and they're spending
time they just as an amazing team you
know I feel all my brothers and sisters
and you know so it's really nice so to
the individual user groups interact with
each other as well yes they do
yeah really so one of the good thing
what we have done is we started as a All
India or Peru so that's covers entire
India so we set the rules and you know
for example mission and vision so
everybody follows right maybe next year
you can see the eight chapters become
twelve chapters so that's why we are
slowly
pounding so that everybody follows the
same standards everybody follows the
same methods and same thought process
instead of going their own way and how
long have you been president and so I'm
recently because my previous president
joined Oracle so if you join Oracle you
can be part of users group so but again
these are all positions for external
people we are the same people the
dedication is from day one it is same
and you know maybe you know it's very
tough to do the performance between our
jobs and activities because everybody is
like so there is no system right here
because if you go to any organization
you have manager and people and you can
appraisal everything you can measure but
in in our system for example I'm having
100% time on Saturday Sunday I can spend
some other having only 10% time but they
are ready to spend that's what we want
so people are very motivated motivated
yeah interesting
ok well great thank you very much sorry
for coming thank you sure yeah and enjoy
the rest of the conference
and thank you very much for watching and
we'll see you actually very shortly
bye thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
