everyone this is accelerated Java EE
open source development with Eclipse my
name is Greg stack Nick and I'm a
product manager at Oracle specifically I
work in the development tools group and
my team just develops Eclipse plugins
all day long so we spend about half of
our time building Eclipse plugins for
Oracle products like the database and
servers and then but the other half of
our time is spent just building plug-ins
for wtp so we have eleven Eclipse
committers and we're active in the JSF
tools project we're active in Dali or
active in eclipse link so we just live
live and breathe eclipse basically and
then I also moonlight in the Hudson
project within Eclipse so what we're
gonna be talking about today is kind of
just how do we use Eclipse for Java EE
development we'll talk about the Eclipse
ecosystem you know how do we build up a
good Eclipse install that will support
us for the types of Java EE applications
we want to create and then we'll do a
review of some of the spec level support
for the different pieces of Java EE and
how well it is supported in Eclipse I'm
taking a bit of an agnostic view of
Eclipse and and the various plugins so
you know I won't just be pushing Oracle
plugins or anything you don't have to
worry about that and then lastly we're
gonna be doing a demo and I think most
of the session will actually be demo
because I want to really focus on kind
of showing you where Eclipse excels in
different parts of Java EE and maybe
expose some parts of the tooling that
you're not a you haven't seen before so
last year around the time when Juno was
released zero turnaround did a survey of
the number of active Eclipse users and
it came out to about 8 million just to
show of hands how many of you are
Eclipse users all right now I just did
that really front my own benefit because
I wanted to see my entire session raise
their hands
but now just this is more real I'm how
many of you have already moved to Luna
okay anyone installed Luna sr1 that was
released on Friday okay not yet it just
came out so Eclipse does an annual
survey of their members and committers
you're all well you probably have gotten
those spams if you sign up you have an
eclipse organ count and what they'd like
to find out is what are their what are
the users working on what version are
they on what versions of Java what new
technologies are they interested in and
what we see every year is that the
majority of Eclipse users are maybe not
the majority but a lot of them are
building web applications and building
server-side Java and an interesting
statistic you may notice in some of
these bars is that in 2014 we see web
application went down slightly but then
if you look down toward the bottom
mobile application embedded devices
Internet of Things is growing it pretty
much the same rate so but at the st.
while at the same time server-side Java
well maybe people are more interested in
other interfaces for the server-side
JavaScript and you can see it's almost
all Java with C++ being the next most
popular and then we see growth around
like JavaScript and PHP so pretty
interesting so when we start with the
clips how do we build our Eclipse
environment um so we always you know
where do we start we start with the
clips or gob viously go grab one of the
bundles off of the Downloads tab we can
see that we have you know a number of
options when you go to eclipse org you
have the e bundle you have the
the straight Java developer bundle you
have CDT these are just statistics that
I pull it's really hard to see the
download numbers but just since the
Lunas our one release on Friday there's
been a hundred thousand downloads of EE
fifty thousand downloads of Java and
twenty thousand downloads of CDT so
people generally move pretty quickly to
a new the newer releases of eclipse and
when we get if you know and as Java EE
developers you're probably all starting
with the base Java EE bundle and that
gives you some good baseline cooling
most of the EE support is built out of
the web tools platform or wtp that will
give you support for things like servlet
JSF EJ B's JPA
some amount of web service support but
typically from there you need to
actually start adding more plugins and
the eclipse marketplace either embedded
within eclipse or in Eclipse org is a
great place to go it's got over 2,000
plugins and as you can see when I took
that screenshot over 10 million installs
of plugins from within Eclipse and
that's tip typically you know where you
would start to add things like maybe
your source control plugin if you're
using subversion it's already included
in in Eclipse maybe you start to look
for plugins to a database that you might
be using or maybe you need extra plugins
for wherever whatever application server
you might be deploying to but the point
is similar to Apple's marketing strategy
a bunch of years ago where there's an
app for that and everything is on the
iTunes with Eclipse there's a plugin for
that and you can pretty much find a
plug-in for anything in the marketplace
so let's talk about some of the Java EE
specs and I've selected ones
specifically that have a lot of good
tooling support in them so we'll start
kind of at the data access layer and
work our way up to the view so when
we're building a data model when we want
to access data from a database to build
data-driven applications which is what
I'll be doing the demo we can use Java
persistence which is our object
relational mapping maybe we need to
develop some business logic so we can
use ejbs for that still part of the java
ee spec
and from each abs maybe we want to build
some kind of you layer and if we're
using the Java EE spec fur for web
technology we're probably using
something like Java server pages or JSF
so we'll look at how some of the rich
JSF tooling as well and then lastly you
know data access business logic that we
may want to expose to other other
applications to consume or to other to
other devices like a mobile device we
often we use web services and we'll look
at both soap and rest based services so
let's kind of deep dive into some of
these specs and particularly I left out
like servlet if you're familiar with
some of the other specs supporting in in
Eclipse
I mean servlets just like a one wizard
that says create new servlet and it'll
add an entry to your web XML so you
don't need a lot of tooling support
around writing servlets but some of
these other technologies it's very
helpful so JPA will talk about both the
design time and the runtime aspect of
JPA so for your design time you have
great support coming out of wtp it's
through the dahle project and it gives
you tools to help create a data model in
a number of different directions
starting with a database we may want we
may have a schema a query a set of
tables that we want to create a java
representation from and we can do entity
generation from basically the bottom up
so it's one way that's one way will be
demo that's the way I'll be
demonstrating when we get into the app
another way is we could you may prefer
to start by modeling you're creating
your data model in Java and and then
pushing that down and creating the
database that reflects that object model
the tooling and Eclipse supports that as
well so you model your objects to create
your entity diagram and then generate
DDL is to ultimately create the sequel
and produce the the tables in your
database another piece of JPA that's
important is configuration and that's
done through the persistence XML file
the nice thing about JPA is you can
write vendor agnostic JPA
and only
in the XML file is where you specify
what database you might be using which
which JPA provider you might be using so
it is possible to write portable JPA
entities and we'll take a look a little
bit at how persistence that XML works
with in Eclipse there's a pretty rich
editor to work with that and then lastly
you're probably going to be doing a fair
amount of querying and you know when
you're doing queries in a database you
might be using sequel or PL sequel or if
using a JD or JDBC developer you might
be using sequel as well but the best way
to do it in JPA is through JP QL or the
Java persistence query language and
there's quite a bit of good querying
tools within Eclipse to help you figure
out which members are available on an
entity you know if it's if it's
reflective and correct against the
database and we'll be looking at some of
the things within the tools as part of
the demo for that too so in addition to
the design time tools Eclipse provides a
runtime and that's through eclipse link
eclipse link is the reference
implementation of JPA so it ships with
GlassFish every time there's a major rev
of Java EE you have an eclipse link
runtime that's that is implementing the
the spec and so Eclipse like started as
an ORM mapping runtime so to map your
database tables to Java objects but over
time it's expanded to support mapping of
a database to other things like mapping
database to xml through a sub project
called moxie another one is starting
with a database query or a set of tables
or schema and mapping them directly to
web services that's through the database
web services and then in the last couple
of years they've been eclipsed link team
has been focusing on them non-relational
database so through in support of
through no sequel and so the great thing
about Eclipse is that you have a design
time tool out of the box through the
Dalek project which is wtp and you also
have the runtime out of the box because
that's this is the runtime that ships
with Eclipse so you don't need to worry
about setting down
or setting up an application server you
can unit test your entities right from
within the IDE you don't have to do it
additional runtime setup so moving up
from the data model we want to start to
build some business logic maybe define
some data access what we can do that
through ejbs
Eclipse has had EJB supports since one
Oh in Eclipse to dot something or other
I can't remember which version but it's
been they've had EJB support for quite
some time and the old versions of EJB
with where it was pre annotations you
can still take legacy applications bring
them into eclipse Luna maintain them and
deploy them into some legacy application
server if you're doing more modern Java
EE development maybe through Java EE 6
or Java EE 7 you have support for all of
the modern annotations for for ejbs
and this couple types of ejbs that are
supported with the Eclipse tooling is
message driven bean since session beans
I'll be looking at session bean
generation and some of the additional
wizards that you may not know about on
how I can take a data model and create a
session facade which will give me all of
my crud operations that I would
ultimately then build an application on
so we'll see that in the demo as well so
if we've built up a data model we've
built up some data access how do we
display it what do we especially if
we're building a web application well
there's quite a bit of tooling around
JavaServer faces and jsps within eclipse
and that's through wtp as well so it's
just native tooling within eclipse for
JavaServer faces and that's actually in
a quite a number of areas so one is
library management so if I need to
JSF does not ship with Eclipse out of
the box but we have tools to help you
browse different JSF vendors and
download and install those jars directly
into your projects for example maybe you
want the Sun reference implementation or
you want to connect to Apache and
download my faces there's tools to help
you do that
configuration editors so
not necessary in Java EE 6 &amp;amp; 7 but if
you're doing a more complicated
configuration of your JSF managed beans
you may need to face this config file
and there's a which rich one in there as
well that gives you configuration
support as well as a visual way to map
out the flow of your pages we'll look at
that
as you know JSF is ultimately about
building pages and you use a series of
JSF components to lay them out on your
page those could be things like text
boxes you know data tables ways of
taking a user input you know different
style sheets things like that and so
with the component gallery we'll be
looking at how that gets surface in the
pallet how we can configure those
components and we'll look at different
drag and drop patterns to build our
pages the property sheet is a common
view within Eclipse so there's a series
of views that are that are just common
and it's up to plugin developers if they
want to reuse them property sheet is
actually reused quite a bit in for
Eclipse Java EE development in the
context of a web page your property
sheet shows you details about the
component you're working with maybe
gives you some additional configuration
options when you're working within a
class with annotations often the
property sheet will show you more
details about those annotations maybe
give you some help with configuring
those so and well then we'll also look
at when we're in the code how we can get
content assist validation refactoring
support things like that and four six
and seven if you're using dependency
injection admittedly the core wtp
doesn't have a whole lot of support for
form CDI in that case if you're if you
want to use the more modern patterns
you're probably going to pick a plugin
get some additional plugins maybe from
like JBoss tools or oracle has support
for for CDI so maybe building web
applications but we want to expose that
business logic to other applications
other consumers other other platen
devices so that's done through Web
Services or it can be done through Web
Services I should say and historically
Eclipse has had support for XML based
Web Services so Jax RPC and jax-ws on
they started with access as the runtime
that they supported but they've been
adding more of the standard jax-ws over
the last oh four or five years so
there's quite a bit of tools in Eclipse
for soap based development and I know
it's becoming an a style but we'll still
talk about it because there's a lot in
there so when you're developing a soap
based web service just like we were
talking about with JPA starting from the
top or starting from the bottom you have
tools to help you so if you prefer to
start with Java right your Java
implementation of this web service and
then create a wisdom around it to then
share with your consumers you can start
from the top down and produce the wisdom
if you prefer to start with the shape of
the web service that you're going to
give your consumers and then work on the
implementation in Java you can start
from the bottom with a whistle this is a
screenshot of the whistle editor and
then generate the Java code nimbin and
implement the methods so either way and
then there's also tools to help create a
web service client so if I'm consuming a
web service point to a wiz Ville point
to a java web service either remotely or
locally and then I can create the the
local code that I need to do the acts
the the web service access so it's a lot
of code generation that actually helps
quite a bit and where else do we have so
we have a rich wisdom editor for those
that are you know want to manually edit
whistle files that are starting from
kind of starting from the bottom and
working their way up the property sheet
is aware of the annotations and then
also some additional plugins so not part
of the cord wtp but things like you know
in my product we also go into tools to
help you secure your web services so if
you want to add policy to a web service
if you want to change the shape of the
web service by defining bindings we have
tools for that as well
but you know most most modern developers
are have moved away from soap or are
moving away from self and are starting
to look at rest and the rest tools in
Eclipse are
rich as the soap tools but they've only
been around for about two years
they started with just a simple wizard
to create a simple rest servlet and put
an entry in your web XML almost like
just the normal standard servlet wizard
but in the last Luna release they've
added more tools around it so more
patterns that you can support more
content assist in the rest annotations
and then we'll also look at similar to
generating a facade for an EJB we'll
look at how we can generate a facade for
rest based on a based on this set data
model so just convenience to help us get
started when we're building rest
applications similar to rest the rest
tools also use the property sheet wealth
with annotation configuration and they
actually in Luna they included a test
client so if I run if I select my rest
application I deploy and I say run it'll
bring it up in the browser and I have
some tools to help me test it so I'm
building this java applications java ee
application but then what do i do with
it and so typically you're going to need
to get some additional tools to help you
with your deployment so there's a
standard server configuration or a
server feature within WTP that has some
baseline server plug-ins for tomcat for
jetty and maybe maybe a legacy a couple
legacy ones but generally what you're
going to do is go to marketplace and go
pick up the the plugins the for the
server that you're deploying to or I'll
show you where you can search within the
servers plug the server's view to
discover additional plug server adapters
and they all tend to have the same
common set of use cases so take your
application bundle it up into a war here
send it over the wire to either a local
or remote server deploy it run it debug
it and then depending on the vendor that
you select you know that you may be
using say JBoss or Oracle or you know
spring or something like that you may
get additional features as well for what
you can do with the server plugins also
how do we how do we so since we're
building a dated at a-- access style
application in java ee how do we
how do we connect your database and
that's done through data tools platform
so that's another one of the verticals
of the Eclipse Foundation is a core set
of functionality to support the
databases and by default they have
adapters for most of the databases out
there but you can always get additional
adapters from whatever vendor you may be
working against and similar they have a
common set of core use cases so you know
connecting to the database working with
schemas loading data editing data
creating DD LS and doing basic querying
so we'll look at that as well so let's
see all this in action so I'm gonna fire
up eclipse
this is gonna be Luna s r1 so the latest
version of Eclipse
you know they close down some of these
windows startin a basic state and so I'm
in the Java EE perspective but let's
just take a look at what I have
installed here so I tend to use a lot of
the core Java EE components I've
installed Python support for some work
that we do internally and then I've also
installed the plugins that we provide
since I'm doing most of my work against
web logic and so if I wanted to go and
look for more plugins I don't know if I
trust the network but let's see what
happens
so let's go to the Eclipse marketplace
and see what kinds of additional plugins
we have that's actually learning fairly
quickly yeah good so we can browse the
Eclipse marketplace look at some of the
releases the recent releases you know we
can do searches maybe I want to look
good the Oracle plugins I can find them
pretty easily and then install whatever
I want
okay so let's see so we've we're in the
Java EE perspective um let's just set up
our access to somewhere with back-end
services so first we will set up our
server so I've already created a
connection I've got connections to web
logic into GlassFish but if I had
another server that I wanted to work
with I tend to use this download server
adapters feature this lets me browse on
the marketplace and filter it based on
just server adapters for various other
servers that not are not currently
installed in this workspace so if I
wanted to do work against Geronimo or
JBoss reson WebSphere very easy to just
download and install I also have a
database setup so this is using TTP and
so when we're creating our database
connection you can see by default
there's connectors for pretty much every
database but those you can always get
additional adapters from from the
vendors themselves so I've already
created a connection to Oracle XE if
anyone's ever worked with Oracle or done
an Oracle tutorial you might be familiar
with the HR schema I know we are within
Oracle because we have to use it for
everything and so here I can see my
scheme I so you have a list of tables
here so countries departments employees
one thing I might want to look at is how
are these entities related let me just
give myself a little more real estate
here so we have a yard diagram comes
with DGP so we can see how for example
you know employees are related to job
history we can get some details about
the sequel scripts that defined on these
columns and tables I may also want to
get into the data itself so maybe I want
to go and say employees I want to edit
the data so here I can load this load
the data into an editor make edits push
the changes directly into the database
so it gives me some basic editing
capabilities it's really meant for a DBA
but you know as a Java developer it
might be enough and then also also we
can always do query so this supports
sequel PL sequel
so let me just get some to a quick
select star get a little content assist
here from employees so the same thing we
just saw and we'll just run it we can
see the results here so same thing that
we just did when we were editing that
table it's it's it's it really depends
on the DTP plugins provided by the
database that you're working against so
we can go I'll show you again
by default the clip ships with these
adapters so db2 derby Oracle Postgres
Sybase but then other databases
frequently developed provide additional
plugins for Eclipse because Eclipse has
such a huge user community
okay so I've got a connection to a
database I can look I could review the
schema I can do querying don't want to
say the changes nope
so then let's actually start to build
this Java EE application so I've already
created an ear project or an enterprise
application project this is the
container for what will ultimately be
compiled into an ear it's got an EJB
module it's got a dynamic web app that
will ultimately compile to a war it's
just to review some of the facets so
your your features of a project I'm sure
you can familiar with this or are
configured via facets so we see here
we've got the ear module configured here
in the EJB module we've got EJB and JPA
and here we've also got um JavaServer
faces and JSP and jst l and so each of
these facets tend to bring some
additional configuration files with them
um so for example here because I
selected JPA
I already have a persistent set XML file
created for me I've also already
configured my JPA facet to be wired up
to the database and what that gives me
is the ability to get some live
validation against that connection so as
I'm writing my JPA entities it will
check to make sure that my annotations
are valid against this local database or
it could be remote database it's also
helpful in Quarian so let's create some
entities so I'm just going to use the
standard JPA tools we're gonna start
from the bottom up so we'll create
entities from tables and so then this
wizard is basically just showing you the
the tables that exist in this connection
and then it's telling you that it's
introspected into the schema and these
are the the relationships that have been
observed so for example you know each
department each location can have many
departments and I can get into the
details of that cardinality modify the
the relationship and ultimately even
define additional relationships through
Java that may not exist in the in the
table itself but I'm just going to
select just stick with the defaults here
so
have relationships between employees we
have an employee you know employee
manager type relationship we have
multiple employees or part of a
department on those types of things next
step is just to decide where I want this
code to be saved so I'm going to put it
into a package decide the type for my
collections how do I want my entity
access this means where do I want my
annotations do I want them on my fields
or they won't want them on my methods so
I'm just gonna select defaults here as
well they also can choose the key
generator strategy and then lastly this
is where you can shape the generated
classes themselves and so let me see if
I can get ya a little short on screen
real estate here so what I see is get
any bigger okay well these are that this
is the tables and then below will be the
generated the generated code so I have
for example departments is going to be a
class named Department I expand
departments I go to the primary key I
see it's gonna be a primitive type and
then I can decide what the accessibility
is on all that generated code now one
thing to note may not be you may not
have realized this but this and this
wizard is what we call re-entrant
meaning the configuration that you spend
the time you spend configuring this
wizard at least it's supposed to be
remembered the next time you invoke it
so if you're spending you know minutes
and minutes figuring out what your
entity relationships are and how your
classes are supposed to look and what
the names are supposed to be the next
time you invoke the wizard running again
it should save all those settings so
once again I'm just picking the defaults
in them as they finish so we see we get
code generated it seems to have built
successfully and so then let's go into
one of the classes so let's just give
ourselves a little bit more room here so
we see that we have an employee class
that is annotated with the JPA
annotation at entity we can get some
code assist to look at the other
annotations available we see that it's
tied to this employee's table
sim similarly if I do content assist
here
I've established that connection to the
database now I can browse the tables and
also if I make a mistake maybe I'd
misspelled employees it tells me right
away okay well this this does not exist
in my database so it tells you that
you've got an error here so let me go
back and just set it to employees and
we'll build it off of there another
thing that we see here is that so each
of we chose that we were going to do the
annotations off of our variables so we
see all of the columns are mapped to our
fields that's not actually required
anymore in in in Java EE if you just
keep the exact same shape as the tables
you don't have to and keep the the IDS
basically the same as the column header
so you don't have to annotate every
single field
you just have to annotate the the class
name we've also generated a default
query this is basically just to return
all the rows and so we see here we've
got it's called employee find all we see
an example of this J pql we want to add
in another another J pql query so I can
do it from the source code I'm going to
show you how to do it from the property
sheet so here's a property sheet and I
have a tab here called queries and let's
create a new one so we'll call this and
let's just say it's a named query so
this should add an entry to our our knit
list of queries that should wrap them in
a named queries annotation and then I
just need to provide what the what the J
pql is and so you start to see from
content assist you get suggestions on
what the right syntax is as well as some
documentation so we'll just say select e
from the employee e where and even we
can get down into the members where
salary is greater than some variable
that we provide something like that
it's also if I prefer to work in source
code same kind of thing
so similarly I can get content assist as
I'm writing my JP QL directly within the
Java class so if you don't like working
with property sheets and wizards and
stuff you can stay within the code
something that eclipse often excels at
is is remembering that a lot of people
like to just stay in their editor and
not bounce around between these
different views so I've built up a data
model for three entities employee
location and departments maybe we want
to build some data access around that so
we're going to use an EJB and this is a
wizard that we provide as part of the
oracle tools so what if I'm just
starting from scratch I could just say
create a new session being decide the
state that I want it to be stateless
Singleton's or stateful and if I want to
generate interfaces or not and depending
on the version of Java EE that I'm
developing against I don't actually need
interfaces anymore but there's another
one that we have which is to be able to
create a facade let's see see you know
let's so let's say session session being
from JP a entities so what this is going
to do is it'll take those entities and
then create basic crud operations so
change remove update those types of
things using jpq l which is it's really
just considered boilerplate code it's
really it's up to you to to go and
modify and add your own implementation
and business logic to it so let's call
this no HR facade keep it stateless
we'll put it in a package and then we'll
just create crud operations for each of
our entities
and so let's look in this package that
we just created service so we have local
and remote interfaces but then this is
the class so if we give myself a little
more room here you can look at the
outline view so what we see is we have
some methods that were generated to add
a new department to update a department
to remove a department so giving us the
basic crud for these entities that we
just created as well as providing
references to the to the named queries
that we had done now similar to the JPA
wizard this is probably also something
that you may or may not be aware of
there are the wizards like this are also
reentrant meaning if for some reason my
underlying data model changes shape I
maybe I had to regenerate my JPA
entities because a column name or
something changed in the database we can
recreate the facade to reflect those
changes in the data model and it does it
in a non-destructive manner so let's do
that
let's create another main query Alice
cranium querying Department
so we'll just create the similar kind of
thing
so it was say
the Department
so this is just gonna basically just
copy the other one that we had in there
but then what I wanted to show is then
recreating this facade so then we say
recreate the facade do you want to keep
it stateless next do you want to keep
the same entities and then we'll update
and there's a convention within Eclipse
which is we have a Java doc annotation
here that says at generated anything
that has that generated tag the wizard
thinks that it can overwrite if you
remove the out generated tag and add
your own implementation then it keeps it
if you ever had to do a regeneration so
we don't blow away all of your all the
hard work you may have done because we
you know this is supposed to boilerplate
code right you're supposed to go in and
know and edit it and make it tailored to
whatever your business logic needs are
okay so we have a data model we have
some data access so let's start to build
a view around that
so with JavaServer faces we tend to have
two well depending on how you're working
with JavaServer faces we need something
that our components combine to so it's
often done as a backing beam or if we're
using CDI we just annotate fields maybe
on our EJB I'm going to use a backing
beam so I'm gonna create a JSF managed
bean out of this and we'll call it just
call it backing up last name and HR
they'll create the code and so then we
have a new Pocho in our web app that
reflects the EJB basically so now we
have something that we can build our UI
around and bind our components
ultimately to then pass data back and
forth from the web UI back into our into
our database and as part of that we tend
to update the faces configuration file
so faces configuration is the descriptor
for JSF and we see that we've got a new
entry in here for this managed bean we
may also want to create some navigation
rules we'll do that in a moment as we're
create a store we create our page so we
have a place to do our binding let's
actually add some components so that we
can
display this in a webpage so I'm going
to use an HTML page so I'm gonna work
with facelets here so employees
Hilly's jsf okay and this brings us into
our webpage editor so the web page
editor is basically the the main editor
for doing JSP and when HTML and JSF
development it has a few different ways
to work with if you prefer to work with
straight code you could just work with
that code toggle if you like to work in
more of a design view there's also a
toggle to bring up a pure designer or a
split view designer so when you're
dragging and dropping you can see how
its give you a static rendering let's
stick with the code view for now and so
let's just move some things around and
let's bring up the palette
so let's just reload the sky
it's like I'm not seeing all my
components that I was expecting so let's
try recreating this page
it's great as a JSP this time
all right great so in the palette we
have a series of components so depending
on how we've configured JSF which
component libraries we've added into our
class path on the the palette will be
populated differently so I'm using the
RI of JSF and I've also added some
additional JSF components I'll show as a
second set kind of second part of the
demo so we'll just stick with JSF HTML
and so maybe let's take that list of
employees and represent it in a table so
I'm just going to drag and drop and then
we have basically Wizards to help us
configure our components as we're using
them in the page so I can start from
scratch with a basic table go and add
each of my columns and define how the
collection is supposed to populate them
or I can just point to an existing
collection that I have and let it
generate the the full pattern for me so
I'm just gonna build a data table around
this binder method that was the named
query on my entity so it's need to give
it a variable to iterate and then as we
introspect into this collection of
employees we decide well which do we
want to display actually so I'm just
gonna have a reduced list here because
I'm short on screen real estate so we
will say first-name lastname salary
employee ID and we'll change the order
and then from here I can also decide how
I want these Tings to be rendered so do
I want to use an output text or a
password field or any other this list of
JSF components so we create it and so
then we have a basic JSF table that's
pulling from our backing beam and we can
get some content assist based on the
vacuum beam so this is where the JSF
tools give you a lot of help so when
you're working with when you're doing
binding of JSF components you're doing
it through an expression language and
the expression language convention is to
give the name of the beam as it's
registered either through CDI or in your
faces config dot and then fields or
methods
on that on that and on that object and
so JSF tools are aware of the way that
you've registered your beans in in your
project and then it can give you that
bit of code insight as well as
validation so you make a mistake tells
you right away well this thing doesn't
exist on that object and if I needed to
if I forgot what the definition was I
can always just do some hyperlink
navigation bringing right into the code
that's just by holding ctrl R you're
probably aware of how that works yeah
ladies please pfft back
so I would say the general rule of thumb
for things where wtp gets out of sync is
to do it clean and just rebuild the
project I don't know maybe is it that
kind of thing help for you I mean
there's okay I can give you more tips
afterwards on things that I know that
work okay so we've got a view we've
looked at how we can get some content
assist so we can get you know content
assist for our components for their
attributes and then even down to their
values like we see with the e L now
let's just run this to see how it looks
so let's take the employees and let's
just say run on server so this is gonna
take this project and push it into I'm
using WebLogic it's gonna push it into
WebLogic and then it should launch an
external browser or I can't remember if
I configure the internal Eclipse browser
but it should show the page so what
we're expecting is a list of employees
essentially
oh I'm just gonna show you something
else while it was loading because
sometimes WebLogic can be a little bit
slow if I know if anyone's good enough
it's familiar with WebLogic so here I
have a list of my employees now so it's
very easy to build that my data model
build up my facade create a bindings
ability to do bindings and then
represent it in a table you know maybe
this is a little boring I want to add
some style to it I can do a number of
current ways one nice waves through the
property sheet so I can go into this
data table go down and say style maybe
you're gonna give it let's see where can
we get some style or some different
colors here to the table itself and
maybe the background color will make it
I don't know gray or something silver so
save it and let's go back to our browser
hit refresh we should see now we've got
apply to style so that's one of the
advantages of some of the server plugins
that you might be using is they support
this kind of hot-swap ability so if
you're modifying you know web pages some
java classes you don't have to do a full
redeploy saves you some time as a
developer okay so we've got a way to
build a UI but it's not that exciting so
what I'm gonna do is actually switch
over and use a different set of JSF
components so we have a this one's gonna
be using the oracle ADF faces components
so these are additional JSF components
they're usually geared more toward like
an enterprise user they focus more
around like visualizing data providing
graphs and integrating with maps and
things like that so let's go and once
again I'm going to create a different
manage beam or binding so let's go back
to my EJB
say credit bindings for like a different
set of components and then let's go and
create a new page so this time maybe
what we'll do is we'll have a list of
departments instead of employees and
maybe we'll do a little bit more than
that maybe we'll have a list of
departments and maybe scroll through the
employees in a department and maybe
represent those employees in a graph or
something like that so let's just call
this departments list and one of the
nice things with this framework as it
also gives you the ability to have some
different types of layouts since they
use facelets as their core page
rendering engine so I'm gonna pick a two
column layout where the top and a bottom
and we'll just populate each of those
areas with something fun okay so I've
got a page
let me just give myself a little more
room here look so I have a few different
areas where I can put components so we
use facets to denote those so I have one
facet here called first
so maybe within the first facet here and
this is kind of how it doesn't render
that well it just gives you some an idea
of how these things are gonna get laid
out so with this facet or this region
we're gonna represent a set of
departments so similar to what we saw
before we had that department find all
so that was one of our named queries I'm
just gonna represent it as a form and so
here I can I can browse into all the
different fields that are on a
department also pulling in some of the
members that are part of the
relationship but I'm just gonna show
department name department ID give it
some navigation controls and so we'll
have a list of departments that we can
cycle through next previous those types
of things maybe we will also want to
have that department align up with a set
of employees so here I'll go back into
let's see
panel form layout
to this facet either
there we go so here we have another
region that we can put content into so
maybe within this set of departments
let's list all the employees so this is
just the entity relationship between
departments and employees that we're
gonna represent in a different way in a
table so similarly which members do we
want to represent so we'll do similar
what we did also with that pure JSF page
so we'll do employee first-name lastname
salary
and maybe able to Mabel some sorting
will make it real make it read-only
let's try running this guy and see how
it looks
and so similar to the JSF components we
get content assist for these tags as
well I mean it's just it's a very
standard pattern in the way that Eclipse
supports JSF so now that's going to load
my page and so what I should see is I
should have a list of departments and I
should also have a list of employees
let's see what I did there
oh I see what I did I put in the wrong
place
put it in between the tag so obviously
it's not gonna render there okay let's
try that again
all right try that that's table same
kind of thing we'll give some sorting
and we'll represent these guys
and maybe at the same time we also want
to represent these differently instead
of just a list of employees maybe we
would also want to represent their
salaries so we'll take that same list
and we'll say instead of a table let's
represent you as a graph so we'll have a
list of employees and their salaries as
a graph we'll put the bars to be their
salary and we'll put the x-axis to be
their last names okay so let's try
running again so once again we're going
to take this application generate the
ear send it over to the application
server run it and load it in our browser
okay so now I have a list of employees
and departments I have some different
graphs that are representing their
salaries and it's just using a different
JSF component library same come same
concepts as normal JSF you just add
components you do bindings that question
I can I actually use full ADF but I but
I also have ADF essentials setup usually
you would use ADF essentials if you're
deploying to let GlassFish or Tomcat but
if I since I'm deploying to the full
WebLogic then I would just use the full
ADF but yeah you can do both okay so
we've created a view a layer do we have
enough time let's that's let's give this
thing a little bit of animation while
we're at it so maybe we'll say that this
graph is supposed to be rendered that
it's going to show up in a 3d just like
you clicking back over there maybe we'll
say that it's going to do a little bit
of animation
mints try read elephant building this
page so now we have little dancing
graphs this is all just done by updating
some properties and just taking
advantage of the fast flow the hot
swapping capabilities of Eclipse okay so
we've looked at how we can build web
apps or Java EE apps just using kind of
the standard EE stack right creating
data model using JPA
creating our business logic using a JB's
creating our pages using Java server
faces well what if we want to take that
data model and then expose it as web
services for other consumers um so let's
do that using rest so I'm going to
create I'm going to close all these
windows down create a whole new project
that will house my rest service so we'll
create a it's just gonna be a web app
we'll call it Jalen rest and in the
interest of time we'll keep it a little
bit more simple than the last sample
that we've developed alright so we'll
create a web XML will place the entry
for rest in the web.xml at the same time
we'll add some additional facets so
we'll add jax-rs and we will add JPA
and then we need to configure those
facets so now we'll wire this up to the
same database connection and we'll also
add the entry to the Jersey jars onto a
class path and then make an entry for
the appropriate rest servlet so like we
did before
let's just create a simple entity
so what create No whoops sorry I picked
the wrong one man today's from tables
I'll so just create a representation of
employee and we'll just we won't even do
the the manager to employee relationship
will just keep everything very basic so
once again we should have our employee
and our model project here with the
right annotation same kind of content
assist does all that good stuff now
let's do a restful representation of
that basically create a rest facade that
we can then publish and make available
to our consumers so here we go we'll use
some of the default rest tools that come
with Eclipse so I'll do a search for
rest and saying new restful web service
and we'll just give it a name and
there's a few different patterns that um
it is starting in Luna that are
supported so we have just the basic
class that's annotated with that path
annotation we have some other patterns
that one I want to show you this
entities access which is new and that's
where we create this facade so we'll
create a representation of employee via
rest then we can see here what the
generated code will look like so it's
all the basic crud operations and we can
decide how what are the producers and
what types of producers and consumers
are we going to support the one that I'm
really most interested in is I'm gonna
test out this find employee method and
it'll say it's by default it's going to
support both JSON and XML and so now
here's my rest service so we see it's a
stateless being that's then rest enabled
and we'll take a look at also the
annotation property editor so this is
another thing that's helpful if you're
new to arrest and you're trying to learn
the annotations this property sheet is
actually pretty pretty nice because what
it'll do is it'll show you you know what
what the representation is of the
annotation and then give you some tools
to help
- or modify so for example create
employee it's got a consumes annotation
if we wanted to add additional supported
types we can go in from the picker and
say you know we wanted to be plain text
HTML something like that and we can just
keep updating but of course we can
always just use the annotations as well
so all of that is supported so let's run
it and test it so let's just take this
rest service and just say run on server
and we'll just send it over to live
logic oh did I select GlassFish by
default let's see here
no we're good I selected the wrong
project
let's try that again I was creating that
restful web service in the wrong project
so let's try this again
that looks better
okay so we got the same cut type of
class that's been generated now let's
run it
so what's what going to happen now is
that this class is going to get sent
over a package up into the web app and
then we'll launch it in our browser so
by default the way I have a configured
is to open up the waddle not all rest
developers use waddle it's just a way of
adding a more structured shape to arrest
service another option here is this rest
test client which here I can just select
the name of the class of the rest class
and I need to use the right package
names let me go back I always forget the
name here that we spent based on our
path and then here I can hit the rest
service
hmm
it's a waddle still active it is
all right well we will ask for running
at a time debug this and I can show you
out in the hallway how this actually
works on a different class that's
actually fixed but some of the things
that we see within eclipse is the
ability to manage dependencies so as a
developer what a Java EE application can
be pretty complicated and sometimes I
need some additional help to understand
what the dependency relationships are
and so we have a feature within eclipse
or within the Oracle tools called app
x-ray which gives us a way to walk
through a dependency relationship and
see exactly how all of our logical
members are have our fields and methods
and variables are related as well as all
the as well as all of the pages and XML
files very helpful to understand a new
project a complex project it also feeds
into more advanced refactoring so in
conclusion yeah so as we saw we've built
a ie application you know going to the
Eclipse Foundation are going to eclipse
org and going to the marketplace gives
us a great set of tools to build our
custom Eclipse install to do our Java EE
development and often when you're
picking these tool sets it really
depends on the runtimes you're working
with so something also is that the
relationship between Eclipse and Java
has really gotten better over the last
couple of years last year with the Java
EE 7 release GlassFish 4 and Java EE 7
were released in June right in around
the same time as Eclipse
junot so all at once from from day one
and Eclipse you could develop against
the new spec and even better was when
Java EE 8 was released it was actually
the launch event was at Eclipse con so
there was coordination between the Java
group and Eclipse to have a really tight
relationship some additional resources
if you're interested to learn more and
look for places to get additional
plugins and other topics that you might
be interested in there's a session
tomorrow about Java development in the
cloud this is looking more around like
application lifecycle management so
tools like Hudson tools like git and
where
you know what are the hosted solutions
that we can use to manage our
application lifecycle another thing is
if you're interested in mobile there
were two mobile development sessions in
Eclipse yesterday there's another one
that's running on Thursday now that one
is actually an open world so if you it
you may need an open world pass to get
into that one but the focus of that one
is more around developing rest services
for iOS and Android development so how
do I develop a rest service how I
consume it and then how do I build a
hybrid application to run on Android or
iOS so sorry I went a little bit long I
hope this was useful help maybe you
picked up some new tricks and tips about
Java EE development in Eclipse and I'll
hang out in the hallway if you have
questions Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
