for a company in Sweden call j way and
i'm at java developer so let me just
check it that i have the right audience
how many of you are java developers
excellent all of you that's perfect and
how many of you program in another
language besides java for example
javascript sequel HTML maybe xml okay so
we have a few languages here already
that's good let me tell you a bit about
myself and the first computer i got was
a ceilings spectrum and the cool thing
with this computer was when you booted
this computer the first thing that
happened was you got a prompt and did
this prompt you had to type some magic
commands in order for the games to load
that was good times but after wine like
with bored with these games and i
started thinking about writing my own
games this were a text based games at
first and then I do some simple graphics
and this was in a basic language that
came with it with the machine after a
while I got the an Amiga and I learned
assembly language because that was the
language he had to learn if you want to
do something cool on the Amiga because
it had all these coprocessors that you
could use to create cool things and now
I had a really solid foundation for
writing excellent programming
programming I had basic and I had
assembly language so a few years went by
and I learned the C and C++ and I heard
about this thing called object-oriented
programming and didn't really understand
it at the time but I started writing
some classes because that was the cool
thing to do apparently
and I started studying at the University
and we had they decided to use Java as
at the language for all the courses at
the University so at this time I
actually learned what it meant to be
Opie oriented and I started realizing
that the software had written before
maybe was a bit unstructured maybe
wasn't that easy to understand the
twenty thousand lines of assembly code
maybe not that easy to understand for
someone else besides me in fact I didn't
understand it either so a few years went
by I got the job I started working this
was during the the horrible egb era
anyone else was there I guess maybe but
after a while I started thinking about
how to write programs in it because I
realized there was a lot of boilerplate
in my programs so i found this spring
framework and i found the aspectj i
started writing programs in a different
way I used components and I used like
these aspects to handle transactions and
logging on things another few years went
by and i discovered Scala Scala is a
functional object oriented hybrid and
this was my first time with functional
programming and I really enjoyed it this
changed the way i wrote java programs
because now i started thinking more
about the functions what should actually
happen instead of what are the things in
the program so when I write Java today I
always use functional constructs I use
things like guava to help me create the
transforms and filtering on collections
but they're also a different way of
thinking about the program another few
years went by and i discovered closure
closure is a lisp and it has dynamic
typing something I
first thought was completely crazy I
really enjoyed having all these compiler
errors and my tooling sir at first it
was a bit different but when I started
learning this it really changed why I
wrote I think about programming and also
how I write Java programs so what I hope
is that by looking at different
languages you the way you think about
programming will change and even if
you're not using closure in your
projects I think you will benefit anyway
so this talk is not about a
comprehensive introduction to closure
there is other great talks available on
youtube if you want if you want to have
a more in-depth look it's not to talk
about functional programming either I
know that lambdas are coming to Java so
I think it's sort of a this is something
you know we we should get to the new
cool stuff we shouldn't be bothering
with these old things like functional so
let's let's look at more interesting
stuff so when you start looking at the
new programming language you have to
think about what can I do with this
program this language that can't deal
with with the old ones so what are the
killer apps I think one of the coolest
things I've seen in closure is something
called prismatic how many of you have
heard about prismatic a couple yeah I
was a prismatic is my primary source of
reading news about programming in fact I
would use it for other things as well
but I really lot in bug news about
programming this all the news i read
actually so this is a screenshot from
prismatic and prismatic does is it sort
of scans the entire internet and loads
all RSS feeds and all of twitter and all
of facebook and all
and Google+ and it sort of looks at what
I'm interested in and presents me with
news that I will find interesting as you
can imagine there is lots of data going
in there and there's lots of you know
calculations that need to be done in
order to create something that's
interesting for me what's also
interesting is that when they when I
request give me the latest feed they
compute the feed on the fly so there is
nothing you know pre-computer anything
in and it's a couple of hundred
milliseconds it's really really fast so
you will think that there were you know
hundreds of develop or something or this
project but actually there is for people
working on this and the entire thing is
written in closure so I think the only
reason they can be so few developers is
the fact that you're using closure there
are also a lot of other projects for
instance diatomic is really interesting
and no sequel database with acid
transactions and extremely scalable
queries there's also storm that's used
by Twitter for real-time analysis some
of the Twitter firehouse and you can
also run closure in the browser which I
find cool
I think when you look at the projects
that exists in the closure community are
quite different to to other communities
they're very few like you know web
frameworks they're more about real-time
analysis databases and data processing
so what is closure its language was
created 2007 by rich Hickey it's a lisp
I will get into that more later it runs
on JVM but it also runs on the clr and
in javascript and the reason for
creating closure is for handling
concurrency and compare this to other
languages for instance Carla scholar was
created as an academic investigation
into you know is it possible to combine
functional and object orientation it's
more of a academic exercise Samsung at
least it started that way but closure
actually has it looks like it's has
academic background protectively the
opposite it's as a really pragmatic
approach to programming to solve
real-world problems and whenever you see
a closure presentation you have to see
some you know cool math problem being
solved so this is that slime so this is
our cloth closure program looks like it
describes what it means to be divisible
by something and then it defines the
prime numbers as all the numbers that
are not be provided by any other prime
numbers and then we define what it means
to be prime but
the problems we encounter typically are
not mathematical problems we have
business problems we have complex domain
and business logic that we solve these
kinds of exercises is not the things we
want to look in till we want to look
into real-world problems so why should
you look into closure I think the fact
that there is a list and I just saw
showed you how it looked like looked
kind of different from jaan liya I think
it is it's also functional but it's not
only functional in the way that it's
that you can have first-class functions
it's also functioning the way that you
can work with immutable data structures
you can you can create these lists and
maps and sets and they once you've
created them they never change and you
can work with these very efficiently you
can create new versions of them in an
extremely efficient way it also has a
very nice interactive development
environment we look into that a bit more
later I think it has a great ecosystem
there are lots of different libraries
and frameworks you can use it's also
designed to run on on the JVM so you
have really easy access to all of the
other you can call gela methods and you
can use java strings for instance that's
the same thing as a closure string I
think in the end it all boils down to
having less complexity but I know that
that's hard to see when you look at this
first so let's give that one so whenever
I talk to a Java developer whenever they
see this language for the first time
their reactions are you know this looks
weird I don't want to look at this
anymore this dynamic typing stuff that's
really scary I want my compilation
errors it's just a toy language I don't
want to solve this mathematic
problems I have real-world problems to
solve and once they sort of look into a
bit more deeply into the programming
language that is cover that it has
macros and I just think I'm crazy
so I'm going to go through these
complaints and see if I can convince you
that these of these these is not
actually not issues so let's stop talk
about the fact that it's a lisp and we
need to look into what it means to be a
lisp and this is all the you know the
data types that exist in this enclosure
you have integers and then I all have
arbitrary appreciate position so you can
have as many numbers as you like you can
also use doubles big decimals and you
can use ratios ready juice or actually
you know you don't lose anything so you
take 22 x / 7 x 7 you get back 22 you
also have strings and characters then
you have something called symbols and
symbols if you think about like you
variable names or function names then we
have something called keywords and
keywords you can think about as
constants or enums and you also have
some other nice things like regular
expressions and that's job as regular
expressions it's it's something you're
familiar I think so let's have a look at
the more data structures how many of you
are using JSON almost all of you so you
will probably know that this is you know
how you write a race and object create
objects in in JavaScript so if you the
difference enclosure is simply that the
columns are have moved into in the maps
the vectors are the lists are exactly
the same thing let's have a look again
array same thing as vector object same
thing as mad however the coulomb has
changed you see very small change
another thing is that commas are white
space so we just remove the Commerce we
can have them if you want to its fine
then we also have two other data
structures and that's lists and sets the
difference between a list and a vector
is that the list is actually a single
link single link list and the vector has
index access you can access any element
in the vector and you also have sets on
status I mean it's quite nice to have
them be able to have sets this way so
let's let's see if I can let's see if I
can demo this oops so I talked about you
know this first machine I had it has had
this prompt where I can start
programming this is exactly the same
thing i know many languages had that
it's called a rebel it's read eval print
loop and what you can do here is you can
actually start typing and it will show
you things like you can do plus we're
instance oops I can also check my my
strings and let's see this I talked
about this symbol thing so let's see if
I right foo what happens well it says I
don't know about any symbol foo so it
will get an exception what I need to do
is I need to define the symbol like so
then i can evaluate foo and it says bar
like like an opportunity
and what's interesting with this is that
most of the coding takes place in this
ripple you write your code here and once
you find something that works you copy
that into your ID
I know that for many java programmers
lisps looks really really weird and the
difference is so tiny you have the area
called to a print line hello world and
the only difference in the list which
you take the first parentheses and you
move it like this and put it first
instant so let's take a look at that
again I know I know this is really
difficult stuff so it's a place a place
pay attention get moving and and if
that's all it is actually so the first
thing in the parentheses that the
operator that's what you want to do the
rest of the list is the arguments for
the operator and that's always the case
so let's look at the more complex
example let's say we have something like
this and what I usually do when I look
at something like this if I take a look
at the innermost parentheses like this
and I start thinking what does this mean
well plus 12 well that should be three I
guess okay so what's to string of three
what is that well that's the string 3
equals that's actually the Java equals
and that's true so that's the way you
should think about it you should go to
the innermost parentheses and start
working your way out from that
so let's compare java enclosure side by
side we have the variable declarations
in java and you can define symbols
enclosure you can also use local
variables because the symbols are
globally defined we have an if statement
so the why and the is the den clause and
the set is the else clause bkc
multiplication in Java multiplication
always has two arguments enclosure you
can have arbitrary number of arguments
but you just put the multiplication
first calling a method we look at that
before you just put the parentheses
before the method name instead of after
calling an object well we put the method
first is a dot method then the object
and then the argument list and defining
your method looks like this
okay so what I want you to look at this
is it's really consistent the first
thing inside the parentheses that that's
what's going to happen and I like that
consistency in Java you have to look
read the entire expression until you
know what's going on so I think we're
going to have a quiz now what is does
the following java code do
does it compile
I sure
yes you you look at this and you think
well the last one thing that should
probably not compile but actually what's
going on here is that it's a do-while
loop with a while loop inside of it and
i've sort of i've done some weird
indentation so the first do that has a
single statement which is a wild
statement so what happens it happens
here is that it prints bang is one
forever and this is part of the to be a
certified java programmer so so i think
Jonna is quite complex to read my
closure on the other hand it's really
consistent you always have to have to
have the parentheses in Java I can skip
the parentheses sometimes but makes the
code hard to read so what this is crazy
thing about macros so first to an
example of working with the Java code
java classes so this little program
creates a jframe add suit label and
shows it something like this the closure
program does exactly the same thing as
you can see there is I mean they're very
similar in structure in a way what we
can see in this example is that there is
a pattern here we see the frame symbol
appears on several places here and what
we can do is in some languages it means
we can sort of use something like this
we can say with frame do this and this
and this and that you can't do that in
Java by the way but there are other
languages we can you can do that so
enclosure we can actually do something
like this we can write like this do to
to frame and then we can call the
methods on the frame
and as you see then we don't need to the
variable frame we don't need to you know
be care that we can just use the new
jframe directly and this due to is
actually a macro but a java programmer
looks at this and things well that's
nice but I wouldn't I would never want
to do something like that that's that's
crazy crazy stuff so what about the what
about this in Java 7 we got this
construct called twat with resources
it's an idea that you can have a try
statement that when it leaves the twine
statement it automatically closes the
resource extremely useful but it took 15
years until we got into the language
with macros we can do this whenever we
want we want to we want to change our
language we can we can do that change
ourselves we don't have to wait for
someone to incorporate the intro to the
language or we don't have to even write
compiler plugins or something in that
act we can just write a simple macro I
won't go into how how you write macros
by the way so I think macros are a good
idea you should use them carefully if
you can't use them all the time so what
about this complaint that there is a toy
language
when you write programs in Java you have
packages for modules you have interfaces
for abstraction and you have classes for
implementation and that's all very well
but where do we put the mutable state
well we put them in classes right but
where do we put this how do we
distinguish a class from a class that's
mutable and a class that's not me at all
where do we put our static methods while
we put them in class is there is no
other way to put them what about
inheritance should we use inheritance is
that a good idea what about constants we
can put them in interfaces and in
classes that's a bit weird isn't it its
enclosure we have four modules we have
something called namespaces and the
difference between the package in a
namespace is that the name state space
actually first class that means you can
iterate over them you can you can do
sink things with them in a way you can't
do with packages we have clinical
protocols for abstraction there are a
bit more powerful than interfaces that
allow a show that in a minute when you
implement things you have records for
things that are immutable typically this
is your business objects like persons
orders I think that you automatically
get equals hash code and all that nice
things you want to add if you want to do
something complex like creating your new
type of data structure you can use def
type that can can be used to create mute
the balance things you should typically
be avoided you can also create
Singleton's using something called we if
I and there is also some things that can
be used to create the
specific java classes for
interoperability okay so let's look at
the record so I'm creating in the
namespace my name space I'm creating a
new record cold person when the that
person has two fields first name and
last name and I simply use the new
operator same thing as in Java and using
and I call call the constructor using
the arguments the on encompassed what
will happen is I will get something like
this on the prompt and if you remember
this is just a normal map so so the have
that I can use the normal things i can
use we're working with maps i can also
use the same thing as 4 records which
text actually really convenient
so let's say I create i define a person
to be a new person youngquist and then I
call the dot first name method on that
person and I could give me yawn as
expected there is also another way to
create the person's and you can use maps
and that is convenient when you want to
have named parameters because sometimes
it's hard to remember what the order you
have to put the arguments or maybe you
want to write them in a certain order in
a certain case and you can use something
like this use map a rope person and you
just enter the map this no sorry let's
maybe no sorry now I think that will
kind of think it would work no it says
something with a screen size sorry with
the resolution I don't know so when I
use this name parameter thing exactly
the same thing happens notice the when I
print the map it will get printed in the
same order first name will be first and
that's the order that it was created in
the in the it was defined
so if you want to do some abstraction
you wanna create some interface and this
equates my protocol called nameable and
has one method get' name and takes one
argument and that is the object I won't
do this on then I define a record person
same thing as before and I on the line
below i write nameable and i implement
the get named method simply by
concatenating first name and last name
then I call it name on a newly created
person and as expected we get the full
name what I can also do with records is
I can do it the other way around I can
because in this case I have to have to
define how the gift name is implemented
while I declare the person class instead
I can do something like this i define
the person and then I do something
called extend protocol and I implement
the name of a protocol on the person and
the difference in this case is i I don't
I have to use the dot first name on this
object to access the data inside the
person and then I can call it the same
way as I did before with the same result
this is actually quite convenient to be
able to add interfaces to classes that
you already have created very useful if
you want to model modular lies the
system and create separate things it's
very useful
what's going on under the hood here is
that if i change the get name to adopt
gate name that means I'm actually
calling the get name method on the
object I get the same result however if
I do that in the second case i will get
an error because there is no get name
method on the person class so the dot
notation is actually calling the java
method on the only class and that's not
available using extent protocol by it
works fine as long as you're in
enclosure land so what about the ides
well there are plenty of ids and
personally I use eclipse
counterclockwise but there are not
otherwise otherwise as well there is
also an emacs is the hardcore version
and mostly developers use that i like
eclipse i think it it's really nice it's
it's a wire about the parenthesis and
you can navigate easily with the
parenthesis and it has some some basic
you typing suggestions when you a minute
when it sees a symbol it can help you
type that symbol again really fast and I
mean you're still inside the Eclipse
environments everything you used to in
Eclipse works the same way
another ID that's quite cool is
something called light table and that's
written for closure but it also works
for JavaScript I don't know if you can
see hope you can see some of it at least
what's going on here is that I'm using
the feature called insta ripple and I'm
calling the Foo method with an argument
world and you can see that when the food
method is defined there is a world
argument appearing and you can see that
argument following down along the
structure of that method so this sort of
allows you to quickly see evaluations of
your programs while you're editing them
and as I said it works also for
JavaScript which can be interesting in I
guess and the resource of sublime text
mate and also claw closure artifacts or
publish to maven central and you can use
maven when you build but there is also a
special paper called close yours and to
close yours they're on the artifacts
that are specific for closure that are
not intended to be used by other
languages they are published to the
closures for example if you have some
let's say specific clothes your specific
API for talking to a database that's put
into closures and you can use you can
use maven you can use cradle and of
course every language need to have their
own bill to write so closure is no
different it has their own built-in
called lining in personally I don't like
you I would like to use maven but lining
in is so much more capable and faster so
i use it because it's because of that
reason
cason the next thing is dynamic typing
so how many of you like XML a few how
many of you prefer a JSON instead of XML
oh that's all of you but the thing is
XML if you want you can have a schema
validation in XML but Jason that's a
dynamic language there is no schemas for
Jason so why are you preferring static
typing when it comes to java what is
done any typing I saw a really good
presentation about from a guy called
Robert small shower he talked about the
unreasonable effectiveness of dynamic
typing for practical programs it's
something I really if you interested in
this you should take a look at that so
the statically typed language you have
to specify the type signatures for the
variables and everywhere in your program
in a dynamic language you don't have to
specify that so if for example this base
iterator you have to specify that it's
in c++ in this case it probably will
look the same in similar in Java I guess
so for when you're used to static typing
you really think it's kind of scary
because you get so much help from your
IDE from your tool and what about
performance won't this be suffering I
was really skeptical to to a static IP
night and I the thing that made me
change my mind was this project I was
working on and we had we worked this web
service that talked to a Mongo database
and we also used elastic search for
queries and we had this JSON API which
our web application and/or the devices
were talking to you and everywhere at
this point we had to do some conversion
between the static Java world and the
dynamic outside and I mean that's fine
for for Jason there is good tools to
create a Jason of a MongoDB there is
good mapping mappings available but at
the time there was no mapping available
for elastic search so of course we wrote
around and along the project when the
project gets cut along the way they
brought in some junior programmers to
the project and the problem they had was
that they had to understand both the
statically typed Java world and the
dynamic typed elasticsearch world and
since they didn't really understood that
there was a difference they focused only
on the yaw world and that led to that it
they didn't understand what was going on
in elastic search or in-home would it be
for that matter so I actually think in
this case it would have been better to
expose the fact that the this data
sources were dynamic instead of wrapping
those in in complex yellow code at least
this made me think do it do I really
need to have static typing in the center
there if everything else is dynamic
what I think is the closure makes
working with the dynamic typing it makes
that okay and the reason it makes it
okay is the fact that you have this
repler you right things in the right
button you execute them in the red bull
that means you test them before we write
them into your source files you also
have these immutable data structures
everything you write every data
structure is immutable so there is
nobody that can sort of change the stuff
that when you're not looking and you
also have a strong focus on using pure
functions a pure function is a function
that doesn't have any side effects
essentially it takes some data and
return some data and nothing else and of
course you have some automated tests but
i think the the things above are more
important by having a rep out by having
things immutable and by having pure
functions you know that the things
aren't going to break under you below
your feet so today so what about
performance closure is actually compiled
to bytecode so when the code is loaded
it gets compiled to bytecode and
generally that's fast enough what you
can do if you want to have more
performance is that you can because
sometimes there will be a reflection and
what you can do is you can add something
called tie pins like this so I say that
the X in the argument list is actually a
string and then when i call the dot
length method the compiler will know
that this is actually the length method
in the string class that will give you
some additional performance and if you
look at the i talked about prismatic
before and they have a lot of machine
learning going on and there is lots of
matrix multiplication and things like
that
and they do it all in closure so it is
fast there's also some studies that have
been performed comparing dynamic and
static typing this was also from urban
small chairs presentation so for example
there is two studies in one by Stefan
Annenberg and let's press alt and they
have shown that dynamically typed
languages are more productive and there
is no difference in lab reliability the
reason they are more productive is that
you don't have to think about the type
signature when you when you write a
statically typed program you have to
think what should what type do I need to
make the compiler work understand this
and anyone that have worked a bit with
Java generics probably know what I mean
yeah some laps there's I guess that's
true and and also robert has made an
investigation where he looked at the
github repos and checked the defects
that were reporting on the repos and
investigated what proportion how many of
them were actually caused by a type
error that could have been fixed by a
compiler and it turned out there was two
percent of the defects never fixed could
have been fixed by a compiler
so conclusion we had all these
complaints we had the fact that dynamic
typing was scary but as as as I showed
you by using this red bow having
immutable data structures and pure
functions and some automated tests sure
by doing that you can actually get it to
be usable and you have this fact that
Lisp looks kind of weird but it's
actually really consistent you have this
operator as the first thing and then you
have a number of operands is it just a
toy language I think it's a really
interesting language you have all the
IDS all the tooling you need you have
some advanced concept for expression
expressing your business logic in the
namespaces protocols and records there
are also many other things that I didn't
show you there are lazy sequences
software transactional memory and
there's functional programming of course
what about macros well maybe they are a
bit hard to accept that I believe but I
think they are really useful if you want
to create dean cells if you want to
create reuse in your programs and if you
want to have control over your structure
in your program I think macros are
really useful
if I've awakened your interest in
closure here are some rich resource you
can have a look at that I've read the
book called the joy of closure there are
many other books but is this one I like
it's quite advanced but I like to be
challenged so what I recommend it any
questions yes any libraries for HP
support yes there are a couple of
different alternatives there is
something called ring with which is sort
of a basic servlet equivalent and then
there is something called composure
which which adds layers on top of that
and then there is something called noir
which is sort of entire web framework
something like play framework is all
together but there are sort of there are
many alternatives sorry yes the the
higher level frameworks our MVC kinds
there are other kinds of that are
completely different from from MVC also
there are there many to choose from and
of course it is it is plain javis I mean
you can implement your own serve let's
see if you want to yes is it backwards
compatible yeah so Scylla isn't the
backward compatible at least it's not
byte code compatible and it's actually
the same problem with closure however
and since you distribute what you often
do is you distribute the source code
instead of distributing the binary files
do you avoid compiling the files and by
doing that you get backwards
compatibility you can't always do that
but sometimes most of the time you did
that and then it's backward compatible
any more questions
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
