DevOps cloud native Microsoft service
development workshop in this lab we're
gonna have you assume the role of John
Dunbar we're gonna use the brackets code
editor to tap into our micro services
that we created in the prior labs we're
gonna pull data from both micro services
and combine it into a central UI that
will be our next generation product
catalog
once our code is complete we will
configure the CI CD framework so it will
auto deploy and directly into the
application container cloud service so
with that let's get started
the first thing when John is going to do
is accept feature 4 to create the alpha
cat office product catalog ey he will
drag and drop it into the in progress
swim line like you see here next we're
gonna go up to our code tab and create a
new repository this repository will
house our UI code for the product
catalog itself now for the sake of time
we have gone out and created parts of
this code base for you and will provide
you the URL on our lab guide to import
this code it should import fairly
quickly and then once imported we'll be
all set to move over to our code editor
and once imported we go ahead and create
a new build job here we can see we're
gonna configure this build job for the
product catalog UI we don't have to
specify a Java JDK because we're using
nodejs in this case but we do have to
specify the git repository that we just
created so we'll go down and select that
we're gonna trigger based on SCM polling
under our build steps we're gonna go
ahead and execute a shell program which
will be NPN install and for post build
we're going to make sure we archive the
artifacts I'll go up and click Save at
the top and now we can build our run our
build on our baseline codebase this will
take a few minutes and for the sake of
time I did speed it up in the video but
once complete
what it should look like next we'll go
over to our deployment tab we're gonna
specify a new climate configuration for
our product catalog UI so we'll give it
some names there we go we're going to
use our cloud connection here and in our
password and just test it make sure
everything's still good specify node as
a runtime now we're gonna run do
automatic and select your build job we
just created select our code artifact
and last but not least we are going to
insert some parameters so the size of
this deployment is relatively small and
it'll be quick when you go to do it
click Save on our side there we go we'll
go ahead and start the deployment right
now that we're deployed we're gonna
click on the name office prattle catalog
UI and what you see here is a shell
we're gonna build the shell of the
framework and now we're gonna go into
brackets or our code editor and wire it
to our rest services so the first to do
that one of the things we want to do is
copy the address of our get URL so go
ahead and copy that and in a separate
window I'm gonna open up the brackets
code editor like you see right here and
we're gonna go ahead and clone this git
repository we will have to specify our
parameters for cloud passed word for a
cloud admin to give us in like
should import fairly quickly next we're
going to go back to our to poll
file and now we're gonna get the
baseline URLs of our arrest services so
first we're gonna reach out to the Java
Twitter micro service we'll copy that
link like you saw right there
it's deployed we're gonna go into the
Alpha office that J's file and this is
really where we're going to start our
wiring in our rest service so we'll
paste in our URL here and put in static
tweets at the end
right and then we'll go back and we're
going to do the same thing for our
product catalog rest service I'll paste
in this URL
we can save our changes and now we're
ready to go ahead and commit this back
up in Turkey repository so I'll press
commit and our message about what we
updated in the code now if you get this
prompt you can simply put in your cloud
admin username and any email will
suffice here so it's go ahead and put in
mine I will do a push
cloud there we go and with that we can
go back up and do our code changes so we
can look at the master branch in this
case and then go over to our arrest tab
and we can see that we updated the
master you can see our note and we could
drill in and take a look at the exact
changes in the JavaScript as well if we
want to do more importantly our build
job will auto execute you can see it
running right here we'll fast forward it
for you and our build has completed on
the product catalog UI next we can go
over to the deployment tab and we can
see our deployment will be running
they'll complete over the course of a
couple minutes and last but not least we
can open up our new product catalog you
are here's a look at our new UI pulling
data from both the product catalog as
well as Twitter and combined it into a
centralized user interface or
next-generation product catalog the last
thing we're gonna do is go back to our
you'll tab and make sure we mark this
particular activity is complete for a
project manager so we'll drag and drop
it into completed swimlane document how
many days it took us and hit okay now a
project manager at any time can look at
a burned-down report and see that
well this sprint is darn near complete
so in our next lab we'll show you how to
close everything out and take a look at
behind the scenes at some of the admin
tasks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
