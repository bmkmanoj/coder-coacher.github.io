about myself my name is holly Cummins I
work for IBM I've been with IBM for
quite a long time what I've been working
on most of my career in IBM is websphere
some some form of websphere what I've
been working on most recently is the
WebSphere in Liberty profile and I'm
always interested to ask how many of you
have heard of the Liberty profile lots
of you that's really good because the
Liberty profile awesome isn't it yeah
cool and yeah for those of you who
haven't heard of Liberty profile if you
think you know Webster but you haven't
used the Liberty profile you're in for a
really nice surprise it's it's
absolutely fantastic so I'm so proud of
what we've done with Liberty until about
two weeks ago I was the delivery lead
for liberty and I've just moved roles so
what I'm doing now is I'm working in the
bluemix garage now hands up how many of
you have heard of bluemix some hands so
bluemix is ibm's platform as a service
and so it gives you all the things that
you'd expect in a platform as a service
so you know you can take a war and you
can just do push it up to the cloud and
then it's there and it's accessible
which is good but the other thing that
it gives which is kind of unique to IBM
is all of the amazing IBM software as a
service so we have Watson as a service
and we have db2 is a service and we have
just loads of cognitive computing and
analytics and an incredible breadth of
portfolio but is all there as a service
which so that's kind of cool already and
what we do in the bluemix garage is even
cooler I think we we operate like a
start-up so even though we're part of
IBM we use agile methodologies we use
all these lean techniques we do design
thinking and we're we're situated
alongside startups as well so not only
do we operate like a start-up we
actually share space with startups and
so I'm based in the London garage and
we're in it incubator in Canary Wharf in
the financial district and there's also
a garage in San Francisco
go and they're down in galvanized in the
financial district so I'm going to go
visit them tomorrow and I think it
should be quite interesting to see how
they're set up and when I was delivery
lead for liberty automation was a big
part of my job description now that I'm
in the bluemix carriage you know there's
nothing in my job description that says
you're going to automate stuff but I
still do end up automating stuff and it
still is a big part of what I do and
similarly before I started as the
delivery lead I did a lot of automating
and you know I think it's really
important as a final note i have also
written a book it's not especially
relevant to automation but if you are
interested in enterprise osgi do you go
put it up and i had to put it on the
slides because even though it's not
directly relevant I've written the book
and that's really cool so I had to clock
the slides so I'm going to tell you a
lot of stories about things that I've
all mated some of them were really cool
and I'm really pleased with them and I'm
happy to tell people about them some of
them didn't work out so well and I'm so
you know but I'm still going to share
them but I'd love to hear your
automation confessions as well so i have
i have a hashtag and do tweet if you've
got things that worked really well or
things that didn't work quite so well
and I'd love to hear about them so hands
up who's ever automated something that
was most of the room which is good
because I think the only ones who
haven't raised their hands are asleep
already now hands up who's automated
something and it didn't go quite to plan
yeah that that's most of you as well so
I'm glad that I'm in good company so
automation is something that I've done
almost for as long as I've had a
computer I started University quite some
time ago and so back then we didn't have
broadband we didn't have anything like
that we had a dial-up into the
university network and so what we had to
do was your head to you got the little
modem software and you pushed a button
and then it did the dialing and then you
had to enter your username and then you
head into your password and this was
three whole steps which I thought was
frankly three whole steps too many thank
you very much and and I had a
back back before they were eunuchs and
so before they were cool and it had a
little thing that that wasn't designed
for automation and so it could record
your clicks and then it could replay
them and so I set this up to record the
the push button to do the dialer then to
record the entering the user name and
record the password there was a problem
with this which is that because it
relied on the phone line the timing of
when the other system would pick up the
phone was a little bit variable so
sometimes it would work great and
sometimes it would just print my
password and plain text for everyone
else in the room to see so that was my
first automation and also probably my
first automation where maybe I should
have thought it through a little bit
more carefully I mean a while later my
one of my first jobs in IBM and again
this is quite some time ago we were
using waterfall and we were really
really using waterfall and we were doing
waterfall very properly and that meant
we did a hundred page design documents
before we started doing any coding and
in these design documents we put
everything you could possibly want so we
put you know the high-level description
of what we were trying to achieve but we
also wrote down all of our interfaces
and we every single method every single
field we wrote that down in a document
and printed it out and share it around
with each other and we had all the uml
diagrams and I mean there's there's a
lot of things that are wrong with this
process and I think probably most of you
can list them off the major thing that
was wrong with it was that by the time
we finished the hundred page design
document the design had already changed
so i started implementing something
based on someone else's specification
while they were implementing it
different specification and so that was
one thing that was wrong with it but the
other thing that was that that was wrong
with it was it was an incredible amount
of work and it was incredible amount of
wasted work as well so we were taking
this description of what the code would
be and then we were transcribing it into
code and then it would change then we'd
have to do this this round trip and I
wasn't the only one who thought this was
pretty wasteful so that there were some
tools of available to do that do that
round tripping but i was using linux
these tools only ran on windows so i
thought rather than coming up with a
pragmatic solution i'm going to write my
own version of these tools to do the
round tripping and i should have thought
it through really because the the tool
that did the round tripping was Cole
rational soda I'm quite sure it's not
around anymore mostly because waterfall
isn't around anymore so it doesn't
really make sense and you know this was
I don't know how much we sold it for but
I'm sure it wasn't a tiny amount of
money and I thought while I'm doing all
of this development and design I could
also re-implement rational soda using I
think I used SVG and I used latex and I
you know I used all this sort of Linux
specific stack and I ended up spending
most of my time trying to make my
pictures that I'd rendered in SVG from
my code look pretty rather than thinking
about what was actually the best way to
solve the technical problem that I was
supposed to be solving which was a
configuration problem and i find that
automation sometimes it makes me popular
with people and sometimes it makes me
less popular with people so we have a
daily stand-up and we have a scrum and
inevitably what will happen is that
someone else in the team will say i'm
doing such and such and i'll say can
that be automated and sometimes the
answer is yeah that's a really good idea
i hadn't thought of that and sometimes
the answer is no just stop talking about
automation i don't care i'm just gonna
do it just just just go away and leave
me to do it so I it has made me
unpopular but on the other hand
sometimes it it's had a more complicated
effect we use lots of open source in IBM
we love open source but but one of the
things we we bring to it is when we sell
a product our customers expect that
we're going to be able to service that
product in a year we're going to be able
to serve it to that product in two years
we're gonna be able to service that
product in five years seven years a long
time and you can't necessarily guarantee
that things that you just got from
somewhere out on the internet are still
going to be there who else had the
experience of having something that it
was in the maven repository and then the
next time you tried to use it it wasn't
in the maven repository anymore and you
were yeah so what we've had that
experience and you know if we're going
to service the product we really need
access to the source code so we used to
have this process where when we would
reconsider open source it was about ten
steps again so we'd we'd tag it in the
open source then we download the source
and then we'd build it locally and then
we put
zip and then we put a zip on a on a file
server somewhere and then we take a link
from that and we put it somewhere else
and it it meant that we did everything
we could to avoid having to do a rican
seam of the open source and we'd batch
it up for ages and then we'd be out of
sync with open source because it was so
painful to reconsider it got it got
round it was my turn to reconsider the
open source so I looked at this and I
said this is hard work I'm not going to
do that I can do something better so I I
spent a while and I came up with a
solution so that it was all automated
and you just had to change you know one
or two characters and then we move up to
the next level of the open source and I
was really pleased with this and I went
to my team lead who was called Alistair
and I said look look look this is
amazing look how cool is this I've saved
us all this time and I thought he was
gonna say yeah that's really good Holly
you're awesome and instead he said I
give you all the worst jobs and I
thought oh that's not a very nice reward
for this cool thing I've done so of
course I said what why do you give me
the worst jobs that someone's there but
he said I know you'll automate them by
giving me this horrible job it meant
that I'd made the horrible job go away
and the rest of the team benefited so do
be careful how you how you tell people
that you automate things so i talked
about how much i like automation but of
course it's definitely not just me who
likes automation you know there's been a
lot of talks on automation here and as a
species we've been doing this for a long
time so i have put a disclaimer on which
is that human history has been slightly
simplified a timeline is not to scale do
not use this for your university history
exams because you will fail so does
anybody know what this is i think some I
can hear certain mumbling but i can't
i'm not sure if it's the right answer
this is a spinning jenny and this was
one of the first instruments of the
industrial revolution and what it did is
it took the work of spinning yarn
spinning wool into yarn and it used to
be that you know it was really
labor-intensive and one person would
would you know have to do one skein of
yarn but now with that it could do eight
people's work so it was a big big labor
saving
so that was in the seventeen hundreds
skipping ahead a little bit in the
1800's the washing machine was invented
and this again was a huge savings
because it took something that was
actually incredibly difficult which was
washing clothes because clothes are
heavy when they're wet and there's a lot
of them and they you need to do quite
aggressive things to clean clothes so
that that again was a huge saving i
should say again as well just in case
you take this to a history exam i don't
think the washing machine in 1858 looked
quite like that but that that's what i
think of as washing machines so skipping
on further we have the first computer in
1941 and then skipping on further we
have anybody anybody want to guess what
yeah exactly so around 2012 we started
talking about chef and when I when I
started talking about automation you
know again it was around 2012 and we
were all talking about chef and we
thought chef was the greatest thing
since sliced bread we've moved on of
course as technologists do so now we're
all talking about docker and we think
doctor is the greatest thing since
sliced bread the principle is similar i
think so you know we really are
automating more and more of what we do
so this is awesome right things are
getting better and better better we're
living the dream everything is perfect
maybe not not not quite so this I think
this will probably be familiar to a lot
of you this is a picture of my kid and I
don't know if you can tell but those are
all exactly the same picture there's
about ten copies of that same picture
and we've had something go a little bit
wrong with our household system for how
we manage the photos and they kept
getting reemployed so every photo we
have three copies of and then we have a
problem with the camera where sometimes
it just goes on to burst mode and we
can't take it off burst mode and then we
get about 10 or 20 copies of the picture
and and again this this isn't just me
because I um I was with Crispin
Richardson yesterday and he was taking a
photo of an amazing view and he went
click and it went click click click
click click click click click 24 times
and you could just see him going oh look
as he knew that he was going to have to
out 23 photos and you know this is a
tedious job and this is a job that our
parents just did not have our parents
never had to say wow I need to go
through 500 photos and eliminate all of
the triplicate copies you know it was
just something that a problem we have
that they didn't have and technology has
actually made our lives worse in this so
why would why would we automate well
really I think the fundamental reason is
that we automate because we are lazy
hands up who's lazy so as I've said that
you know I've been around with IBM for a
while and I have learned some pieces of
career advice so this is me being lazy
and this is my manager looking rather
grumpy at annual assessment time when I
said I have successfully been incredibly
lazy this year I've found that my
performance reviews when i when i
express it like that not so good so
instead the thing to say is to say i
have made our processes more sustainable
that good performance reviews so you
really you know even though we know in
our heart of hearts we're automating
kids were lazy when we talk to other
people who control our salaries we say
i'm making our process more sustainable
and more efficient so fun mmm
repeatability absolutely absolutely as
well so my first automation principle is
if it's boring automated one example of
this which I think probably a lot of you
will have thought of is server farms so
how many people know where I'm going
with that the UM the expression is treat
your servers like cattle not like pets
so really if you have named special
servers and their configuration is
unique that's going to be a real problem
what you want to have is servers that
you just sort of go oh yeah
over there they're all the same whatever
this is useful when you have just one
server but it's really really important
when you have a lot of servers so with
websphere Liberty we run a lot of tests
and we have a lot of developers
contributing and so in order to support
all that we have a server farm of about
500 servers and so we really need them
to be absolutely repeatable we're not
one hundred percent there but it really
hurts us the ways that we're not there
because what you don't want is you don't
want these little snowflake servers and
you don't want a situation where if a
server has a problem it takes a lot of
effort to get it back you want it to go
away and then come back and not even
really to be bothered about it and part
of the reason this is important for us
in WebSphere is a question of scale
we've got about 500 servers so we we
don't want to be spending our time
maintaining and handcrafting these
servers we just want them to to be
something that we can push a button and
it sorted there's a corollary to this as
well so I don't know if any of you were
in Martin Verburg stop yesterday no one
of the things he was talking about is he
was talking about his startup and he was
saying that there's only about one and a
half of them and so they absolutely have
to automate everything because there's
so few of them that they have to
automate so you can sort of basically
you can't win when it comes to
automation or you can't lose because if
there's a lot of you you've gotta
automate because it's really important
because there's a lot of you if there's
a few of you you've got to automate
because it's really important because
there's only a few of you so basically
you you've gotta automate but but
deciding what to automate and what not
to automate I think it can be tricky
I've definitely got it wrong a lot of
times so this is this is my second
principle which is that the first time
you do a task just do it even if it's
boring realistically just do it the
second time you do it take notes then
the third time you do it you're really
well positioned to be able to automate
that task so that you don't have to do
it the first time the fifth time
time and so on there's there's another
reason to automate which is if you care
about it automate and so this is if you
take one thing away do I think this is
the most important principle which is if
it's something you care about it's
really important to get that automation
in place and there's two reasons for
this the first is if you if you care
about it you want it to happen if you
want it to happen automation is
absolutely the most reliable way of
making sure that something happens an
example from our product development is
we had a process so we had a continuous
integration and we had a build and
people ran sandbox bills before
integrating of course but accidents
happened inevitably so sometimes a bad
change would get integrated into the
stream and our policy was when the bill
breaks gets delivered it gets backed out
of the stream no questions asked then
then we fix it while it's out of the
stream unfortunately no one wanted to be
the person who did the effort to do the
back out and who got the bad karma and
you know the glares from the developer
whose changes got backed out and so the
net effect was that even though our
policy said it should get backed out
stuff didn't actually get backed out
which was unfortunate because then it
met the build web went red and then it
stayed red so the solution was to
automate so we put in place a tool that
we called Marvin so this is Marvin the
Paranoid Android from from Hitchhiker's
Guide and so what Marvin did was when
Marvin detected that the build went red
he just reverted back to the last good
snapshot and then and then the bill
break got fixed so this worked quite
well this brings me to another principle
which is if you have an automation and
it is got some significant code in it
which Marvin definitely did you know
that there's a lot of logic in there you
have to give it an adorable name so I
think the thought works one of their
pieces of automation is called Conan the
deployer which I really love and I'm IBM
Watson which is the cognitive computing
they when they're built sometimes you
know as builts do occasionally it will
get a process that gets left on a
machine and so the tool that they have
to clean up the Watson processes is
called Moriarty which I also think is
great so it's important give it an
adorable name so here's another example
of of caring about any of them carrying
about things our process was also you
know we were doing agilent's that we had
iterations and at the end of the
iteration we did a playback and we
everybody showed the stories that
they've completed to our stakeholders
but what we found happened was that some
people really love to the sound of their
own voice and their every iteration they
did a demo there was other people who
are doing these amazing stories but
because they didn't really have the
confidence or something or the
motivation to step up and say yeah look
at my amazing story their stuff was
never getting played back and all of
these stories were just slipping through
the cracks of the process so um I should
say as well this illustration it's
incredibly hard to demonstrate an end of
iteration demo that isn't happening so
that's what that's trying to be so you
can see there is no one there doing the
end of iteration demo so what we did is
we we put some automation in place and
so we use rational team concert for our
development and we put some plugins on
the server side so that every time
someone closed a story it created a task
for them that would say do the end of
iteration demo and then they could close
that off once they've done the demo so
in this case I've talked about
automating because we're lazy but in
this case actually laziness really
didn't come into it because it actually
made a lot more effort for us so the
outcome was better but the effort was
more and there's a few reasons for this
the first is that we had to put the
initial investment to write the plugin
and you know that that wasn't tiny and
then the people doing those stories
every iteration they had to close the
demo task so that was a bit more
paperwork for them as well and then they
had to do the demo so that was a bit
more effort
for them as well and then for the rest
of us as well we had to listen to all
the demos and so that was good because
we wanted to know about them but it did
mean that our end of iteration meeting
took longer than they had before but the
net effect was that we did get these
stories happening so we were pretty
happy with it so you can see that that
is the end of iteration demo which is
happening there's another side to caring
so one one thing is that you care that
it happens at all another what aspect is
that you care that it's done right
because there's a lot of things that are
really quite hard but sometimes they're
kind of easy for computers so we're
really big believers in linting so with
with java you get a lot of compile time
checking out front you know the compiler
won't let you do very very crazy things
but there are still a whole class of
stupid things that you can do that a
code reviewer might not catch but that
fine bikes will catch we also do some
development in other languages like
JavaScript and in JavaScript unless you
have your development process set up
right it is so easy to shoot yourself in
the foot you can do all sorts of things
and you'll never find out until some
time later at runtime so you know you
can misspelled variable names and that's
okay so I really strongly encourage you
to if you haven't got it into your
development process already add in
either something like fine bugs if
you're doing Java or a linting tool if
if you're doing JavaScript you know
either something like j/s lint or maybe
even something like typescript
another another area where people can do
the job but for a person to do the job
as accurately as needed is hard is
deployment so deployments one of those
things that you know it should be so
easy right because all you have to do is
you have to take your deliverable and
you just have to put it to where your
deliverable supposed to go and what
could possibly go wrong well somehow
there always is one step that goes wrong
so I with liberty we we release beaters
once a month and we release a ga level
once every three months and so that
means that there's a lot of deployments
and we've got it mostly automated but we
haven't got it entirely automated so
that's one of the things that we need to
still work on and with our mostly
automated process we have found that
we've made mistakes so once we managed
to release the wrong version which was a
little bit embarrassing it was only
about a week wrong but still that was
kind of awkward so we had to sort of
hastily go back and say on that that
version that we released that that
wasn't quite the right version and you
know we had to hope that well I mean the
differences weren't significant it was
just you know the numbering in the
license but still it was embarrassing so
with these kinds of things where it's
really important and it's really easy to
get wrong automation definitely the way
forward so that's one of the things on
our to-do list is to make sure that this
never happens again and never
accidentally release the wrong version
there's there's another read there's all
these really good you know business
reasons to automate and and there's the
laziness as well but there's another one
which i think is pretty important to a
lot of us and this automation is
actually really fun a lot of these
problems are there interesting problems
that are challenging problems and the
things we can do are quite powerful and
quite cool and I think that's why
sometimes I found myself doing things
like writing a design document
generation tool rather than actually
doing the design because it was a lot
more fun than
then writing out this really elaborate
design document was but there are good
reasons to not automate as well so that
this is my colleague Ross and and he
said to me I get so mad at how much time
I could save if I only had the time to
write the automation to save me the time
but there's this bootstrapping problem
so there you see Ross's bootstraps and
and it's this paradox of automation that
you know we know it's going to save us
time but we can't quite find the time to
get there and an example of that for
example as our deployment story where we
know we have more we need to do but
we've just got a backlog and it's not
quite at the top of the backlog yet and
and sometimes automation can be hard as
well so we had a problem where we have
our Eclipse class pass and we found that
we had duplicated libraries and they
needed needed straightening up and so
this was just in case of editing a text
file fine but there was there's a few of
them to do so I thought well no problem
i'm gonna i'm going to automate this and
doing search and replace across a bunch
of text files as one of those problems
that should be incredibly easy and i
always find quite hard so at one point I
had written a whole said library to do
it for me because in order to get the
files in the right place and then get
them written back out to the right place
it needed scripts but then I I had a
computer failure and I lost all of this
script so that that was the end of those
scripts you can also do is find and then
you pipe it through exact but then you
need to go to Google to get the right
syntax because frankly I can never
remember that syntax so then you can do
said you can write your own wrappers
around said you can probably do it with
pearl but you know either way it ends up
being a big investment you spend half a
day on Google in order to do something
that was just editing a file so as it is
perhaps not worth it so the situation we
had with these class pass is I looked
and I said oh I can't do this by with an
automation it's going to be too hard and
I you know I'm a team leader and so I
have a team and so I looked at one of
the new graduates in our team and I said
Kate why don't you do this job manually
rather than me automating it and I still
feel really bad about that because poor
Kate had to fix 26 class pass and it was
not a very enjoyable afternoon for her
and I think I still think perhaps I
should have tried harder to automate it
but I tried a little bit and I couldn't
so that there's an epilogue to this
story as well which is sometime after I
realized that this is the magic command
that will do a batch searching replace
in a group of files even always this
though it's not so easy because I did
this and I used it and it was really
great and I thought okay I'm going to
put this in the slides because I want to
share this with the world because it's
awesome and I also want to make sure
that I can find it for myself again
because it's awesome and I spent another
half a day on Google looking for this
solution that I had already found but it
wasn't floating to the top of the Google
search results which is just weird
because it's what is right and it's
useful why isn't but who knows so it is
now in the slides forever so I think
with a lot of things XKCD just gets it
absolutely right so this is the xkcd on
automation and i found this slide
because one of my colleagues had it on
their wall and i saw it and I don't know
if you can read the text but it says I
spend a lot of time on this task I
should write a program automating it and
the theory is that you stop working on
the original task and spend a little
time writing the automation the
automation takes over and then you have
loads of free time the reality is you
write the code for the automation and
then you do debugging and then you do
rethinking and then you do ongoing
development and the original task that
you are trying to automate has just
completely fallen by the wayside and it
doesn't get any time anymore and I saw
this on his wall and I just thought oh
no this is the last 15 years of my life
that's just been reduced to this one
tiny little XKCD panel and it was
pretty much a hundred percent accurate
which is quite depressing because I
think we have this this dream that what
we're going to do is we're going to
automate stuff and you know we're going
to spend our time on holiday because the
little automation automaton has just
taken over everything but the reality is
that we end up supporting this thing and
actually working harder than we did
before we even wrote the automation so
before starting with automation you
really need to think about support and
you need to think about robustness as
well so here's here's a recent painful
memory which is again because because
you know we have really strict and
strong serviceability guarantees to our
customers we need to make sure that
everything that goes in the code base
isn't going to cost regressions and that
kind of thing and we wanted to make sure
that the the checklists that we do for
this were every developer side and it
was automated and that as much as
possible of the checklist like have you
changed this have you changed any of the
translations that kind of thing as much
of possible that was done automatically
so we said great what we'll do is we'll
write this tool and it will have a GUI
front end and then it will have a back
end that looks at all the changes and
works out what questions we need to ask
the developer to make sure that this is
all going to be completely okay so that
time by the way I don't know if you
recognize it it's rosie from the made
from the Jetsons so that that's where it
came from and so that this theory was
that we were going to spend a little bit
of time writing this tool as we did this
process transformation and then it was
all going to be fine the reality was
that Rosie just absolutely ended up
taking pretty much all of my time all of
another developers time then we drafted
in a third developer in all of us we're
just working pretty much 24 7 we were
doing round-the-clock support for Rosie
and it was it was not good and it was
not how it was supposed to go so it was
a I think it was the right thing to do
but I don't think any of us anticipated
when we came up with this initial plan
quite how expensive it was going to be
to do this tool
so this brings me back again to the
principle of giving your your massive
automations adorable names because when
I when I came into work in the morning
you know that was bleary-eyed because
I'd been up till two in the morning
trying to help people you know with this
tool I could just say to my manager yeah
I've been working on Rosie again and
they knew what I met whereas if I'd said
I'm working on the serviceability
automation checklist tool I don't think
it would have had quite the same same
level of meeting so again you know
before you go into an automation you
really have to her after asked well who
can maintain this is it just me who can
manage it how much is this going to cost
in terms of the developer resources and
is this going to be robust am I going to
have an ongoing serviceability cost for
this thing if if the environment changes
and again during automation you have to
check point so I found my manager said
to me well when are you going to be done
with Rosie and I realized I had no idea
because it just seemed like this work
that was going to be stretching for for
the rest of my career as I was going to
be working on Rosie so you really need
to think well at what point do I say yep
this is good enough I'm going to stop
working on this so you need to have
strong completion criteria and you need
to think well is this actually still
worth it you know my still saving time
or have I just created a big nightmare
here so another automation principle
don't go insane you need to keep your
sense of perspective and remember what
you're trying to achieve instead of
getting consumed in the in the great big
automation vortex and there's another
thing to think about with with
maintainability as well which is the bus
so if you write this amazing automation
and you think you're a genius and no one
else in your team has any understanding
of it that's not so good when you get
run over by the bus and the rest of the
team has to maintain it
so carrying on with reasons not to
automate there is there are quite a few
unfortunately there's an issue about
whether whether things should be
automated or whether they should be
changed because computers allow us to do
dumb things with ever greater speed and
then when we automate it we can do dumb
things even faster but that doesn't mean
it's a good idea if the things we're
doing are actually done so we had a
recent example of this with because we
um when defects come into our system we
do initial screening and we set a
priority and we say well is this assured
occurred or a must and inevitably at
these meetings at the end we would say
this is assured this is assured this is
a shirt as it was the most boring
meeting and so someone had the bright
idea I know why don't we write a plug-in
so that it automatically assigns the
priority for all of these defects to
shoot and then the question is if the
priority field is so meaningless that
every single defect in our system has
the priority should maybe we should just
delete the field rather than doing extra
tooling to set this field that we'd
never ever care about that has no
meaning so definitely do when when
you're confronted with something in your
organization which is an adding value
before automating it away see if you can
just get rid of it entirely and there's
another reason not to automate which is
that computers don't always get things
right so I think we've all gone lots of
examples of where a computer just got
something terribly terribly wrong and
there's a lovely example on youtube if
you google for feeding robot you can see
they um they designed a robot and the
intention was that it would feed people
who are unable to feed themselves so I
had this robotic arm and they were
testing it so they had a mannequin and
luckily it was a mannequin because what
happened was the robot head you know
that the thing in its hand and it went
to the mannequin and it tried to put the
thing in the mannequins matter
but it got the direction and the speed a
little bit rods instead of wet like that
and then it went like that to try again
and then it went like that so again
luckily it was a mannequin and you know
luckily it was just the testing but it
was in a case where automation was not a
good idea in any way because the problem
was too challenging for a for a computer
and we have this with our build
monitoring a lot you know we've got a
lot of bills and things do go wrong so
we need to go through them figure out
what went wrong fix it if we can raise
defects and that's it's kind of a
tedious job some of it but we we've
never admitted it because twenty percent
of that job is really really important
it needs a lot of insight and a lot of
human intuition that a computer just
couldn't provide and so we do end up
doing this job manually because we think
we don't we don't trust a computer to do
the right thing for this so there's a
bit of an elephant in the room which is
that I'm doing a talk on automation and
how many of you were expecting me to
have mentioned DevOps by now a few of
you probably the other five have all
left so I'm interested by that because
now you know when we talk about DevOps
we talk about automation and often you
know when we talk about automation we
talk about DevOps and i think that the
two are related but they're not the same
and they do have a life independent of
each other so i was interested by this
because the um we just the other day
announce the the bluemix garage method
and the URL for this it's quite faint
but that the URL is www mcom / devops /
method and i was interested by this
because what you know what we do in the
bluemix carriage some of it is DevOps
but a huge amount of it isn't DevOps you
know so you can see it's stuff like me
and started our badger development
design thinking and that's nothing to do
with DevOps but the the URL we chose was
DevOps and I think that's partly because
dev ops is now coming to mean so many
things to so many people in it and it
means a lot of different things and it
almost means everything as well so
whatever you want it to mean it
can mean so I wanted to try and crisp
the definition up a bit because of it I
think it does matter in this area so
that the old way that we did software
development was that we had a team of
people and another team of people and we
had a great big wall between them and we
had the group of people on the left and
there are the people who broke stuff
let's call them developers and then we
had the group of people on the right and
they were the ones who dealt with the
consequences and we can call them the
ops team and really you know there's
this absolute division between them and
the developers were pretty happy right
because we were doing stuff we were
breaking it whatever there was no
consequences for us the ops team were
less happy because we threw our broken
stuff over the wall to them and then it
broke and usually it broke at two in the
morning as well so I couldn't figure out
how to distinguish between two in the
afternoon which is a totally civilized
time to be fixing something and two in
the morning which is a really uncool
time to be fixing stuff but you know
that this relationship was so unhealthy
because we weren't learning from our
mistakes because our mistakes never came
to bite us at two in the morning and the
ops team well they had lots of learning
but they had no actions that they could
take either because they just kept
fixing the same problem over and over so
this is pretty bad so the new way is
that we get rid of the wall and we merge
the two groups of people and we call
them the dev ops team and the same
people either people I think this is a
really important principle of DevOps
that the people who are breaking things
are the people who end up dealing with
the consequences and one of the really
good effects of this is that if you know
it's you that's going to get the call
out at two in the morning you find
suddenly your interest in code quality
is a lot higher than it was before oh
this is what I think why DevOps is
successful and that there's another
reason why companies like DevOps which
is that often actually instead of having
the two teams merged into one great big
team you actually just kind of get rid
of the ops department so I that's maybe
less positive for them but but it
it's efficient and it means that the
quality is higher the ongoing cost is
lower so that the the reason we can get
rid of the whole ops department really
the thing that enables that is
automation so in order to be able to
have a group of people who are doing
stuff and get rid of that group of
people but have the stuff continue you
know it's got to be automation and it's
got to be a hundred percent automation
as well so that's kind of I think we're
automation fits into DevOps is that
automation is the underpinning that
enables that bigger DevOps culture so
there's a there's things as well that
DevOps is not getting you know it's a
pretty overloaded term so DevOps is not
a job title and DevOps extra extra is
not a new job title for the people in
the IT department if that's how DevOps
is is you know for you then then you're
doing it wrong basically this is a true
story I was working on these slides and
I was sat on the train and someone about
to I had a slide and it was an empty
sliding that said DevOps and some 12 and
the aisle over said to me oh are you
working on dev ops and I said yes and he
said right that's great because my firm
is hiring DevOps people so he's
basically almost offered me a job on the
train and he's added me to LinkedIn and
now his colleagues have all added me to
LinkedIn and I didn't have the heart to
say because it was the middle of the day
and I'll train that again you know I
think if you're going out in your hiring
DevOps people then maybe your idea of
what DevOps is isn't quite right because
DevOps shouldn't be some new people that
you bring into the team DevOps should be
what the existing people in the team are
doing differently in order to get the
responsibility and the consequences
closer together so but but as well you
know we're all talking about DevOps now
is absolutely the flavor of the moment
and these things do kind of go in cycles
so I wonder if in three years or four
years you know we're all going to say
our DevOps haha foolish how we were
hummus guided we
we're not going to do that anymore what
a mistake and if we do that I really
don't want us to throw the automation
baby out with the DevOps back of water
because I think automation is bigger
than just gave up sore you know DevOps
brand so I'd like to give now some some
more practical tips on how to automate
and tools that you can use to automate
but of course before I can do that you
know automation it's a big thing so how
you're on mate depends on what you're
going to automate so going back to
DevOps the first thing that probably a
lot of people will think of is the
delivery pipeline so that hopefully is
this familiar to to everybody yeah nods
nods but no hands so I think the
delivery pipeline again it's one of
those things that's easier to say than
to do but you know it is absolutely
important so you know you should have it
fully automated from you do your coding
you push it into source control it gets
tested it goes live without without
manual intervention or if you do feel a
little bit too scared and you want the
manual intervention it should just be an
approval button rather than actual steps
and so again you know this is definitely
very much in the category of DevOps
there's other things we can automate so
your your infrastructure should be code
you know that's that's a really
important principle if if you depend on
it it should be code and again me that
this is very much still DevOps and
there's a bunch of things in this area
so stuff like machine configuration
servers test environments all of those
really you want to make sure that their
source controlled and that the effort to
get from source control to an actual
physical stood up system is as small as
possible so going a little bit more away
from DevOps you can automate tests
there's a qualifier here which is that
you can automate trivial tests so things
like getters and setters making sure
they don't explode making sure that what
you set actually is what you get
you can do this i have to say we don't
do this in my team we found the value of
it wasn't quite big enough and and i
think there's a risk here as well
because if you do this and you do it
wrong you do this and then you say look
I've got a hundred percent test coverage
our quality is perfect and you haven't
actually tested them more meaningful
things that needed a person to think
about so you may find value you may not
it depends a lot on on what you're doing
as well so this definitely though not
DevOps not DevOps in any way but still
automation another thing we automate is
that we take into source control while
we regenerate all of our dot settings
files for our Eclipse projects and we
put them all into source control and
they're all automatically generated and
one of the things that we have set to
true in these files is that every time
you save it does a bunch of save actions
one of which is formatting the source
code so this is really important I think
because you absolutely do not want to be
doing code reviews where you're just
trying to wade through a whole bunch of
formatting changes to figure out what
the meat of the change is and what's
even worse than that is when you get a
code review back and the reviewer says
are well I didn't really like your white
space on line 10 because that's not
adding value that that's really well
it's the opposite of value so that I
would absolutely encourage everyone to
do this and and some languages have had
decided to decide step the whole thing
so with go there's a command called go
for matter and the wonderful thing about
it is that it is not configurable you
cannot say actually I'd like this brace
style and I'd like my tabs and sort of
my white spaces and I really kind of
prefer two spaces here instead of the
default one because you know what it's
not that important it's not worth even
the effort of setting up the
configuration for it if you just take
the default you avoid a whole world of
pain which which is such a good thing
but formatting this is absolutely one of
the most controversial things you can
automate it it caused so many arguments
in our team of people who said well I
agree with the principle but I'd quite
like this project to have
from formatting settings than this
project because my tabs and my white
spaces are really important to me so if
you go down this road you may have a
battle but I think I think it's really
important that's what we do yet and I
think it just saves a whole bunch of
hassle when when you extract so the
question was if i do i recommend
checking in the settings files and I
would yeah if you can auto generate them
that's best if you can't do that then at
least check them in and then that means
that when people you know extract from
source control everything is good to go
and it's consistent and you don't end up
with churn which I think turn-turn is no
good for anybody so another thing you
can format is copyright statements so
this I think is probably the second most
controversial thing you can automate
different parts of IBM do it differently
and I think different teams have
different views there's one school of
thought that says a copyright statement
is an assertion that you really care
about the copyright on this code and so
if computer generates it for you that
shows that you didn't really care so
it's not valid I I'm not a lawyer I
don't know the you know the rights and
wrongs of it so this is one where I
think there's value from automating it
but not everyone says it's ok so I last
onto the tools so this is a really
incomplete list you know this it's a big
area but I just want to give some some
pointers that that may be useful so this
is the the old school the oldie but
goodie shell scripts she'll see you can
get such a long way with shell scripts
where she'll scripts maybe don't go
quite far enough then you can go to the
other really old-school unix tools like
said and they can do pretty powerful
things if you want to be you know a
little bit more modern and down with the
kids you know you can do script them the
newer scripting languages you know like
Python and Ruby
um the in yesterday's talk mar tang he
was saying that that the problem with a
lot of these automation tools was that
they were written in Ruby say maybe you
don't want to do Ruby but but really has
its uses so if you want to be you know
even even more modern you know you can
use something like Jenkins so hopefully
you're using that for your continuous
integration it's very good at
orchestrating processes down a pipeline
we use rational team concert we
absolutely love rational team concert it
does a lot for us if you if you want to
get even even more modern you can use
stuff like chef you can use puppet in
the bluemix Garrett for one of the tools
we use is called sprout wrap I hadn't
heard of it before I moved to the garage
but it's quite cool because we've we do
one hundred percent pair programming and
we've got pairing stations and we've got
about four of them and if you're doing
one hundred percent pair programming and
your rotating your pairs then you need
to make sure that the machine you're
using that's no longer your personal
machine with your idiosyncratic settings
that's a machine that you're not going
to be using tomorrow and so you need to
make sure that the configuration of
every single one of those machines is
identical or you're going to be wasting
a lot of time in the morning going over
where is this and why is this and you
know this is the wrong shell and that
kind of thing so what's sprout wrap
we've got it set up so that all of our
configuration for the machines is code
it's all it's all checked in to source
control and we have a cron job that runs
and it just splats it out and it makes
sure that every single machine is
identical and there's no surprises
another advantage of this setup is I
think with continuous integration we all
know it's a good idea but there's a
little bit of a tendency to say oh well
this isn't quite ready to share with the
team so I'm just going to work on it for
a little bit longer and then three
months down the line you're still
working on it for a little bit longer to
make sure it's ready but when you rotate
machines every day that's an absolute
deadline you know no matter how unready
it is it better be ready by the end of
the day because it's that's not going to
be your machine the next day
so that that's another way of enforcing
continuous integration of course now
docker you know darker solve so many of
these problems and it means you really
do have something that you can just
bring up you know stand up in it and it
does what you want so that's quite cool
and again you know VMware in vagrant
images also you know important and
useful in this space if not quite as
accessible as docker and with a lot of
these tools you know things like chef
and puppet there is a bit of a learning
curve but it you can get a lot of the
benefits without going that elaborate
you don't have to necessarily know
invest a lot of skill and invest a lot
of time so our our IT team they have a
call out and if they get a call out at
three in the morning they don't want to
be to spending time setting up their
tools they need to have everything they
need accessible to them and I think they
probably consider something like setting
up a virtual machine but in the end they
said you know what at three in the
morning you don't want to be dealing
with a virtual machine what you want is
you want the laptop so they have the bat
laptop and basically whoever is on call
gets the laptop and it means you know
it's not high-tech it's low-tech but it
solves the problem and it means that
they don't have to be worrying about
access or IDs or anything they've just
got the machine there so the fanciest
solution isn't necessarily the best
solution for the job in terms of tools
of course we're an ant shop we really
like out and I should clarify that as
well but that's an ant not a reindeer
but if you do what it's rearranged if
there is buck build which is you know a
new build tool which is a reindeer see
well not that that looks like well what
will leave aside the question of what
that looks like because probably I'm the
only person in the room using aunt
anyway because everyone's moved on to
maven except that actually everyone has
now moved on past maven onto Gradle I
have a theory because it a lot of the
time when I talk to people about Gradle
they say yeah cuz grey tiles really
great because you can shell out to add
and I think hmm
so I have a theory that all roads lead
to aunt I think I'm probably the only
one with this theory but please don't
don't shatter my illusions but I think
it definitely is true that all roads
lead to Java so when you have these
tools you can get a lot out of the tool
but you can get so much more if you
invest in learning how to extend them so
either with the maven plugins or the
great or plugins or the ant tasks and
they allow you to solve problems that
that you couldn't have before and with
it with a pretty small investment really
so I it was a long time I'd been using
app for a long time before I wrote my
first task that was amazed that's like
this is so easy why had I always assumed
that I couldn't do this one actually you
know it it's not that bad so you the
other thing some teams do is is if
you're using eclipse you can distribute
plugins I other ideas and we'll have
similar extensibility mechanisms I would
be cautious with this one because when I
went when we've done this with teams
we've discovered we have a real
maintenance problem then because we find
that we make updates and we put in bug
fixes and then we need to get the
plug-in out to the whole team so the
plugin mechanism it's not very good for
something that you're going to be making
changes to and that maybe means it's you
know there's a bunch of problems that
it's not so good for so we try and avoid
it I maybe am a more modern way of doing
this is something like a UI tool that
people will go to or a web application
but I would say based on my recent
painful memory if u UI is involved the
cast will be way bigger than you think
it is so do proceed with caution
so finally thinking about rolling your
own I think you know a lot of what we do
is automation could be considered some
kind of rolling your own but you do have
to sort of stop and ask a question I
think well what's my motivation for
doing this is it really the case that my
problem is so unique that I need to
spend weeks and weeks developing a tool
because no one else has ever had this
problem before and if so maybe this
means that this isn't a really valuable
problem to be solving but of course if
we all followed not invented here
strictly then nothing would ever get
invented you know so sometimes you do
have to say yeah my problem is unique
and special I do have an amazing idea
and it is worth this investment so you
have to ask yourself the question but
the question may be yeah absolutely go
for it I know here we have the bit where
Polly put on the slides beware fun you
know which is just like the worst thing
to put on slides don't have fun but
again you know just think about your
motivation and if you're only motivation
for doing something is that it's fun
maybe there is something that's also fun
that's going to provide more value and
you know again finally you know don't
have fun but do have fun because and do
innovate because because that's a good
thing to be doing and so just to to
conclude I've talked about a lot of the
negatives of automation and a lot of the
times where we found that there was a
problem with it but you know there's so
many positives as well and I think we're
incredibly lucky to be in jobs where
we're allowed to do automation and not
only are we allowed to do automation
were actually encouraged to do
automation because being encouraged to
do automation means that we're also
actually being encouraged to be lazy
which is like yeah I'm down with having
a job where you know I'm rewarded for
being lazy and especially when that goes
along with having fun too so I think you
know we're in a good pretty good place
with where we are in the industry so
thank you very much
we've got about three minutes for
questions and I do have t-shirts as well
so I can answer some questions now and
then I'd love to talk to you afterwards
as well so Oh question up there yeah
yeah so I know urbancode deploy we use
it in my team I haven't personally used
it so I think the answer to that was yes
and no I i mean i can recommend it we we
do some kind of amazing things with it
in our team actually because we we test
our product on 140 platforms and when
you're doing testing a product 140
platforms you really need the automation
and so we use a record code to deploy
that high oh good question i think i
think that the marvin tool that we did
for backing changes out I really am
really attached to that one because it
had such a good effect on the code
quality and it really solved a problem
but I think some of my favorite
automations haven't necessarily been the
most successful ones because one of the
ones i had most fun doing was the wanted
to auto-generate the design documents
and you know that one just fell by the
wayside but I did really enjoy doing it
hi
I did yeah yeah it dumb that's why the
ants look like reindeers hyah yeah
that's a really good point the question
was about ongoing support and and I see
that now because I've moved teams and so
there's a team left who are who are
maintaining some of these automation so
that you know they're maintaining the
rosy tool and they're maintaining the
Marvin tool but I know that you know
some of the intricacies I know when they
don't and so there is a little bit of an
expense there so it's definitely I mean
I think this is probably true for all
code that we should try and resist being
really clever in a way that makes it
inaccessible to others because if we do
it right we're going to move on and
someone else is going to be maintaining
our code because hopefully we're going
to be doing cooler code and so we have
to make sure that we don't leave people
with something that's just completely
intractable and I think as well i think
i probably have left some pieces of
automation where I don't think it will
be maintained because I think I didn't
do a good enough job of making it
accessible to others or understandable
so you know there's a lesson learned
there so I think I should have been
firing out t-shirts actually but I got
sidetracked but if you asked a question
