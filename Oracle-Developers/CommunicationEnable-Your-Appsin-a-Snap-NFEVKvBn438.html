to talk a little bit about I think
something a bit different than what is
typical at these types of sessions but
one things that we're hearing in the
industry is I have these java
applications but I have this need to be
able to communication enable these
applications and i'm going to give three
use cases today so you'll see some real
examples of real world instances of the
challenges and what I hope to get across
is number one it's very real number two
it's very very easy and three java
developers don't have to be intimidated
by the fact that you don't have to
understand sip you don't have to
understand back-to-back user agent so
you don't have to write a lot of complex
protocols that this is incredibly simple
and trivial to put into your application
so when I talk about communication and
able applications you see it all the
time so as an example if you look at the
mobile phone on the left you know we
wouldn't know how to live nowadays if we
couldn't see in a phone number embedded
in an email or embedded in a web page
and be able to click to call right think
how irritating it would be to have to
switch back and forth between your phone
application and your dialer and say gee
here's this phone number I need to call
them I go to the browser a look at the
phone number I try to remember it I go
back to the dial pad etc we're very
spoiled because we just simply see the
phone number click on the phone number
and then it says call that's exactly
what i mean by communication and able an
application it just ought to be very
simple to take any java application and
be able to very quickly embed
communication right into that
application another example that you
don't see as often but we're going to
see an explosion in this side of the
world which is on web pages i would say
probably what five out of ten six out of
ten web
ages there's click to chat but how many
times do you actually see click to call
or click the video in that web page so
that you don't have to use a phone you
don't have to use another device to be
able to talk very cheap very high
quality now I'll show you some examples
of how easy it is to be able to do that
today whether that's JavaScript on the
desktop java servers on the back end but
that's another example of communication
enabling an application more and more we
see at avaya requirements for how do I
put phone how do i put chat how do i put
video inside of my application now one
of the problems if I said this is really
easy here's a very simple API you do the
rest of the work as a Java developer
then here's all the things you typically
have to think about how am I going to
make my application scalable it's one
thing to be able to audio video chat and
able an application but if you can't
make it scalable if you can't make it
highly available if you can't make it
virtualized then you know you're going
to say it was easy to communication
enable my application but difficult to
roll it out as a production application
well the good news is we've taken care
of all that so you don't have to worry
about scalability high availability
virtualization we've done that with a
back-end platform very very simple to
use so now is it not only easy to enable
your application but you can move from
development to deployment very very
quickly and that's unique in this
industry of communication in the past it
was complex ap is and then you do all
the work we simply enable the
application now it is a true
communication development platform that
you write small amounts of code and all
the heavy lifting is taken care of for
you I'll show you some great examples of
that so as developers our job is how do
we take these complex
excommunication type applications and
how do we very quickly get those two
production and in the past not many
applications were communication enabled
because it was just too hard to do you
had to learn sip you had to learn
various codex's and protocols and you
just go look that's not my
specialization my specialization is
writing applications just not the case
anymore so I'm going to take you through
three use cases and the idea is to
convince you that this really is easy
and you're going to see huge diversity
between these three use cases meaning
that these are going to be very
different use cases but each one of
these will show you what communication
enabling your application is about so
hopefully this will give you a broad
spectrum of what the possibilities are
so the first is going to be what I call
a customer journey so let's imagine that
we have a user who spends a lot of money
and they start by going to a website and
in this case it's the Gillian's website
where this customer is going to buy blue
jeans okay so very typical website now
if you notice in the bottom left-hand
corner this user anytime they want to
can just simply click on the icon and
they can be moved to audio or video with
the expert on the back end anytime they
want and this wasn't writing hundreds of
lines of code this wasn't writing tens
of lines of code this was like writing a
very very short number and this web page
was completely audio and video enabled
okay now that's just one small part of
it and typically that was complex and a
big hurdle now brain dead simple to go
just simply drop that into the web page
but there's some other things you have
to think about as well it's one thing to
click to call or click the video and
then talk to this expert through your
browser but it would be nice if that
expert on the other
in that knew all about blue jeans knew
something about you are you a good
customer are you a first time customer
are you on the web page about ordering
are you on the web page about returns so
some context about you so included in
this handful of lines of code you have
the ability to now pass all kinds of
context from your web page so you could
say that this is a customer who's
interested in buying new jeans and not
only that but they place a lot of orders
with us so they would be considered a
premium customer all of that information
can flow across as part of the request
to make a call or to make a video so
context is built right into it okay now
there's another challenge when that
consumer presses that simple button that
says I want an expert and I want a video
we have all kinds of experts at jillians
right and not only could this be within
a contact center but it could virtually
be any employee in the company what if
the best person to be able to be on the
other end of that video call is somebody
in finance or somebody in the warehouse
or a fashion designer who knows what the
right expert is so just getting them to
the next available agent in a contact
center it is not the right way to go
about it so what we do is we call those
attributes and what that means is is the
consumer has a set of attributes this is
a returning customer they've spent a lot
of money with us they'd like to buy blue
jeans and they were placing a new order
so that maybe attributes about that
caller so then all the people in
Jillian's can have attributes associated
with them I'm a contact center agent I'm
someone in sales I'm someone in finance
I'm a designer etc and the key is how do
you take the attributes that the caller
has associated with them
and match them to the perfect person
behind the scenes and that's called
attributes based routing now in the past
used to have very sophisticated contact
center software to be able to do that
now it's just built right into this
collaboration environment that we're
talking about this back in platform that
you communication and able so no acd
involved no complex contact center
software involved it's just all built
right into the environment so in this
case automatically that caller that
press the button out on the website was
connected to the person within Jillian's
that have the perfect attributes to be
able to handle that caller so not only
did I communication enabled but I
matched up the two perfect people to
talk to each other the result I make a
bigger sale I have a happier customer
it's all about getting to the right
person so I hope this gives you an
example of it's not just communication
enabling your application but it's also
making sure that you have the right
connections once you're able to do that
okay now in this case what's interesting
is remember I said that we could write
very very few lines of Java code well in
this particular case this example real
world example I actually wrote 0 lines
of Java code okay what I did was when
that caller press talked to an expert on
the web page it actually kicked off a
workflow on the platform and you as a
developer simply dragged and dropped and
built that workflow so it's as simple as
grabbing what you want to do and
dragging it right into the workflow
right grab another step or tasks as we
call them like context or I'll talking
on a second about speech recognition and
I just drag those capabilities right
into my workflow so in this example that
I just gave I could prove to you that I
could take a website
that had zero communication whatsoever
and in a matter of minutes I can modify
the website I can drag and drop and
build a workflow and I can have that
call or fully video and audio enabled
back to an expert and I could turn that
out in minutes not days of development
not weeks of development I'm talking
minutes of development okay so so now
you can start to see the power of taking
these Java or JavaScript based
applications and putting some of these
great features now let me bring up
another point with this remember I said
step one was enabling the application
getting the icon and the clickable area
to video or to voice enable the second
was let's pass context right who's
clicking what do you know about them as
a customer let's get them to the right
expert on the other end so let's do
after be based routing now if I told you
as a developer once that customer starts
talking to the expert on the other end I
want your software to listen in to that
conversation real-time and I wanted to
listen for certain things being said by
either the expert or the customer and
when certain things are said I want you
to pop up recommendations on the agent
screen so for example if the person that
clicked to audio or video is in the
middle of the conversation and said I'd
like to know more about your skinny
jeans your application could be
listening for skinny jeans and pop up a
recommendation to the agent on their
screen automatically Oh skinny jeans let
me tell you all about them we have two
new designs they've been out for two
weeks we're currently backordered but
they would be shipped within 10 days or
less guaranteed etc etc all that
information popped up on the screen
because the caller simply said the word
skinny jeans now imagine if I said I
need for you to take your application
and I need for you to put that
capability in it and I need for you to
demonstrate it to me in an hour you
would go oh my gosh I have to do speech
recognition I have to figure out how to
do it real time I have to figure out how
to get the events when certain things
are said etc in this particular case
remember all i did was drag and drop the
speech right into my workflow and i have
now wired up real-time speech
recognition capabilities right inside of
my work phone no development whatsoever
it is completely speech-enabled right
from the ground up so the power that you
get with this type of a platform as a
developer means you can turn things
around very very quickly I didn't have
to worry about scalability high
availability etc and now imagine the
richer application that i have for the
end customer than i ever had before I
communication enabled my application ok
so now let's take our use case one step
further and let's talk about the second
use case completely different scenario
I'm now an employee of jillians and one
of my customers called me up they were
very angry and they said hey I'm on your
website I'm trying to look at these cool
new blue jeans and every time I click I
get a 404 error what in the world is
that your website seems broken I'm a
very unhappy customer hey now somebody
has to go figure that out figure out how
to get people together and go our
website is broken what are we going to
do about it and in the past that's
typically been a very manual process
let's see how do I call IT how do I tell
them what page I'm not even sure who to
call so in this case we want to take a
catastrophic issue and we want to put
together an application that quickly
brings a team together to go work this
problem in a matter of seconds ok so
completely different use case
but still communication enabling an
application so I start off with my
problem and what I find is remember the
attributes attached to the employees
well some of those attributes can be
these are people in IT who maintain the
website that could be an attribute so
what I want to do is I want to pull
those people together that are available
very quickly and i want to say guys our
website is broken we're getting unhappy
customers quickly fix the problem
traditionally what would I had to do one
figure out who to call secondly go
schedule a meeting third hope it shows
up on their calendars and that they're
reading their calendars and forth they
have to call in or video into this
meeting I want to do that in seconds so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this problem and I'm going to
develop a workflow that simply says
problem find all the people with the
right attributes and send every single
one of them a text message that says
catastrophic problem click here join the
meeting immediately now all I had to do
was drag and drop and build that
workflow or I could have written it in
Java code and here's what it did it
first found all the people that had the
IT I can fix the website attribute it
took that list of people and it created
a video conference call built into the
platform on the fly okay one line of
code it then took that video conference
call and formed an SMS message and said
send this SMS message to all the people
that have the right attributes so that
workflow is ten or twelve steps that I
just simply dragged and drop now
everybody that is part of that website
team automatically gets the SMS I could
have also sent them an email or both
they simply click on the link and the
next thing they know is
on their mobile device they're inside of
a high-definition video call all
communicating together so again if I'm
the manager of Jillian's and I go to you
and I say gee when we have a big problem
it takes hours to get the right people
together I want you to write a java
application that anytime we have a
problem it will automatically notify
people create a video conference on the
fly and bring all those people together
in a matter of minutes you would go oh
my gosh I think six months from now I
may have a prototype for you we were
able to do this dynamic teaming start to
finish in about an hour drag and drop
decide what we want the SMS message to
be fully communication enable the
application and we could have had it
ready to demonstrate in about an hour so
that's how productive you can be as a
developer in this environment very very
simple to communication and able
applications ok so that's a second use
case see it's a totally different use
case the first use case was about
customer and getting them to the right
person getting them to the right expert
about making sales communication the
second use case was all about we have a
catastrophic problem we want to bring
everybody together it's still about
communicating and collaborating I was
able to implement both of those use
cases in measured in minutes not
measured in days weeks or months ok let
me give you a third example I'm going to
actually show you a live demonstration
off of my mobile phone so this came
about within avaya this idea for this
use case because of a problem that we
have that many many companies have okay
so see if this sounds familiar to you
within avaya we probably have 50
conference bridges 50 conference bridge
systems so if you're like me I'm in
meetings all day long I call in to
conference bridges and I have to
look at my calendar I have to find what
number to call I have to find out what
the host code is I have to find out what
the pin number is and so every time I
get ready to go into a conference
meeting it takes me four or five minutes
and fat fingering dialing numbers to
finally get into that meeting do that
eight to ten times a day and I'm
exhausted just trying to get into
meetings so here was a great place to go
do a communication enabled application
same platform as the first two use cases
and we call this personal assistant so
what I want to be able to do is take my
desk phone or my mobile phone or my home
phone or a conference room phone and I
just want to hit the speed dial button
and let it figure out what meeting I'm
supposed to be in and let it put me into
that meeting so now what I've done is
I've married the video or the phone
system to my calendar that matter if
that's exchange or google calendar or
whatever and I've communication enabled
my calendar but I team have to go to my
calendar why because the communication
system knows behind the scenes how to
access my calendar and it says hey I
know what time it is I know who you are
I'll simply put you into your next
meeting I didn't have to really do
anything so so what I'm going to show
you on on my mobile phone for personal
assistant is essentially i'm going to
call into personal assistant single dial
and then speech recognition remember is
built right into the system and you're
going to see that this is just yet
another simple java application inside
of the platform that's going to do
personal assistant so a third use case
it's completely different from the first
two but uses exactly the same set of
capabilities okay so hopefully we can
hear this over the speakers okay so I'm
going to dial personal assistant
oh my a personal assistant Gary I see
two scheduled meeting which do you want
to join meeting one staff meeting
meeting to Java one conference keynote
or see or enter the bridge access code
meeting to move into I'll connect you to
the about yeah well conference bridge at
the house please wait you will now be
placed into the conference okay so
that's a real example of it knew me
because I dialed from my mobile phone so
it automatically knew me it
automatically authenticated me it
automatically accessed my calendar it
knows what time of day it's in and in
that case my admin had double booked me
right because it said I'm supposed to be
in two meetings right now so what I what
it said was it was smart enough to say
well you're supposed to be in two
meetings I better ask you which meeting
you're supposed to be in so i said i'll
be in meeting too that's what I spoke it
recognized the voice and it took me to
the second meeting I had no idea what
conference bridge that meeting was on it
just simply automatically took my
information from the calendar extracted
it and connected me to that system and
behind the scenes put in the host code
the pin number and everything and it
just simply put me into the meeting okay
as a Java developer that was written in
Java written by one of our developers
internally as this personal assistant
did not have to worry about scalability
high availability nothing he just simply
developed the code dropped it into our
platform and then we started rolling
that out to our employees who loved it
because it made their day much easier
now for example I can be in my car I can
just simply click the button in my car
bluetooth to my mobile phone put me into
the next meeting and the next thing I
know hands-free I'm into the next
meeting so another
example of a very cool application that
was very very easy to develop single
developer over a very short period of
time dropped it into the environment and
now I can make that available to the
whole world to be able to do personal
assistant one of the new things that
we're adding to this is dial by name so
we all know what Siri and other
capabilities are but I can't do Siri
from any device in other words I can't
be sitting at my desk phone or I can't
be on a website that's audio enabled or
I can't be on an Android and do dial by
name with Siri with personal assistant
very simple job application in about
another week or so I can be on any
device that it knows is me and I'll be
able to speak a name and it will
automatically call that person for me so
it's like taking Siri and putting it on
every device that I'm associated with
for my corporate communication system ok
so I hope that this is kind of giving
you a feel for three very different use
cases very different but at the same
time what they had in common is I needed
a way to be able to communicate more
effectively now how did I do this well
you saw some of the capabilities first
of all to write the Java code this is
simply an eclipse plugin you just
download the plug-in put it into Eclipse
and you're off writing the code it
creates the template for you
context-sensitive help does your syntax
checking and you're off developing code
in a very short period of time what that
eclipse plugin is doing is it is
exposing the open api's of the
collaboration environment for you so
know where do you have to learn sip know
where do you have to learn communication
protocols it's things like make a call
transfer a call send an email create an
SMS anything communication enabled is
built into that plug-in its
multi-channel it's not just voice but
it's voice video email SMS virtually any
communication that I choose to use we
call the
collaboration environment and what you
do is through that Eclipse plug-in
you're actually developing what we call
a snap in so personal assistant is a
snap in being able to intelligently
route my customer because they clicked
on the video with an expert was a snap
in okay so that's what you're doing as a
developer never are you writing main /
in / in you just simply develop your
snap in drop it in to collaboration
environment and you have this infinitely
scalable application up and running in a
matter of minutes and if this is
something that you developed it's very
clever and you want to make that
available either free or charge for it
in the very near future you'll be able
to put that up on the avaya snap store
okay appstore snap-ins okay that's how
we got the snap store and we think and
we're already getting a lot of interest
of being able to write applications as a
snap-in put it up on the snap store and
then charge every time somebody
downloads that and puts it inside of
their collaboration environment okay so
a whole new ecosystem for writing java
applications that are going to become
communication and able okay now in this
example is my getting back to my use
case is the person ordered the jeans
talk to the person on the other end had
this great experience and now they can
share their how they did with their
friends on you know Twitter with you
know whatever that they would care to
type in so they could click and be able
to send out a tweet now that is
important to our fictitious company
jillians because they want to know what
people are saying about them good or bad
so communication enabling your
application may also mean that i want to
bring social media into it so as a
fourth use case is how do i capture
social media about my company and then
how do i make sure that gets to the
right people and treated the right
a so again I can simply build a workflow
and drag-and-drop social media
capabilities right into that workflow
now whenever I get a tweet that's about
me I can execute a workflow and decide
what I want to do with that okay so
another form of a snap in and I can
choose to route that to marketing I can
route that to my contact center I could
send it to the CEO of Jillian's I
consented anywhere I want to be able to
route that because I have all these cool
capabilities I didn't have to write any
code or if I chose very little code to
be able to get that information get it
into the workflow and then decide what
it is that I want to do so another way
of communication enabling the
application this time it's enabled
through social media okay and I
mentioned earlier that snap store is how
you would distribute these those
applications can be a viable personal
assistants a great example of a novia
built snap in you as a developer can
build snap ins or customers can build
snap-ins okay so if I'm a customer of
avaya and I could go build my own snap
in for my own internal personal use
right whether it's on my enterprise or
in my contact center so a great way to
be able to distribute these
communication and applications you don't
have to they're very easy to install
through what we call system manager on
any site but if you want to make them
publicly available and you want to put
value and commerce around those you can
use snap story alright so the next
question I always get asked is okay this
sounds too good to be true it sounds
very very simple but I have to go out
and I have to get an audio system a
video system a video conferencing system
I have to be able to connect up with SMS
I've got to go put this collaboration
environment together that's going to
take me months even though i can write
applications in minutes so what we've
done is we've created what we call
collaboratory and collaborate
tori is this entire development
environment in the cloud as a
development sandbox so you as a
developer can sign up for collaboratory
have eclipse down on your desktop
download the plug-in your eclipse talks
up to the collaboratory and you can set
write applications upload your snap in
up to collaboratory and you're now in
business to be able to test your
development so very very simple as a
developer to get up and running what
would normally cost you tens to hundreds
of thousands of dollars to set up the
sophisticated audio video etc you can
now do for pretty close to free have
that up in the cloud do all your
development there before you roll out to
corporate production environment so to
give you an idea is if I took this whole
big environment and I took the cost of
just what you would have to pay for one
server to put on your site I can go for
that same cost I could go get
collaboratory for three years okay so I
give you an idea that it is essentially
pennies on the dollar investment to be
able to get up and running very very
quickly to start playing around develop
your snap ins try it prototype things go
through an iterative process very very
very inexpensive to be able to do that
so we wanted not only it easy to develop
applications as I've demonstrated but we
want to make it very easy for developers
to literally get started in a day one of
the things that we've done over the past
day or two is we had collaboratory as
part of the hackathon hands-on lab so we
didn't have to come to Java one and
bring big you know videoconferencing
systems and audio systems and all this
other stuff we just simply use
collaboratory up in the cloud and then
as we were going through the hackathon
the desktops simply had Eclipse loaded
and
they were talking to the collaboratory
up in the cloud and of the people that
we had come into the hackathon the
feedback we got is wow much simpler to
do than I ever expected I could sit here
in the hackathon and have a pretty
decent application up and running in the
hour so that I'm sitting here because
it's just so easy to use and so easy to
enable it's harder now to think of the
use cases than it is to do the
development okay it used to be use cases
where easy development is hard and takes
a long time now development is really
really simple and it's all about use
cases also if you get a chance stop by
our booth which is 50 12 in the Grand
Ballroom they can also show you hands-on
I think all the hackathons are now
finished but they can give you
demonstrations show you how to sign up
for collaboratory show you what a
snap-in is they can drag and drop you
can actually build workflows if you want
to see how powerful the workflow system
is in the booth you can actually drag
and drop and build some of those as well
okay so I think we have a few minutes
any any questions that you might have no
support for you can you can get to the
api's from anything but the plug-in that
we've built it helps you with
context-sensitive help etc is for
eclipse but because this is simply
exposed as Java methods you can get to
it from any IDE or any platform hey we
just made it easier to use in Eclipse
or anywhere baby
yeah so see if this is your question so
what we do have as part of collaboratory
and part of the development environment
is you can download a whole bunch of
running examples so if you want to see
how to go do something we have a library
of source code that you can literally
say here's a simple call redirect
application snap in here's the source
code you can see how easy it was to do
etc so there is a library that we've
developed as part of collaboration
environment to help developers see a
whole bunch of examples okay so if they
want to do video there's examples if
they want to do WebRTC there's examples
if they want to do call redirect there's
examples if they want to do make call
you know so a whole library of examples
not object level snap-ins but actual
code that can be built into a snap-in
that helps you get started very quickly
okay another question make sense okay
great they do get a chance please please
stop by the booth and you know just
start to see just really how easy it is
and you know our view is is if there's
one thing it's going to happen over the
next year or so is that you're going to
see applications java based applications
certainly that had zero communications
built into them that this area is just
going to explode where virtually every
application is going to have
communications built into it some way
and the reason it hasn't in the past is
it was too hard too expensive now it's
become very inexpensive and very easy so
it's just a new area of development just
waiting to happen and we think that
everything's lined up very nicely now
that us developers will start to see the
benefit of this and start to think about
how to take any application doesn't
matter if its inventory management
doesn't matter if its retail every
application has a need for a human being
to commute
Kate with something and they want that
built right into the application so we
think it's an area that's really going
to explode here in a very short period
of time we're certainly already seeing
it with our existing customers today
okay all right thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
