you know how with the job application
you can address two problems okay
the first one is how do you ensure that
you have at most one commit and I will
explain what this is about in a minute
and the second one is how do you capture
and replay in-flight transaction I mean
how do you capture and repeat database
operations for an in-flight transaction
okay this is our statement of duration I
mean this is a legal talking legal
protection you know I can say things
about future functionality it's not
binding that's what I mean okay so what
is the problem we want to solve which
problem I are gonna try to solve and so
I am sure that some of you have
experienced this one of this real-life
situation so I personally experienced I
was trying to buy a flight ticket and
when I put all the details and hit the
submit button something happens and I
did not get the ticket on the the they
did not give me a clear message saying
you know it did not go through it went
through so I resubmit and I ended up
with two tickets so I have to call the
company and say I really want one ticket
so I don't know if any of you have
experienced that you're trying to buy
something online and paying your taxes
and you end up by paying multiple time
because of the problem we want to
describe anybody has experienced that so
what was the case
okay okay okay so this is a real
application issue and I mean unless you
use the problem and we're gonna show
here it's it's a difficult problem to
solve
okay so what happens is so why it had
this problem have to serve and this is
one example of Oracle travel which is
the system we use to book flight and
sometime you know when the problem
happens they say please do not click the
purchase booth button more than once if
you click more than once you're gonna
buy twice the same ticket because they
have not yet incorporated the solution
we're gonna describe okay so so what
happens is what we need is a reliable
mechanism to make the determination of
the outcome of a failed comic because
the problem we were describing was you
sent the commit you know you enter all
the details and you hit the submit
button which correspond to commit the
transaction and the problem happens at
that moment you know that's difficult
period of time to catch what is going on
and in application code people have
different places but they never managed
to get it right and I'll show you next
slide why it's hard to get it right so
we need a mechanism to make a reliable
determination of the outcome of the
Committee of the sale commit and the
second thing we want show is the ability
to capture and replay an interaction
with the database for in-flight
transaction traditionally if you don't
have that possibility it's lost if you
have an in-flight transaction and
something happened everything you've
done until the failure is lost
and you have to start over and we want
to show you how you can deal with that
problem
okay so real first problem first
solution so when there is a break and
communication during the commit the java
application receive an error message
which says commit failed but it does not
tell you is it the return did i not
receive the return from the commit or
did the commit even did not reach the
database so the the fell in the commit
is not clear so Douglas please interject
at any time in in a smaller mr.
architect anyway so the typical scenario
to make you understand is at T 0 the
application
you know you receive this fail and you
check the status and you get unknown I
mean status unknown which means your
transaction has not committed so what
application usually do is they assume
that the transaction will not commit it
did not commit say we never come in
that's what I assume so they let you
resubmit but the problem is at T 1 T 1
which is like T 0 plus few millisecond
the transaction the previous transaction
eventually commits and that's how you
end up by buying twice the same together
by paying multiple times your taxes or
by you know if you you click the
purchase button many times that's how
you end up because the it's hard to find
the exact period of time where you want
to make sure that the transaction reach
the database are did not reach the
database you know what is the status of
the transaction how do you check the
status of the transaction I don't know
how you do today how you guys ensure
this problem do you think it's an easy
problem to solve a win is Oracle making
big stuff out of this or it's a trivial
problem you guys can solve easily owner
okay thank you okay so that's the
situation and it's a it's a challenge
it's really hard okay so how do we
manage to solve that okay so the first
thing is there are some changes in the
our DBMS to associate in logical
transaction ID with every transaction
and this logical transaction ID is only
changed by the our DBMS which means if
the our DBMS did not commit any
transaction the logical transaction ID
will not change that's the trick that
the secret sauce you know it's a the
logical relation ID so the logical
relation ID is assigned by the database
to every transaction and it is sent to
the driver so the application I mean the
driver to the BC driver has the logical
transaction ID in some connection state
the property okay now if there is a
break in communication I mean the fail
in commit what you got to do is since
your connection is already dead because
there is a break in communication your
connection is dead so what you got to do
is get a find out what is the logical
transaction ID from the old connection
then get in new connection and then ask
what is the status you know to do that
you need to invoke this start probe
which is the database proc on it will
tell you I mean the database will tell
you
unknown I mean I don't know the studies
it has not committed or a disk emitter
only the database can tell you in a
reliable way
based on the logical transaction ID if
the associated transaction has committed
or not so that we ago ahead
receive by the application is that the
commit case the was not receive okay the
second one oh it's a real scenario and
that's how I many of us end up by buying
transcen ticket because the application
did not receive the the return of the
commit to say it commit happens and the
application assumed they did not go
through the grass wanted to add
something
whatever the response operations the
server with that that's why presented
the resources on this drive is
did that
yeah go ahead
yeah um okay
right
oh no no a wheelchair I mean if you ask
the database what is the outcome of the
transaction associated with this logical
transaction ID in the scenario you just
described the database will tell you it
has committed oh if you able to get a
connection it means the databases are if
you are able to get a new connection I
mean in this scenario okay I did not
want to do a product pitch here but
let's say we are in a real application
cluster situation where one instance
dies but the other instances are up and
running let's assume that for some HM
eken is me you are able to connect again
to the database
you need to ask you need to send the
database the logical transaction ID for
the transaction for which you have doubt
on database will tell you all this one
as the class explained I don't know I
don't yet know the hacker okay I won't
tell you in that case you can be sure I
did not come in I will tell you it has
committed in that case or you can
proceed you can tell the your end user I
mean you know we got all your details so
be assured that you will only be facts
taxes only one signal a new transaction
right
right or the inside go ahead and he's
member of the expert group so if he says
that you can trust
while they defend their interest it's
kind of lower piece you know go ahead
Oh each strand each connection each
connection has its own logical
translation ad each transaction is or
logic odds of dodging ad and this is the
picture of the interaction between the
application which is here and the driver
on the database so as the class was
saying at the beginning when you start
the transaction the ER logical
translation ID is sent to the the optic
I mean the driver okay so you always
have the logical translation ad now
let's say you do a commit and the
failure happens during the committee did
not get back the message of the commit
or you receive you know failed commits
or something like that that's why you
need to get the last logical translation
ID by getting a new and when you get it
from the dead connection get a new
session and ask the database tell me the
outcome of this transaction associated
with the logical rationality
so
go get a coffee
somewhere
yeah that's the second secret so the
first one is a logical transaction ID
the second one is what Douglas just
described the database if you ask and
the transaction did not commit the
database blocks the transact
it prevents the transaction from
committing and that's the only way we
can guarantee you when we tell you you
know not committed you can in a reliable
fashion go ahead and ask the customer to
submit a new transaction
EJ's coming that way
perspective maybe but creative outlet
minima's very very minimal overhead
but I think it's a minimum it's it's a
mini model over yes
no ticket
right
you know second round trip that most
find out what the
oh oh there is a package of this the
procedure here this one let me show you
this one yeah this is provided this is
something we provide you know get
logical transaction ID yeah
it's available anyway so that's the
that's the bottom line and instead of
showing you code I'll show you a demo
and you can see here
you circle computer blah blah blah okay
let me show you a quick demo yes a demo
and to explain the demo I did not excuse
me okay that's called it so that's why I
want to show a demo so keep them and I
have a lousy VirtualBox setting here I'm
not able to make it big I don't know can
you see can you see the screen okay so
this application I will just explain
what up the application does and I'll
just show section of the code so this
application tries to give raise to
people okay so try to give five percent
raise to everybody in the employees
table and you need to decide if you want
to use this functionality or not so I
have a property file and at the
beginning I will set the property files
to false which means I will not be using
this functionality and we can see we
will see the result and the second file
is the second time I will run the demo I
will set the property to true which will
use this mechanism so when this
mechanism is not used what's going to
happen is we will receive arkad I need
to add one more thing we are using a
library called cyclop which is a proxy
interconnection proxy which is capable
of injecting a failure to prevent
the carnation from reaching the
application in fact the connection will
succeed but we will just prevent the
carnation from reaching the application
so the application will make the wrong
decision and I assume transaction has
not committed and will give additional
raise to everybody so people will get
10% raise instead of fantasy and which
is not acceptable I mean if you are they
if you are the CFO you will not like
that application but in the second case
when we set the functionality to true it
will realize that the commit has you
know happen and we not applied the race
in the second time that's the demo and
the grass can explain to you how this
cyclop cyclops we call it is the library
which injects so you can see here I have
used TGT G is the transaction card as
the name of the the mechanism so if we
use T G we okay this is a transaction
instead of bloodwine assuming the entire
request fail because we got recover
reception will you write on T G+ or not
that's how it was so let me just go
ahead and run the applications will make
more sense where we check the outcome of
the transaction
let me see chop down yeah we get raised
no that's true too too far the cyclops
okay get there is no exception we
consider okay so I will let me check the
function below yes okay
just
rather above that
so you can see here we are invoking the
gate logical transaction ID wrapper okay
and there is a method here called gate
transaction outcome and we give the
disconnection we give him the logical
transaction ID on the new connection and
it's gonna check and by invoking the
gate logical outcome wrapper is wrong
okay we can we can get it right so now
let me run the demo by first of all
editing the property there should be a
property file here
okay so let's put these two false
it looks like I'm in the wrong territory
I think I'm in the wrong territory there
no no I have that this demo was working
so I think I should go to CD TG
okay yeah
TG okay so if I change here false
okay now I'm to run the the thing I'm
the way to run it is to invoke run TG
demo
all right so what it says is applying it
connect to the database applying
five-person ways to all employees in the
table it received a recoverable
exception no more data read from socket
lost connection to the database
reconnecting okay
trying to date the connection
established retrying applying 5sm rate
or employees raise job was successfully
completed then we did a final check and
we find out that we applied 10% raise of
everybody because we are not using the
functionality and the application assume
that the recoverable exception means you
know it was not committed so we inject
the we inject the break of the
communication after the transactions has
committed and we prevent the with the
response from the database to reach the
application okay so now let me run again
and put the I'm gonna put this to false
to true now
okay so it connect it's a whip
transaction get we can find out
transaction was committed and we don't
need to retry so the following you will
erase apply to everybody has been five
percent which is what you want you don't
want to redo the the thing okay so to
summarize if you are an application
developer there are only one place that
you can have a function which will
guarantee you that you know you will not
be find yourself in a situation where
you executing you know your retrying I
mean modern wants to commit that which
is the title of this the presentation if
I go back to the presentation I'll
cannot present you the next
functionality yeah we still have some
time okay so the second thing we want to
talk about is how to capture and replay
in flight transaction for that we need
to define the unit of work we need to do
market you know when do we start
replaying and when we stop replaying so
we start replaying if you're using
Oracle connection pool you don't need
that explicit begin request but if
you're not you have to explicitly tell
the driver and by the way we have in new
in how can I say a new data source is
that your correct word because it's not
a new driver it's the same driver in 12c
but it has a has tooth data sources you
need to use what we call in the replay
data source if you use that one and you
use Oracle pools such as Universal
connection pool or WebLogic when you get
a connection we start recording start
recording every interaction with the
database and when you close and put the
connection back to the pool we stop
recording so this
is not for long-running jobs you know
where you do 24 hours before you commit
because we will blow the memory the
recording is happening in memory for
each connection each connection there is
a space in memory where we record all
the interaction but when we reach the
commit we throw away everything we have
recorded when the committee successful
we throw away because we don't need to
keep that we keep that only during the
in-flight transaction when until it
commits or rollback
so that's that's one I mean
precaution the second thing is you need
to use the what we call in the replay
data source and that's all you got to do
a derpy I mean there are some other
consideration okay so you need to do
market unit of work that's happening
when you are doing normal operation and
we hold the original calls with bind
variable etc etc when there is a failure
and you reconnect we check that the
transaction has the replay neighbor if
replays not enable we will not replace
if you have not explicitly say I want to
be able to replay if you're not using
this replay data so we will not do that
so under the cover the driver itself
will create a new condition will
validate will check the outcome of the
commit you know use the feature we
described earlier the day the driver
itself will use all those things and if
everything is okay if all the results
set are similar it will replay
everything it has recorded in memory so
for the end-user it will appear as if
nothing has happened they were not even
we see see the message the error
messages so to show you how it works I
have a kind of a sketch it sketch here
and we assume that we have a multi multi
instance database you know real
application cluster when this the same
database can be managed by multiple
instances so if you one instance fail
you can reconnect to another
etc but some other database have similar
high high availability mechanisms so
it's not specific to Oracle okay so this
is an application we have the driver etc
cetera so you asked to establish the
connection before establishing the
connection we create a queue in memory
okay
so create a queue in memory contacts in
memory and associate the connection with
the application notice here there is
something called proxy this is very
important when we will need to replace
the connection in the back without the
knowledge of the application okay so we
have to use some proxy mechanism there
is a proxy library used on the decoder
the class can tell you more about it
okay so connection is established since
second person connection established
with the context now so normal operation
we capture everything now let's assume
that one instance fail the instance
where those are connected failed okay so
the way the Oracle real application
cluster works is it will notify the
driver that one instance has failed the
driver will check and find a good
standing instance it will find one of
the instances which is still valid it's
the same database it's still the same
database but it's just another instance
for managing the database so it will
find that one and it will create
temporary connection you know those are
temporary object and that's why we will
do all the checks you know check that
you know the result set are equal and
check that you know you apply to replay
and if everything is okay and if we
replace successful so that's replay we
replay
thing that has been captured so if we
replay on the result set are equal then
we assume that replay has been
successful and we will let the
application continue as if nothing has
happened okay so from the application
perspective from the end user
perspective nothing has happened the
driver is more active than usual and
will hide everything that has been
happening under the cover if everything
goes well there are many cases where
things will not go well for example
somebody has changed the table has
insert or deleted arrow the results that
will not be the same so we assume that
replace not successful oh no the way
Iraq works is it's the same database
it's a shared disco system everybody
accesses the same database that they no
no need to replicate yes it's a same
database oh yeah if it's a select and
the results that are different we assume
that it's it's not
if you're not making an in DML well it's
still needed if you want to ensure that
you have I mean that we can give you the
the remaining result set for example you
do a query you are retrieving the result
set and failure happened in between in
order for us to give you the remaining
part of the result set we need that this
mechanism
sure you can restart over but if you
rerun the query the results may be
different
planetary
right
I think there was a question okay go
ahead can you
yeah
nothing
then we will hide here but that
while I here
right the air is very different if we
currently
question in the back
okay a question in the back
oh they're not guaranteed
we execute we executed
yeah everything including bind variables
everything you know we we really capture
everything you know a video a video
stream right
okay this this rich is my this rich is
this slag which is the last part of the
presentation where we tell you you know
there are some assessment and best
practices so the first one we already
described which is request boundaries if
you are using Oracle drivers a
connection pool you don't care about
that but otherwise you have to
explicitly the market and we provide the
API to say begin request an end request
we do not we cannot support concrete
classes remember I show you the proxy on
this slide on the slide there were some
proxy object for the connection it's
because the developer they replace all
the other objects in the back of the
shell of the connection so the
application does not see but under the
cover it there was a new Java object new
connection object new statement object
wha-wha-wha so so we need some proxy
that's why we cannot allow concrete
classes at least for now all right so
let's not go there okay okay
internal discussion side effects and
that was just explained what one of the
side effects you might not want to
replay if you are cutting checks for
example you don't want to reprint the
checks or if you are calling some
external system there are situation that
you might not want to replay in that
case you can explicitly disable replay
you tell the driver I don't want you to
replay that the remaining part of the
transaction okay I'll call back let's
say when you get every time you get a
connection you set some specifics
properties for example NLS settings
transaction isolation things specific to
your application so in order for the
driver to be in the same situation when
he gets a connection you need to provide
a callback I mean we're talking about
non-stem
the properties things you want to set so
that the connection is exactly in the
same situation as if you are getting a
fresh neo-keynesian so that that's up to
the application developer to know you
know okay and the last is if your
application is sensitive to things such
as this date or sequence value because
if the cyst that is not the same we're
gonna say replace not successful so you
need to explicitly tell us in fact you
don't tell us you use you use some
privileges you know your DBA should
grant you the privileges to say I want
the time I want to keep the same time
when I replay the same time as before
because my application is very sensitive
to the time or I want the same sequence
value as before so you play God and you
retain the time time this man
that if you buy koala they made two
sales start replaying we come back to
the insert together the sequence we're
going to be a gazebo cover that's what
yes okay
Oh
about before that uses the sequence
typing again
the older all sequence number or the
same see state for example right the GUI
DS yes and that's why we say application
assessment practices we cannot make any
decision on that because it's
application specific here let
yeah it's a challenge easier anyway
yes go ahead yeah
because is perfectly beautiful babies
paint like they may be before
indeterminacy
correct yes that's a very good question
and so we have two modes and it's it
anyway and one last question yeah it's
already out there since at twelve one of
the database so you need both the twelve
one JDBC on the twelve one driver I stay
away from product because this is Java
well if you add open oh and I'm gonna
give you the full product pitch excuse
me you need to use the 12c JDBC driver
so you need both the JDBC driver the
latest and the latest database because
there are built-in functionalities in
the database in order to work for
example assigning logical transaction ID
for example that sorry 12c you cannot
have it in three to EXCI database okay
thank you very much for coming tomorrow
we have thank you thank you well guys we
have a session on JavaScript here we're
using Naz horn avatar Jia's etcetera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
