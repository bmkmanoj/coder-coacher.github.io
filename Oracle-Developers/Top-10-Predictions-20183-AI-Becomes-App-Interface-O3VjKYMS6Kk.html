the button on apps is going to disappear
ai becomes the interface today when I
get into my car why do I have to open up
my Google Maps select the address paste
it into Google Maps and then be able to
tell Google Maps to send that to my
vault so that my vault can then you know
be able to show the route I want to get
in and the car automatically knows by
connecting to my phone hey he has a
calendar appointment that appointment is
taking him here at this time and so let
me just show him routing so that the app
itself the car for example is becoming
intelligent or any other app is becoming
intelligent today I do a lot of expense
report approvals and most of the time
I'm actually approving the expense
reports maybe out of a hundred
I reject an expense report well the app
should become intelligent where it is
watching my pattern of approvals and
overtime itself's approves most of them
and only brings forward the ones that
are challenged or the ones that you know
I would have rejected so in order to do
this developers have to think about what
is the domain of my application what is
the data that I need to gather and then
how do I need to analyze the data and
what intelligent decisions can I make
and if they do that they can make the
button disappear where the customer
where the customer is not turning on the
app and telling the app to do something
the app is being able to make
intelligent decisions on behalf of the
customer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
