colleague Martin Lippert and we are
going to talk to you about ide
technology and how we can take this ID
technology we have today and move it
into the cloud so just to quickly
introduce myself I work at IBM I work on
many different Eclipse projects i'm a
part of the management committee that
oversees development of the Eclipse
platform I'm a competitor on Nicholas
platform and also on Orion which is a
browser based tools project that you're
going to see some of today and also the
flux project which is a brand new
project at eclipse that is looking to
address this cloud-based development
towing problem okay and my name is
Martin I work for pivotal that's a
company behind the cloud foundry
platform as a service I'd to be the big
project a side of a spring cloud foundry
rabid red ISM rabbitmq red is groovy
grails all those projects are founded
and operated by pivotal we have a big
booth up there so join us and and visit
us and talk to us and I work with the
Eclipse technology for quite some time
now and in my group at pivotal we are
doing this spring tool suite and all the
eclipse-based integrations for all the
different projects at pivotal like the
Eclipse integration for Gradle and the
Eclipse integration for TC server and
the spring ide and things like that and
that's what what we are doing in our
group and and we are looking ahead and
then thinking about what what comes next
after the traditional desktop IDs that's
why I'm here ok thanks Martin so what
we're going to do today and we're going
to give you a little bit of background a
little bit of context of why we're doing
this work then we're going to give you a
demo of a prototype of cloud-based
tooling that we've been working on and
then we'll after we've given you a demo
of what it can do we're going to switch
over and look at how it's done and give
you a little of you of the architecture
of this project and how it's and how
it's working so
Norbit ok so our starting point is
desktop tools so developers today and
for the past 15 20 years have been using
tools that run on your desktop right or
your laptop and they they're quite
powerful they have you know there's a
little huge range of different tools
available these there's several
different IDEs that have many different
plugins for them there's really tooling
for every language you can think of the
ability to deploy two different target
platforms and they're really you know
they're really pretty good tools and
we're really used to them so let's but
things have changed since IDs were were
first invented so when I DS like eclipse
were first developed this is what
computers look like right this I found
this image last night now it's just
amazed because this looks exactly like
the computer I had in my dorm like in
you know in the 90 it's like it's it's
really that is exactly with the
computing environment that you had when
when I des first came about so if you
think about the characteristics of this
computing environment it is very it is
very specific environment there is
exactly one cpu or one processing unit
there is one set a memory one disc one
display one user it's a very simple
programming model but it's we've moved
past that you know we the way we
interact with software today is does
incorporate machines like this but it
also incorporates many different kinds
of computing devices lots of different
interfaces and our and our software runs
in many different places so we've really
moved to a world where we interact with
software much differently now and the
environment that IDs were born in is no
longer the environment we live in so so
some of these new you know capable of
these new software you know born on the
web software the characteristics they
have really started they make us ask
questions about
our IDs and cutter Ige's do much more
than they do today our development tools
so for example why why can google do you
know code completion or content assist
on the internet faster than eclipse can
do content assist on your java files or
you know takes five seconds to open type
hierarchy so how come I still live with
these constraints of a single processing
unit for my tools how come is so hard to
collaborate with IDEs so these IDs were
originally designed for these physical
isolated desktop machines and it's
actually quite there's quite a lot of
friction in the in the way that we
interact with others you know unless
someone sitting next to you you know
it's probably too small but that's the
six or seven lines of git commands you
need to do to create a patch send it to
someone else and they have to apply that
patch to see what the heck you're
working on whereas a lot of newer
software makes collaboration with other
people almost frictionless very you
think about how you collaborate with
google docs for example how i can our
ids do that that kind of seamless
collaboration so we also would like our
tools to be up to be able to update a
lot more often you know if you're a you
know I guess a lot of you are Java
developers and job as a platform that
really only has a major update every
three or four years so in that world
it's it's okay if your IDE only has one
major new version every year you know
we'd like to get new things faster but
it was good enough whereas if you're
working with web technologies if you're
if you're doing development for
javascript or against html5 or any kind
of you know browser capabilities also
iot in in many domains the the runtimes
are moving very fast and our tools have
to be able to keep up that pace of being
able to update very frequently to keep
up with our runtimes now something our
ids don't do very well today so you know
how come it takes so much work to set up
my tooling environment you know I I I
used to dread the
idea of my machine crashing and having
to recreate my tooling it would be a
couple of days to recreate my entire
tooling and development stack on a new
computer or if I wanted to switch to
another device it was very difficult
task to do it was our development tools
have this very large set-up cost which
was okay again when we lived in this
environment where he had this one big
machine on my desk I only had to install
it once and then not worry about it
right but now if i am using lots of
different devices i don't want to pay
this set-up cost over and over again so
how about the cloud as as a platform
that could solve some of these problems
so if you think about the type of
software today that is allows
frictionless collaboration that updates
itself very easily that has immense
compute power when it's needed and then
when it's not needed it goes away the
cloud is the platform that promises a
lot of these advantages and many
different tools that we use today take
advantage of these capabilities so why
can't our IDs take advantage of them too
so you know this just summarizing here
again the advantages of cloud so the
cloud is is environment where it doesn't
matter what kind of peripheral i'm using
it doesn't matter where my software is
running all those details are opaque and
it allows me to you know move from
tablets servers desktops it doesn't
matter where the tools are running it's
extremely scalable up and down it
enables you know live collaboration all
these advantages so what's the current
state of jet of cloud tooling so there's
actually a lot of activity in this space
there's every week or every month
there's some new cloud-based development
tool cloud-based ide initiative you hear
about so there's really quite a lot
going on and the tools that you see
coming out work quite well if you have
very specific tooling needs so if you're
working with you know just with
JavaScript or just with a particular DSL
there's a there's a cloud tool that
that can satisfy that need but they're
very they work in very specific domains
but they're not general-purpose
development environments yet and desktop
tools are still way ahead right so I des
have had a 15 year head start on these
new cloud development environments so
there's the IDS the cloud IDs have quite
a lot of catching up to do so this is
the dilemma we face today as developers
we can continue using IDEs or desktop
tools but live with the constraints that
they impose on us or we have or we can
make this leap into browser based server
based cloud-based development
environments and get advantage are able
to take advantage of all these new you
know cloud computing powers but we have
to leave behind all our desktop tools so
this is a huge dilemma do I make this
leap to the cloud leave all my tools
behind or do I suede on the desktop
until the cloud tools mature so I'm
really kind of forced to pick between
these two worlds but so this is these
the problem area that we're Martin and I
started working on this new project
called flux where we were trying to
think about ways to address this gap
between this huge set of existing legacy
tools on my desktop and these cool new
cloud environments that have a huge
amount of potential but don't really
have the breadth of tooling available
yet so how can we get advantage of both
of these worlds so we started this new
pilot project called flux and I think
Martin will now give you a quick demo of
the things you can do with flux and
hopefully I know the monitor is small
and it's a big room so hopefully you can
you can see it and follow along ok
thanks talk since we since we talked
about these at the moment you're using
your existing desktop IDE and you do not
want to jump over the wall and leave
everything behind right you want to use
your local tool to command line tools
whatever you would like to continue to
do that and that's what's still possible
but in addition to that you can now I
have opened my Eclipse IDE
this case it is sprinkled suites with
springy version of Eclipse and add my
project in inside eclipse i can continue
to work inside eclipse that's all fine
but in addition to that i can now
connect my projects to flux to the cloud
right so that means the files of my
project they continue to stay on my
local machine everything stays the same
as before I can continue to use Eclipse
as before or you can substitute eclipse
with IntelliJ for example as well with
any other desktop ide like NetBeans or
whatever right so you can continue to
use all yours live locally but in
addition and those files are being sent
to the cloud it's a little bit like
Dropbox let's say Dropbox for code right
your files they stay locally you can use
them on your local machine you can you
can use them offline whatever and but
they are synced to the cloud as well and
this opens up a whole new world of
possibilities for example what we built
is what we connected is the Eclipse
Orion and browser-based em browser-based
tooling and to the sinking mechanism so
you can now open up a web ide which is
in this case an Orion instance and you
can access your projects from the web
just open up a browser go somewhere in
the world open a browser window login
and you can access your projects so in
this case it's my it's my spring MVC
example of course I have to use a spring
example here in this case so when I can
I can edit my I can edit my coat here
right it's my controller I can edit my
code is syntax highlighting that's nice
right that that's that's great but maybe
you've seen that before already right
editing text files on the internet
that's nothing that's brand new nothing
that's really exciting having some
syntax highlighting maybe that's nice as
well but it's still it's still far away
from the feeling that you get from
working for example with Java and it has
to buy de but the sinking mechanism and
the idea behind flux and these kind of
keeping files in saying
allows more it allows now services to
run inside the cloud somewhere in some
cloud data center in this case it's all
running on Cloud Foundry so you can see
here it's on CF apps iOS that's that's
the domain of the of the public version
of cloud foundry it's all running on
Cloud Foundry so there's a timeless
service on Cloud Foundry running now
that takes care of my let's say Java
language tooling for me so it takes care
of while I'm changing filed it does
stuff behind the scenes for me and gives
me some feedback for example it is not
only able to send files while I'm saving
a file so I'm changing a new version of
the file it is also able to sync files
while I'm typing and this allows for
example the service to do real language
tooling real life reconciling for Java
as you can see here inside the browser
right and that's that's real that's the
same feeling that again as if you would
work inside your debts of ID it's doing
real reconciling for java at the same
speed or even even faster then you are
used to in your deaths about the e which
is not implemented in JavaScript inside
this browser application running inside
your browser right so we have
reimplemented a java compiler or java
puzzle or whatever in javascript to let
it run here it is a service that is
running inside the cloud that gives me
the feedback that is operating on my
project inside the cloud gives me
feedback here for example for doing real
job job reconciling the same of course
doing some reconciling yeah that's nice
i see it's it's it's errors and warnings
and you can see here oh yes it's doing
real language validation what about
content assist it's here right it's it's
the same there's a service running
inside the cloud that gives me real
countenance is for java so it's not fake
it's not conferences it's being kind of
kind of kind of guest from this local
file or from partying a little bit
inside the browser that's real full Java
Constance is running inside the bra
I hear it's not running as a trois right
it's coming from the cloud service from
the cloud java service but the feedback
is being presented in my browser ide my
in my editor that i have here giving me
real content syst for java the same for
example is here right these are these
this warning is also being produced as a
side effect of the java service that's
running inside the cloud it analyzes my
code tells me all this local rival
that's not used somewhere it says it's a
kind of the simpler feature they have
from in the desktop ID right so it's not
a new feature but it's now available
from all over the world the same for
example if you want to do navigation
like you want to jump to the Declaration
of day in this case here you can jump to
the Declaration and jumping up here
right this shows a little bit how the
first language features the first real
job of supporting language features are
being implemented as cloud services
running on Cloud Foundry in this case
but good one could run anywhere in any
data center and are being presented and
usable from from a browser-based editor
inside my browser based ide and the
interesting thing is that this is not
only of course not only limited to this
to this one file right so in this case
this controller is implementing an
interface it's my interface so let me
open up a new browser window editing the
interface so let's let's type something
here add a new method to this interface
and I do not add a default
implementation this is the old-style the
java 7 style doing programming with
interfaces so let me save my interface
and if i if i go back i immediately see
the error here right so the service it's
running inside the cloud the java
service and says oh you change the
interface oh i do some kind of
reconciling recomputation whatever and
the result is not only an error for the
five yet it hit but it's an error for
for another file so i send back the
information for the other file so i get
this feedback immediately right which is
kind of nice it gives me the feeling
that I'm really operating on my project
and it's not these e makes style of
working with your code like oh you have
this one file open you type something in
you press save and then I need to do
something else to find out what's going
wrong right it's a real ID feeling you
get here for java it's not just not just
any fake language it's real java2me as
John mentioned those deaths those cloudy
IDEs they are still way behind the
desktop by the ease in terms of features
right I showed you get reconciling I
have continent-sized errors or warnings
I've navigation but usually in this case
if you're familiar with your deskaway ve
you would press something like a quick
fix right generate me the implementation
of this method and that's not yet
implemented in my cloud IDE so what I
would like to do in this case I would
like to go back to my desktop ide right
I would like to go back and and and
continue to work here because as we
promised we promise to your and you're
not you do not have to jump over the
wall and use the cloud ide only it's
synced we said it's synced so that
that's what happened here it's int and
it's in all the time right so if I open
up the same file in my Eclipse IDE I see
the same error because i'm editing the
same space right the same stuff it's not
oh i'm editing the five year or the file
there it's like Google Docs like you're
not adding your file and inhales file on
whatever file you're adding the same
stuff from all the different devices
from the browser from the desk of
wherever you are and that's the same
here with flux right it feels like
you're editing the same stuff and it's
being in sync all the time for you which
does not mean for you for your team or
whatever so does not replace version
control of whatever but it's for me it
is the same stuff so of course in my
desktop ide I have the quick fix so let
me let me do the quick fix
and as you can see here I haven't
pressed saved it aventure safe right
it's generating this the method food to
hear and since it's int it feels like
I'm editing the same stuff it's the same
it's the same in the end the browser
window right so let me delete that here
it's leading the death of ID as well of
course right because it's the same it's
like google docs in this case okay let
me press safe so I I change the file and
I can continue to work in my web eid e
in my cloudy IDE I can go back to my
desktop ID if I want and I can go forth
and back whenever I want I do not have
to jump over the ball and use the cloud
eid exclusively or go back to my desktop
ID and use that I can use whatever I
want whenever I want that right and
maybe one day I wake up and think oh my
god I haven't used my desktop ID all
week so maybe the cloud stuff is already
feature rich enough for me to do my
daily Java development or my daily
scholar development or my daily
JavaScript development or whatever or
altogether right but to me that still
feels like that that's that's that's
that's great but that's not enough once
I'm in this in this cloudy world I also
would like to start doing programming in
my in my cloudy world I do not want to
start creating projects in a desktop ide
and then jump and then go back to the to
the desktop I would like to start here
as well and that that's what I'm able to
do as well so we implemented a totally
different different application which is
a spring initializer that's something
like the html5 initializer thing just
for spring project so and i can i can
create spring projects here let me
create Java 12 here
and let me use a web web style and
usually if you would create the spring
boot project and that's I think the
official applications at star dot spring
bio you could create a project and it
would generate a basic in this case a
basic maven project for you based pom
file that contains all the dependencies
and stuff like that so you can easily
start your spring bootie application
development but in my special version of
this initializer app I can start using
this project right away in my cloud ID
of course right in this case I sit here
in my in my flux is my Orion you I
already so it is it's shown here
I can I can start working on my on my
project here so it seems like the the
service still is still trying to Trantor
background this is java java service
going up they see this this cloudy java
tooling that is doing some stuff for me
and let me press reloj because it should
have created the project not yet take
some time so i can i can start this
project from from the web only if i
would like to go back to my desk so by
de now i could go back to my desktop ID
and say okay i import this project back
into my desk tidy because i would like
to work on the same project as well so
to keep those partners and think again
and to download it to my local machine
if i want which is not the case which is
not the case here okay so what I could
do now is again for example creating you
in your file say oh yeah let's do some
kind of a hacking here
that's good
crane some controller hello from Java 1
and usually it shouldn't port this and
it's not yet the case that strange so
something seems to be going wrong here
but usually it should kick off my my
java tooling for this project well which
is not the case here not yet the case
which is strange but it shows you that
you can start up your project from the
web as well and interesting an
interesting additional thing that we
built is since there is behind the
scenes all those services running inside
the cloud they can now do additional
things for you the one service that that
i'm using here is a java service doing
some kind of java tooling for you there
could be another service doing other
stuff for you for example here is the
service that is deployed is able to
deploy applications that are synced to
the cloud to for example cloud foundry
so in this case I could say ok there's a
tiny little application that's running
somewhere in the cloud that allows me to
push my app to Cloud Foundry so i logged
in with my Cloud Foundry credentials
here it did that before and that's why
it knows this is my cloud foundry ID and
I can start to push my application to
cloud foundry in this case so again just
continue to work inside the browser only
I can start to push my app to Cal
foundry and maybe some some some if the
network is still working it will show up
some some additional information some
some some lock information your for me
just to show you the basic idea of how
this Claudia environment is connected to
the death of ide and is operating with
additional services inside the cloud
that can do additional stuff
for me right and to tell you a little
bit about the background if this is very
deployed I will go back here we can go
back to the slides and talk a little bit
about how all this is working behind the
scenes that's okay yeah yep sounds good
yeah so the really interesting aspect
there is that it's a highly decoupled
environment right you can have these
services that are running on my desktop
services running in a browser services
out in the cloud different data centers
whatever you can have all these
different towing services very loosely
coupled design that are interacting with
each other to provide the tooling
capabilities you need so yeah Martin's
going to dig in a little bit on what the
architecture of this system looks like
and okay the architects you behind this
and this is quite interesting and it's
the reason why I would like to talk
about that as well and not only show you
the demo oh it's okay can you hear me
still fine yeah okay also is that the
architect behind that as John mentioned
is something that is highly decoupled so
we tried to think about it totally new
way to build cloud IDEs and cloth
development tooling because we thought
about all we do not would like to
reinvent the wheel in terms of
reemployment the java compiler and
javascript and let everything run inside
the browser and things like that right
it doesn't feel right to do everything
inside the browser and we would like to
leverage these cloud resources and
computing power inside the cloud and so
that's why we came up with the totally
different architecture which is based on
messaging and async messaging so
everything that happens inside these
let's say flux architecture for club
tooling is based on a stick messages so
what you've seen at the beginning when I
connected my desktop ID to the cloud and
said oh this is something like Dropbox
for code behind the scenes my desktop
IDE and something like a repository
that's running inside the cloud they are
now both connected with messages they
are exchanging messages and that's all
there's no rest api being called or
whatever is is a modern way today to do
a web applications it's using messages
only async messages so the desktop ID
would exchange messages the cloud backup
repository would consume those messages
send messages back and that way they
would do something like this file
syncing based on those messages they
would exchange those messages for it in
back to sync those files and changes
among those files now the desktop the
browser-based editor comes into the into
the game here so it participates in this
system as well and what it does is it
connects to this message Chen channel as
well and that's it everything else is
done using those messages again right so
if the browser-based editor wants to
know what's inside of the project it
sends out a message and it gets a
message back about what's inside the
project if it needs a content of a file
it sends back it sends out a message and
gets a message back about the content of
the file and if I start doing typing
inside my browser editor it is sending
out those typing events and those those
file changes on this message bus as well
and other people inside the world in
this case and in my demo it was a
gesture by de it is also listening for
those life edit change events those
messages are being sent forth and back
so the browser editor is not really tied
to the desktop ide the dancer body is
not tied to the Browse editor and
they're both not tied to the cloud
backup repository those are all
independent components that can run
wherever you want them to run so at the
next step whatever I showed you is there
is a java service running inside the
cloud somewhere else in some data center
in my case it wasn't Cloud Foundry
totally separate application of cloud
foundry and and that Java service is
also communicating with asic messages on
this message bus and what it does is it
consumes those messages about what is it
was a project how does the project
like what's inside and while you are
typing it reacts to those typing events
by saying oh I do some reconciling for
you and I send back errors and warnings
as messages like SN pega messaging oh I
created some errors and warnings and
someone else could be interested in
those messages like the browser editor
that is interested in those messages and
shows those messages the results like oh
I'm showing errors of warnings that's
great and if someone else is not
interested he's not interested that's
fine right the Java service just does
not care about that interestingly this
Java service is exchanging those live
sinking and so she resolves messages for
example with the browser-based editor
but it could get the content of the
project in this in this example from the
back of a positive running inside the
cloud again the project content from
there live events from the editor
sinking back the changes force it back
over those messages and I said that this
is Java service is not coupled to the to
the browser-based editor and that's very
interesting because the browser-based
editor doesn't know in this case
anything about job except from the
syntax highlighting right it sends back
it turns out edit events it consumes
back errors and warnings but it is not
calling an API for the Java so say
please do some java stuff for me please
give me confidence syst dear Java
service please give me Comm dennis's it
sends out a message saying i change this
file or i need confidence cysts and the
Java service in this case guy gets those
messages receives them and say oh you're
editing a Java file that's interesting I
can do something for you I send you back
errors and warnings or I send you back a
continent cyst information but it's the
decision of the service not the decision
of the editor in this case because they
are so highly decoupled so another
service could be deployed somewhere in
the cloud so some other reason region
connecting to this to this channel and
say oh there is
edit events coming along for a scholar
file I'm able to do scholar stuff I can
do something for you I can do
reconciling for scholar I can do come to
this force Carla and I do not have to
change the editor site for that right I
just need to plug in or just need to
deploy the service somewhere I can host
it and then operate there totally
independent all system it just connects
to this messages out same for JavaScript
or whatever language you can think of
and I think that that's very interesting
interesting decoupling and interesting
way of decoupling language services and
ide services and extracting those
services out of existing justified E's
for example out of existing toolings
into those tiny little or maybe slightly
bigger cloud services that can run
headless in a cloud data center and give
you and provide you some service on on
your projects since those a sinking
messages and those components that are
exchanging those messages there's a
highly decoupled they do not really know
what is out there in the world which is
interesting and it's sometimes a bit
confusing sounds strange but as I said
this backup repository that's running
inside the cloud in the end it's just
one guy listening for those messages
right this one guy listening for all
there is the files five being changed
someone needs a file someone would like
to know the content of a project someone
else change the project whatever it
reacts to those messages and keep stuff
in sync so it's relatively easy to just
spin off a second one the second
repository a second pack of repository
or third one or whatever in a different
cloud region saying oh do the same I do
not need to change the other guys and
the other participants or whatever the
other the the second or third bank and
purposefully would just do the same
stuff for you but it would continue to
sink the stuff simply the other
repositories automatically things like
that because it would also just consume
and send out those acing messages which
i think is very interesting
and as we said you do not always want to
leave your your local tools behind and
that's that was one of the motivation
that we had for allowing you to continue
to use the identified II and the cloudy
tools and this interesting thing is now
for example if you continue to work on
your cloudy in your quality environment
but you would like to execute for
example something you would like to X
you're working on a maybe a very strange
example you're working on a rich cline
desktop application inside the cloud
right and you would like to execute that
and test that what do you do in a cloud
environment it doesn't make much sense
right bu you can start it inside the
cloud somewhere in some help machine
okay yeah it doesn't make much sense
it's not not really possible and
therefore we thought about the
interesting interesting additional
service that's running on your local
machine which is something like an
executor service it's more it's diving
now until this year well what we haven't
implemented yet but what what I our
ideas are about having additional
service it's running on my local machine
that is also keeping files and sync with
my with my cloud environment and is able
to execute my stuff for example on my
local machine if I want that to swing
stuff back from the cloud to my local
machine keep stuff in sync whenever I
press the button say run it calls out to
the service saying hey please run this
and if there is a service connected like
my local services running on my local
machine that is able to react to that
message saying oh yeah I can do that for
you I can run that could be an
interesting interesting use case and it
again shows how highly decoupled this
system is and if we take a look into the
future thinking about what is possible
based on this architecture and this idea
about building cloud development tools
that are connected to the desktop ID e
and are highly decoupled and the more
and more we think about it the more and
more ideas we we have about what's
possible using this architecture
and we just put up some some of our
ideas on the slide a that could be of
course the the collaboration service
right the service running inside the
cloud telling you all the time who else
in your in your team in your environment
or who else in the world is working on
on the same files as working on the same
project it's changing stuff for you in
parallel for example raising the
awareness of what's what's going on
behind the scenes because they could be
the service saying oh yeah I'm listening
to those messages and see oh there's
another guy working on the same project
and he's changing the interface and you
are working on the class maybe you
should chat maybe just Nick Justin just
an idea in addition to of course when we
talk about collaboration it is of course
possible to use this technology that we
built here and that we are continuing to
build for direct collaboration right so
if I would like to invite you saying hey
can you take a look at my coat John can
you take a look at my coat I have a
problem here I just sent you the UL
right you open up a browser and you're
looking at exactly in my file and we can
edit my file together you do not need to
set up anything you didn't need to set
up the whole environment you need to
clone the repository whatever you just
open up a browser and we work on the
same fight in my stuff right in my
environment in my project that i synced
by project that i hiding inside the
cloud with everything that i enabled for
this like the java tooling whatever and
maybe Jon Jon's not a Java developer but
a JavaScript guy so he never thought
about Java development we never
installed anything on this machine
whatever he's not interested in that but
but just handing him the URL he can
immediately work in the same space but
I'm working which i think is very just
interesting i quickly talked about the
cloud foundry service so a service that
is just while you're editing your files
and Mabel every time you press aide it's
continuously updating the application on
Cloud Foundry or some some other place
where you deploy your application
kicking off a continuous integration
build all the time for you for example
telling you whenever you press save
whenever you're
doing whatever i don't know maybe a bit
crazy but telling you when you're
breaking the build because the bid is
running inside the cloud and the
background all the time things like that
a whole I think a whole new world of
possibilities for development tools that
are connected to desta bodies and allows
you to to work with your pole with your
existing projects and start to work in
the cloud environment more or less right
now right you can you can just start
using this cloud tools now you don't
have to wait three four five more years
until the latest java refactorings are
there and stuff like that if you want to
do java development and do not want to
go back to the e makes level of doing
coding is this mic on ok i just want to
make one quick comment about this this
this vision picture that i thought about
while Martin was talking so if you think
back to that picture of the desktop
computer at the very beginning the the
key thing here is that the architecture
of the tools of that era were designed
for that environment so they were
monolithic they were statically linked
they were you know resident on one
machine that architecture of the tools
that we built in that era does not
translate to to the cloud to the web and
you know we actually know from
experience because we've tried it like
we've been at the club's foundation
there's been different projects working
on cloud-based development tools for
five or six years and we've tried many
different approaches and that
architecture that static monolithic
architecture just does not translate so
the fundamental thing that I'm really
excited about here is that I think we've
found an architecture that does I
actually translate to to the cloud to
the web that it is highly decentralized
decoupled very dynamic services can come
and go it is an architecture that we
believe is is perfectly suited to that
cloud environment
is a perfect foundation for building
tools that can take advantage of of the
cloud the way a lot of other software
you know takes advantage of it so the
status the status quo of the project at
Eclipse so the Eclipse flash project
it's still kind of a prototype code so
it's not production ready so please do
not do not go home and try to install
anything or use it in production or
things like that we are not there yet
we're working on it just to raise the
awareness of we're not making any
problems as above products and ready to
use code not yet and we would be very
happy to answer questions because I'm
sure there are questions I hope there
are questions please so we'll be very
happy to answer questions yes
yeah the question is when I invite my
colleague to look at my code SMD you l
am I able to see the keystrokes and
everything live even if it's a different
browser different machine different
place in the world yes it's like Google
Docs like you see the same stuff you see
live at it which is a very quickly quick
say that it is my stuff that I synced to
the cloud right I sent my project to the
cloud I can invite John to my project
and he would see my file if we both work
on the same project and say project he
would sink his stuff to the cloud I
would sink my stuff to the cloud right
so if he he would work on his stuff I i
do not see anything of the from that I
work on my step right I can send him the
UL and invite him to my stuff and that
he is looking at my synth-project inside
the cloud and we can both work on my
stuff and but it is not a replacement
for we exchange and all the changes
inside the team and work on one space
inside the old the whole team and get is
going away or something like that right
that's not that it's not meant to be a
replacement for version code or whatever
just my stuff hyster and we can exchange
your else say hey please ad-hoc take a
look at my code I invite you to my to my
to my file but it's not one space photo
for the whole team it's my space in his
space I think that that's an important
detail or our detail to not not create
confusion about all this is this is
making teamwork totally different than
today it's not right yeah I was just
going to say essentially the same thing
so it's there are very specific
scenarios where you want to do that
you're doing pair programming you're
doing code review where you'd want that
live environment where you're both
editing the same content but the default
and you know mode would be you know I
think most developers wouldn't want
files changing out from under them
without them aware of it right I mean
that's that would be
you know a nightmare it runs then next
time you try it doesn't run anymore what
the heck happened right so there are
very specific scenarios where you'd want
to be able to do that live collaboration
and there were times when you wouldn't
want to do that but this architecture
allows that live collaboration when you
want it
yep okay yeah yeah yeah so the question
is we haven't shown anything about as
version control source code control
committing to get whatever way is that
basically what it did end up the idea is
that it is totally off haga no to
anything like it or any version control
what we've shown right I can work from
the browser on my files on my project I
can work for my desktop if I would like
to commit my changes for example to get
I can go to my desktop machine and
commit changes to get as before or maybe
in the future and Orion has that already
I can go to the to the browser and have
some some of you I poor kid to say oh
what what files did I change in the
meantime since my last commit to get all
those hives a change I can commit them
to get so it is basically exactly as
before with the exception that you are
now you can you can commit from get from
the web and you can change your files
from the web and it's still exactly the
same all the time right which is
interesting because you need to make
this mechanism the sinking mechanism
between the worlds aware of the version
control otherwise it gets confused right
if you if you switch your branch engage
on your desktop machine it doesn't mean
that you change all your files it means
oh you switch your branch so the other
the cloudy world of the sinking make
this needs to be aware of it and tell
all the other participants like the
cloudy eight interesting oh you switch
the branch or get so they keep the get
state and sync as well yeah right just
to give a quick plug so the Orion
browser based tools actually has quite
good get a get support it has a very
advanced UI for that I don't think we
have time to demo it here but if you are
in a demo I could show it or there's
resources on the web that show it if you
want if you're using different source
control mechanisms
today there's no integration in the
browser but then you'd have to switch
back to eclipse for that yep yes well
what does version mean when you're
running on the web oh right so the Java
tooling capability you see here isn't
from Orion per se so what you saw today
was the Orion browser-based editor
connecting to eclipse JDT running as a
separate application out in the cloud
and interacting with the Orion editor
through through the flux message bus so
this Java tooling capability is quite
new it's very prototype as Martin said
and it's not something that comes with
Orion today it's something that you know
we're leveraging both oh ryan and
eclipse JDT to to show this today yeah
an Orion is able to show errors and
warnings but it is not able to produce
those arrows and borings for java for
example that's done in the cloud right
the Orion UI is just used in this case
as an editor component and as as the UI
facing side for this
yeah the question is here if we have
built a prototype for running mate
builds and running tests in the cloud
already no not yet yes it's called
Jenkins or ever Hudson I mean
effectively there's there's you know
integration servers like that out there
today and those are very natural tools
that you could you could plug into this
kind of environment for yeah but but the
idea would be too too too bright right
but you could imagine kicking off for
Jenkins billed automatically every few
minutes as someone's typing and
incorporating that feedback into the
development environment right that's not
something we do today but that's a very
natural extension of this yeah it for
the for the cloud foundry pushing the
application to California in this case
for example what we done is we integrate
the Maven built into the build cake on
Cloud Foundry so you can just push am a
project to class boundary and the maven
build is run on Cloud Foundry executing
the test once everything is good it is
kind of deploying the application on
Cloud Foundry it's another option that
you have but it's not ready to use
component here and then the connection
to Jenkins or hearts know whatever is
also not built yet it's just thought of
more questions
otherwise we whistle here for a moment
and I'll just quickly explain the
pointers at the bottom here so there's
both a wiki and a link to the github
source code for flux so all of this
everything you saw today is open source
you know really open source you're free
to join in and contribute to it and and
use it in whatever way you want it's
very liberally licensed you can check it
out there the link at the very bottom is
a link to this presentation so if you
want to look through it again and
there's this presentation actually has
links in it to various aspects of the
demo that you can try it yourself so
that's available for you cool hope you
like it and thanks for coming and enjoy
the rest of the conference thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
