to wake up so it's always a difficult
slot because you know that's the first
one of the day with the jet lag I was
coming from Paris I was awake at three
so I'm awake I'm ready to deliver some
sleep snippets of knowledge etc around
groovy who's a groovy user in the room
everybody all right that's great who
knows about me yeah if you say I'm gium
lefort I've been working on the groovy
project for the past 12 years so that's
quite a bit of time I also co-authored a
few chapters of this book Ruby in action
that's the second edition which was out
which was released in June I think and
that was special promo codes ctw Java
one in case you want to buy it for think
you get the thirty-nine percent of the
list price
that's good opportunity to buy it and I
I'm going to get rich you know I get
like 50 cents per book so yeah beside
working on Ruby nights and weekends and
think like that I work for a small
company a small start-up called restlet
which specializes in AP is so we have
different products and projects around
api testing api platforms forest in your
AP is or web api is et cetera so if you
want to know a little bit more about
that go to rest let calm and i gave a
presentation on monday on groovy and
rest you can mix both together so you
will be able to watch it afterwards when
it's online
okay so as I said I have 12 years of
groovy experience you won't find many
people in the field with more experience
than that obviously the project is only
these are already 12 years old so if you
see someone with you know 13 or 14 years
experience it's gotta be surprising but
wait with this experience i'd like to
distill a bit of what i call the let's
say the good the idea matic groovy style
of writing groovy code so in this
presentation so it's not just you know
that fashionable bits of code but I'll
try to give you some show some puzzles
house certain features of groovy can be
used together to build something
interesting so I will explain some
features but the combination of those
features add even more value there are
something certain gems certainly AP is
that are interested interesting to use
and yeah with the this experience I hope
my advice will be interesting because
once you've worked with groovy for a
number of years you noticed certain
things how the bed the best way to use
types for instance although it's a
language that can be both statically
compiled as well as totally dynamic if
you will so you have to find the right
balance etc so that's the kind of
feedback i want to i want to give you
today okay so i'll try to so there are
many many or let's say features pieces
of advice etc that i'm going to show you
but i'm going to illustrate each of
these elements with a little quiz ok so
the quiz will be i will be showing you
an image which tries to be somehow
representative of what i'm going to
speak about and you'll have to guess
what i'm going to speak about just by
looking at the image so some will be
pretty obvious some will be much harder
so we'll see so if i show you that's
just too warm okay so if i show you that
what that does it ring a bell for you
what's the relationship with that and
groovy
anyone knows don't be shy in the space
yeah what kind of the heichal is is no
it's not I I could have been hurt
Francis yeah save that one for later now
it's the spaceship operator we have a
spaceship operator for doing comparisons
so it's like calling a the compareto
method this special spaceship operator
so if you if you do a spaceship operator
B it's going to return minus 10 or +1
depending on the weather aob is bigger
than the other they are comparable so
that's the kind of quiz I'm gonna make
you know I'm gonna show you a picture
and you'll have to guess ok so the
spaceship operator one of the the
operators that really provides which Don
existing job so the the content of this
presentation is based essentially on
this document here that is available on
the groovy website so if you have a look
at this one you get as well more
explanations of these various features
elements of style etc so you just go
click on the documentation and then
there's a link to the style guide ok are
you ready yeah good let's go ok so an
easy one
no a semicolon yes the semi column so in
groovy the semi column is optional you
don't have to use it so usually when you
you know start going groovy so big
something for the few who don't agree
very much I mean groovy deriving from
the Java syntax we accept pretty much
any Java syntax that's also valid groovy
code basically but one of the first
things people learn about Groovies that
you can drop semicolon so in this class
so there's a hello class greet method
some private field etc I mean you don't
need those semicolon so you can remove
them okay so that's the first little
lesson of the day so who's still using
semicolons in there groovy code is there
anyone no good please don't so except
you know for things like if you want to
put two statements in this on a single
line perhaps you might be you know you
might need semicolons or yeah but that's
basically it usually you just don't need
semicolons are oh so don't use them oh
this one okay that's microphone yeah
this one is bit tougher to guess
had difficulties finding a good image
for representing that so what could it
be any guess I wouldn't be often did if
you didn't find this one so let's say
someone like me speaking in front of an
audience okay making a public
representation so this is about the no
no no save this one for later on no
that's about public you know public
speaking etc the public key word by
default in groovy all classes and
methods are public so you can actually
emit the public key word so just to show
the difference between the two so public
class public hello for the constructor
public string greet for the method I can
just remove the three public modifiers
okay so by default I mean when you
create a class we want to use it when
you create a method you want to use it
so by default we decided that class
isn't method should be public so you
just omit public if you want to be
explicit you can still use public
obviously but usually
we just omitted and for things like you
know protected private etc keep on using
those modifiers obviously if you want to
you know keep things I encapsulated or
having a method being able to be
overridden in subclasses et cetera so
continue to use private and protected as
appropriate but for public classes
methods you don't need the the public
key word help yes I yes that's a very
good question i usually get this one so
and it's also in combination with
another feature which is the gooery
properties great properties as I'm going
show later on when you say a class
person string name it's not actually a
field it's a groovy property meaning
that there's a private field and getter
and setter which are generated for you
by the groovy compiler but then it looks
as if the property would be packaged
scope but it's not the case because it's
a property so it is especially in that
situation where you might be missing
something like package scope and
actually so that's one of the little
differences with Java if you want to say
something like a method a field etc its
package scope you have to use an
annotation so you use at package scope
to make things well packaged up with
that visibility okay
so here I also remove the so in this
example I private static spray message
private string name and hear what's
happening if I remove that's why I was
mentioning properties if I remove the
modifier on the fields that we have here
naturally what's happening is that the
groovy compiler generates getters and
setters for these fields backed by the
private field and the hood so it works
both for static as well as non-static
fields of properties and the compiler
will take care of generating getters and
setters and starting killers and setters
for the massage example so that's why in
this case if you will the notation frog
for properties is this string name but
if it were in Java you would have
created a package scoped field but it's
a real difference with Java here okay
so far so good yep good
okay so this one is a bit tricky what am
I going to speak about here and there's
a there's a trigger I'm gonna give you a
hint so I'm actually French and I don't
have such a strong French accent right
but when the French people speak with
the French accent there are all sounds
they don't pollute correctly so sounds
like a good one like when of it when a
French guy says I think therefore I am
the is going to pronounce I think zepho
I am so it's like thinking like you know
the Titanic way basically and sounds
like the so I should try to find another
word to not give you the final hint a
thorough
thorough the friend guy would say sorrow
just like you know the trying to find a
synonym for that so or think and sing or
the or sometimes using an F instead of
thur so that that's kind of the hint I'm
trying to give you there so what does it
evoke for you especially you know the
life passes and at the end that's death
so it's not about death but if you say
it with some more of a French accent
french guy might be saying death so it's
about the DEF keyword okay so this part
okay let go on I I I couldn't find
something about death lift lift lift I
was like okay I'm fresh I'm gonna joke
about my accent so it's about the DEF
keyword so sometimes I told because
groovy can be dynamically typed you can
basically put death everywhere def def
message def def method definition that
property
a parameter a method parameter etc you
could put def everywhere so in this
example I put you know private debt
string def hello def string name
everywhere but actually once you have a
modifier once you have a type etc death
isn't actually not required so you
should just get rid of the clothes
redundant death keywords they are really
not needed which makes the code a bit
lighter and actually there was a debate
or a long time ago but whether we should
let the compiler through some kind of
compilation error for people using def
when you know it's not needed so we we
didn't want to break people's code but
perhaps at some point we'll decide to
make the compiler more no more grumpy
and complain about over use of death
that said there are places where it's
totally fine to use death and especially
for things like local variables inside
method bodies you should definitely use
deaf because groovy is totally happy
with that a compiler is happy with that
and even if you use static compilation
the static compilation mode in groovy
there's this type type inference going
on so you don't need to specify the type
of variables etc so i usually use def
inside method bodies or inside script
but are rarely used f actually elsewhere
okay so this one is a very
straightforward one the return key word
there's no wealth is not there is a
return key well obviously but you don't
have to use it it's also optional so
return is optional in my greet method I
can just say I'm going to remove it can
just say that I want to reach on that
string that's a interpolated string and
you know how those interpolated strings
are called in in gruene the g string so
some people say it's the sexiest feature
of the language
anyway you can get rid of the the return
key word here and there are places where
you usually use it for instance in as
part of the code style of the groovy
code base we often use early returns so
we check you know conditions parameters
or if something then we return right
away instead of doing if then else kind
of block so that we know we return
quickly from the beginning of a method
so for those cases if you use that code
style if you want to return early in a
new method inside the closure it said
well you have to use the return key word
but otherwise the last expression which
is evaluated at the end of the method or
of a closure that's the value that's
going to be returned by that method or
closure and it also works for things
like if else so here let's say I want to
return different values according to
what I get in my name parameter so I
don't have to say return 1 return to
return minus 1 I can just say won 2-1
although the last thing in that method
is a statement if Elsie of else is a
statement but the last value the last
expression which is evaluated that the
branch we're going into basically so
that's why won 2-1
returned but unlike some other languages
there are non which is where constructs
like 'if else etc actually have a value
but here it's a statement statement
doesn't have a value but the fact that
there are expressions which are
evaluated at the end of that statement
we return the values in those branches
that are evaluated another example and
that's one of one of the cases where I
might be using semicolons by the way in
this example with switch case so I
switch over the name case red case green
default etc again it's a statement but
the the last thing which is evaluated
that's the the K value 1 2-1 so again I
don't have to use the return key word
here it's not mandatory and yeah I've
always thought that the break keyword
was a bit ugly perhaps someday we might
have some other pattern matching
construct or things like that but we you
know we took what we had from C Java etc
and you've got this ugly break keyword
but we got used to it I guess
another place where you can use the
optional return rule is also with
try-catch so here I'm going to parse its
string and see if it's a an integer so
I'm going to return true if it's an
integer if it's not integer there's
going to be an exception thrown then I'm
going to return false it's not an
integer and i might have you know some
finally statement so depending on
whether the tripod succeeds or not i'm
going to reach on true or I'm gonna
return false but note that even if there
were value here in the finally block we
don't return anything from the final
debug so it's really just from the try
part or the catch part that you can
actually return somebody but there's no
value being returned there and i'm using
the groovy hazard statement to check
that ok is int 1 2 3 yes that lint and
ABC is not an int so yep that's it well
actually there's a big mistake there
because it should be up oops like this
it's not a certain asset it's a cert the
sorry yeah that's what I said finally
box don't return about you okay so this
one is an easy one on someone already
mentioned it so parents is this so we're
not going to speak about least for
something like that you know with the
nested bananas but yeah you can omit
parenthesis in statements like these so
printing hello world I can remove the
parents there okay so usually there are
places where you cannot completely get
rid of all the parents especially when
you you have more complex expressions
but for top-level statements and
something I'm going to explain
afterwards you can get rid of them and
this one is interesting so what do you
see here move forward at three perhaps I
should have converted into miles per
hour yeah well you know where I come
from I speak in kilometer per hour so
move forward at three kilometer per hour
is actually valid Ruby syntax and I used
this rule of parents optional parents
for this feature that we we call common
chains it's a way of chaining method
calls and getting rid of parents and
actually dots so this one is actually
parsed like this so it's move
movies method right that's in the name
of the method move takes one parameter
forward this value move forward is what
is written by this method call is going
to be some value on which there is an at
method and that add method takes some
parameter and this parameter this
expression it's 3 km is actually a
shortcut for the property notation so
it's exactly like three dot get km
parents and the the slash is actually
the division operator and H is some
constant and I'm actually here combining
several little tricks together so first
of all carbon chains are really about
method chaining and where you can drop
the parents on the dots plus I'm using
the shortcut notation for properties a
dot km is equivalent to get km parents
parents I also use the trick of being
able to add properties to any type I
dynamically or statically it's possible
as well so i can add properties methods
etc two numbers in groovy the fourth
trick being used there is operator of
loading you can do operator overloading
with groovy it's a simple convention as
long as you follow the convention here
to be able to use this / you have to
have
deve method on your type okay so three
dot cam might be returning you know some
distance you need distance instance or
something like that and on this class
you would have a div method so that you
can use operator overloading so here I
used four or five tricks to make this
statement and what's interesting when
you mix all those things together is
that you're able to write let's a pet
topic of mine dsl's domain-specific
languages it's very easy to build
English life sentences without all the
although it's a syntactical noise of
parents and dolls etc so it looks yes
how do I handle one nullpointerexception
yep so here later on I'll speak about a
special operator for that but here
indeed if let's say move forward returns
something know you'll get a
nullpointerexception just as if you had
used the this expression bill those two
are really equivalent and you'd get the
same no pointer exception if there's
something knowing the chain yeah when
i'll come back to a no point of that's
an interesting question and we provide
some interesting tricks game okay and
another little one where i combine named
arguments in groovy you can have a
parameter argument to to your methods
which are named and for that we use the
key column value syntax just like in
maps that i'm going to mention
afterwards so this one is interesting
because it looks like
the center is separating until check
that and wine tastes good as if it were
to you know separate things but the way
it's parsed actually is like this so it
again to come on chain so we change
method call but the the perimeter of the
check method is named argument so that
Cullinan wine is an argument that we
pass to check this is Rick this is
returning some value on which I can call
taste method which takes good as
parameter so again nice treat for doing
dsl's business rules etc which are
pretty readable even for you know
subject matter experts etc so again
that's a combination of two features
together to make things pretty readable
and concise another one which is
interesting so it's not so much about
removing the parents but when you have a
trailing closure which the last argument
of your method is a closure the closure
can be put outside of the parents so
here I'm creating a kind of statement
which looks like an if statement so
unless the condition is met then I'm
printing something and it looks like an
if statement but you know reversed if
statement because the the condition is
reversed and the thing is that I didn't
have to write it like this unless P
limit then
well coma and the the enclosure argument
I was able to put the closure outside of
the parents and then it just looks like
an if statement so we can create your
own control structures that looks like
that look like native control structures
thanks to this deal trick of being able
to put the the closure outside initially
we didn't have that name trailing
closure name for that feature but it's a
language that took inspiration from
groovy which copied that feature and
code it training for sure so that's why
now I call that trading closure and
which long wait is that that's Swift the
new language from Apple they borrowed
this feature from the groovy language
and we'll see later on that some other
features in some other languages like C
sharp will be coffeescript Swift I've
taken some inspiration there from the
work with them so it makes me proud
because you know big companies are you
know like Apple or Microsoft are looking
at groovy for inspiration that's you
know quite humbling and please okay next
and what is that yeah a class classroom
so I'm going to speak about classes in
groovy classes us o clock yeah class is
our first class citizen so I'm not just
being able you know to define classes
but to to to refer to the class of some
class so let's say here I've got this
resources response and I want to have
the class of that class name somehow so
in Java you do resources response dog
class to get the class okay but in
groovy it's you can just have resource
response like this without the dot class
and sometimes we're in our examples i
have shown for this one is when you use
annotations and you pass classes as
parameters of your annotations sometimes
a bit verbose to to pass a list of
classes so food art class come about
class etc such a bit more concise you
can just say ok resources response
instead of resources responsible class
or two small small deal thank
haha
so this is a dog but a special dog sorry
no yeah I'm interesting him I didn't
think about that good idea no not us so
think about dog breeds the particular
breed of dog it's a yeah setter and I'm
gonna speak back getters and setters but
not the dogs so I was mentioning
properties in greer what we call
properties it's the fact that you don't
have to so you create you know in Java
you create private fields then you
create a setter method get your method
it set around especially for those dumb
getters and setters which don't do
anything particular groovy the crew v c
compiler can generate that burger place
code for you directly so instead of
doing that you you can just say class
person string name into age and that's
totally equivalent to that that's really
the same thing at the bytecode level the
bytecode we generate is exactly the same
so it's much shorter much more concise
and what's interesting as well oh yeah
it's something i wanted to mention
before this over the channel that is
that if you want to specify getter and
setter obviously the groovy compiler
won't override your own getter and
setter so you can steal let's say you
want to
you want to do access on some lazy
loading of because the property is
complex to evaluate or something like
that you can still do get and inside the
implementation of that Gator you do the
lazy loading etc or caching etc so here
the little nugget I wanted to mention
the icing on the cake is if you add
certain annotations special annotation
that we call a ste transformation
because those annotations actually
trigger some code transformations if you
add add immutable for instance to that
class at immutable class person string
name int age it's going to implement the
mutability pattern directly I mean
that's the compiler that's going to do
the job for you so it's going to make
the class final it's going to make the
fields final private etc it's going to
generate equals to string methods
hashcode methods what else if some
properties were collections it will do
defensive copying so that someone
getting the you know the list of pets or
something like that someone with a
reference to that list good add pets to
it so you have to be careful with that
and use copies of those collections so
that the class believe is immutable and
you cannot change anything so just with
adding new table you save literally
probably like 50 lines of code to
implement
the immutability as by the book
effective java if you will so it's much
more concise and that's the compiler
that does this implementation that pipe
cogeneration under the hood so add
canonical is similar to immutable except
that it's for mutable so it generates
equals ash code etc but you can still
mutate things that's the difference
between immutable and canonical I
already mentioned the property notation
actually when I showed 3 km kilometers
so when you have a property string name
you can say P dot name to actually call
together and if you use if you do an
assignment p dot H it's like calling the
setter so PHP name that's a way of
accessing the property I said get
through together or through the setter
and the other interesting thing here is
also the the use of the named argument
so you see name guillaume age 37 and
it's actually an interesting shortcut as
well because it's not a special
constructor but it's going to call the
default person constructor and then in
turn it will call the setter and the
what set name with guillaume set age
with 37 and it's just in one line of
code you do the instantiation and then
calling the the setters afterwards so
it's a shortcut and all
haha what is this couple doing they're
having an argument right
so again that's the the named argument
constructor that I showed just before
and we also saw it already with check
that wine tastes good that Colin wine
was an end argument is there no I
thought that was what else you don't
want to show you something yeah what's
interesting as well is bounced i can
show you some you know life do some live
coding as well something so i'm going to
use the groovy console let's say i have
a method i'm not going to be very
creative okay full and i want to call
fool with some named argument so if i do
that it's going to tell me okay no
signature foo is applicable for
argument's linked hashmap hmm
interesting link touch map so if i have
actually a map there and i'm going to
print the content is it is it big enough
by the way it's readable from the back
because otherwise i can just tell with
the shortcut i can increase one bit more
okay so if i do print on em okay each
time you use a named argument there's a
cold convention if you will that all the
names arguments you're using info for
that phone so whether i use parents or
not is irrelevant them so if i do that
or even add several several named
arguments all the arguments are going to
be put inside that map so if you if if
you want to support that kind of syntax
let's say you know dsl
wherever you have to have a map to
collect the all those named arguments
and the the keys will be obviously those
a B and C and the values one two three
what's interesting as well is what
happens if you have let's say a nun
named argument let's say fool and in the
middle you might have a bar and then
whatever so what kind of signature this
method is going to call oh it's a bit
bigger help if you look at the so it's
not very readable visits spread across
several lines but actually look at this
point that really defines what you'd
expect in terms of signature all the
names arguments are put inside the map
and all the non dem named arguments come
afterwards so I'd have to do let's say
string s1 string it's two scoops string
as three to make it work and then I well
I could print s1 s2 it three that you
can trust me print on s 1 i'm going to
use g strings up to our s2 door and 3 so
that you really trust me full bar
whatever so that's the code convention
that we have here so that I mean even if
you write the full method in Java
because brewery and jaw really worked
well together so you can have mix and
match you know groovy and Java together
have a let's say Java interface you
implement the interface in groovy then
you extend that class in Java that kind
of things you can do that very easily
thanks to the degree joint compiler yeah
so that's that's about it named argument
can mix named arguments with non named
arguments as well and the convention is
to have the the map as the first
parameter yep
no yeah here it's actually a map a map
it's uh let me think about it it's just
a map be a map of object or string
object straight for the kill yeah yeah
yeah so the really the the keys are
always i think the for instance if i
import Rudy I'm gonna check something
compiler static and if i compile static
that one is going to be happy yeah it's
gonna be well but let's do something
more clearer like like like like what
let's let's say s1 or no no no yeah m
the method on int what do we have trying
to find a special method that's on int
but on integer but not on let's say own
string
do you have an idea add
too hmm okay map at oh yeah no that's
the map sorry I need to retrieve the of
course the let's say the a parameter for
OEM to to get access to the the keys you
can either do that or you can do this
okay oops so if I do that yeah so now
the we could actually infer that in
terms of type inference when you use
static compilation it's something we
could be adding I think because we well
on the other hand there's nothing that
differentiate a map from a map taking
named arguments so perhaps we need some
additional hint like you know at named
args or something so that the compiler
figures out it's a special map for named
named arguments so now it's really just
a map of objects right that's the next
one question okay another one another
interesting transformation that the the
Builder transformation you often see
these days fluent api's with chain
method calls for building objects
instantiated objects so here we
implement the build that kind of builder
or fluent interface pattern and we we
have so there are actually different
strategies for implementing that pepper
and we support those strategies by
increasing some special parameters to ad
builder annotation but by default views
ad builder it's going to generate
something like that so you get some some
builder class and which can call name
gium age 38
then equal build to fully instantiate
the instance and there are different
approaches so here that's a static
method on the person class that was
added but you can also create a
depending on the strategy you use can so
create an external class of person
builder class you can what else you
don't remember the various start oh yeah
the chain setters here it's dog named um
that age 38 etc but you could have had a
dot set named Gil and it's not a normal
javabean setter in the sense that setter
is normally don't return a value but you
could make the sailors return the
Builder so that you can change that so
it could be set named Young's dots at
age 38 etc so there are different
strategies depending on the study of
prefer
okay so look at the the topping more
than the cake itself like a cake what
does it look like
the equal sign yeah so equals so when
you do a equals equals B in groovy it's
pretty much just like calling dot equals
I say pretty much because movies bit
smarter and actually it's another
difference with Java because usually the
the double equals is for you know
pointer equality or if it's a primitive
type but here that's a difference
because equals the equally home is like
calling equals but it's like because I
said it's like it's not the same because
groovy dial is a bit clearer in the
sense that it checks if something is no
on especially in on the left side so
that there's no null pointer exception
thrown if something is no I especially
on the left side because a equal equal B
is like calling a dot equals B and if a
is no you would get a null pointer
exception but groovy checks that the
left side is not known so this where you
see here status not know and status
equals control studies completed is just
equivalent to just status equal equal
control studies completed ok
so this is a this is handy it makes a
you know if conditions a bit clearer etc
hey
so quotes and where do you use quotes in
programming languages for defining
strings so I already mentioned the
groovy g-strings interpolated strength
so when you use a double quotes and you
use a dollar inside I get back there and
so when you do let's say that name
equals Guillaume oops and then print
name up name
this one is a simple string but this one
with the double quotes or all those
dollar something inside the curly brace
is it's going to interpolate the value
from the variable or the expression that
is there so here if I do print line name
name it's going to write name diem okay
but there's a little difference in that
this with single quotes is actually a
plane string okay so you have to be
careful with what kind of strain you're
using and here the advice I wanted to
give is to be a bit more explicit when
you have string constants which are pure
java.lang.string i usually use single
quotes to be explicit but if I had done
yeah I could show you that as well if I
had done let's say a print plan named
class okay it's a java.lang.string but
even if i use double quotes it's also
java.lang.string the compiler is clever
enough to figure out that there's no
string interpolation going on okay so
here it's a g-string so in internal
class don't don't bother too much body
and especially everywhere you can pass a
string let's say you've got a method
you know void my print string fool and
then print landfill although or and I
yeah although of the my print name
although my print name takes a string
here it's a g-string but it's going to
convert automatically g string into a
string so you don't have to worry about
whether it's sort of challenge string or
is it is it a groovy string yeah so
usually yet the advice for this line is
really to use single quotes when you use
string constants to make things more
obvious ok this one
what kind of building is it about sorry
scaffolding yeah interesting I heard
another proposal what was it a frame my
frame know so I was trying to go
illustrate data structures so it's a
structural metallic structure okay but
you know what could you use you know for
structure I don't know scaffolding was a
great great idea by the way yeah so
native syntax for data structures a list
is a comma separated list of elements
surrounded by square brackets so it's
pretty readable in Seville just like
that in some some other languages as
well you can also define ranges with
this double dot operator so it's a range
of strings from A to B and groovy is
going to figure out how to go from A to
B because we don't create a list of 20
of well perhaps I and could use a bigger
list because this list actually contains
only two elements a and B but if I did
let's say 1 2 1,000,000,000,000 I
wouldn't generate a list of 1 trillion
elements it's it's implementing the list
interface but internally it just
remembers the upper bound and lower
bound okay so if you iterate with the
elements of that least you'll go through
the other trillion elements but it's
just a sequence of things and you can
also create your own sequences if your
method contains next method if they're
so if you follow that convention of
having a type with the next
method because it needs to go through
you know the least one after the other
and figure out what the next element
after the current one so this is a range
there's also a variation with double dot
less than sign because here it contains
the the upper bound as well but if you
want to exclude the the upper bound you
can use the less than sign here and
that's also the syntax that Swift Apple
Swift again chose to borrow from group
for maps we we saw already the the named
argument so that it's bit like named
arguments again inside square brackets
we also have support for regular
expressions with the tilt operator and
we can write strings with those slashes
and it allows you to avoid you have to
double backslash things to you know
double escape things special characters
so it's it's quite handy so this is the
the special data structures well regular
expression is not really a structure but
some native syntax for a concept which
already exists in the window JK
okay what is it about tool kit I heard
and what else I heard something on the
left as well now so keep the tool kit
especially the GDK the groovy
development kit the groovy development
kit and I've got a I've got a browser
below here if you go to the groovy
documentation you click on the groovy
development kit here the king and it
lists all the classes that groovy
enhances with additional methods so
let's say you go in the Java yo package
and on file for instance we ID'd and
where is it a get text get text method
so on a file you can just go get text or
dot txt with the property notation you
can do file dot txt to retrieve the full
content of a file if it's not too big
and if it if it holds in the memory but
yeah you can retreat the full content of
a fine with just one pole without having
you know to iterate over the content or
you know opening a stream opening a
reader reading over each line up ending
things together etc now you just have to
go to call dot txt or get text to get
the content of a fight so there are many
shortcuts like that that you can have a
look and learn and benefit from let's
say some other example that could show
you things like
sometimes for nice display you could use
a pepper pepper where is it who is it
called a pad pad left but i know its own
car sequence i think worst cars cars car
sequence on consequence we ID'd things
like center if you want to center a
string let's say you've got a space for
12 20 characters and the string is only
five characters you want to put some
Bank on the left on the right there are
utility methods like like this in the
Guru development and some others which
are more useful than that probably but
you know have a look at this once in a
while and see if there are some useful
methods for you know simplifying I don't
know how you use walking cues for
accessing and also the content of remote
URL you can do dot txt to do an HTTP GET
to remote URL that's the kind of
shortcut that that has been added to
java classes from the jdk okay so i know
you're GDK lots of grooviness in there
okay it's a switch a switch statement in
ruby is a bit you know more advanced you
can switch on more things than the
standard java switch so we can switch on
numbers on strings actually on I think
it's in Java 7 that you can also
switch on strength I think on classes so
it's equivalent to having instance of
string if you put the least in the case
statement it's like if you if you had
case one case to case three one over the
other so it checks that o is part of
that list so it's like stacked cases but
in just one single line you can also
check that the two string representation
of that object matches the regular
expression and if known of the above
suits you you can also define a closer
and it's like doing up less than three
and then you're inside that case we can
use more values or more k statements to
you to check against yeah
yeah so if ya in this case so the return
is only when the switch is the last
expression of a method first first
element second thing is that yeah in
this case the the thing with with brake
is that if you if you're inside in that
case it's not going to evaluate the
other cases but you might have two cases
for which something is true okay so
perhaps here it's one two three but here
I could have it equals equals 1 2 3 so
two cases could match ok so here you
need to break if you want to return the
first one and not going through all the
other cases it's going to return it
should be returning the the last one
actually because it's still going to if
there's no break and if there are two
cases which are similar it was
so here here this is not really yeah the
example is not ideal in this case indeed
so if i do a simpler example def the
quote something switch but you're right
you two to ask that question because
it's not really the example is a bit
simplified k is one print line one k is
you know it equals one print line
closer okay and if I do that it's going
to go through the first one it matches
and then it goes to the second one it
matches too so that's why I had to use
the the break in case of you know but
perhaps that's what I want perhaps that
what you wanted okay yeah get rid of the
print line
now one yeah but here it's not yeah so
if I so I have to put that inside a
method okay so that the return optional
return applies ok so I do em I call em
what's wrong yeah I need to pass the the
value so it's oh yeah oh you're right
actually oh yeah I have to break yeah my
god let's see
yeah but i need to you know assert
something because it's not all print
print print print print line
Oh what's going on
print Lynn
now I'm surprised is there an obvious
mistake there oh whoa what's going on
no no that's the point of trying when is
it in primary yeah just one fine yeah
but printings I'm supposed to be
returning so the switch statement is the
last expression evaluated inside that
method so here it should be returning
something so that's right I'll have to
investigate look because that's not what
I expected right thanks for pointing
that okay next so yeah oh I already I
didn't go through everything and I'm
already through the time so it's about
import aliasing sites aliasing you can
do some shortcuts when let's say you
have two classes with the same name you
can give the class in all the name so
just do as something to say okay that's
that's the new name and for things like
constants which are very very long
sometimes that's nice to be able to have
a shortcut so that the code is more
readable and it also works with static
imports so here i'm importing the parse
in static method on integer and i can
call it so a2 I like in C languages so
I'm just quickly going through some of
these examples without letting you guess
it's about the truth when you square the
truth so everything that's no empty void
0 etc can be evaluated to boolean false
value and otherwise what's not know
of length more than zero etc and non
zero can be evaluated to true everywhere
you know method or an if statement
etcetera where you have a Brean value
you can pass any expression which is not
a boolean it's going to be coerced into
a boolean value and you can also
customize the truth that's interesting
for politicians if you follow the
convention of having a boolean as
boolean method in your class you can
define how class can be or an instance
of a class can be coerced into a boolean
value so here an account is coerced to
true if it's not disabled in scores to
false if the account is disabled okay
very quickly that because i wanted to i
just mention this one safe navigation
for null pointer exceptions that we
mentioned earlier we've got a nice
feature which is the ability to shortcut
all this into this with this ? dot
notation so if anything is no inside
that chain it's going to be returning no
value so you don't have a null pointer
exception it's going to return null
value and the last thing I wanted to say
about this one is that even if you did
order get customer get address and not
using this safe navigation operator
which has been borrowed by Swift and
Ruby is going to add it by the way
mobile language that stole something
from us if something is no usually in in
in Java you get just no point of
exceptional value message but here it
would say something like okay I can't
get the account called get customer on
something that's not so you know where
the null pointer actor actually comes
from so that's very useful feedback for
figuring out where no important
exceptions are
and well that's bread basically
basically if there's a nice assert
statements which shows a very nice graph
somehow or tree of all the sub
expressions of an asset statement so
that's coming from the Spock testing
framework I had a slide on the Elvis the
Elvis operator which is a kind of
shortcut for the chunari operator for
default values so if this is no or
course to false you can use a default
value and the two last things you can
omit the exception so catch any he's
going to coach any exception and someone
suggested me to call it mo to do you
know catch em all this one is funny so
it's coaching exceptions but not a
throwable so it's really just for
exceptions and the last advice this one
contract that's really the last one when
it mention it's great to use x 4 method
signatures properties field editor
inside method bodies you can use def no
worries but it's good for using types
for Java interoperability type inference
we use static compilation for
documenting your IP is for code
completion refactoring etc it's better
to use types and be explicit about the
types you use thanks a lot i had one
last line for thanking you thanks so
much for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
