refers to not only me obviously but the
whole load your team and loggia is is an
open source product that that I've been
working with for for a number of years
now and it's purely Java fix so when I
come to think about it I don't know of
any any team in the world that's been
using Java affects more than than we do
but I'm probably wrong you know but I so
contact me later but we have we have
been using javafx a lot just one graphic
too so that's why I thought you know I
wanted to to share some experiences
there's a lot of I think there's a lot
of Oracle talks about cool little if the
stuff you can do with your FX and this
could be kind of a contrast to that so
how many here have been using geo
effects Oh splendid that's great because
this the thought of this session is to
its kind of intermediate not not
beginner session really i'm not going to
explain what your life fixes and how it
differs from swaying etcetera okay
moving on this is the agenda that I've
been thinking of as you're going to use
today so introduction our experiences
examples of java fix usage and then our
tools and that's open source tools that
we have created when we when we have
been developing our own software so
about me I'm developer and the product
owner a blow-dry and work in stockholm
sweden for a company called smart where
software
I work with javafx for about three years
here's some contact I guess these slides
will be downloadable so if you whoops so
here ya hope loggia is an open source
load testing tool it's the sister
application of soapy I how many I've
heard about Sookie I cool so it's soap
there is for testing just to give you a
context so it varies for testing web
services such as rest and soap
functionally to see if they work and low
GI is see if they perform load testing
tool and this is just an architectural
image kind of the technologies we use so
up in the right corner you see the this
stuff we used to for for the layouts and
graphics and we used h2 database
etcetera etcetera our experiences so why
we shoot javafx okay so here's the story
we we had so p I those kind of did the
start the beginning of the company but
we wanted to create a low testing tool
because we we have a low testing in
soapy about it we we wanted to expand
that we didn't think it's really fitted
and we need we had also had a vision
about how low testing could be how we
envision load testing and this was back
in 2009 so here's a look at the
competition back then this is this was
and still is the market dominant in
performance testing a load testing it's
an HP product it's a some few takeaways
from the UI is that it's static once
once you have a test started once you
start
let's see how this server performs at
this web service it performs it's
completely studied you can change
anything and you don't get a lot of
feedback some feedback and personally I
don't think it's too pretty so another
big player that you might have used who
recognize it yeah it's jmeter open
source it's the same thing it's a static
once the test it started you can't
change anything you can just stop the
test basically it's clearly in swing and
not very sexy eater I think so what we
did was we hired a UX designer we didn't
have any anyone for for soap yang maybe
it doesn't surprise you it and we told
him our ideas about flows and you know
load coming here users coming here and
then this wire here and then all these
ideas were inspired by tools like or
software like propeller Driessen are the
Swedish company they then make music
sequencers so there you have like wires
going into the synthesizer and you know
the drum machine and also yahoo pipes
which is a mash-up web app i guess for
for connecting RSS feeds and filtering
and stuff so he started to drawing this
UX designer in Illustrator and ended up
with this Illustrated draft so this is
pre-release almost pre you know writing
any code at all so at this time we had
no job FX experience we were pure swing
shop so and we knew enough swing to know
that this would be extremely hard to
implement and I think you do too so we
started looking at this new framework
2009 called javafx and it was
Geographics one at this point we ended
up with this as I believe it's the first
version of vulgar or a beta version yes
so Joe FX had had proven to be very
flexible and easy to style you didn't
have to kind of hack to you know get
what you wanted are you exercise I could
draw whatever you want it and we can
make it happen without feeling you know
have this dirt if you think that you're
kind of forcing the framework to do
something it doesn't want to do so this
was nice and the user service tell us
that the U is a competitive advantage of
all yang it's one of the reasons why
people first try it and yes so it's it's
and I think this is this is coming more
and more and you can blame that phone if
you want to but people users expect
nice-looking and well fought at you ice
you can't get away with new software
that looks crap
so the great migration and this refers
to the migration from javafx 12 javafx
to because less than one week after loei
10 was released oracle announced that
they would discontinue Geographic script
which was the only language you can
write could write javafx one in ok so
Java ethics one completely different
story from ufx to write it it wasn't
pure Java API is but it was a specific
script language or programming language
to to define the layout and logic and we
had at this point we had forty thousand
lines of JavaScript and our managers had
no plans to migrate this code of course
there's no business case really if you
you know if you would be in a manager
you wouldn't have done it either because
we had a first version and we we wanted
to start start seeing some people using
it but but we thought that of course we
could we could hang on to Jeffy's one
for a while until we want to migrate
ourselves but then we saw this on the
java fix blog this was a few years later
so this wouldn't worry you maybe if this
was Microsoft saying we end of life
windows XP you're like well I can use it
as long as I want anyway but the thing
with Jeff is one how many have used
yellow 61 yeah so not too many but the
thing I think that's why why this
happened not too many used it but the
thing with Joe left one was that the
license model prohibited with
distribution of the jars so we had to we
solve this in low GI by making the
installer download the jar and then
the runtimes and then doing some web web
start magic to kind of get around this
this restriction so our CTO wrote this
email to Oracle
and the answer was no sorry so and yeah
so we were a bit stressed here and i
made this presentation I just had to
include this quote from Wikipedia so I
probably don't have to show you this
it's it's it's not a generally a good
thing to to have time constraints and
have to migrate the whole a whole app
okay continuing the conversation here
this is a bit later ha fear later and me
coming into the picture I became the
product owner so I emailed Oracle again
and said the deadline will be very hard
to meet because we find ourselves like
this is going to be impossible could you
delay the eol or maybe you could you
know make us redistribute this the
runtimes we can pay or whatever so we
got the end of life postponed but for a
number of reasons the runtime could just
not be redistributed and then this year
in april i'm happy to say we were done
with immigration to you have x2 all the
developers were very happy to you know
move to this new modern language the
managers well they haven't given up at
this point and guess what happened one
month later so all of a sudden you could
distribute the runtime yeah that's just
a funny story I want to share
so migrating some takeaways from the
migration yeah forty-one thousand lines
of Java fix to 32,000 Isagenix to its
it's not because Java is very day you
know expressive I'd say it's mostly
because we had to cut out a few features
so we got fewer lines but also you know
when you if you if your dog eats your
homework your ear I've written an essay
and you think I'm never going to write
that again as good as it did or you just
think it's it's hopeless and then you
start writing it and it turns out to be
much better and that's kind of the thing
that happened to us we knew we knew like
our previous pitfalls and we did it
better I think nine months yeah so ja
affects one in Java fix to cannot
coexist so we had to do it all in one go
we couldn't have any beta testers or
something or I mean we couldn't replace
yes this part we had to make it fully
functional before anyone could want it
to touch it luckily for us all the code
was isolated in those giant module so
very modular code and it was more of a
rewrite that immigration at first we
thought we would look at the old code
and like okay so this method basically
does this so let's write that in Java
and so on that but pretty early we
realized that we weren't looking very
much at the old code we just we knew the
requirements and we did it from scratch
and maybe that's also part of why we got
got away with fewer lines of code we did
a much better work I think so some
performance metrics that i did a blow j
startup time and memory usage this is
java fix one on windows and linux and
genetics too much better
so as a developer I were ever really
happy without come of this to summarize
some some of the things like some pros
and cons of java 6 1 and x 2 i've asked
when I made this presentation I asked do
like previous members of the team and
current members of the logic team so
it's this is not just me flexible as I
showed you in the screenshots it's very
flexible see says do I have to comment
CSS is very very useful fun this
surprised me a bit or when I think about
it it is actually very fun but I didn't
expect it to come up in this survey i
sent out it's very fun to almost
everyone said it without me asking about
it specifically like it's more fun than
swinging and it's it's actually it's
powerful and really fun coding I think
most people think this pitfalls poor ID
support mostly because of geographic
script you're basically forced to use
netbeans hard to debug because of the
same reason I mean JavaScript not open
source the license issues are already
mentioned and the missing basic controls
javafx one was really not done 22 I mean
if I wanted to defend javafx one it was
never done really we were really very
early adopters so there were no table
view no modal windows etc so i had to
invent all of that stuff ourselves or
use the swing integration
so Java if it's one actually had swing
node which your f is to doesn't have but
jelly fixate will have ok so in Java fix
to all the pitfalls from the rx1 gone
everything is sold and additionally good
stuff we got F XML which is this
declarative language which kind of
replaces the the JavaFX script in some
sense because Geographic script I think
one of the main advantages was that it
was really decorated you could describe
your UI you know in a way that you just
can't do in Java but now we gotta fix
Mel and I think that's even better
because it kind of enforces you to do
pure MVP or NBC you know separation of
concerns yeah but more pitfalls
multi-platform issues in javafx to which
is the current release there are major
problems with windows server basically
the stonework Mac problems java fix to
on Mac has to run in headless mode in a
you know a WT headless which breaks all
swing integration for Mac so you can
just forget about that and a major drag
and drop bug in Linux as well all of
these are reportedly fixed in javafx 8
which brings me on to the next bullet
know to do this bullet living in the
future some extent of think Oracle is
living in the future but when it's a lot
of now this has been fixed this has been
fixed this at the fixed and a lot of
talks here are at javaone I think are
about the cool stuff you can do in Java
fixate which isn't released and
the release that was just delayed 33
months and we're you know we're having a
product with alex too we have serious
bug stir and then some undocumented weak
references I think the use of weak
references overall might have been a
mistake actually but yeah I'm happy to
discuss that with anyone so tips for
starting with your left to if you
haven't already run tests early on all
platforms that you will support this
ties back to the multi-platform issues
they might not you know you might not
need swing integration with on Mac you
might not need this kind of special type
of Dragon drop that we needed on linux
but there are a few quirks and i think
you should run on all platforms very
early test and i'll come back to testing
later because we have a tool for that
learn and use CSS and epic smell the
where it was a previous talk about this
don't do swing in gel FX it won't get
you very far use IntelliJ or netbeans
it's it's very they have very good
integration with the xml and and you can
you know it checks the all this this
method it actually exists in the Java
code from ethics ml and you can you know
you can have this color pop up in the
XML I haven't found that to be nearly as
good in Eclipse prepare mentally to move
to Java fixate this is the living in the
future thing if you find a bug it won't
be fixed probably in Java 60 here you
have to be prepared to move together to
say you're not a UX designer maybe there
is so UX designer here but if but if
you're not the youth center remember
that i'm not saying
should what I'm trying to say is that
it's very easy to do effects and
gradients and everything in GL FX just
because you can do it doesn't mean you
have to do it it's easy to go overboard
and enjoy because javafx is is really
cool it's fun and it's here to stay i
think this time it's made right it's not
super mature but it's mature enough and
we couldn't have done loggia without it
it's open source this time so it won't
just go away it's part of OpenJDK in
java ethics 8 it's going to be part of
the you know the java runtime it's going
to be under default classpath so it's
basically going to be around for at
least as long as swing it's going to be
around and I think that's basically
forever as long as someone cares about
it that was our experiences now i'm
planning on showing you really quick how
we use java a fictional oh yeah
let's see if I can pull it off
so I'm starting low GI on my other
screen and when it started I going to
move it over so you can see it as well
so loggia is we have we have made
victors of everything we don't use
bitmaps and we use CSS styling quite
heavily we don't style in Java
and here we go finally
whoops
that's better so this looked like this
is a starter page we call it some tips
and tricks and links and stuff like that
and this is the web view this is Jojo f2
webview so it's an embedded webkit
browser in here and if this works yeah
if we have network access which we do so
you can see like html5 videos in here
and everything it's just it's a fully
feature basically html5 browser inside
load you I we don't have to do anything
we just we just knew webview pointed out
that URL and then it works let's see I'm
going to open a project now and there
you see the effects going the blur
effect going above the video as well so
here the wires are talking about have
these things and this grid I don't know
if you can see the grid because of the
contrast but this is a this is a CSS
repeating background if you have been
doing some web design you might
recognize that you can just do repeating
background repeat this and it repeats
endlessly and this is FX chart its new
in Java fix too so we got rid of Judge
charts which we used in just one and
using this instead and I think it's
primarily used its intended probably for
report static charts mostly but we're
using it for a live shorts
now i'm going to load yeah yeah
I'm having a problem with multiple
monster so I have some witness on the
other month let's see
yeah so and then you can compare runs
and everything it's really let's see if
I can open this old one yeah let's see
if I can find a longer one I wanted to
show you the performance of this chart
here we go so this is a bit a lot longer
run as you can see it's it it's really
fast it's much faster than judge charts
actually for us which is good so you can
use charts for more things than static
sharks you can use it for things like
this that's all i wanted to show you
from lodi I back to the presentation
ok so our tools
I'm going to talk about two tools the
first one is go away fix how many here
have heard about google guava yeah so
Google guava is a library I guess for
Java which brings among other stuff it
brings functional some functional
features to Java so you have functions
you have the filter you had transformed
so what is global fix it's the same kind
of thing but applied to instead of
applying it to the Java collections we
apply it to the observable lists of
javafx so you can do transform and
transform is called map in most
languages but go out a called transform
you know MapReduce this has been a game
changer for us so we can do with any
observable list we can do transform
filter blah blah blah in a in a fluent
api style i'll show some examples and
it's cached for performance using week
listeners it's free and available on
github so now that you've seen the low
your canvas I'll show you how it's made
with graphics we start with this empty
empty canvas just a grid and an empty
tool box to the left so let's start
writing code so we start by transforming
so canvas is is the core back-end object
here it's a it's not a genetic snowed so
we get the components and then we use
the function they go our FX function now
they go out a function that we have as a
field or something component in node
which takes a component and creates a
giraffe is no doubt of it and then we do
the regular bind content thing this is
ready
genetics then we have all the components
and they will always be updated they
will always reflect the back end the
position of the components and
everything and that's just in two lines
of code and then we want some wires so
we do the same thing we ask the back end
object canvas can you give us your wires
and then white node so canvas get wires
returns an absorber list and we
transform that observe the list to
become notes instead of back end objects
then we get the wires and there will
always reflect the back end which is a
good thing because you can interact with
this you know in groovy or from command
line so it's very important is always
stays to sync but we need more stuff and
now comes some more advanced stuff here
because we want to populate this tool
box to the left so we call the things in
the toolbox that you dragged out to
create these components we call
templates so there's a template other
component so first we have we have 11
type of things that that should go into
the toolbox that called scenarios and
remember I said we're using osgi using
osgi and spring so we have services we
have this beans floating around in our
dependency injection framework so we
saying we want all services that that
implements scenario template and we want
them to end up in this observable list
and we want it to always stay in sync so
if any other service comes in for
example if you copy and paste if you
download a custom component to load you
and put it in the custom component
directory loli I will listen for that
directory on the file system and it will
become our osgi or spring service and it
will go in here
so it is pretty cool and we do the same
thing with components and we filter we
don't want to deprecated components to
be in that list but it can still exist
on the canvas but not in the toolbox
list so you can't create new deprecated
ones and then we use concat to
concatenate these two and finally we
transform them to actual your ethics
node remember they just they're just
beans now if from the start and then we
do the same thing bind content tool box
there we go so now we have sooner the
first one is scenario that's the only
scenario template and then the rest
outcome our component templates and you
will always stay in sync and this is how
the code will look like in plain javafx
to do this maybe not as maybe not as
much as you have thought but I think
what's more important than the length is
the readability it's not very readable
and it's what quite easy to forget to
add a listener to something and then you
get this annoying bug report you know
when I delete this then this doesn't get
later then yeah it's also bit worse but
yah graphics a task this or we'll have
this the current state of FX 8 when I
looked a few weeks ago was that observe
the list has been extended by filtered
and sorted but no transformed or mapped
I don't know why really I'm I gotta ask
the Joe ethics team about this if I can
catch them
so this will hopefully make our FX
obsolete so you can just use this
instead so you can use you know closures
to filter together so you have in this
case you have you have a my observable
list that contains a lot of tweets and
you just want to filter out there with
tweets and this will return an absurd a
new absorber list that will always stay
in sync and always just show the
retweets do you follow this yeah good
test effects puts our other tool and
maybe even more useful for you guys if
you're using javafx
so why test effects we needed when we
started this port since we didn't have
any since we have to rip out all of
jeff's one and put in jail f2 we
couldn't do any it was hard to do you
know user testing stuff like that so we
needed really solid automated tests we
need a test test that any tester could
follow and modify our testers aren't
coders and the options we had Gemma
effects how many have used genetics I'm
gonna have heard about genetics as same
people misc Jim effects is I don't know
if this is right but it's kind of the
official testing framework for javafx
Utley at least it lives on java.net and
I thinks it's sponsored somehow by
Oracle that it was too complicated too
verbose for us first John effects it's a
port of the swing testing framework fest
but it was dead it didn't survive the
death of Java fix one and there's
something called Marvin effects which is
quite new and it didn't exist back then
and did there was more no GUI testing
software you know like you can record
and you had this you have this Windows
software that you can record click here
click here and then click here that that
a lot of Q people use there were no such
things so we ended up writing our own
what is it it's a fluent and fix your
less API for interacting with genetics
applications how many knows what a
fixture is when it comes to GUI testing
rapper doc it's it's something that you
instead of saying like if you have a
button this is how it goes in infest an
Indian FX and
most of every frame work instead of
clicking on a button that you say
instead of doing that you request to get
a wrapper for that button or a fixture
so you say get me a fixture for the
button that has this ID and then you get
a rapper object and then you interact
with that rapper updates and then if
then you get a bottom wrapper and that
button rapper has a method called mouse
and that mouse method returns a mouse
object it has a method called click yeah
it's it's complicated and I think it's
too complicated enjoy effects or in
Turing test effects you do this this is
an example right-click the node with the
ID desktop move mouse to denote that has
label new click text document type my
text file dot txt press Enter this is if
if there are any windows users left here
I feel like a rebel here using Windows
but this is how we create a new file if
you go in there you know you're right
click the desktop new text file blah
blah blah enter or you can drag my node
to trash can so this is a node and then
you can it can do stuff like this and
you get screenshots if the test fails
which says like here here's where it
failed when i try to click on this but
it's more than that it's also verifying
Joe ethics applications behaviors not
just clicking and interacting but also
asserting for example you can do this
assert that my folder contains three
nodes of the class file click the node
that has label that ends with FX so here
we're using here we using the ends wit
here is the is a hand crest string
matching so its regular hamcrest string
mature and has label is a ham chris
mature that test effects supplies so you
can mix them
wait until the continue button is
enabled so is is a ham Chris mature and
enable this a bizarre mature and I think
this is pretty cool and very useful and
it's yeah it's free on github the key
print principles fix your less as I said
and this has a few implications that is
fixture less because it's pretty rare
you don't have to create fixtures for
custom controls and in lodi as you can
imagine we have a lot of custom controls
so we don't have to create you remember
i talked i was talking about the bottom
wrapper button fixture for that to
actually work you have to have a class
called button fixture so if we want to
test our toolbox we want to have we need
to have a class called toolbox to
fixture a toolbox wrapper and then for
the canvas in either canvas rapper blah
blah blah and this was just not possible
for us so it's very good if you have a
lot of custom controls it's clean code
but most tester can read and some can
modify its implementation independent so
you don't have to know if this is a
button that shows a pop-up next to it or
if it's a combo box do you understand it
doesn't matter how you implement that
this thing that looks kind of like a
combo box is the combo box its era
there's something else called there's
two types of combo bachchan jaya fix
yeah sure is box yeah and or you know it
doesn't matter so this enables you to do
BDD behavior driven development you can
just say from a user point of view all i
care about this that when i click this
button i see this text like i'm a
product on all right so that's what i
like from a product owner perspective i
don't care about how you code it yeah
and we got the hem kiss matures just
make use of regular hand kiss matures
I've already talked about that and we
have state so come back to that later
it's optional
so this is the gem FX official example
so if you if you would start to a few
you had had been using your attitude so
if you would start to you know you have
this application it grows and you
realize that I want to test this
application the first thing you will
encounter is probably gem effects
because it's kind of the official one so
this is how the official example looks
indian effects and it's probably too
small to see but here we're playing
around with all these fixtures and this
is the same in test effects it's quite a
difference so in test effects you can
actually tell what it's doing without
understanding it here is very hard to
you can just read this like click the
click the node that has the ID address
field type test data and press Enter
double click on folder one it's it's
easy to read and I think this is it's
very important because tests get tests
get written more if they're easy to
write an easy to read and if they run
fast etc if you have long running tests
that are hard to read hard to write then
you get worse test coverage worse tests
so this is more than just you know it
looks good it's more than just
aesthetics so we since we save some more
space here on this slide we get some
time to we get some space to do to
actually start that what we're trying to
do actually happen so we can assert that
the directory listing contains one file
and that file has labeled file dot txt
so how do we use test effects we use it
in about I think it's about 60 tests
that we have of this type
we have half of them so 30 tests are a
GUI unit tests that's what we call them
basically you remember the tool box we
had to the left that's a that's a javafx
control that can be unit tested at least
in my in my world it can be interested
so we take that control and we say show
this in a stage and then click this and
that that should have been in love just
this node like like a unit as the class
your unit tester here unit test
controller and we also have oh sorry so
here's an example for example this is
this is regularly in it you have the
before class you want to show this
notice stage so you have an older test
let's see if we can get the cursor here
you have no down your test that's what
you want to test for example the tool
box and you just a two-test effects show
this node in a stage just bring it up
and show it so we can click on it and
then how should it be hey this is the
first test and then you have the test
loyalty for it you know like i said
click there do this drag this to that
and then we also have something we
called system tests so might call it
integration tests it's probably the same
thing with states so all we have states
that extend something called test date
and yeah I think I think I have a
picture of it yeah so the first state
shows start slowly I so we have a and
here you see it so we have a first all
the Blues are blue boxes are states and
all the green oops all the green boxes
are tests so this test for example
execution test it says well I require
this state project loaded state and
product loaded state says well that's
fine but I require this state
creative state says well I require low
yet to be started it's a very simple
this is not rocket science at all this
is just you know state it's just a tree
basically a little note and but but it's
quite good if you want to have if you're
not doing unit tests you're doing so you
don't have to rewrite all the code like
oh oh I want to test this short here so
I need to start node you then no need to
create a product than I need to do this
so if you have state you can say I
require a project to have been run a
simple web project and it's also good
for for performance because it takes a
while to run this test so if you want
you can set them to if you want to you
can set them to start a new JVM all the
time so it just does this and then next
test does this or you if you want to
save time you can set it to do well it
does this and then do this test or this
test and then it goes back to this state
because all of these dates has done you
know the states has em through code and
our exit code so you can traverse
between these days so they clean up
after themselves if you want to save
time and we have 30 minutes left and i'm
basically done here's some links and
thanks and we are looking for good
coders and if you have any questions
yeah here so here's here's a movie that
i recorded from the tests that we have
from our test suite so this we start
with the units test your google unit
tests / custom controls and then we'll
come to some system test later
while we're looking at the distance
takes quite a long time so so while
we're doing that if you have any
questions at the hab to answer them if
not i'll be around yeah yeah think I
understand with me let me go back in the
slides and go to so here we have wait
until is that what you mean yes so so
this is a this is a hamka snatcher that
says so you can have a match sure that's
called a node mature so mad sure and
then you know die mode node and then you
can say you can do custom one so you can
have used you can for example use this
one as well you can say wait until the
continue button has label click here to
continue for example you know I imagine
you all have been using winzip when it
was shareware you know you had to wait
until the button was great and you have
to kind of know where it was because he
moved around all of this would you
wouldn't you would just do a wait until
otherwise enable but we also have some
built-in waiting in the I mean a click
doesn't fail per the folder click
doesn't fail if it doesn't find what it
what it wants to click but it waits it
waits for 20 seconds or something it's
just you know exponential time out and
then it fails so you don't have to do
wait until you know just because you're
running on a slow computer this is
mostly for for which you were talking
about like special cases so the whole
philosophy that it should be easy to
test and we yeah let's go back to the
tests
I think I have to
there we go oh you have to see it from
the beginning now sorry gives any more
questions yeah yes so the question was
if test effects registers performance
how long it took for things to happen so
if you when I get out performance report
of your application for example no
doesn't no more questions yeah now it's
it's the question was if test effects
runs in the j unit framework or if we
just making the same annotations to
create a similar syntax no it's it runs
in j unit yeah any more questions okay
