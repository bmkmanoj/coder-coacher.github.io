total I don't know if it is 45 50 that's
the normal trend we have we are 25
minutes late or 26 minutes late but
that's okay
the sessions will keep getting late that
much but your end time will be very
similar most most of the time that
happens I have seen I want to ask you
few questions before I get started how
many of you are coming from development
background great great almost 90% I
would say anyone from DBA or systems
admin background not bad not bad great
and anyone from pure security background
I'm not pure but six last six years pure
so we are talking today about machine
learning and does to make dev shakeups a
reality now devs say cops is the term
that has probably come up 15 2015 or
2016 and in practice just last year very
new by the way if you guys want to come
little bit in the front there are few
sit still there but almost full
otherwise sorry for that and I had
admire that you decided to stand there
there is live streaming outside as well
but there also you need to stand but
this would be better okay so let's get
started now my name is Jason with Lani
I'm the principal product manager for
the our solution called Oracle
management cloud I'll talk a little bit
about my product as well or the solution
that I have but mostly focus on the dev
psych ops in your day-to-day use
prospective how you can avoid the hacker
getting inside your organization and
your company become the headlines in the
newspaper for all the bad reasons I will
help you minimize that I will I will
tell you two things before I start one
is that in the next 45 minutes you will
learn something new today right number
two it's a bonus if you hang until the
end I will give you a small tip which
can help you and definitely a big help
okay so with that two lines that I'll
normally
start with and I love to do that I get
started again I'm chip voice still there
are you guys able to hear me in the end
they thank you I thought I dropped for a
second just like over mobile phones - in
Bangalore all right so I'm from
Bangalore and my job is a principal
product manager I focus on both the
security and systems monitoring and
management at Oracle it is native cloud
solution only cloud solution but we
monitor both on-premise and cloud and
multi-cloud right we call it a hybrid
cloud solution right this is mandatory
for any Oracle employee that don't rely
on what I say today just read the
documentation and make your decision
don't think this isn't based on what I
say today it's my turn illegal
documentation this is about me I'm
skipping this you can read it by
downloading at the Oracle Court website
and please follow me on Twitter and
LinkedIn and and I'll tell you in the
end why okay so this is the agenda for
today I will we'll start with defining
terms why dev Cyclops is perfect for
machine learning it's a buzzword today
both both are buzzword and so the crowd
is big and I'll not let it down
and that's my problem is as I said
making machine learning smarter for
psych ops now there are two parts to
devstack ops DevOps and sec ops which
has merged into the Deaf psych ops some
even go to say Davies say cops or it can
get extended right so this this this
loose loose terminology but for all good
reasons and for faster development to
match the business speed right there is
demo in between before after my point
number three here and then Q&amp;amp;A so first
thing first define the terms I'm sure
most of you know what is machine
learning and what is systems or idea
presence management from the number of
developers here you all know this so
I'll just focus on the middle term here
which is deficit cops and their to the
underlined two words that is security
and cloud the DevOps fundamentally
started with the cloud adoption right
and and security is a key component
which was lacking till we say DevOps and
it is really the reason why hacking is
so much popular and so easy that we are
not built to do the security as a
developer much right so that's that's
the reason the security is been lacking
from designing architecting and
development side and becomes the last
thing in the in the viewpoint of the
developers right that someone in the
security will take care of it which
which is a bad idea I would say so dev
sykov is a practice that em said
integrating security into every aspect
of an application lifecycle from design
to development right they in doubt you
need to do this testing production and
ongoing offices right their operations
include both products and support
operations as well as security or
vessels right it's increasingly being
used in context of cloud right
organizations already have DevOps teams
and tools in place to integrate automate
monitoring every aspect of development
lifecycle from development to production
so security is part of it and and that's
what we mean by when we say there's a
cops
some people even say SEC DevOps right
now doesn't it to me it's the same thing
some people may not agree now this is a
classic kill chain if we jump directly
into the security aspect which is my
focus today there are there are many
different thoughts about some say seven
steps from say eleven step cyber kill
chain but this is the minimum bare
minimum things that you will see and I
will demonstrate this in my demo as well
how hackers comes and attacks your your
environment it can be cloud it can be
on-premise or it can be hybrid right so
they typically start with recon just try
to attempt to get inside using malware
or some kind of those things which
typically comes in the email and one out
of 10,000 employees would click and and
they enter and in it's it goes low and
slow across infiltration the lateral
movement and finally once they do the
exfiltration of your data or any
critical information or take over your
environment they call your top
management and ask for the bitcoins or
anything similar in terms of money right
there are there are cases where people
have successfully avoided them I that's
not important right now
it is not the right forum for that but
I will continue to focus on the
development side of how you can take
advantage but this is the focus this is
the terminology that you need to keep in
mind when you see the demo right so just
as high-level okay why say cops is
perfect for machine learning right so we
are focusing their SEC ups security part
and machine learning so this is a very
classic way to explain how it all
happens and and this is been developed
and and if you look at bottom there are
references taken all the way from 15 to
17 and all all from the prominent a
security Fox so what you need to
understand is security posture must be a
setlist light on the left most I put the
data center and and your assets it can
be anything it's no more the physical
assets but the data which is the key
right so I say set less which means data
identity is very important and it is it
should be hybrid cloud away now I don't
know how many of you understand hybrid
cloud hybrid cloud means you have the
sum of your assets in the cloud some of
your assets in the on-premise and if if
I go and talk to customer most of them
cannot completely be on the cloud
especially the enterprise level customer
some of the banking customer today don't
even think of going to cloud our
government also on the PSU banks across
the world or ps2 companies rather they
they consider it to be very difficult so
it will remain hybrid for very long time
and may be forever right and and
security is one of the reason for that
as well so it should be hybrid cloud
aware and it should be a DevOps pick I
would say at business speed right our
business today is not willing to here no
you get it done or I will hire someone
who can get it done right so that's
that's the reality
so coming moving from security now to
the machine learning part I will talk
focus more on the rightmost bottom of
the screen right so what human brain is
smarted asking questions versus trading
ten million rows of the log files if I
am reading so many rows of log files and
there is some deviation I might miss it
right but if I have to ask questions
what caused the problem
is what I'm seeing normal or abnormal
what do I need to pay attention to right
now or even what problem is coming up in
the near future basic predictions with
machine learning right so we are good at
this but if you ask machines which which
where we develop machine learning
algorithms and give you the ready to go
data they are good at reading this not
asking those questions right so it's
it's a perfect mix of human being and
machines where they are good at doing
this we are good at doing that and if we
if we do it effectively we can save a
lot of problems right and or avoid the
human error which is the common thing
which I see when I read the issue where
some compromise happen for the security
for very large organizations right so
I'll skip this part for now so another
another angle to look at the daresay cop
situation there are two ways to look at
it about apart from the basic
development focus to security need to
worry about the configuration because
once in the kill chain was the hacker
comes inside the start changing
configuration so that they are not
visible in your tools the traditional
tools so for example if I go I for a
minute if I pretend to be hacker go
inside and stop or eating in the
database or stop auditing for the Linux
logs then I don't get visible in my in
the tools of the customer right and then
they keep on moving in that way so
configuration is another important
aspect and you should keep keep a eye on
security configuration bot plus the
third level to look at is the
performance metrics if the hacker start
encrypting your environment which is
very common practice they do and I call
you for unlocking there is obviously a
pic in the performance when they do the
encryption it is it is a heavy activity
on your environment so if your if
everything is configured in a very well
manner the security of person centers
would able to see that there is a
performance pic which is not common at
11:00 p.m. in the day we don't see this
then
can start investigating and find out
where exactly it's happening and who is
doing it right it can be false alarm but
even if one out of ten is the real alarm
it is too good to hell and stop there
right so these are two another important
aspect are to to your security so let's
move to making machine learning smart
for say cops okay so next the final part
of the session and then I move to the
demo live demo which is very interesting
so almost five years back as a
development team the product management
team we started thinking around the
situation that when I when I go to
customer and ask how many monitoring
solutions that you use typical answer I
get is anywhere between 20 to 80 and one
of them you want say 100 right and when
you have so many different monitoring
solutions in your organization in a
different departments as well then you
don't get the complete picture and you
cannot avoid the heck that happens
inside organization they play well with
this kind of situation where you're
isolated set up so that keeping that in
mind and many other things that we
noticed we decided to build the
environment which is cloud native able
to monitor both cloud assets and the
on-premises sets and that to multi-cloud
not just Oracle cloud and that's where
we started building the thing with very
simple reason right so it should be
complete and integrated it should be
powered by machine learning and this is
possible only if we are cloud native we
cannot give you the setup in your data
center with machine learning and big
data analytics in there it becomes
really heavy and another thing we
decided is we don't want customer to
have their own data scientist we will
make it so simple to use right so with
that goal we started building this
almost five years back and started
delivering the modules almost two years
back and there are seven modules now we
have which is in the middle unified
platform we call it so from monitoring
all the way to security and
orchestration it's all in the single
place for you and it's the same screen
if I show you the demo you will see that
it's all coming from the same place
right
so this this is the interface I mean
your company would have information from
the application all the way to
infrastructure right and everything in
between and and these are all the
features that we have which we use I'm
not going in detail right now but the
fundamentally we wanted intelligent and
unified platform that is solved with
machine learning and big data analytics
it should be powered by machine learning
it should be complete data set as I give
you the example when I go and meet
customer and I see so many different
monitoring solutions this is what we
wanted to avoid it's it would be
incomplete if you don't have just one I
mean you don't need to use to everything
on day one you can you can lend an X one
is you become confident and comfortable
with our solution it should be
heterogeneous and open it we saw
everything all your applications all
your all the cloud on-premise or on the
cloud right any single application that
you have we we provide the solution for
that you just need to give us the logs
and the basic information and you don't
need a data scientist to use this
solution right so this is Billy about
the security and monitoring analytics I
am NOT going in depth because I'm
showing you this part in the demo and
the other thing in the security we cover
is configuration and compliance cloud
service again I'll cover that briefly in
the demo but you can read this once you
download your my deck let's go to the
demo quickly any questions so far
synthetic use it was it in there okay
okay I'll come back to that yeah just
give me give me a second
Deepak you like to pitch in
yeah we can take it offline thank you
appreciate thanks for a question okay
all right sorry for that technical
glitch I'll keep at least five to ten
minutes at the end for the questions as
well okay and let me get started now
I'll go to the home page of the solution
called Oracle management cloud which is
at the top so that we can start the demo
I just check my environment
in the mean time that I get started just
give me a minute there appears to be
some internet glitch
all right so let me just get started
here
I'm just moving from my basic login into
the security monitoring and compliance
which is one of the slide that I've
shown I'm just logging into my solution
it is cloud native solution and this is
a live information here so as I
mentioned there are seven modules
they're all on the same screen that you
get once you log into your I once you
register and login to the environment
and I am focusing on the security
monitoring analytics this is the seventh
and you can have your own dashboard as
per your preference as well okay let's
get started
okay so I'll just customize my setup
which have built the story around custom
data you can choose either last number
of days or you can select the range I
put my data in September so I'll select
September ok 15 to 23 okay all right so
get the range of September 15 to 25
I just supply alright so I was focusing
a lot on the identity part in the
initial definition phase that how
identity becomes very important because
if my information at oracle is stored as
json dot with Ronnie at oracle.com
in the email email server in the Windows
Server say it can be Chetan or with
Lonnie in the UNIX server it can be see
with learn right so all these suits saw
the same information when security
operation center is looking at the
information on the screen how many of
you are aware of this security operation
center ok fine
let me explain that to you during this
demo I will I will pretend to be a
security operations center how many of
you are familiar with NOC network
operation center which is like when you
go to any data center it will so what is
up and down
Marad green right so everybody has seen
that that dashboard right so this
counter part of NOC is the song NOC
takes care of your infrastructure
information sock takes care of your
security information same thing but the
security team looks at owns the sock the
asset or the data center teams look owns
the NOC right so here the identity
becomes very important because if my
sock thinks I am three different person
then they cannot take the right decision
about the ethic that is coming in so we
have I'm starting with the users with
that perspective in mind this screen is
just maybe one millimeter left what I
see worse is what you see I don't know
how to move that but it's not cutting
too much so don't worry about that that
is the users so I see that there are 35
risky users across 11 risky assets out
of the 33 assets and their total of two
one seven threats right so let me start
by looking at the user risky users but
before let me just show you the landing
page completely what what happens here
right so I will I will
look at this 35 is key users say this is
my first day in this company as a
security expert I'm joining the
organization and I see this screen right
this is what I look at day in day out 27
by 24 or the team would look at right so
I would start with this which are these
35 users with with the goal to find out
if there is one user which is looking
strong or or having many threats so here
as you can see there are many risk but I
have sorted it by number of threats and
there are many there is Mary Baker who
has the highest number of threats 20 so
let me see what is going on with Mary
Baker as I said identity becomes very
important in security so let me see what
who is Mary Baker and what is happening
in my organization
security perspective so as a stock
expert I would like to see what is going
on
who is the merrymaker right so here we
have integrated identity with the
security solutions security monitoring
solution and I can see that season
employee sees part of the marketing team
her manager is check lean see speaks
English and which what is her off we
said this so that I can get the idea if
I am seeing some some information coming
from so Ukraine or some other region I
can figure out that there is something
fishy here
right so I need to understand this part
and there are there are other modules as
a summary right so as I told you the in
the definition there is an Emily
infiltration lateral movement
recognizance and risk indicator right so
this is a classic kill chain that is
happening here so let me go to the
threads which is in that which has the
details about it right and I would like
to see little more detail in terms of
thread so that I can understand my
language of the security language right
what is going on with Mary Becker so I
see that there are two and Emily ten
infiltration etcetera right and if I go
below to understand what exactly is
going on here I have by default I sought
by the risk which is high towards the
law if I go down you will see that there
is a low as well so this is how it
happens just for the Mary Becker all
this I am seeing right so let me just
explain one more thing that in reality
if you have if I am the sock expert this
may not happen if I'm using this
solution because as soon as there is
something happens I take the action but
just to give you the picture the full
picture of the solution I am building up
the story okay so so don't get worried
about that I'm just trying to show you
the full strength and this is just the
demo data okay yeah
yes yes yes yes
yes that's correct you understood yeah
any other questions so far let me know
so let me let me just see few things
here and and also just keep an eye here
that I'm right now in the security
monitoring analytics SMA we call it
within the OMC but as I see start seeing
the data it will move to other other
modules right so just just be aware of
that and in keep an eye so let me see
few things so what has happened at the
bottom there is a WebEx anomaly for Mary
Becker and you can see here there is a
website called paypal.com not Kogelo etc
right and and even the time wise if you
see that is the earliest time September
15 and and if I the way I explained to
you kill chain it goes up and even the
risk level also goes up right so I will
show you a few of them so let me start
with pre-sequel anomaly here and just
look at what is going on with the pc :
Emily for Mary Becker and keep an eye
that there is a finance database C
belong to marketing team okay so here
once I start seeing the basic
information what happened here I just
click here and there is a log analytics
but only I have so I can simply move
from SMA into the log analytics which
are tightly built together and I see
that my my tool is identified that C is
running this query called select star
from users dollar write the marketing
department person is running on the
finest database the business critical
database select star from users right so
similarly so this is this is unique
feature that we have to go data deep in
the monitoring I don't think there is
anyone else who can go data level and we
do this with with peer comparison that
if marketing team is doing this this
this queries anything different or for
example DBA team is doing this this this
queries and it
different we call it anomaly it's a
machine learning solution that we have
ready to go right so if I go further
also let me show you some of the
interesting thing fits
so there is a Cosby here so it's alert
coming from office 365 that you have
there is a WSL are coming from cosby
which is different solution all together
but we take the feed from everything so
if you have some more solutions DLP or
your cord check solutions and and if you
can bring out the log from there we can
take it as a feed so this becomes your
single source of truth as far as the
organization's security sensor that's
the goal that we have from this part of
the demo there is there are there is
more than that but security wise that is
our goal right there is a brute-force
attack here which means which means
after at least five fail login within a
minute there is a successful of it that
is that is the brute-force attack and
there are there are lot of other things
I cannot show you everything right here
but if I get a time and talk to you
offline or at your office premises I can
show you much more than that and this
all becomes the feed for the developer
to to take action right now now let's
move towards the initial part yeah yes
yes
is one of the one of the thing and you
you have seem to change that thing in
place of Phi if you think it is too too
many then you can change it to two yes
very good question so the question here
is I am sorry that we could not get Mike
on time around her waist time here the
question is if tomorrow there is a new
way of hacking and and that's what
happens today so we we that's one other
reason why we're coordinating when we
see one customer facing this problem and
we fix it we help other customers also
to get the patch in or we patch ourself
so that everybody gets the solution so
any new IP address and I'll just show
you I'm going to that so this is this is
the first time that I'm seeing the web
anomaly with this website right so I'll
just show you what you just asked right
this is this a first time that's exactly
the case so I'm getting this potentially
this is where it started so I'm just
doing one click and it going to log
analytics and I will just show you this
time I forgot to saw this last time so
here in the log analytics I'm seeing
that there is a website at the top
paypal.com
but if I go a little bit inside there is
this HTTP it's not HTTPS but Mary Becker
being a marketing person she doesn't get
into technical things
she just clicked once I saw something
interesting and PayPal is a very popular
and authentic website so just see just
click there right and that's where the
whole thing started that's the beginning
of the whole kill chain in this case so
let me just see that is it just Mary
Becker or something else in my
organization right so there are three
threats for the same thing same problem
same anomaly and I now see that there is
not just Mary Baker but even Jay little
is been tricked by the hacker all right
so I can not only take the action for
Mary Baker but I can same time take the
action for J litter and and it can be
just simple I can just say reset
password for Mary Baker and J little
because it's now proven that someone has
misused her you
the name and password to enter into the
organization environment and go on into
the next level of the kill chain right
so I hope that answers your question so
not only I can do it for my organization
but this will give the feedback to
Oracle to do it for everybody and then
fill in the information though we don't
look at the data we just look at actions
right so the machine learning mean
machine learning it we can smart with
the usage right so if there are 10,000
customers and one of them face problem
30 minute 9 and will get the benefit as
well
good yes that's correct
first time that's a very good question
the first time you see it's a menu
election but you can tell the my
orchestration solution which is inbuilt
you don't need to skip this look
somewhere else to do the orchestration
that ok do this every time and and reset
password is not a big business top
effect so you can take the sock experts
are trained to take this kind of action
that every time you see this HTTP colon
or also block this website permanently
for my organization so all these are
click away just one click and you do it
right and I can extend this demo to
configuration how the attacker change
the configuration but I think the time
is running out I don't know if I could
use my full 45 minutes we started almost
25 minutes late ok yeah so so I'll
extend this how many minutes I have now
ok all right all right that's fine let's
just making sure because I got the
warning so I wanted to check so this is
how intelligent the solution is very
easy to use you don't need your data
centrist and and the biggest message I
have for the developers here is that
just the way I saw on The Cosby feed
coming in and other feeds coming in like
even there was a vdf I don't know if you
pay attention and those are all external
solutions from where we take the feed
into the sock so this is like a big
mother of all the security in
organization the biggest thing I would
like to convey to you is that when you
do the development and use those
solutions this will keep the information
permanently developers may change you
may
into the new place new development but
this information will remain so this
will become like a repository of the
security challenges that you have faced
either as you as a person or module or
organizational level and if I am the CSO
of organization I would like to put this
in the cafeteria or somewhere in the
hall where everybody can see so that
everybody understands what kind of
security problems like you ask the
question everybody in your organization
can see this is a new new mantra in the
security me open right and and everyone
knows where the security holes are right
and everybody can fix it that's the only
way you can counter the sophisticated
hacker today there is no other option
out there and it's there becoming more
and more sophisticated as as one of you
mentioned and trying new new types of
attacks and we are prepared to counter
that but there are there are limitations
we cannot go in take action on your
behalf right and it can be as simple as
patching that is there is a holes in
your application or somewhere where
vendor has given the page but your
change management takes a lot of time to
decide and in the meantime hacker comes
in then start exploding so one one thing
I would like to share with you is that
one of the customer I was working with
we had the patch but during the time
they apply the patch hacker started
misusing because now it is documented to
everybody when we release the page it is
open to everyone that this is a
vulnerability and this is a reason you
patch so hackers also get this
information so hacking increases after
we release the pitch you know I mean
this this limitation that we have we
cannot just send it to customer we send
it we have it remains open and even if
you send your customer somehow they get
it right so that's that's one thing and
and I promised you that I'll there is
one thing that I want to share with you
which is which is sort of very
interesting so with with the job market
which is there today is are you guys
fear that your job may not be there or
if there are decreasing jobs hi yes 10
years or 15 years down from the DevOps
community or you don't I mean I I do how
many of you do right so one tip I I
would have from this while I was
preparing this presentation a one tip
for every developer that I have is that
you spend at least one hour a week to
review the security things it's
interesting I mean when I join the
security I was not thinking that it is
interesting but it is becoming more and
more interesting you would agree with me
right and if you spend this one hour and
use it while you do the development
right your your job possibility of
getting better job is much much higher I
can tell you from my personal experience
sure it is in demand I have a question
yeah good I don't know okay all right we
are talking that we will get feeds from
different applications and when you're
talking at different layers right and
yes structure application model beer and
all that yes and that means log files so
now we are saying that push everything
to this just the logs only because lot
of logs application log goes into
database tables or even big data tables
right wherever wherever as long as you
can get it in the ASCII format xml
format or sony do we have yes yes so so
there to two things either it can be on
premise or in can be any cloud AWS
Oracle Azure Google so we have the API
for the cloud to collect the locks and
they come in encrypted or if it is in
the data center so that API will be
called from most mission host machine or
it's like it goes data goes directly
from Oracle cloud to the respective
cloud or within the Oracle cloud okay
and then we are not seen any challenge
we are doing it today from all the cloud
in real time and we have not seen any
challenge because today the situation is
that if Oracle we say no to give our
logs customer don't use it so you don't
hear no from any any cloud provider
genuine cloud provider we are not hurt
don't worry about that if you have some
data on premised we put the agent and
get it and you have templates for
packaged applications and all that yep
can we use it yes that's on the Oracle
on Oracle right now but we are expanding
okay yeah thank you very good question
thank you any other questions
yes only the compromise is
based but you have the option to put the
Gateway outside your dmz you understand
dmz right outside of datacenter not
within your data center I mean you have
the option either you put it on your
server where the logs are or you put it
in the Gateway you need to put it in
each server but then you simply do
Gateway and Gateway we take it from
there and all this comes encrypted into
us from your source itself so there is
no security risk and it's just the locks
and you can mask it as well some part
you don't want to send it to us or if
you something very sensitive like IP
address things like that you don't need
to really ship it to us you can mask it
and then encrypt it and then send it and
it's all automatic you don't need to put
efforts so everything is just click
click click click you don't need the
expert sitting in your organisation to
do this right any other questions I will
just take one or two last yeah certain
one question is you mentioned
infrastructure locks various log
application logs middle air locks yep so
all locks will be having different
formats that's fine so do we have to
make some standardization that how this
lost no once once you download the agent
you need to tell the agent that this is
where my DB log is this my let log is is
my application log is virtual machine
log is that's it thank you good question
yeah that's cool because I was expecting
that so we are we are not sharing this
information and we are improving almost
every day or every month at least
because we are also using DevOps in our
development cycle so it's improving but
what I can tell you is is we use the
clustering we use the correlation which
you might have observed here but those
are the things I can tell you at the
most right but we can discuss further
offline if you are interested but I
cannot tell you exactly because it may
change tomorrow as well so even if I
tell you it may not be the same tomorrow
but I'm not allowed to honestly right
okay one second
because equal to mic just one minute
I'll definitely take a question come
here yeah is this module available
independently yes you can just use SMA
you can use any of the seven modules
or all of them or any number of them
that's a good question the second one I
had is what about deployment one
durability you know for example if I
deploy an application on HTTP yes this
tool helped me to identify that yeah
that's what I saw a demonstration that
the Mary Becker clicked on HTTP : W or
paypal.com and we identified that as an
Emily and you can even tell the tool
that okay next time I see TP : it comes
I don't know but what I'm saying this is
runtime right this is after the
application has been deployed and it is
running that yeah there you can
configure in configuration compliance
which is I could not show the demo
because of the time yes yes that is this
total seven models someone can someone
give it to here you can just pass the
mic thank you for that support
go ahead one quick question this is the
last question okay yeah so you make sure
you initially about automated
remediation okay yes yes are you using
machine learning only on the inside
deduction are you also using for the
decisioning ourself forcefully we let
you decide it takes two to three months
to learn what's going on in your
organization so as your person starts
saying that okay orchestration is
available but you use help me with
orchestration to automate this because
there can be change control which the
requires you to use without we cannot
automate that we're using machine
learning to kind of give recommendations
to this yes that's that's coming out in
my screen right sure sighs these are all
machine learning inputs whether this
risk is low high whether it is any Mali
or other things these are all coming
from washing learning what orchestration
is a separate module you can either use
it or don't use it you can use it for
security as well as systems monitoring
both same orchestration module okay it's
inbuilt in the home see you don't have a
blog outside okay yeah that is the
unique part of it thank you good
question I think I think that ends the
session probably we could not do the
full 4550 minutes but that's the lack of
the first session time layover thank you
very much for joining our really
appreciate it
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
