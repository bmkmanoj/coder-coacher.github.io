Francisco this is dev live at Oracle
OpenWorld and I'm here with wim Koh
Kurtz
hi our vice-president of the Linux
organization right yeah Linux and
virtualization yeah and ancillaries
sorry ancillaries recently works on
Solaris Linux operating systems and
virtualization go spark in x86 okay so I
wouldn't have a conversation today about
about open source about open source and
Oracle maybe we can start off you're
gonna do a session tomorrow maybe we can
start off by giving a little bit of a
over the overview what you're gonna be
talking about in that session
sure so tomorrow I have this state of
the penguin that's the title of the talk
I have been doing that I guess for the
last can I guess up 10 or 11 years last
year and this last year and it's
basically an overview what have we done
over the last year with Linux of
virtualization and then what are we
doing going forward why are we doing the
things we're doing what our contribution
is upstream what are some of the
interesting technologies that we see
coming up docker kubernetes and and such
of course very important
we are doing a lot with container
development and one of the topics is
about secure containers how do we secure
them you know what are the sort of tests
that we run in and ultimately we want to
do multi-tenancy so that you can run
containers in a in a secure way and so
that's the talk okay yeah so I have some
questions just basically around where do
we contribute why do we contribute as
a company we have as if this is a very
large company we have thousands of
engineers and we contribute to many
projects but it doesn't seem to be
centralized under any one individual so
basically that lends to a lot of
questions about what's your strategy you
know as a company and so what what's a
summary of basically where you see our
strategy is well it's there could be a
big question to answer so let me let me
try and frame it a little bit I think
there's a couple of things one is we've
started most of the open-source work
that we did at Oracle started with
around Linux we had Linux development we
helped make Linux a better operating
system to run Oracle products and then
either through acquisitions or to sort
of just organic growth we added other
components of course through Sun we had
Java we had VirtualBox we've had a
number of other products that we open
sourced and then we've done another
number of acquisitions over the years
and I think in general the best way to
describe is we're we're a company that
has to provide software and services and
hardware to our customers and we we
compete with other companies that do
that and so we need to find the best way
to build that and so we can either write
everything ourselves or we recombine the
best things that are potentially
open-source into a larger product and
then we offer a full service on it so
for us open-source is about development
and about participating in a project and
use that to for us to build a bigger
surface around and and you see that when
you talk about cloud and and so forth
where it's sort of a collection of
different things so we have software
that we wrote that's not open-source and
we have software that we wrote that is
and in the end it comes down to we're
providing services and products to
customers and we want to we want to do
that in a way that helps them the best
and so that's really the core to it now
that also means that you know as you
said we're a large company so we have
the product division around applications
of project efficient database clouds
virtualization and so forth mysql of
course not to forget mysql and so of
course each group has their own little
world that they play in and contribute
to to that particular thing or pieces
that are related to it so we can
contribute to the Linux kernel they also
contribute to the C++ libraries to GCC
and the whole ecosystem or docker and
other things so the whole ecosystem
around the operating system and then we
contribute to Xen to KVM so we have the
hypervisor piece and we have qmu there's
a pretty big broad range of it one of
the things that one of the against
drawbacks you could say that we have is
because we have so many different
product groups when when they talk to
developers or customers they present
their own little world right and so for
that developer talking to that group it
might sound like we're only doing this
little thing and when you walk around
here there's a lot of stuff that we're
doing and a lot of open-source pieces
and lots of lots of developers come come
out of a conference like open world and
say oh wow Oracle really is very
involved in this if you look at the
kubernetes stuff they talked about this
morning market average the different
projects we put on github rail car and
and schmitt and and other projects
there's a lot of interesting stuff there
that's relevant for the future not just
not just the past but we have a huge
amount of open-source contribution
happening every day
so would you say that we have to do more
with tying things together to tell you
know better story that how basically how
these things all fit together how people
understand that it is a very serious
amount of code that we're contributing
to a large number of projects you know
sure I think it makes sense to do that
but at the same time I'm a believer and
showed their code and so the more we
keep doing this and we put more stuff on
github and we collect everything better
the more people just see it and I I
prefer to to tweet a link to a
repository over a press release that has
fancy works in it and talks about it
so it's more about doing rather than
rather than just talking about it and
the other thing is that there are there
multiple ways of participating in open
source right one is you contribute to a
third party the other one is that you
have some code that you wrote that
wasn't open source you release it and
then the third part is where you start
from scratch and the first one
your your your contributor to a third
party thing so your contributions are
based on you know where in the lifecycle
use you wrote something in the second
one it can be large pieces of code but
other people don't know it so it's very
hard to create a community around it so
it might be interesting from a press
release point of view right but in the
end you're not going to get the real
community around it and the third one is
really starting from scratch and I think
you're seeing more of that today and
that's actually that's the things that
we're seeing move over to github right
exactly yes yes a real primary post
there now yeah and a few hundred
engineers yes absolutely and that will
that will grow and I think that's the
right place for us to to get other
people to contribute and work together
as a team rather than owning it and and
pulling things in for as much work
much different yeah yeah I'm gonna
bridge over to something that is rarely
focused on developers you've been
engineer for a long time you've been
working with open source obviously for a
long time what are the benefits you know
when you talk to young engineers you
know because obviously as oracle moves
you know through time we hire lots of
people one of the benefits of you know
young engineers you're getting involved
in open source
it's an interesting question so for me
Linux was the first open source product
that I was got involved in back in you
know 90 let's say 92
shortly after lenez put his email out
and it gave me access to source code
where I wasn't and wasn't able to get
access to source code from an operating
system so it gave me the ability to
learn something without the restrictions
if you have you're working at a company
you only see this much and and and stuff
so I think it helped you it helped me
get access to code the other one was
that Linux is maybe a little bit
different than other communities but you
create you know friends working together
abroad you know we had folks in the UK
and here in the US and and I was in
Belgium at the time and so you kind of
learn to deal with with development
where you're not in the same room it's
kind of interesting because that's
typically different at companies and
it's for some people it's building a
resume because you can do stuff before
you work at a company and you can show
it right you can say hey I I worked on
you know a database from somebody but
really can't show the codes really yes
the project in schools actually real
yeah and I do think that that helps
because there's a sense of pride when
when when you do that
so so those are probably the big ones is
you know really being able to
collaborate across a large group of
people and seeing your work out in the
open and if you're if you're a developer
on a crowd probably good in a company
then you can show off your colleagues
but that's where it ends of course it's
in in the product that goes to customers
but you can't pinpoint it so I think
those are pretty attractive
Risa's so was open source just normal
now in terms of development methodology
and the years ago was new and it was
very disruptive and but you know I was a
toss con you know in your six months or
so ago and I haven't been for many years
I just noticed that it just seems all
very normal very understated now all the
big vendors are involved to one degree
or another they have lots of Engineers
out and obviously got an e obviously out
in these communities and they have
marketing campaigns wrapped around them
and it just seems like normal business
is that an accurate perception I think
it is but the the open source world has
changed quite a bit too so when when
Linux became popular for enterprises in
in the mid-2000s it was it was about
free it was oh there's this operating
system it can compete with the other
ones and it'll it'll be free its mobile
source and for for a few years when we
talk to customers it was all about you
know what is your open source strategy
but focused on we're going to save a lot
of money and then over the years that
has changed to you know well Linux as a
project free with Linux as a product I
need to pay support for it because I'm
not gonna run random stuff and so as
companies have started to understand
that open source is a development model
and in the end you probably still end up
paying somebody for services I think
that has made it more accepting for
people to to to use it in companies as
well and it I think the other thing
that's happened is we're going away from
you know large companies just being
purchasers software and pretty much
every company now does development and I
think that wasn't the case a long time
ago Union sectors where they did that
and so because of that I think there's a
lot of folks taking these pieces and
kind of putting stuff together and of
course in the cloud its it's also very
it's very common to use open source
components interesting okay final
question cloud and open source there's
two big meta trends in the industry
what's the relationship between the two
well I think I mean I guess I could I
can think of two things one is a lot of
cloud infrastructure is written using
open source projects and it makes it
easy there's so many different things
out there so it's easy to pull pieces
and build a surface around it and make
that available so that's one place where
we're open source and cloud meat so it
provides the software for the
infrastructure pieces I think the other
one is that in the past when when cloud
started to happen it wasn't for
traditional applications it was for sort
of new cloud native stuff and there
weren't any non open source cloud native
apps right and so it was natural
people were just coupling things
together it was small it was written by
themselves because there was no market
for it yet so now that the cloud market
is maturing more and you know with
Oracle you have all our commercial
products in the cloud as services so
you'll see a more of a hybrid right and
a lot of the partners that we have here
have don't necessarily have open source
products but they're now slowly starting
to move into the cloud so so I think it
was initially there because that was it
but we'll see more of a mix now and
that's good okay thank you very much for
your time and good luck a new session
tomorrow and
I actually I hope to actually hope to be
there and well I'm sure will I'm sure
we'll see you in your future events and
we can have you know what have you have
about future conversations as well
and for a dev live this is Jim presencia
or will sign off now and another session
is coming up soon so stay right there
thanks bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
