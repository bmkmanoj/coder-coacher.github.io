worldwide alliances in channels
organization we work with different
companies in the ecosystem to develop
Internet of Things solutions it's one of
the many things we do we work with ISPs
OEMs and channel partners to use our
technology in the marketplace it's
really neat that you're all here we
actually have a pretty decent-sized
audience and this is actually a special
talk this is a talk that almost didn't
make it into Java one this year it was a
late submission I was so interesting
enough that we had to accept it imagine
that the world of embedded everyone is
looking at micro processors and the can
on technology and run times you can use
some of the people in this ecosystem
actually found it you cannot use Java SE
itself and an embedded fashion today
you've got two speakers both of them are
CEOs of their own companies one's a deep
expertise in hardware manufacture and
design custom design the other is a
specialist in application technology for
embedded the two of them work in
partnership and it's a really
interesting example of how you don't
have to be a large company to actually
produce m2m solutions embedded solutions
and Internet of Things solutions in the
industry they work with some pretty
large companies and they're developing
and have partnerships were pretty large
companies you would know an ecosystem
and today the two of them will show you
how you can use standard off-the-shelf
products in the software industry things
like java SE embedded itself and be able
to develop really innovative solutions
so the two companies are revolution
robotics and kinetics and the two CEOs
are here to present to you today that's
erin moore and Nicola liguria thanks
James so I'm Nicola nice to meet you
guys thank you for showing up I know
that it's really you know it's the last
session probably you have to run to the
airport so I'd really appreciate that
you are here as James told before we
were a little bit unexpected and so we
you know was like a bit of rasa a nice
things to do together and I really
 that you are here you know for and
I hope you enjoy so wants to be like a
session very interactive and very
practical so we have stuff here and we
want to show you some some things that
is known is our experience during that
product development Aaron and I we met
as you know separate company and he's
another designer and my company is a
java company and we decide to we fall in
love with embedded products and actually
we develop products we need products we
love to you know don't do I don't call
system integration or solution I what I
really love to address them as a product
okay maybe want to set off the shelf so
these are very you know just an agenda
we go through these topics probably most
of you already you know in every session
probably your introduction about what is
java diving better so i will be very
very short on that so we define we will
define what isn't bad today embedded is
changing i don't know if this worry is
still valid because and better 10 years
ago was something that today is
completely different we will want to
show you real scenario where today if
you go to customers they are asking for
some use cases that you have to
accomplish so we will go through how to
architect forking you're obviously from
from our perspective on what we call a
new embedded product we want to use the
word embedded but actually we want a
little bit to focus on how these were
probably is a little bit you know
old-fashioned so so this is this is kind
of our process and we're sharing this
here today kind of going through the
steps that we've looked at to share how
we bring these products using java
technology using embedded systems how we
kind of marry them together and looking
at kind of some more real-world examples
rather than maybe some of the exercises
you've seen around here like turning
lights on and off what we've done here
is really developed some products
after after we go through our process
will have a demo here where we kind of
show you one of the systems we've
developed to give you a better
understanding of of how Java works in
this ecosystem how it works with these
embedded platforms and now questions
will be welcomed anytime you have them
throughout so what historically embedded
is you know was really focused on
microcontroller and you know what we
call the DSP or real-time design
specific micro processors like FPGA so
system that were very target and narrow
for some applications right and they
were very expensive if you guys think
about how you know in 10 years and
industrial tunnel you know drop down in
cost is absolutely exciting because so
many technology we're in you know were
enabled in the last three four years so
we have you know for example very
specific code you know very robust for
critical environments and we have
real-time operating systems so we need
to know every day we have a different
microcontroller we need to build a very
target from scratch operating system and
it you know it was like time consuming
and at the end we have limited software
capability to build the UI so you I were
ridiculous pretty conservative I think
so that is there was not much going on
you know now we see many things running
javafx wherever and years ago you know
still I think six years ago nothing that
that was possible this is a market space
that is very much evolving with
technologies like Java and you still
there embedded system conferences where
the focus is on embedded development on
microcontrollers there's a whole suite
of tools in a process and that is what
we like to refer to as kind of the
history of embedded development because
Java with Java and these technologies
today and application processors and
power that you have in these systems
today what we're going to show you is
kind of how that's evolving in and what
that means in terms of you guys is java
developer
so in our experience the real embedded
is Java ME right so we run Java me on
microcontroller to for example very
small 10k kilobyte you know footprints
memory stuff that and it's amazing Java
ME is what enables a higher-level
language to be used actually very in a
very productive way so I want to really
use again the world embedded and you
know have a great give a great
visibility to Java ME now everyone is
talking about George of AC whatever but
today Japanese are really important to
think about arduino ok so Arduino or
embed right they you develop software
for microcontrollers John Amy you know
did start to do this probably 10 years
ago so right now is very popular for
users you know prosumer people to write
C code very simple on Arduino platform
but Java ME if was for that right
especially if someone most of you always
um you know Java me when some hyper
system are developed was a real-time
operating system was supposed to be a
real-time operating system environment
but like everything like that is very
target and optimized you know as a son
limitation for example the code the
beautiful machine so i need to work
around you know and target every
application on the micro processors that
i want to to to to use but today the
embedded okay is changing think about
multi-core processing you know so you
have like the I'm x.x from Frisco for
core 1 2 gigahertz on you know of
process of frequency and you have like
two gigabyte of two gigabytes of memory
and you can use you know you boot the
oh sorry guys yes that one doesn't know
that he the kind of systems that you see
today are entirely different than the
traditional sense of micro that is it
micro I mean these are essentially what
desktop systems were only a couple years
ago we're talking high performance
systems that have operating systems not
just cut down operating systems today
but it full featured desktop
environments like Ubuntu so the idea and
the notion of embedded and Java on
embedded is entirely different and and
from our perspective you have to
understand the the platform you're
running on to build to leverage the
tools if you're looking at
microcontrollers if you're if you're
looking at small devices you program
differently we want to what will go be
going through is is how to really think
of embedded as a computer platform how
to use s why it's beneficial in terms of
leveraging the operating system the
hardware and the frameworks and in
ultimately the java community that's
here in present this week and and how
that adds value to the products that
that you build so this is that you know
the question that probably every
presentation why job a white Java so
yeah those things are really you know
the the main topic so no restrictions
JDM now runs on up float you know a
float processing unit so Java and I
Oracle released you know few weeks ago
the first java version that you can run
on a floating between on microprocessor
with a floating point you know unit to
run you know more in a more faster way
okay we use eclipse we use netbeans
right you can the bug remotely you so
probably some section where the guys
from oracle show you how to debug
Raspberry Pi using you know using
NetBeans so you
you develop things like you usually do
with your java application right so
under your desktop you don't require any
emulators if someone is on android we
develop Android as well so you know that
deploy things on Android and the bug on
Android is a little bit more complicated
you have an emulator you have to deploy
virtually on your emulator and the debug
is not so easy sometimes especially when
you're working with native code all
right so you have separate domain the
Java domain and the mating domain that
actually is present even in Java so it's
not and we will see why the real
scenario is that you are using today as
well GN I orgy ok Angie and I detonated
the native interface because the real
war required that so it's not very it's
not so true that everything run
everywhere and everything is so smooth
ok and we will go we will see those
scenario on now in the next slides but
and sorry I said now we have the GPU
supporting it's very exciting in the
last two years we have vendors important
vendors especially from Asia that are
supporting right now very cheap GPU chip
and this is a problem actually this is
not so good because if you look at the
you know how they develop these things
is a for example proprietary code so
they'll put on the market those bunch of
chips they make one version of the
software and the community for example
if you want to use in a product you want
to extend its really complicated there
is no interface between developers and
the chip manufacturers that they provide
this GPU that are so fantastic right the
Molly Devante right so all these two are
great but for example to run Java you
need linux and linux drivers are way
behind sometimes with respect to android
one you know that android use a
different lipsy so you're using bionic
so you cannot use the same drivers or
the opengl low-level drivers to to do
your graphics so this is why you know
it's a very exciting morning the same
way it's a kind of mess today um
embedded systems
catching up to what desktops are SC the
standard edition of Java represents what
you run on your laptops and your
desktops at home and we can run that on
this embedded hardware and essentially
the process that we're showing today is
is that you can develop and deploy just
like you do on desktop hardware on
embedded platforms and you don't need to
change your tools that you don't need to
change your mindset because the
technology the vendors Oracle in terms
of the JVM support it's stepping up to
fill this gap and provide this layer
that makes it transparent between desk
traditional desktop systems and embedded
platforms so we we want to try to define
a different target you know from what
was embedded five years ago and what can
be consider embedded by with another
word today for example we don't want to
really use java SE to turn light on
right and that's a really academic
example but if i have to move a giant
boat to you know to turn on a light is
not so cool from a product development
okay it's a nice game but it's not there
where we are we need to look in ad right
so for example I should call java AC
embedded you know something that we can
use for new kind of low-power
architectures think about if you ever
data center you you implement a smart
grid a solution you want to save energy
but then the data collectors that the
data center that process your stuff
consumer more than the energies that you
are saving because they run on very
power expensive microprocessor I don't
see the you know why we need to do all
these efforts so I expecting that in the
in the next year's that we have arm
servers and we use Java that is not java
for a meta Java for arm and tomorrow we
will have other process we will add on
with 64 bits Apple is already using that
but you know next year every one of us
will will be very happy to work with 64
bits on platform so we have real
computers that's the point so we can
develop low power server architectures
or small size powerful computers to run
complex hm I like we will see or hosting
full operational application servers why
I need to you know I can run a full
tomcat ok and and and and develop
adapters and connectors to become you
know connected to enterprise platform
right without any special code I use the
code I used to you know to to use for my
eee project and I simply deploy here
right because i have a quad core
platform for example I can you know
operating system use the bus you know
your linux probably or linux guys so the
bus is a standards for inter process
communication is really cool and it's
supported by java so if we want to write
an application that wants to communicate
with the low-level operating system
stuff we can use the buses and messaging
system we have to all the you know the
unix inter-process communication stuff
so and obviously full Rene's full
relational database right now yeah
sequel light whatever but Java DB h 2
mysql okay so it's something that we can
really host in that kind of system so i
want to give you a typical real scenario
so if i want to sell my product i go in
a true to our customers they say okay i
develop something to make some controls
we call many people associate embedded
with control system so let's say that we
are you know inventing a product and
this product has io capability
inter-process communication database
application server adapters and in on
top application i choose some typical on
the on the right some typical example
where everything is native everything is
native you need g and i think about the
simple serial port communication today
you don't have any full java entirely
java solution to control cedar
communication use probably rxtx right if
you want to deal with Celia communicator
you use G and I and then you have your
your your Java code but you still need a
SOA native library Bluetooth devices
today if you want you know with
bluetooth for points
zero the Bluetooth has a new life so low
power state you know like a stateless
communication I don't know if you you
know something about Bluetooth Foreign
Service is exciting it's like working as
like web services it's not anymore it's
something that I use when I need I call
and I cross the connection okay then we
have canvas if I am working on
automotive application in canvas Oh 485
if I work on industrial machine
automation or PLC custom bars like
ettercap for home automation very
popular in Europe so all these and for
example be bus to you know on inter
process communication all of those
example needs a native life so go back
to the first slide that with the the
previous slide yeah we can the bug job
of whatever but those code is native so
we want if you want to go and debug we
will need to use gdb we will g DB server
if we are trying to the back real-time
hana on a machine so yes everything is
java but if you want to go outside and
says something we will have probably
those constraints so and i call embedded
just you know so we are everyone on and
everyone is on the same track but
actually when we want to you know
develop a product what we're going to do
is to have a piece of hardware we need a
bootloader we need a colonel okay then
we have you know the operating system
and like the gnu/linux operating system
for example then we have the JVM i put
the graphics in the JVM section and you
will see why probably later and probably
some one of you already know then we
have all our libraries and frameworks
and then at the end we this is we have
our application see that the typical tie
right this is the pile of a proper each
product we develop a variety that has
the same pie right okay this layering so
today you want to build a proof of
concept okay so you have a bunch of
boards right you can use a lot of those
here you you
you you know a lot of Raspberry Pi
Oracle fall in love with raspberry pi
but we have the new beaglebone black you
know is a or map cortex a8 with floating
processes unit whatever we have a only
only Luxy know that is a new platform is
European and is Europe II and you are
European certified so you can build a
product without certification costs city
do you want to spend just a few words on
how much does it cost when you want to
certify a product for example in Europe
or in a United States we are talking
about twenty thousand dollars thirty
thousand dollars that probably for a
huge company it's not so a big deal but
you know for a small company it's not so
I think so well the point when when
you're looking at hardware harder was
the base layer in the previous slide
that's where you have to start you pick
a piece of new embedded device you're
going to want to run on it so if we're
talking about proof of concepts there's
a lot of great single board computers
that are off the shelf that you can work
with obviously the UM Raspberry Pi being
the one that's popular here beaglebone
black is really popular in the embedded
world for its price and performance the
point is there are systems off the shelf
that are consumer grade devices that let
you get going these are great platforms
hardware platforms today that can run
java SE these are computers small
form-factor computers that are full
linux machines and you can run and
deploy java SE applications on these so
this list here just represents just a
handful of of different kind of systems
we pick but the point we want to
highlight on here is that all of these
are gigahertz class processors all of
these are about the size of a credit
card these are small platforms just like
your cell phones that change the way
people really think about what an
embedded platform is you're not talking
about kilobytes or megabytes now you're
talking about gigabytes not not
kilohertz or mega hertz but gigahertz in
terms of performance so as software
developers you essentially have more and
more and more and more resources so that
your applications don't need to be
restricted
and when it comes to experimenting and
playing with Java these platforms are
great because they represent things that
are low-cost widely available and
they're they're essentially overly
powerful so it lets you really kind of
play with it so as a first step in terms
of picking hardware this is these
systems here represent kind of a good
starting point into in terms of our
perspective I want to point out only I
don't know if someone have used knows
that they or droid the audio board
someone ok so the odd right border is
like this all right has a quad-core
cortex a7 all right with a GPU with fork
or the mali 400 sorry 450 450 is one of
the state of the art of a really small
form-factor computer that you can use
for prototyping what is the problem what
is the dark side all right it's not
certified so you cannot build actually
something without you know spending
money on certain you make the
certification for example in Europe or
in the United States and then they have
a really powerful GPU but there is no
way to use it because there are no
drivers today that are really performing
for example if you want to run a Java FX
application so sometimes we have to buy
all of those fortunately they are 60
bucks so I hear put only things that
cost less than one hundred dollars and
actually okay the Raspberry Pi here is
an arm 11 so all the others are arm
cortex subversion ARM version 7 the
raspberry fight is still Raspberry Pi an
armed version 5 but I think that many
people love the Raspberry Pi because as
the power of the air the power VR is the
same graphics GPU engine of the iphone
so it's a really cool to know to develop
small graphics and you know is fully
supported really it's a really good
product its readiness 30 bucks oh yeah
so so when you go from your experiments
the little raspberry pi turning lights
on and off or playing with when you want
to go to the next step
next up is a prototype or proof of
concept and this is an area that we've
been working with partners other
companies and in developing people want
to see these they say is it possible
okay in product izing what you need to
do to customers show that yes this is
this is feasible prototyping building
and proof of concept is the first step
in product izing these systems so we've
kind of outlined some some things here
for you to consider in terms of how you
pick the right platform what are some
really important things that we've found
throughout this process so right right
off the top you want to pick one that
has good community support and and for a
long time we've been partners with
freescale because they have a great
community a community means a lot of
developers in that space who helped to
support the chip who provide bug fixes
to the colonel things at the low level
that make the system functional in that
stack that we showed okay Java sea's the
application at the top okay there's all
this hardware the Linux the colonel
layer all this stuff and the community
can help provide that because in a proof
of concept or prototype you want you
want fast you want to be agile you want
to get this done quickly to win your
customer to show that it's possible so
that you can take it to the next step so
you don't want to spend a lot of time
setting it up you want to platform
that's ready to go something that's
modern so you're not needing to port or
downgrade drivers to support an old
criminal you want to avoid that and
there are some important things in terms
of selecting the processor at this point
because that essentially defines the
scope of what you can accomplish and by
that I mean what kind of computation are
you going to be doing are you going to
be running a lot of graphics okay like a
game engine with a graphical input on a
big display are you running a headless
server that's just collecting data
because the processors are really in
this market space designed for somewhat
targeted applications architecture obby
obviously affects this v 5 verses v7 the
biggest difference there is really
floating point so if you're going to be
doing a lot of math you want to be sure
that you're picking a platform that can
keep up with your needs and I think
that's one of the limitations in terms
of the day here and all right well and
here again you know the community let's
say that I want to leverage you know you
you're using probably embedded you know
openembedded let's say that you are
tailoring your opening this operating
system grand up using openembedded so
what's happened if I'm the GPU provider
and you you know what is the trick the
colonel part is for free GPL because
they need to but there is a user space
driver that is binary alright so if I
cannot compile from scratch using my art
float compiler how can i leverage the
power of my processor how can I i will
not so i have to write two people to
china they will not respond to me anyway
so it's the community so a huge
community is spending time those guys
are great reverse-engineering legally
okay because if you do reverse
engineering a some using some patents
you can trying to reverse engineers the
latest cpu to make drivers that everyone
here can be crammed up and integrate
their own platform right right now we
have great products but this integration
is like a hell all right and i will give
you some suggestion i mean we we are
leveraging like Aaron work is saying
freescale as a very good community so if
you want to make it serious really free
scalars are really good use a really
good partner um I think that you can
explain here for example I run the long
life support yep that's really portal so
um we we develop products so we don't
play around with raspberries raspberry
PI's too much why um raspberry pi is a
subsidized platform okay broadcom
provides those chips at cost to help
bring the price down it's a great
platform for developers who want to
tinker and play with but if you want to
go design and build a platform you have
to understand that processor how long
it's going to be available for and how
much it's going to cost and let me give
you an example the BeagleBone black cost
forty five dollars for us if we wanted
to build a couple thousand units the
processor itself would cost twenty
dollars half the cost we can't even
build a big o
bone black thousands of units in that
price because we don't have the economy
of scale and same goes for raspberry pi
raspberry pi actually when it first came
out they were losing one dollar actually
in the in the design of it they were
going to lose one dollar per unit they
sold just to put it out there into the
community this is before they realize
they're going to sell hundreds of
thousands of them obviously but the
point here is that there are processors
that have that are old older like the
broadcom one which is based on on old
architecture there are processors that
may be restrictive in terms of price if
you want to go commercialize later down
the road and then there are processors
that may have a short life cycle and
then these might represent some of the
the Chinese processors that are built
for specific one-off applications
they're great now but can you get them a
year or two later because if your
application dividend depends on it and
depends on that design you might not
have access to that chip so for example
we've done some work in the industrial
space where these products need to be
around for 10 plus years and there are
some chips that have a long life support
long life support means that that chip
manufacturer promises to the community
that they will for that duration of time
support and have that processor
available this is really important if
you have a product on the shelf I don't
know how many of you have the old school
linksys router that's you know black and
blue but that thing is over a decade old
yet there's still people carrying it
around and in fact they manufactured
those units for a long period of time
because hardware has a long shelf life
software gets updated all the time every
couple couple weeks you released a new
new release preview or something every
couple months you might have a release
but hardware is much slower just from
the traditional nature of manufacturing
but the life cycle of the development so
once it gets onto the shelf you want it
to stay on that shelf for a while so
there are some implications in terms of
the processors you select we actually
work in the three main you know market
segments I developed the operating
system for the I'm watch that is a smart
watch that was in the market last year
all right so I I know pretty good you
know the consumer then we develop a
product for the medical market and the
pan and a product for the industrial
market they are completely different for
example in the longevity if your design
a consumer product you don't care if you
want to use like an old winner a 20
microprocessor they will probably run
out of production in two years who cares
because you want the fastest you know
coolest stuff and usually up there and
cheaper and actually is the cheapest one
with the extremely good performances so
market segment is very important to
identify where you have to pick up your
components all right if you're designing
even the ardor so so that's an
interesting point so when you need to
you know to move from off-the-shelf to
customs or so cut commercial off the
shelf okay this is a term that is
popular in the hardware world and you
may or may not run across it but there's
a question of if your product izing can
you and do you leverage something that's
off the shelf or do you build something
custom and while the initial kind of
ideas of course I'm going to build my
own product there's a lot of things out
there that run on commercial
off-the-shelf hardware and really
probably the biggest example of that is
set top boxes okay comcast probably a
lot of customers here they have a
set-top box that sits in in in there
with an application processor running
running software stack on top of there a
lot of these boxes are commercial
off-the-shelf systems that are rebranded
re boxed but the hardware remains
constant inside then in fact most of
these are only derivatives or small
tweaks from the reference platforms that
were built by these chips at
manufacturers in terms of the final
system and that's for that's for a
really good reason the biggest reason
they're being kind of the cost when you
want to build custom hardware it takes
money so it's a volume issue and it's a
time issue it takes a big investment in
bringing up a system from the ground up
so in terms of product izing there there
is there are off the shelf platforms and
you can do custom or you can do a blend
of this and this is something that's a
very interesting kind of approach
because what you can do today with a lot
of these off the shelf boards is you can
build hardware on top of them I think of
it as a daughter board think of it like
a graphics card you plug into your
computer but in this case you're
plugging this processor board into your
electronics and in this way you can
leverage existing hardware that is built
on a scale that maybe your products
don't don't lure initially won't have
that volume so being able to take
advantage of this economy of scale is
really important if you need to have a
ramp up into this space because there
are very restrictive costs like Nicole
is saying in terms of certification but
also in design and time at debugging so
like the BeagleBone is a really good
example of a processor if you had a way
of plugging it in your getting a system
almost at cost but you can then build
your own hardware on top of it and when
I say build your own hardware we're
talking about very simple things this is
where it's about the LEDs and lights and
things that define the look and feel of
your product but fundamentally the
processor is running your application
and that's what matters in the end so I
don't know but let's let's go to the
next slide here I think okay what this
is what this is one on an example for
example fast bringing up when you buy a
board what how much do you want to wait
before pulling in Java right so put Java
and make it run so you have to go
through some stuff because for example
you have some drivers you have some
things that you want to customize the
colonel you want to customize the
environment variable of you boot so for
example what is that today that the
trend the trend now is to have like a
system in on an SD card because program
not memory or msata is a little bit more
complicated so I want to develop
something on an SD card all right and
let's say you have two partitions I in
one partition I have the colonel the you
image binary so I can compile on a
machine you know copy
the UU image binary and copy the file
system on another partition these takes
like three minutes all right some old
system for example like this tablet they
have the the kernel that I have to
transfer binary with DD so it's a
process it takes more longer so when you
choose a platform look at how much time
it takes to bring up you know and make
some little modification you don't need
to do so many stuff but like a custom
kernel every one of you will want to
probably have a custom kernel loop just
because you wanna for example a
monolithic kernel and not a modular
colonel right so this is very simple or
you wanna to rebuild your kernel in a
floatie in a hard flow with the HUD
float so compiling okay without float
compiling and and this is the problem so
to run JDM we need a linux us linux OS
today if we want to really leverage
everything it's a little bit ugly duck
because android in this in this in this
kind of scenario took over you know like
a three years ago i was speaking with
devante and they told me any color you
know that when android 1.6 was out there
the driver performances on linux were
amazing and we were building Linux
driver much more than android library in
five years everything you know some
switch and now Linux drivers are not
anymore you know very good like the end
joint drivers so we want a GPU running
for example this is something that I
will always say a GPU is the pain we
need a a nice okay so the topic is that
when you have when you want to develop a
product no way that you install Ubuntu
no way that you take an off-the-shelf
debian it's okay when you want to work
on prototype but when you want to
develop a product you want to build your
operating system ground up every single
library compiling every single component
because you want a five or ten second
boat time you don't want one minute
smooth time right so you will be loading
all these libraries and whatever but you
don't need that so you
to be your operating system fact but
there's a difference between a
production operating system and a
user-oriented operating system user
owning and operating systems are
absolutely great I mean this enables you
to put up a computer and it tells you
when updates are available it makes it
easy to install applications it will
help you with gooeys and everything and
it provides that user experience that's
wonderful but if you're the application
with one application that's running and
maybe you're already most of an embedded
product wants to application to and
that's it all right even even these
these guy one application so all right
so the iPad or the Android model is not
ready production ready or business
oriented right the point the point with
the operating system is the operating
system becomes another layer another
layer and the stack from the hardware
the colonel the operating system that
runs your application so as you go from
prototyping on things like the Raspberry
Pi where you have a full desktop
operating system these are the pieces
that need to be optimized to give your
application more power to run on these
platforms this is a typical scenario why
too big an operator operating system
ground up so target the specific
platform targeted specific architectures
for example some SDK our own version 5
and you're running on imx6 so you need a
nominal version 7 and you need to
compile from scratch you want to
leverage the art float and you want to
build exactly what you need all right
you don't want any other dependencies
that are not required from your project
and these is the question so today x11
was the bottleneck of every graphical
application right when you want to
design what ya when you want to design a
system that has a HMI on Linux you have
two choices you can work on direct frame
buffer ok like everyone didn't you know
in the past or you want to support a
window manager so so and in fear there
is a trade okay so you can make
different you know different choices so
you can direct a direct train buffer
you can have a mix windows with a native
window manager so use jdk cutie all
right or you can use a minimal x server
like open box all right and for example
awt swing they manage their own jpanel
and you know that their canvas to draw
objects so the to think about the to
dependents the only to dependencies from
from an ex windows perspective or to
library to run swing application on an
embedded device liebigs analytics render
that that's it alright and then i can
and we have an example here so we after
we go to that then you have like javafx
javafx probably you most of you are
aware at that speech javafx now add they
don't need x windows anymore to draw to
draw accelerated graphics they put some
native code that actually right now is
only capable to render on Raspberry Pi
but they embed in the in the in the Java
native package all the natives stock to
enable java to you know direct rendering
graphics and this is one way another way
is that like a canonical they're working
on a window manager who knows I don't
know you probably know a really they are
not outting nothing okay but they are
developing a window manager and the
future of the community is going to wail
and I don't know if you some one of you
knows whale and we land is a new window
manager that is like a very simple and
it display manager sorry is a display
manager that has no more complicated
client-server requirements like geeks
windows and the cut the community is
going absolutely there and I want to
tell you something else people is trying
to leveraging the drivers from Android
you know and make it running on Linux so
the result library that is called lib
Hybris that you can run your OpenGL
native library and draw directly from
Android copy on your linux system and
you know use
as native linux library so we are built
from from from 444 lead bionic but they
run only looks so what kind of joy why
this matters java is slowly helping to
make this transition from the desktop
onto the embedded platform easier and
easier with graphics was traditionally
dis hard point I think Nicole's focused
on this tonight because this was the
barrier in terms of performance okay it
was desktop graphics versus embedded
platforms and traditionally you had to
write very very specialized code for
graphics but with today's technologies
and what's coming out right around the
corner here these challenges are are
being provided by companies like Oracle
they're solving these challenges so as
application developers today Java is
becoming a better and better argument
from an application development
standpoint because it will leverage
these systems underlying it so your
applications will have accelerated
graphics performance when you run on
embedded platforms that means more and
more of the pain of traditional embedded
development optimization and tuning is
no longer your concern at someone else's
we were talking before about how those
computers right now a real computer so
you probably want to run swing
application if you want to run swing
application you can use very light
lightweight the window managers like
open box if you're using JavaFX right
now you can enjoy your no direct AGL
direct rendering if you have the
Raspberry Pi but I talked with the Java
guys and they are developing also for
davantes so they are trying to to make
it you know a little bit more to expand
the support for different GPUs or you
want to wait for Weiland Weiland is like
x11 so you need the community to develop
the drug the user space drivers like X X
11 so x11 has a user space driver sir
you need to wait the community to
develop the the user space drivers this
is what is happening so today so today
we have the traditional approach that is
the x11 and wayland where we have the
kernel space and we have the kernel
drivers then we have the
displays userspace drivers they have
your veto machine and your native
whatever you know layer and then the
application today what is oracle is
showing is that hey you know what we
eliminate completely the display
userspace driver and we put the jaya fix
driver ins into the native part of
javafx it's cool i mean it's really
interesting but we are i don't know i
was talking james with you know one of
the developers david hill i say but what
do you think is not a way to fragment a
little bit the way we did in the past
ten years and now you want to you know
to incorporate those kind of how can i
say those kind of requirements into the
oracle deliverables so it's not anymore
part of the system because when i say
display uses space is part of linux now
we want to put the drivers that deal
with the frame buffer to build
accelerated graphics into the Java
Virtual Machine so this is today what
you know the two possible scenario so if
you want to follow you can follow both I
mean right now but if you want to use
the Molly GPU the second approach the
left the left one the right one is not
feasible so you know select your
hardware and try to you know to figure
out what's the best approach for you
okay so just a recap we have linaro you
boom to actually it's very long it's a
very long boot time so it's very boring
right I don't know if you want to see
something immediately on the screen that
that that's okay then you have the open
embedded it's an opening better was the
really you know low-level very nerdy way
to build your own operating system I'm
strong is a projection is is a built on
top of openembedded and yocto today is
the state of the art to build ground up
an operating system is developed in
collaboration with Intel and yocto right
now for example freescale the deliver
our yocto make a layer so someone who is
interested so it's a way to build layers
on top of different platform
in order to for you to not be involved
so many to some complexities that are
managed by low-level layers and you
cares only of the upper layers or for
your specific application but you build
roundup so you select what you need and
you have different packages so you the
operating system can manage our dead
packages LPN packages so for you is very
simple then to maintain eventually your
product providing different packages
updates for to your customers they want
you obviously for security fixes or
whatever then you have to be very aware
you are you doing an embedded head fool
or an embedded headless so you have open
and bed in a doctor of the best choice
and then there is the tablet stuff how
many customer are asking me for linux
tablets to run the java vm because they
have you know they're there they have
their software ready if i ever a
quad-core tablet like this why cannot
use my java application that i developed
10 years ago right and so the problem
today is that the user experience in a
tablet is different think about the
pop-up keyboard the top of keyboard that
now we take for granted because we have
on ipad and android it needs to be
developed at the operating system layer
everyone every time sorry you want to
put your fingers on a text field
something needs to be a who is
controlling that the operating system
your application we have an example here
where is the java application that has a
pop-up window but we have to project
running today one is mad and one is
teasing of stealing progress so if you
want to be productive today with a
tablet you have to work around a little
bit ok so going back you know that's
stacked we had the hardware the colonel
then the operating system and next is
how your software is built around SE SE
has a lot of frameworks ok there's a lot
of community developed code and these
frameworks are what you want to leverage
so go ahead nicola well actually the
point is that
if we now today is very you know it's
very trendy to have a really good um nvm
MVC implementation so today html5 is a
way to build interface really the couple
from the logic so what we do for example
is to leverage on these boxes all the
standard geee framework like like for
example spring spring roll we use that
and we want to build when we decide to
be late am I we don't want to use JSP or
you want to use those we have a web kids
so we have web kids from javafx or you
know that we can leverage to build
scalable interfaces very and we use a
lot of jQuery jQuery clay did you see
another example of an old technology
that is becoming again like a trend is
JavaScript jQuery is incredible so all
those things today are very you know
very important tools to develop product
that actually are you know in a small
footprint like that so the look at the
point is these frameworks weren't
necessarily built for an embedded system
but these frameworks were built on Java
and you have an example here so we are
using spraying you're using groovy i'm
using groovy to build web interfaces
like the router you know you want a web
interface night now ok I many people in
the past usj pythons item all right
because was a scripting language there
was no scripting language so cool java
JVM based now we have Grails in groovy
on grace so we are you need an
application server you can run tom cat
but dekhti is absolutely amazing we use
in a lot of product you are do web
services using soap rest you have access
it so you can't you can leverage
everything you can take advantage of
these frameworks in your java SE systems
because your processors are more
powerful now these are things you don't
have to rewrite from the ground up you
don't have to optimize these you can
leverage code that's been written over a
period of a decade or more in some of
these cases and use these in your in
your applications and you not only get
more robust code because it's been
tested debugged revised is improved and
and and all that but fundamentally these
tools let you as developer build your
applications more robust
and faster so in terms of product izing
leveraging the right frame works is
really important I mean there there's
there are certain limits you don't want
to not have bloated systems because some
of these were designed for very large
platforms but understand that these
pre-built java code and application
frameworks give you the ability to start
much further in that application
development cycle where you're not
developing very low level code even
though it's an embedded system just
final say okay I want to go to
production one problem is that how you
deliver let's say that you you're making
a successful product you sell 100,000
units that you want to distribute
upgrades how you want to do that osgi is
a way to control deployment of you know
your jar or having a controlling or
version controlling when you know your
devices goes on a cloud and look at for
up some updates and you want to start
and stop services you know in a
container so there are really great like
super J's one of those okay we are we
are using super Jay from Itachi is a
very good osgi a very very you know
small footprint was designed originally
for Java ME then another important stuff
is how you deliver your system updates
if I'm building a target operating
system for my java application if I have
some updates like security updates my
customers wants to add those security
update installed without any issue
without asking for an IT guys to make
some stuff you know manually so
something when you want to get really
serious all right you need to take care
about for example we have a platform for
a continuous building of the operating
system so we have a dedicated man she
for cross-compiling every single comet
in the Yocto community to test it and
you know make some kind of announcement
okay so many many talk sessions to talk
about profile your native code profile
okay profile your Java code everyone
here I think that knows how to do that
profile your native
this something that is a little bit you
know the same stuff that probably you
did 10 years ago so using GDB GDB server
client okay it's a little bit boring but
as I told you before the native code is
really to manage input output still
towards like small PLC or serial
machines or serial devices so it's a
limited it's a limited area but it's
very important when you want to develop
a like and industrial product everyone
will ask about that right I think that
so we want to show you something so if
you have some questions open area we
have we did in 47 minutes so yeah time
what we are showing today I don't think
that you are a blur James announcer we
were partners we've been developing
products this this is one of our newest
areas into the industrial market space
with what is a java-based industrial
embedded platform this is essentially a
device that was built for scada control
systems this is when you're talking
about manufacturing plants that run
control systems you've had plcs in these
archaic industrial control systems today
we're building an embedded platform this
is a new company building an embedded
platform that is delivering a system
that is a new generation of devices that
that either interfaces with or replaces
the control mechanism in this industrial
space what in with respect to this talk
what's unique about this platform is
that the one application that this
system runs is a java application it is
software that has been developed over 10
years okay this hardware did not exist
two years ago but the software has been
in development for 10 years it was java
SE software that has been built into
this machine control space we're working
with a company has been developing the
software and today product izing
involves taking this software standard
software that runs on dell servers
desktop machines mini PCs and we're
taking that soft
or as is and deploying it on embedded
hardware because we can and and the
advantages that it has in terms of
deploying is now is an inform factor
that people can take and deploy into the
field where they don't have to go
through this process of installing a
system this becomes a way a new method
to sell software essentially if you
already have software that's written in
SC here's a new way to sell it put it on
a box and this is the schools all the
way but actually and these box a little
bit special because these box needs to
be placed in Alaska and you know till 85
Celsius so he's very rugged and remote
environment so the point is the hardware
in this case is actually one of the
living limiting factors for the software
they could not place this system in the
in Texas where traditional computers
overheat embedded systems actually let
them put these systems into high
temperature environments because they're
more efficient okay they generate less
heat so now you can start putting these
systems into places that traditionally
you couldn't place computers so this is
a way where you can deploy and sell your
Java applications into new markets faces
so basically eat these box okay here we
have the the open you know just to see
the how the developer the development or
app we are running a tomcat server full
tomcat server right so this is a web
application so I'm here I'm connected
with my laptop to the two to the Gateway
and this gateway run h 2 mysql all right
we design an operating system then boot
in 10 seconds only to build to you know
to launch the Java Virtual Machine
because everything is controlled by Java
he is an entire Java stock software
completely so the requirements so those
people came and say we want to build a
product in a new rugged you know
enclosure and for critical environment
but how we can make it we try to launch
like using an off-the-shelf operating
system and it took like three minutes to
boot and then I have to
to to load the application server and
then so five minutes boot is not
acceptable for a product so we start
ground up and the only requirement
that's was a fantastic was only the Java
Virtual Machine so how many things I
need to run the java.util machine so we
tailor everything we we compile an appt
float operating system because Java now
is our floating sigh here and the game
was done and another question came up
and those guys say you know what this
guy is a server but we have clients you
know that using that are using java web
start that as a free license that can be
used on mobile interface just to control
hm i so the idea was to have a tablet to
show a control remotely or right like
pressing a button right here and
activate something on the plc that i
have in front of me but it is running
the virtual machine the oracle virtual
machine so this was like an Android
tablet and again we developed ground up
an operating system different a little
bit because we have a different touch
interface we are using an e-2c here we
can use a USB based our control for
example for an industrial a resistive
panel but the idea is that the only
things we need is a small linux with a
very tiny colonel the Java Virtual
Machine and this guy actually is
connected through the wireless alright
so here i'm only running a small client
to you know is it use the remote method
invocation so and everything is going
through tcp/ip entirely but the
application the application that's
running on here okay is a java
application this daughter Julia was not
developed for tablet in fact was
developed for a laptop or a touch panel
on on a server and we can run this today
on a platform on an embedded platform
and sell this as a product in fact most
customers are really interested in this
form factor
because traditionally you can't in fact
this is the only viable real method for
business and commercial tablets because
your other options right now our
consumer grade products okay the biggest
difference between the consumer products
I can't take it sure um so the biggest
difference between an industrial or
business grade product and a kind of a
consumer one is reliability okay
security and what your operators do with
it so in an industrial environment you
don't want your operative playing angry
birds okay they need to be focused on
what's what the machine is doing to be
able to interact with it and only use it
for that purpose Java provides a method
to do that okay Java provides a method
to run one single application really
well without needing to worry about a
lot of the traditional features that are
again usability features for customers
needing an experience it's not
necessarily business oriented for
business oriented system a Linux tablet
that runs one single application is much
like a kiosk in that sense is that it
does one job really well and in terms of
a product that is very much the
definition of the product and actually
the like Aaron will say this is a swing
application design ten years ago they
did they don't have money right now
because they have so many customers they
cannot spend now three years to put
everything but they want to run right
now so this is a swing actually
interface right so Java 2d and no
special requirement but zero effort for
them to deploy the client or write the
client jar into this tablet and make it
make it run another example here so here
you see that the server interface
usually those interface are used in a
dell server the idea now is to put this
guy in a front panel in a liking an oil
plant system okay and control touch
panel
next to the next to the machines and
pretty much the same architecture so the
software get actually exactly the same
but now is not running anymore into the
data center is running on the field so
this guy can store local information
data logger real time and if the network
goes down to the serial 485 I'm still
grabbing data from the machines so it's
real you know it's a redundant system
and they're really interested because if
a network cable is broken they don't
want the machine to be you know
corrupted or something you know that
it's not recording any more events just
the last detail we decide to develop
using Grails the web interface to
configure the so again we are leveraging
Java the JDM also to build the web
interface to configure the box here you
can see for example the info so we have
the quad core you can we can see the CPU
the CPU temperature the memory
allocation right we have two gig of two
gig of ram running here industrial
memories or everything use industrial
design and sew all the core so Java is
multi-core teacher he managed the multi
threading between so is a SNP type of is
a SNP ready and so you leverage all the
of the core we are using dynamic 6 from
freescale the version quad that right
now for us is like a standard solution
to build those kind of those kind of
servers so leveraging these sorry this
guy as a quad-core too so i'm using the
same processor but not in dust about
consumer because these tablet is are
manufactured by fic that you know oracle
is working with from a couple of years
and he is not rugged but he's a
quad-core mx2 so i'm running basically
with the same performance is in tablet
okay it's a client is not a server but
there was no use case to have a service
inside so so the point here is that
using Java frameworks and using the
tools that are available from this
Community it's very very possible and
very in fact easy to
to build Diagnostics interfaces entire
products and deploy on an embedded
platform and in fact there is no secret
special sauce anymore you are leveraging
the tools and the applications and
traditional desktop development tools
and processes and really the work that
goes into product izing the difference
between playing with a system in product
izing is in optimizing the operating
system layers and making sure that you
have the right interfaces and so java
really changes the way you can develop a
product because it up in a product
product ization cycle you might not know
what your hardware platform is right
right from the start okay traditionally
with microcontroller embedded
development you have to pick your
processor first then write your code for
it okay with Java you can start writing
your code day one okay you can change
from you can go from a PowerPC to x86 to
an ARM processor okay and your
application stays running and that's
part of the power of using java SE for
product ization is that you can decouple
your software team from the hardware
team okay and as the hardware technology
evolves and becomes faster you're able
to then take traditional desktop
platforms without any modification and
start deploying it as new products
essentially and bring up new use cases
and new possibilities so it isn't very
powerful in terms of being able to do
that and as as these same processors are
available in things like tablets and
different form factors it's an
opportunity to commercialize your
applications into market spaces that
traditionally were dominated by
specialized hardware industrial control
systems are really good example that
that traditionally required very special
control hardware systems and today java
can do that and it can do it better it
can do it a can do it faster it really
can it can do it more dynamically in
terms of be able to update and upgrade
it and maintain it and it can leverage
hardware as the hardware platform
involves you don't have to rewrite that
software from the ground up okay so I
think that we have done
if someone wants to hear and you know
have some more information and ask any
question even we are here and so in
terms of what we have a 3g
implementation and basically the
implementations the same is what you
would find on a laptop using a 3g modem
card it's interfaced over pcie and so if
you'll ever just system like that with
SC you're essentially just talking to
the network better already come on
operating system we are using in an emmy
on a small chip like the centurion in
that environment with emmy you would
definitely be talking to the modem layer
through AT commands through low level
interfaces if you want to use minutes
you have all the framework you leverage
the frame with like Al Forno for example
and you you have exactly the application
layer and Java is ready for that if you
have like a 3g card here against in this
this application that's network driven
can leverage a 3g network without having
to write 3g code because they're letting
the operating system and a framework
layer take advantage of that and in
doing so you reduce substantially your
debugging and your testing and your
overhead for maintaining that code
because that's tested code that's
provided by a third party who's been
developing this over decades in terms of
the linux system
well you in term is in terminal HMI
which domain you mean fun factor for you
is like a size of the board are you like
physic are you talking about physically
smaller yeah well so so we've done and
we've done work with it like the Ryan
boy I'm not sure if you saw that here
Qualcomm has a development board that
has a job any system that has a 3g
integrated modem on us um no two Nets
actually based on I think a free skill
it's a nice Osieck or so with the letter
yeah so if I'm x 28 in fact so that kind
of a 3g system can be integrated through
traditional communication either USB
board level USB interface or through
pcie so and actually it is a good
example the the yet the tuna yeah the
two net is a good example in fact they
are using end you know that is Android
is a headless Android is already
interesting so they are leverage that
the telephony interface the telephone
interface of Android to manage the 3g
communication that is ready to go but
linux is ready to go as well so they
decide to go to android for to resume
the bluetooth that is much more reliable
and that was like ready to go and the 3g
connection because you know is android
is designed for phones it was ready to
go so they cut the development time
