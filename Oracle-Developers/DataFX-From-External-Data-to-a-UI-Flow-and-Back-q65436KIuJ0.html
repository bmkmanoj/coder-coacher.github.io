got two of my colleagues on our data FX
if for those that don't know me
I do UI controls in the gyro fix team
what my main focus is on is the controls
that list view table view tree view and
about 2011 Johanna and I were chatting
and we realized that these controls
needed a way to get data into them you
know it's not just good enough you never
show data we needed a way to populate
them so Johanna and I chatted and we
realized these controls are all based
around the same kind of concept of an
observable list and so we set about
building what we cook now cool data
effects and it was 2011 at this Java one
that we announced the first release
since then we've done a few more
releases but as I see it I'm a UI
controls guy I live in an imaginary
world where I don't build actual
applications I just sit in my office and
build lists and trees and tables and I
never actually put them into real-world
use where these guys come in is that
they build real-world applications and
they also know Enterprise stuff and as a
pixel pusher Enterprise stuff just put
me to sleep so we're very lucky to have
these two guys who pretty much taken
over the project and I pretty much just
stand up and do the introduction then I
sit down for the race on the station and
leave it to them so to introduce who's
here
well I've seen who I am I'm Jonathan
Giles an Oracle employee I do a UI
controls JavaFX team on the furthers
aside from me as Johan Voss he's Dux
Choice Award winner so everyone should
give him a pat on the back when they see
him he's been working not just on this
project but also on ER effects on
Android so it's a very cool project and
there's really cool just to see him
bring out his phone with you know a map
application running on Android all
written in Java it's beside me is
hindered Eva's he works for canoe and
he's comes website GUI garage very blogs
about all the stuff that he's doing and
with various projects a core of apes and
various other things I'm sure he's gonna
talk about in our stations he's got
having season to you about six years six
season decisions so you know he's gonna
be talked about all those projects this
week
leaving now our handed over to Johann
who's gonna talk for the first half
you're really told okay thank you
Jonathan
and thanks for initiating this data
effects project and I think it was very
good that someone from inside the Oracle
Java vex team realized that we have
these nice controls with observable
lists and observable values now we also
need something to get external data
being visualized in these controls so
that's one of the parts of the of data
of X which is the what we call the data
sources part WebSockets is now part of
data sources I will come back to that
later and these things are about how you
can get external enterprise data in your
java vex project the second part of this
presentation which henry cool guy to
tool is about how you can use enterprise
functionality inside your java attacks
application so it's pretty complimentary
i've used two different approaches in
some project one may be more suited than
others it depends on your use case your
configuration or your using javac so
embedded on mobile or on desktop so that
really depends what parts of the data X
component that you can use so the goal
of the data sources component is that we
want to facilitate the interaction
between Java vex applications and data
that is at backend services and thereby
we want to respect the differences and
the commonality is between those two
often completely different worlds so the
world of embedded of of enterprise is
still typically cloud based service with
lots of resources and the client world
is much much smaller often contains much
much smaller devices so data sources the
whole project is open source and you can
get the the source code at bitbucket
we
we'll provide a link on the website of
course so I'm not gonna go to the
intervals too much but very briefly in
data effects and the data source part
contains three pieces first of all we
have some clauses that allow you to read
data from an enterprise component then
another piece that converts this data
into Java or Java FX beans and then a
second and then the last part will
provide this data to the Java VEX
controls we use standard protocols for
example grest to communicate with
enterprise layers and it also makes it
possible that you can use the same
back-end on different clients can be a
web client can be a Java vex client can
be a Java client on iOS or on Android so
data fx8 the our latest version runs on
Java vex on Android as well so so the
protocols that we support if the data
sources are rest service and event and
web sockets and we use technologies like
we support technologies like XML and
JSON encoding we also have support for
JDBC drivers and for more accessing the
native file system I think it's very
important to stress that the data
effects is not just retrieving data from
a back-end it's it's really tailored for
JavaFX so we try to leverage whatever we
have it in Java effects one of the cool
things of Java FEX is the notion of
observable and observable list so data
the data sources indeed have acts we'll
make sure that your Java vex controls
get populated that the observable list
backing a list you is populated with the
correct data so you don't have to
retrieve the data and then write some
callback handlers that will populate the
the list items and so on this wiring is
done for you all so you have to be
careful in JavaFX that whatever you do
that might change the UI happens at the
TRX application thread and it's also
something that data vechta does for you
so as I said three main pieces in the
date of X so the first part is where we
read the data and what I will show in a
few minutes is that we can read the data
amongst all the protocols from west-east
web services from SSE endpoints server
sent event and also from WebSockets then
we convert this data into Java FX into
Java objects that can be Java Beck
Sabine's
data effects provides an XML converter
annotation converter out-of-the-box so
we have a Jason processing piece as well
so if your data is in JSON or XML it can
be automatically converted to Java
objects and then the last part will
provide the data as observable instances
or as items in an observable list so
again the quite easy integration with
Java vex key in Data effects because if
you use the data sources then your data
can be kept up to date in your controls
and for example for server-sent events
this is very important maybe I should
have asked first how many of you are
familiar with service and event ok and
WebSockets okay so WebSocket seems to be
more popular today than server-sent
events but um I think it's it's as I see
increasingly being adopted
especially in web technologies as well
but the important thing here is that
data sources will make sure that your
controls are kept up-to-date when new
data comes in so the Java VEX controls
like for example label and lists you
they
ever use observables and observable
lists for example if you want to set the
text on a label you populate the text
property of a label and data effects
will do the remaining part it will make
sure that the the text comes from a
back-end and if the text is updated that
the label will be updated as well so I
will show three examples of this the
three examples are based on project
Avatar project after was announced last
year at JavaOne and it's a project with
from our goal with JavaScript on the
back end and JavaScript on the client
and what they showed there was that you
can have a JavaScript back-end that
actually runs in a glassfish application
server and you can have a JavaScript
client it is something like angularjs
for example and both communicate using
standard protocols so what we did was
okay we will take the server for
whatever reason that you want to have a
JavaScript on the server but in case you
really want to have a script on the
server fine
and the child clicked on the client not
that's too much we will take each other
vex client instead of the JavaScript but
we will use the exact same protocols and
we're also connected to the server and
showed that the functionality is exactly
the same avatar demonstrates or uses
West's server sent events and web
sockets and they use JSON as the
encoding format for doing the
transportation and with avatar FX which
is a project that we also have in our
book bucket repository we demonstrate
the avatar functionality in a Java vex
client so first of all the rest part the
rest part of the data sources is similar
to the functionality provided by each
access to doto client API but it's more
simple because the jacksons client api
is part of the java ee
standard and one of the reasons is that
most of the
use cases for checks client or servers
that are initiating connections to other
servers and then you have of course much
more resources which you don't always
have on laptops or mobile or embedded
devices so that's why we're not using
the full jax-ur as client API but we
have something simple if you want to
develop using it you can use a builders
or you can use the katta7
approach we also provide all-out support
so if you need to communicate with a
back-end that requires or out
authentication that can be done with
data effects you provide key secret and
hashing is calculated for you and of
course the protocols get post put delete
or supported and I will now show the
example of how to use rest services in
data sources on laptop too I think
so is this now I'm okay
so first of all I have to start the
client this is a we today we use cradle
as the built and deployed system so we
have here the Java vex application that
we just start with cradle one and you
see I created the layout and it's a very
easy to know who created the layout if
it looks like this it's hardly change
coughing or me who created it with a
fair chance that it's the latter one so
these are four examples but look at the
hover that's nice but that's actually
building in Java right so so the first
sample is what we call the webstore this
is exactly the same as the Avatar
example but they have a web client for
it if we click on get all we get a
number of key value pairs
I can add some item key - value - and we
put it and you see it's now in the list
we can ask the value for key K and then
we see here the value is V which is
about right so that's not very
impressive but you probably understand
the the US base so this is great right
update delete things so quickly going to
the code of this to the relevant code
snippet is that readable more or less I
hope so because I have no idea on how to
increase the font size on Mac here like
this
opiates working okay yeah for me it's
not working so anyway these examples are
open-source as well they're on the big
bucket repository bitbucket or threads
data effects / avatar effects so how do
we retrieve the items we first create a
converter as I said step 2 in the
process is that your data is convert
that it's step 2 but it always have to
create a converter first we have a JSON
converter because as I said avatar is
going to send the data in JSON format so
the Jason converted that we create is
created here so what we supply is that
we expect a number of items and the
items are separated by the tag items and
there are each item is of class item
table cloth which is a very simple class
with just a key and a value so that's
probably not the most complicated
example then we create the rest source
and in this case we used to build a
pattern but you could have done it with
cat or setters only as well we create a
registered source builder we tell it you
will receive data and you have to use
this converter that we just created to
convert the data into item instances the
host where the rest services is residing
is some constant here then we supply the
path so the context root of the Avatar
application is demo rest and then we
have to call another part of the path
with data items so this is actually what
you typically do in a rest-based
application you you specify the address
and then that's it then we have the rest
source in order to populate at least few
with this data then we create a list
data provider again we use the Builder
pattern here and we tell the list data
provider that you have to use this data
reader which is the rest source that we
just created so we told it your day
will be read by this reader and I want
you to put the results in all items all
items is it's an observable list
containing instances of item so the
moment that data affects is reading
items it will start populating this list
and finally we call the retrieve method
on the list data provider this will
create a worker and it will start doing
the work there are a number of ways that
you can get the result but what we did
here is we just we didn't do anything we
just said put the result in the in the
all items variable and then what we have
in the control of our Java vex F XML
file because of course I had to use of
XML to create such a complicated user
interface you see that we have a list
view all items which with this very
complex list you and when when we
initialize you have XML view we called
set items on the list view and we
populate it with the the items property
that we had in the web store app which
is to all items that we were populating
so that's that's all wiring that that is
needed so the moment that new data
arrives the all items will be populated
so this is only demonstrating to get all
items we I didn't well I didn't go over
the get item and a push item in the
delete item but that's that's that's
pretty similar so but this demonstrates
how to use rest in your Java vex
application talking to a rest back-end
with the data sources so maybe some
music while I'm walking up there I hear
okay here we are again with the second
part of the demo which is about SSE as
this is a server sent events and because
I didn't want to take the risk telling
something wrong about this protocol I
just copy pasted from Wikipedia server
sent events it's a standard describing
how servers can initiate data
transmission towards clients once the
clients initiated the connection so
there are many use cases for this a
typical one is that a stock ticker you
want to be informed when the value of a
stock changes so as a client you first
send a request I'm interested in the
values the server immediately sent the
current value but maybe changes five
seconds later or 10 minutes later and
the server will then send the updated
value and client and server they use the
SSE protocol to keep the connection
alive or to re-establish the connection
if it fails so this is actually
something between arrest and web sockets
so server sent events are actually part
of the html5 technologies so yes we
embrace html5 I never realized that
before so it's it's something that's
getting more and more popular in recent
web applications and we also support it
now in a Java vex so I will show yeah I
will I already explained that this one
so what we do in d8 FX is that we create
an observable object and every time that
new data comes in the observable object
changes and that's pretty cool that the
Java vex has this notion of observable
so that whenever it's whenever the data
from the server changes your control
will change as well
so there are two examples here but I
will only show the clock which is very
typical example but useless of as I see
you see that the avatar server is
sending us updates every second and you
see that the time is changing here
that's not very very sexy but that
that's just data coming in every second
and the property here is being changed
every second so very briefly the code
for this the clock up is initiating this
connection because we have the retrieved
data here it's very similar to getting
rest data but this time we use an S and
SS e RS source builder that retrieves
the that initiates the connection is
similar to the rest source builder we
provide a converter which is now using
the time good class a host above and we
build it and then we have an object data
provider in which we say the result of
this should be in a property called time
whole time bowler is an object property
of time so every time the server sends a
new instance of this time we will change
the properties in this time clause so in
the user interface just displays the
value of time and data I've actually
make sure that when the values changed
on the server that these properties are
changed as well hi and welcome again to
part 3 of the demo which is about
WebSockets so that's the final part and
then I'll able to - Henrik WebSockets or
standardized in Java as part of GSR 356
which is actually the server-side
standardization but the client protocol
is very useful on clients like Java
effects as well we leverage it with data
effects again it's a very lightweight it
still works on mobile so what the
effects will do is
we will using the same techniques we
will retrieve incoming messages and
populates observable lists once new
messages are being sent over the
WebSocket session so the obvious
application for this is a chat
application so if you join me for the
next demo you will see what I mean
thank you we will now show the chat demo
as you just explained so first of all we
have to look in and if you don't mind
I'm going to use your name for logging
in so we now see that you are logged in
into the chat room and I can talk to
myself like I'm doing the whole time
hi Johan so that's just yet another chat
application very briefly the code for
this chat application oh shut up here it
is so where do we handle the connections
once again we start with a chaser
converter because we will get Jason
strings and we convert that to instances
of check message which can be a login
message or a message or a private
message and so on we create a WebSocket
reader the equivalent of a rest source
we provided the address of the rest
source of the of the WebSocket back-end
sorry we set the converter to it and
then instead of a list data provided we
create a message provider which is
typically for WebSockets and we tell it
the observable the result observable
list is messages which is an observable
list of messages and then we started by
doing a MP dot retrieve now every time
that data evacuates an incoming message
on the WebSocket it will put this on the
messages observable list and then we can
do whatever we want so messages here is
the observed list of chat messages so we
can write that to a list you or whatever
you want to do once again you don't have
to worry
about being on the Java X application
thread or not I don't have to worry
about missing callbacks because that's
what data facts is doing for you so that
concludes the part of how you connect
your Java vex application with external
enterprise data now it's up to vendrick
okay so we have so before I will start
talking about the flow John and I we've
written some Java fix books so yeah if
you like Java fix and want to know more
about Java fix you should buy this two
books and if you buy them at JavaOne you
will get a free Teddy so even if you
don't like Java fix you will get it tell
you if you buy to it Java one you should
do it okay
oh yes before I will start talking about
the floor API of diuretics I will go one
step back and talk about concurrency mmm
the data sources have a lot of
concurrency stuff inside to manage all
the background sweats
that receives the data and all the stuff
and we extracted all the concurrency
utilities that we created in an extra
module it's called dar F X core and all
other data fix modules like the data
reader or the fuel includes this module
and if you develop an Java example
occasion there is a lot of useful stuff
in this modules that you can use in your
Java except Rakesh - and I will show you
three different utilities so as I said I
want to talk about the concurrency API
in that I fix and you might know that
Java fix is a single sweater - to create
like any UI toolkit so you only have one
thread for the UI and every operation
that takes a long time we are calling
the rest service or something like that
we freeze the application sauce UI if
you do it on the application thread so
you shouldn't do it and what we've done
we've created some help
asses the first one is a data if it's
executors it's an implementation of the
default Java executor interface
like sweat pool or something like that
in Java but it has some additional
options and methods so as an executor it
will support one Evert and kaga birds
but it support services and tasks or the
Java fix concurrency classes - it will
support for all the task title message
progress like in the new Java fixed
assets but you can do it in one a bit
and corabeth's
- you can cancer tasks and you can
configure the sweat pool on that the
executor depends and by doing so you can
kind of do some cool stuff I will show
you would be more ok so what I did here
let me see can you read it I think so
okay what I did is I created an observer
executor and a list view and the
executor provides a property called
current services this defines all the
services that account he executed in the
executor and then I have a button and
when pressing the button I will submit
tasks or whatever to call that to the
observer by executors and when I start
this example now here on the top series
and here's a button and when I press a
button I see what tasks are currently
running in the executor so in the sweat
pool and I see the title of the task
I see the description I see the purpose
and if the task is cancer gamer I just
click and the task will be removed so
it's it's like this progress we know in
Eclipse for example you can do this very
easily by using the observer executor ok
another one is Java fix only provides or
didn't provide a run and rate method
it's only in the private API and in that
afix we have implemented run and rate
message that works whenever always a
call able and we will turn the wizard of
the core gamer then we have stream
support normally the streams in Java 8
won't fit to Java fix because they are
not running on the application sweat and
who's stream of X Epson Daleth X cap and
it's a wrapper around a normal stream
you can do a lot of stuff that you can
do the streams on the java application
sweat like you have a stream and do some
stuff in background in power and you can
then you can say stream a fix for each
or at and the result that you have done
in all your background sweat will be
handed in the java fix application sweat
and the sort
tools that i want to show is a process
chain it's like so people who did swing
menos a swing worker and the process
chain this react the string swing worker
for Java if week so you can handle
background tasks and tasks in the
application sweat and here's some code
horses might look so I created the
process chain and say ok at first I want
to grow up my UI I need to do this in
the great form swept so in the Java it's
applications well then I want to load
some data from the server so I will do
it in an executor so in the background
and thanks to you - I can I can use in
Supriya here in the Supriya returns
somewhere you saw the data that you see
ordered from the server and as an s next
step I can add a consumer that will be
handled in the pH from sweat and by
doing so this comes uma will get the
data that is loaded in the background
from the server and can handle it in the
application sweater so by doing so you
can do the same what you can do with an
swing worker but you can do more because
you can add as many executors supriya's
consumers as you want and in addition
the process chain has support for
exceptions and you can define a final
tasks that will be called even if there
was an exception while running the
process chain ok maybe a short demo let
me see here it is ok what I did here I
have a list and I create a process chain
and this is a more special example
because the progress progress chain like
the swing worker supports publishing of
data or tasks so what I did here first
in the platform sweat I will disable the
action button when it is pressed then I
will create a list in the PM said to and
then I will call a server task it's this
one so I don't have a service all I have
in such sweeps that it looks like we
have a slow connection and it will take
some time and simply publishing
somewhere you've got gravy 1 2 3 2 where
you 10 and this will be added
automatically to the list in the Java
ethics application sweat and once this
is done I on an error I will set the
text of the button to error and at the
end I will enable the action button so
when I start this oh I simply can call
the action and as you can see
everything's working fine the
application sweat isn't blocked because
the concrete server action isn't a
server action here because I have a
sweep we run in the background ok
yes okay that's just an overview about
the things that I have said we have
exception handling in it and oh it's
like ooh you can configure the sweat
poured on in in Java fix the service and
tasks API is using the sweat pool too
but you can configure it it's hard coded
in Java fix and when using data X you
can configure the sweat pool so say how
much sweat should support the minimum
and maximum of the sweats and all the
stuff okay now I want to start talking
about the flow API when creating an Java
fix application normally you will have a
lot of youth like forms or tables or
quite views and normally as joined it in
this demo you will use FX ml to create
the layout of the view and yes it's
working fine use a very simple example
some ethics a male code on the button
and by default you were doing from the
ethics and verifier to an Java
controller it's my controller in the
example and this controller will be
linked to the XML file and then you have
a view a layout that is defined by F XML
and the controller class in Java that
will handle all the activity in data F X
we yeah we have some kind of inversion
of control as you will see because we
don't define the controller in the F XML
file because we sing you shouldn't
define a class name with all the package
in yeah and if XML file isn't a Java
file it's just a text file and what we
did here is an example about view
controller in data fix we have an
annotation it's called ethics of air
controller and there you define the
ethics of air file so by doing so you
can yeah you change the controls of the
victim if I didn't know the controller
but the controller knows the ethics that
matter file in addition by doing so we
support
other default Java annotations we are at
the post construct a notation that isn't
supported by ethics M by default okay by
doing so you can simply create one view
us this controller class and you have
this view class it's working fine but
normally you don't have only one you you
will have a flow of views or wizard or
something like a QWERTY I go cuz a
master detail view or something like
that and there isn't any good solution
in Java if it's tutoring between Oz's
views and that is what the flow api in
data if it starts all gets thing about
this application you have some views and
you have actions that will link to
another view like ohm or details on the
bottom you have settings views that can
be accessed by any other view for
example so that might be a map of an
application workflow for example and who
is the floor API in data fix you can do
this very easy and I will show an
example by creating a master detail view
so in a master detail view we will have
two views we were as a mass W and we
will have the detail view what we want
to do is use a xml to create views and
we want to switch from one view to a
salon and what's very important we want
to hot the data so when we switch from
one view to the other one we don't want
to get all the data again from the
server or something like that so we want
to transfer the data from one view to
the second one and we want to decouple
all the stuff so we don't want to have
hard dependencies between all the views
because maybe we want to reuse the views
anywhere else so this is houses might
look we have this master view we have
this detail view and we have some
actions like we go to details go back or
delete anything in the master view
and said we have an XML file for each
view and the controller that is written
in Java as I already showed ok and now
by doing so we can easily define a fuel
with data ethics here's some source code
how this might work so we create a flow
and we define the start view by saying
new flow start and then we can define
the Rings from one you to another view
so we want to create a link from the
master view to the detail view that is
called D Jets and we want to create a
link from the Edit view to the master
view that was caught back so that's a ID
of the Ring and again we have this
delete action on the top so this isn't a
ring but by using the flow API you can
define actions here's an example we say
ok for the master view controller we
want to define the delete action that's
defined in the remove action class
another option is to say ok we want to
define the delete action and define a
lambda that will record once the delete
action will be caught okay by doing so
we can create rings we can create
actions for a floor or for view of a
floor but the big question is how can I
caused actions how can I get from one
view to another one or how can I caused
delete action for example and he was
Howard stuff how it's working we see the
controller class of the detail view and
in epic somewhere we have defined a
button called back button and that has X
of us an annotation
it's called action trigger and by
annotating the button
who is the action to get annotation it
will be automatically bound to the
actions that is defined for the floor
for the back
action ID or that is defined for this
view service that F X you can define
actions club actions for a flaw or an
action for only one view Tauruses two
options and again on the button I use
the post construct and pre destroy
annotation these are the normal Java
annotations but data FX will support
them if another option is if you don't
want to define all your actions when
creating the floor you can simply create
new actions in the controller classes so
here's an example we have this action
method annotation and by using this you
can bind button directly to a method in
the controller you don't need to do this
you can do this in ethics and man but I
think a fixham anomaly a designer for
example we'll create the layouts and all
the stuff and ethics ml and so people
shouldn't know which method should be
caught when I clicks backbone I think
this is better to do this in directory
in the controller in Java code and was
that I fix you can do it by just adding
these two annotations and the delete
message will be caught whenever the back
button is pressed okay and yet talked
about data so as I said we want to
translate a transform data from one view
to another one and therefore we
introduced contexts context can be
injected to like a button or something
that is defined in XML by using a
notation it's called XML view for
context and this will inject the context
for the complete complete flow and in
this context you can we guess the object
and we use them or get them back in
another view of the fuel I will show an
example some other features we provide
back actions so if you want to go
one step back in the floor to the
previous view you don't need to call it
because we have a back action annotation
and by adding this on a button or on any
other control it will go back to the
previous view once the button is pressed
or the air quotes the controller I think
on a button and on a menu it's whenever
and the King listen now will be fired
and on each other control it's whenever
the mouse is clicked on it for example
yeah we we use exception handlers in the
floor too so by default each floor has
one exception handler and whenever
there's an error in the floor for
example in an message that is caught on
a button quick whenever there's a
one-time exception or if you link to any
controller of use that doesn't exist it
the exception will again the exception
handler and you can define whatever you
want to do with this exception globally
by whenever you define the fuel Oh
influence how we use ever so you only
need to define them once and you can
start them as often as you want if you
want you can start them in parallel
because whenever you start and you flow
a con your container is created it's
yeah maybe something like this Java EE
container and this will have you the
floor and handle all the injection and
all the stuff okay I will show a demo
first one is very simple one I have two
controllers this is a first control yet
only has and button in it and it defines
an Inc action to view to controller so
whenever I click this button the floor
should move or go to view - and yeah I
have this view to control it's mainly
the same there's a button with an wing
to view one and the definition of the
flow is very easy
I only say new flow and view one
controller this is a start view and I
want to start it in my stage so that is
not much caught and when I started I can
click the button and go from V 1 to V 2
to V 1 and so on or just simply example
and what I did here I on the sides
I created links between all the views
and controllers when defining the flow
and in this example I directly used
annotations that's another option to do
it in the controller so here I can say
from this controller I will go to view -
the other option is that I create
everything when defining the flow here I
can say ok I want to wing from the start
controller to the without one controller
and the action ID is next from the that
one controller to the wizard -
controller and the X night is next and
so on and when working in controller Oh
when looking in the controller you will
see that we have this action trigger
next it's the next button so whenever I
click next this will record so what I
did here is a simple visit mmm well I
can go next next next I can go back
that's justice back action annotation
I can call finish and you will go to the
last step of the wizard and sometimes
you have a help and the other only a
system out so how it is defined
I just say okay I have a new flow and
start controller is a first controller
and then I have some rings like from the
start controller to the without one and
from 2 to 3 and from sweet to done and
then I have a global back action code
pack so whenever the back action ID will
record the flow should go one view back
then I have a cool green action to the
last view this is bound to the finish
button so whenever I click the finish
button on any view I will go to the last
view and here was action it's whenever I
caused a head button it will we are
point out something on the Condor and
this is a global action too so I only
need to define it one time and can reuse
it in any view of the fuel okay and in
combination with an eye our shoulders
head okay and a big benefit by doing so
is a few use of photography you don't
have any dependencies between the views
you only have such action IDs that
defines the links between the views and
a view don't need to know the class of
the next view so by doing so you can
split your views in in different modules
for example and each model didn't know
each other and at one time they are all
in the same class path and then the flow
is working so if you have something like
a help module or settings module you can
you can call it from any from any view
ok and the last one that I want to show
is the injection API is that
new and it's integrated in the flow and
by doing so you can inject data in your
floor it's based on jsr on to J's ass
it's not completely implemented there
are some problems I will talk about it
and it's deployed as a pre oculus of
your API but it uses a default
annotation so like add inject and it
supports some scopes who so who knows
CDI we know scopes and for that I fix we
have four different scopes the
application scope and the dependent
scope are the same as in Java EE and we
have two new scopes it's the view scope
that only gives in one view and a flaw
scope that only used in one flow and by
doing so you can I was short demo so I
hope it's working because I need Wi-Fi
this is a demo that uses the floor API
as an injection a PI and data sources
and it's a music player and I can yeah
search for any artist and it will use
data sources API to search on iTunes so
it uses iTunes Web Services and searches
for the artists by using the data source
API and everything is created in a few
also at first I started poussez view now
I have an overview about all the CDs I
can I can open one for example go back
this is all done by the floor and what's
interesting we always have the same data
model and only one time we created the
data model so I can even create a track
if I want for
working and this is done by using
injection so and having for examples
that I've amore view controller I have
an iTunes data model and this is
injected and iTunes data model has a
flow scott annotation so this data model
with the whole floor so whenever i
injects this in one of my controllers
like in the detail controller where it's
injected here or in the all of you
controller where injected here it will
be the same instance because it is floor
scope so it is about one concrete floor
if I would at at view scope a notation
to the data model it would only with in
one view and whenever I go to another
view it will be distraught the destroyed
and a new instance will be created so I
see you noses from CDI it's mainly the
same okay as I said some problems
illicit it's currently not based on a
default implementation like red or open
web beans because both of them are very
Java EE specific you you have a lot of
HTTP staff in it and a lot of stuff that
you don't need when doing Java fix
because of that we started to create our
own simple implementation and so
annotations like qualifier for example
are not supported at the moment and but
we created pre AK in API so you can at
the moment define your own scopes we
have this false corpse but everybody can
define it own scope was yesterday I saw
on that someone created scope for data
fix and use this back in are very cool
okay so that was a injection API and
thing well we're done so so if you're
interesting go to da F X dot IO and
download our F X so the sources are open
source at bitbucket and yeah we have a
Google crew if you have any questions or
you can ask them no ok what's the guy
since they used a the BSD license yes
the HB stuff yeah we want to release
data fx8 this week and everything that
we shown will be stable in that ethics 8
and we have I can show it some more
stuff come to recall the star F X gaps
there are three more modules that aren't
stable and we've yeah we've created and
RF its incubator because they are not
stable and not sign up for that f68
there will be released as snapshots and
maybe indirect X 8.1 or something like
that one of them blue be part of the RF
XO it's the first one is a validation
API it's based on the Java bean
validation so on the jsr that is used in
Java EE 2 and it's developed as a flow
API appraoch in and by using it you can
simply yeah very date forms for example
in Java ethics and it's very cool
because it supports the property api of
java fix or normally you can only at the
validation annotations at strings or
primitive objects and with the directs
validation you can use the annotations
for any property and we are here's an
example how it will look but it's also
sides and we will publish this guide and
another one that's what you're talking
about this
eg be support and with the GB support
you can inject a remote egb in your
controller so if you have for example in
a Wi-Fi and you have a GPS deployed on
it and you there are not only locally
GPS but remote agb's - you can inject
them in your java exemplification and
directly call methods on them for
example and at the moment we have a
white figure implementation also we have
this Balak api and we have a vodka
implementation that is experimental and
that's it we don't have any other
implementation and because of that this
isn't part of data FX 8 and the last one
is the feature toggle API
who's this API you can use feature
toggles very in a very simple way in
Java fix so here's an example we have 2
annotation side by feature and disabled
by feature and by doing so you can
you're simply through it switch at one
time if a button should be hidden or
disabled so maybe you you know the
targets API or you know feature toggles
and you can do it simply by using
annotation so these are the three
projects that are currently in the
incubator and no so it's we do this for
fun and when I have time I work on it
but and I'm not an eg be expert and not
an application server expert so the
white for implementation was easy but I
don't know what was also other stuff so
I can
I think the future turrets will be the
first a few is because this is mainly
finished and egb and validation I don't
know so we were not with those projects
are you know join in okay other
questions
yes
it doesn't
it's more on the outside right time with
scene billet so you'd be calling this
cut from your controller you would be
using it you define the views on scene
bird opera you even in Tina I can show
you how I work
maybe this is a canoe project I'm
currently working on and I use of who I
pay to this very simply this just a
master detail view and what I did is
I've created two controllers one for the
detail and one for the master view and
for each one I have an FX MFI so and if
you see this is very I have no idea how
to do this in code and I just use the
same mirror so here it is and what I
normally do I
I only set f-fix ID saw the name and
then injected by adding @fx a man in my
controller and everything it so all the
logic so all the listeners and all the
stuff I won't I never do in a fix a man
I do this in the controller by using the
fuel API uses inverter to to to lay out
my controls okay
oh yes the value of the effects ml
controller refers to the scene yes yes
yeah okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
