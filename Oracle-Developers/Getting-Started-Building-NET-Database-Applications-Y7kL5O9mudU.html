long to see this session now this is
going to be a very introductory section
I'm going to actually assume no
knowledge whatsoever then so those of
you who are already got net experts I
think well at least you know what what
you're in for
so we're just going to kind of try to
give you a lot of the introductory
information you need to get started
writing dotnet database applications I'm
also going to do one for you a couple of
them right in front of you but don't
necessarily expect you did I just it all
but this will kind of get you going and
and also one thing I'll do here that I
guess is a little bit more aggressive
because we're going over flaky Internet
is I'm going to try to deploy this into
the cloud and run it from the cloud a
few cases anyway and so we'll see how
that goes so welcome and welcome to
those of you on YouTube watching this so
let's get started so I'm not sure how
many of you know what dotnet is even so
Logan we're going to introduce what
dotnet is we're going to talk about the
different types of net development that
there is especially with databases and
then I'll show you some of them and then
we'll talk about visual studio tooling
and what kind of tooling is available to
you so my name is Christian Shea that's
my email address and that is the OTN
website where you can go to download
software for Oracle and get help with
tutorials and videos and such we also
have a Twitter account and this slide
deck should be on the Oracle code site
shortly if it's not feel free to email
me alright so as I was saying we're
going to introduce dotnet here so I'm
not sure if you're familiar with j-b
Java and JVMs
but dotnet is first and foremost an
execution engine that runs applications
and it runs a very special type of
application a bytecode
you get to give it as a virtual machine
type of thing and it provides memory
management thread management code safety
verification and a whole lot of other
things to make sure that the code is
safe to run on your machine and then
along with the actual execution engine
that runs the bytecode
there's also what's called the dotnet
framework now you've probably heard of
that somewhere along the line the dotnet
framework ships with Windows and it's
basically a set of libraries reusable
code that's used throughout throughout
the life of the dotnet developer but the
interesting thing about that is
sometimes it's not on the machine that
you need it varies depending on what
version of Windows that you're using so
it is downloadable it can be installed
on various versions of Windows at this
point they've been dotnet has been out
for over 15 years so there's a lot of
different versions they've been there's
to the years but right now we're seeing
more or less people are moving up
through version 4 or 5 at this point
particularly if there's developing new
applications so you'll see four or five
through the latest which is 462 which I
believe is shipping with some Windows
2016 but generally your application will
target one of the versions you'll
actually define what version of.net you
require with your application and Visual
Studio is actually a really nice code
editor it's very very popular with
people use it because it's it's it
basically makes a lot of that the stuff
that you do when you write code really
easy for example you can right click on
on any symbol and let it'll tell you
it'll drill down into it when you're
debugging you can you can do things like
change values as the program is running
and you can without read without having
to go back and stop recompiling it's
very sophisticated it's a really nice
development development enter and
currently they just released Visual
Studio 2017
however there's a lot of people using
their studio 2015 still you'll see that
a lot and probably of interest to many
of you there is a free version it's
called community edition which is really
just the same thing as professional
edition it's just that it has its free
as long as you fall under the right
category you can't really be working for
a large corporation or something but if
you're an individual wanting to learn or
you're doing open source development or
something like that then you can use the
community dition for free your your mile
mile miles may vary so make sure to
check the license to make sure what I
say is true but but in general um it's
free for a lot of people and so the
language is that people write their net
applications in are called typically
c-sharp that's the big one
Steve sharp it looks a lot like Java
actually believe it or not and and very
similar to C++ if you've used that and
visual basicnet is a distant second
liebe net kind of was a weird thing
because people who were doing Visual
Basic programming couldn't quite make
the jump to a full fledged language like
vb.net
and people who already know C or C++
they tend not to want to use the Visual
Basic semantics so it's not as used as
much as c-sharp when you do compile your
application down it's compiled into
managed code which is what's run inside
of the virtual machine the CLR net CLR
and it's called an assembly typically
it's a DLL and Visual Studio has dated
designers and it will talk will show you
a few of them but things like you can
basically have an automated way to to
populate a a hidden memory
representation of a table you can
basically connect you can basically set
up an automated way to pull data from a
database and put it into an in-memory
representation of a table and you can
also we're going to be talking about
entity
frame work which is an ORM they also
have designers 4:44 their ORM and that's
also part of Visual Studio so they do
have some data features baked right into
Visual Studio and then all of the
different database vendors have their
own tools so for example Oracle has the
Oracle developer tools for Visual Studio
which I'll show you a little later
sequel server has sequel server data
tools my sequel has my sequel from
Visual Studio and this just gives you
some some administrative features that
you can do it against the database so
now we'll talk about that after we get
through some of the introductory coding
and you feel free to interrupt me with
questions as we go along because it's
not like my last session where I was
absolutely slammed for time so I can
handle questions okay have any of you
heard of nougat anybody okay so nougat
is Microsoft's package manager so this
is very important for you to know
because this is a really easy way to get
a hold of software that you need when
you're developing your application so
it's a third party database they needed
it to be that way because links break so
all the software is stored in a database
forever that's what they say anyway and
then it maintains a list of dependencies
so if you for example if you go and get
Oracle's entity framework code we'll put
a we'll put a dependency on our data
provider in a Microsoft entity framework
you don't already have those in your
project it will go out it'll download
Microsoft entity framework and download
Oracle's data provider all from the same
database not nothing externally and the
other thing that's really nice is it has
a search engine built right individual
studio so you can just type Oracle and
it'll bring up oracle data provider for
dotnet another thing that's really nice
about that is you can check check your
requirements in the source control
without actually checking in the
packages you can say I depend on this
package and then when somebody goes to
source control and brings it back out if
they're using a new get package manager
it'll go out and it will find
the packages that your project required
it'll install them and it's smart about
things like versions you can get you can
provide it when you talk about
dependencies you can say I'm dependent
on this version to this version or only
this version and on top of all that one
thing that you could point out about
Newgate is it's really a package manager
for visual studio developers it's really
not designed for runtime package
management like you distribute your app
and then it at runtime when your app is
running it goes out and ask for packages
because that's what a lot of people
think of when they think of package
managers on other platforms they think
when my application runs it's going to
go out and get the dependencies so
that's not actually what's happening
here it's it's inside of your project in
Visual Studio and what it you're working
on it will it will basically well you'll
see in a minute anyway but it basically
becomes part of your project and finally
a web deploy that's another important
key thing to understand so if you're
running dotnet is presumably you're
going to be most of time writing web
apps and your app is going to run into
garnett web server usually that almost
always that's iis web server running on
Windows and so so there's a standard for
pushing an application from visual
studio into is web server and that
standard is called web deploy it's
actually really nice because it's built
right in the visual studio and you just
publish menu say publish so in order to
get this working you need to install web
deploy on the server and configure it
because obviously you have to make sure
that you you set up security and
everything so nobody can just go up and
put anything they want on your web
server and I'll show you how that works
so getting into the nitty-gritty here
there's lots of different ways that you
can start talking about developing for
developing for databases on winnette
some people would go with the newest
first and kind of work their way back to
the archaic stuff
but I prefer to start with the
granddaddy of them all this is what they
first had for data access because I
think it's still relevant in some cases
and it's important for you to understand
how it works it's more complicated than
the way people do it today but it also
lets you see how the plumbing works and
what I'm basically alluding to is a lot
of people use ORM today and I'll talk
about object relational mapping in a
little while a lot of people don't do it
this way anymore however especially if
you're concerned about performance there
are times when you may want to use plain
old a deonette but in a do that net as a
grandfather of them all everything that
comes after it is based on it builds and
layers and it basically exposed it
basically exposes data access to the
data net programmer so the first thing
that you'll see if you take a look is
that there's a connection on a
connection object right so as you would
expect and this these are standings are
not Oracle specific this is kind of
standard a do and in fact it's it's
interesting to say that because most of
the or all of the database vendors out
there they derive from this and they
extend it it's not like ODBC if you
remember if any of you have worked with
ODBC in the past another data access
protocol but where you basically are
kind of forced to only use a small
subset of the databases functionality
because ODBC which was the common data
access protocol in the 90s basically
said you can only do this much we're
going to only allow you every database
vendor to do this much so that everybody
does the same thing a do that Nets
different there's a set of basic classes
and then individual database vendors
like Oracle sequel server IBM my sequel
they extend it so they'll add stuff to
it if their database supports more
they'll add to it
however the base classes which is what
I'm showing here are fine to understand
if you go by a book on a do net you'll
pretty much be able to program anything
you want with Oracle or sequel server or
any other database at least at this
level it's only when you want to start
using database specific features that
you have to start learning about the the
added features to the the other data
providers so let's take a look at what
we have here so we have the connection
object it is what you would expect its
connection to the database and within
that there's a transaction object which
can control the lifetime of a
transaction transaction being if you're
going to do like insert insert insert
and then you want to either commit all
those at once or roll them all back
that's a transaction a command object
basically is a sequel statement it can
be more than that it can be a stored
procedure it could be a few other things
but the basic idea is it's the statement
you're sending to the database and that
statement can contain parameters so you
might say select star from employees
where M no equals and then you want to
change the employee number over and over
again as yury execute the statement so
you would use a parameter object in the
place of that employee ID
data reader this is a basically a way of
hoovering data
pulling data out of the database it just
basically lets you say okay I want 25
more rows I want fetching me more rows
fetch me more rows fetch me more rows
you just it's an easy way to move
through data data adapters are really
interesting and probably very very key
part of all this so data adapter kind of
acts like a glue or a middleman between
the database and this thing on the right
called a data set maybe we should talk
about data set data set is an end memory
representation of a table it's XML based
and it's basically not connected to a
database you can date a data set can
live alone it doesn't need a database
data adapter talks to the database and
populates the data set and it goes both
directions you can select from the
database put it in the data set or it
can look at the data set say oh this
changed I need to update to database
so that's where you get your select
insert update delete statements here
because as things change in the data set
the data adapter is capable of modifying
the database so if you know this you
pretty much have enough to write a basic
database application yes yeah yeah so it
kind of basically the idea of a data
reader is you're connected to the
database and you want to just start
pulling data out you have a select
statement select star from employees and
now I need to get those rows so data
reader is a very straight ahead way to
just fetch fetch
now data adapter is more complicated
because data adapter is kind of like a
middleman between the database and the
data set and the reason why it's a
little different than the data readers
the data reader is primarily used
programmatically you're writing code
I want to fetch I want to fetch the data
adapter is a little different it can
actually make make it so you don't have
to write as much code because it just
basically fills the data set and updates
to the database and you can put that
data set in association with a grid and
actually you'll see me do that and
basically you don't have to write all
the code that populates that grid the
grid knows how to populate the grid
knows how to talk to the data set and
the data adapter knows how to talk to
both of them and you don't necessarily
have to write a lot of code so the idea
is the data adapter is a more
sophisticated entity that knows how to
talk connect to the database and talk to
it and keep track of what's going on in
the data set so a lot of this is
esoteric and so on at this point I'm
going to go into the code actually start
doing a demo with you
all right so this is where the network
is really important let's see what I got
here okay so I'm going to start up
visual studio I have 2015 on here
because I'm on they just released 2017
about three weeks ago and I'm not quite
ready to redo all my demos I don't think
I'd have to redo them all but I
certainly would have to test them all
and I'm just a little lazy alright so
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a web application that's real
simple and all the web applications
going to do is going to give you a
drop-down list that gives you a let me
show you that let me show you the
backing database first so you can see
the data we're working with okay so
we're just going to use two tables and
this is part of a schema that comes with
if you do a default install of Oracle
it's called the human resources schema
Microsoft has something called the
northwinds database this is what we use
when we do demos but anyway the tables
you see here on the right on the left
are what we have to work with work and
I'm just going to work with the
employee's table and the department's
table so if you take a look at the
employee's table
it's got employee ID a bunch of data
about the employee and then and it's not
wide enough let me make a sweater
there we are because I want to say show
you the department number okay so this
is a department number it's got a
foreign key relationship with the
department's table which I'll show you
now so here you can see each of the
departments and there's a department
title and then some information about
department table so I'm going to
basically provide a website where you
get a drop-down list and it shows all
the departments but I'm not going to say
Department one
one-ninety I'm going to show the text
marketing administration purchasing so
you can pick which which department you
want you can press the button it'll show
all the employees in the employees table
that match that department so that'll be
a good simple application that can let
us use some of this a do die net code
that we just did alright so let's get
started so first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to choose a new new project
alright and the projects going to be a
asp.net website web application not
website I'll just leave that the project
type as web application five is the name
of it down here say ok and then I'm just
going to make it an empty asp.net
template asp.net is just Microsoft's
helper libraries and such for web
application development it doesn't
really come into play too much with what
we're going to do today you'll see a few
of the widgets that I'll use to make it
easier but that's what asp.net means but
I'm just going to say empty to keep
things as simple as possible I'm just
going to make an empty application and
we're not using Microsoft Azure today so
I'll say cancel but you could excuse me
alright let me close this because it's
taking up too much space alright so put
that over there bring this guy over here
alright so now what you're seeing is a
solution Explorer so this is what keeps
all of your code all the properties any
of the dependencies and config files
that your application requires alright
so the first thing we need to do is we
need a web page to start with so I'm
going to add that by is saying
right-click add new item
and then I'm going to say webform as my
type and then I'm going to change the
name to default ESP done default and
that's just because I'm lazy and I don't
want to have to go back and tell it
which webpage to start loading on
because by default if it's called
default ESP the aspx it will load that
page first so let's do that otherwise
you can just go over here and
right-click on the page and say set a
start page that's really all you got to
do but in this case it's default so I
don't have to do that all right so so
this is the on the HTML for that but I'm
going to just switch to the designer
because it's a little easier to do some
of the things I want to do here because
I'm going to work visually right now so
the first thing I'll do is give it a
title welcome to Oracle code 2017
Washington and just to prove that
there's no funny business going on here
we'll put the time with just 429 p.m.
all right and then the next thing we'll
do is put that drop down list so this is
where the power Visual Studio really
comes into play so I'll go ahead and
grab a drop down list which is right
here and I'll zoom in on that okay so
it's going to add a drop down list and
then I'll add a it's not beautiful but
I'll add a text box so that if there is
any error right now it'll it'll pop
propagate to the text box so I can see
what's going on I don't expect there to
be an error but you never know so
there's text box okay I'll move that
down here a little bit
oops see if I can move it below it
okay it's not be it's not getting along
with me so let's try it one last time
and then I'll leave it where it is
okay I don't know let me try this No
I don't know why that is okay it's not
letting me move it on the design surface
but that really doesn't matter okay so
the next thing that we're going to do is
we're going to basically wire this up
with code so in order to do this we're
going to need the Oracle data provider
for net so I was talking about nougat so
let's go out and get the Oracle data
provider for dotnet because I'm going to
be going to Oracle so I need an ad on
that driver for Oracle and it's called
Oracle data provider for dotnet so I'll
come here to nougat and there's
something called manage nougat projects
sorry nougat packages so I'm going to
add this to my I'm going to turn this on
in my project and it brings up this nice
search engine so I'm going to type in
Oracle and you can see that it has
brought up the a couple different Oracle
options one for energy framework and one
for Oracle managed data access so we're
going to use Oracle managed data access
which is the official Oracle data
provider for net so I'll just say
install ask me about license and then it
installs and all its really doing is
it's copying the assembly that we have
Cole Oracle manage data access right
into my project just copying the file
into the folders that are part of my
project you can even look at these
folders if you want by just
right-clicking and saying you know open
open project and file explorer these are
just these are just file locations so
it's copying our data access driver here
and the other thing it's doing is it's
doing some config file setup so it's
giving me some some setting up some some
things for the for the data access
driver and setting up some default
connect strings and stuff like that here
and it's not really going to come into
play in this demo but
but it's good to know anyway all right
so we've added that and the last thing
you want to do is change the using
Clause on the code actually I need to
add the code so let's do that so anyway
on page load I'm going to add some code
to load the drop down and I've rather
than you watching me sit here and type
all this in I did it earlier
so let's and then we'll walk through it
so I can show you what each one of these
things does okay I don't know why it
wasn't doing that to me before I don't
know what
yeah okay
I'll do that in a second maybe you can
help me when I do it so I don't spend
more time than I need to okay so I'm
going to add the name of the namespace
here Oracle managed data access client
and also Oracle managed data access
types that's so that when I'm using the
classes in net it knows where to look
for the definitions of them the last
thing is system data because I'm using
data set all right
zoom in on that
alright ok so you can see that now I
think if I look we can look through the
code here to see what's going on so I've
added this is this is a little esoteric
but I added this to that because there's
probably wouldn't put this code in the
page load normally but for simplicity
I'm doing it however I did have to add
this if not postback and it just means
that every single time the page load
it's not going to every time you post or
press a button or something and it loads
the page again it's not going to do this
every single time I just added that
because otherwise it'll just reset what
you did in the drop-down box okay
so ignore you don't really need to know
that but then I've got to connect string
here and it's connecting to a database
so where is this database and this is
the format of the connect string user ID
password normally you would put the
password in a config file encrypt it or
something but I'm just putting it here
because I don't care but but here I've
got an IP address and a database where
is that coming from well that's the
Oracle cloud so let's take a look at
let's go into my console and take a look
at where I got that information it's
actually pretty easy to install you know
you they have free credits they're
giving out at some of these events it's
pretty easy to spin up a database and
the best part about it is you get a 12-2
database which has all the news features
so here I have a couple compute
instances and I have a database instance
so I'm going to click on the database
instance and open up the service console
and click on the database
it actually takes almost as long to look
this up as it does to spend one of these
guys up it's pretty amazing it's really
fast it's so easy compared to installing
it yourself I have to tell you so here
you can see the IP address the name of
my database which is pdborcl and the
port number and so if you take a look
that's 83-61 port number 1525 and
there's the connect string I think it's
supposed to head of : 1521 right there
I'm not sure where that went so there's
the connect string and then let's take a
look at what the codes doing okay so the
code is opening a connection doing a
select Department name Department ID
from departments and then it's using
that data adapter that I talked about
the data adapter is taking care of
executing that select statement so you
take a oracle command object which is
what holds this little sequel statement
it's being created with the sequel
statement plus the connection and then
command type of text and then the data
adapter is basically taking care of
executing that statement and then the
data adapter fills the data set so
remember the data set des is actually an
in-memory representation of the table
that when it's stored it can be stored
as XML it doesn't know anything about
database connection the data adapter on
the other hand is able to talk to the
database and keep track of the data set
and fill it or make changes from the
data set into the database so it killed
a lot of birds with one stone
so what you can see here is we're
filling the data set
and then what did I just do I mean them
I changed something I deleted the line
okay so the data adapter is going to
fill that data set and that data set
which is the in-memory representation at
the table is going to be given to the
drop-down list and the drop-down list is
going to display the department name and
meanwhile it's going to be giving us the
department ID because that's what we
need for the foreign key so let's run
that
now when I say debug start debug no it's
giving me an error here I must have done
something wrong I must have deleted
something let's see what the error is
let me build it first
okay sale let's see why all right I
think I just have a missing hug that's
the problem with cupping coat is you can
accidentally delete stuff so let's see I
think I'm missing a thing one of these
is extra aeneas hopefully yeah that's
what it is there we go okay so now the
other thing I did was I added an
exception so this is pretty important be
able to capture errors so we've got to
try and a catch and so if there's an
error it's going to show up is an
exception object and I'm going to
populate text box with the error
all right so when I say debug start
debugging it's actually going to run a
local instance of iis web server it's
pretty cool so it runs the local
instance you can see up here localhost
and it lets me do my debugging local
before I go ahead and send it off to the
database and so you can see that at
least so far we got it working so we're
showing the list of department names and
underneath all this it has the IDS okay
so now let's move on and let's add a
grid view to it
so see here grid-view
and we'll add a button
okay and we'll change the name to get
employees and then we'll need to add
some code behind this button so I'll
double click on it and time is just
flying by isn't it already so this is a
similar code that we're going to add
that will basically I'll show you what
it does but okay so now let's look at
the code again we're connecting to the
same database this time this might be a
little this uses a little bit more of
the I do donate interface so this time
we're going to select star from
employees where Department ID is equal
to a parameter object and then we're
going to set the parameter object to the
value of the drop-down list you can see
down here it says drop-down list
selected item value and then we're going
to turn around and we're going to again
use the data adapter to fill a data set
and then we're going to put that data
set into the grid view and then we're
going to take data bind which basically
turns it all on and that's that
so build it and again run it locally
and see if this works so I'm going to
choose sales and then click get
employees and we'll see what happens
there we are there's some data we can
try a different one finance get some
different data so now we're running
locally see this is a local instance of
is now let's use web deploy to ship it
over to the Windows compute instance so
again I'm using I think I was on that
nose on the other second here so one of
the things I was looking at when we were
looking at the different services you
may have noticed that I have compute
instances so I do have look at the
dashboard that's a good way to do it so
I actually have Windows computer unning
and I've configured it for is web server
basically a dotnet app server and it has
Windows 2012 or Windows 2012 r2 or 2008
r2 available to you so I've got Windows
compute configured here and I configured
it for web deploy I think I even don't
really have time but I think I even have
a remote desktop going to adhere to so
you can see that yes I'm really
connected to it but I think it lost oh
there it is so you can see that this is
the IaaS console probably the most
important thing you see here oh it's
slow I'm probably the most important
thing you see here now it's chosen to
block it from me is this here the web
site publisher settings so when you set
all this up you'll get this file which
makes it easier to do web deploy it's
called the publish settings and you
bring it down to where your client is so
let's go ahead and send this up to that
web server so what we'll do is we'll say
build and then publish so it's web
application 5 let's publish it and
import from that file that I just showed
you now this is I brought it down
locally
and it will basically at least bring
down the username and password I still
have to put fill in some of the other
parts so I put them here too so I can do
it quickly so this is the Earl for the
server and I'll zoom in on this as soon
as I finish and the destination Earl
because the username password is brought
down the destination are all say web
application five so let me zoom in so
let's validate the connection to make
sure it's going to work all right it
will and let's publish it so now it's
using the web deploy standard to push
this file up into the dotnet app server
and it's firing up this so let's see let
me try to figure out what happened here
you
see it all went through we have an
application five I'm not sure what
happened but we're out of time so what
I'm going to have to do is use one that
I I just did a little earlier go which
is with application one so you can see
that basically if it works it goes up
there and now it's running on the actual
server say sales and there's a result so
I have to figure out what what actually
went wrong there I don't quite
understand that actually it's one of
those demo things so we have a few more
minutes so let me quickly just talk
about code first these will be in the
slides these are instructions how to set
up the dotnet app server and set up the
database cloud server so using our MSO
object relational mapper --zz allow you
to create a class is and basically
operate on the class and then not worry
about what happens with the database so
you have an employee's data class and
you make changes to that and then
magically it goes into the database and
when the database changes you magically
get changes to your class and that magic
is an ORM and there are several
different arms you can use and any
framework is a big one and hibernate is
another big one and there's a lot of
smaller ones and any framework offers
several different ways that you can do
it most popular by far I will say is
code first code first means you write
the code and then energy frame where it
figures out what the database needs to
look like just to persisters your
classes but there's also database first
where you point to the database and you
generate the classes based off your
database so let's take a look at an
example code for that
all right so this is a code first
application basically what we have here
is a set of classes that you can make
any class that you'd like I've got an
employee class and I've got a department
class before I do this I need to make
sure that that the schema is cleaned up
it's not so let me just delete a couple
tables here
all right so I've got the employees
class and I've got the department class
and then below it let me just show you
the accounting class zoomed up
and then below it you'll see the the
wiring that takes place that wires it
into the ORM so you're telling this
dbcontext which knows about the database
you're telling it that you want it to
track the employees table and the
department's table and that's really all
it takes this is called code first
entity framework so now when I run this
what it'll do the very first time you
run is it'll create the tables in the
database that you need to store your
your tables so it's done it so let's
take a look and server Explorer and you
can see it first of all it keeps track
of your might your history of using that
table and it has a departments table
which is curiously lowercase and an
employee's table which is curiously
lowercase and the reason I say that is
that in the entity framework world we're
asked to deal with lots of different
database types it does not follow the
oracle convention of doing all uppercase
it actually case matters with entity
framework okay so that's entity
framework amount of time so I can't show
you database first but it's very easy
you point to the database you run the
entity designer in Visual Studio and
magically these classes appear that
represent your database objects and
those are the two major ones that people
are using the two major role are ms so I
think the decision that you have to make
when you're going down that path is
ease-of-use versus versus performance so
I think in a lot of cases in our M is
fine it's very easy to use because
you're working with your own classes
you're not thinking about the database
but then sometimes it's not fine
sometimes performance really bites you
and as you can see from using the Ada
Okla net classes or as you will see when
you look at the ODP dotnet documentation
you'll see that it gives you tons and
tons of tuning knobs that you can use to
get good performance
so with that just like to give you again
the links to our site and I hope that
gets you started at least you've seen a
lot of different material here and I
encourage you to download the get the
slides and then try out using the Oracle
cloud to put your done that app into and
try out the database with the free
credits they're offering here and get
started using that so sorry I ran late
thanks everybody
