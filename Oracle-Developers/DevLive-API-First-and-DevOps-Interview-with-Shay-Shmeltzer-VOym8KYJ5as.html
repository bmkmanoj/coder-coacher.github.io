session at Oracle code Israel
just outside tel-aviv I'm your host
Javed Mohammed and I have as my guest
she smell sir it was the director of
product management at article and also
gave the keynote and also you have a
another separate session also a right
time very busy in this conference okay
my name's yes well thank you so we can
just probably just start off with your
keynote you right Esteban you gave a
couple of demonstrations one right
relating to API and a PR you will just
talk a little bit about that so what we
are showing in the keynote is some of
the new technologies the Talking Heads
for modern development one of the
aspects is API management and API
definition so we demoed a purely a
company that's all can purchase and we
just showed what people can get for free
if they sign up for an account and how
through a cloud interface they can
design shell and document and test and
their API and the API is basically the
base for a lot of the micro services
based application that people are
creating kind of feel contact with the
consumers so it's very important to get
those aspects right and this is why
having a good design environment and the
documentation environment is important I
think I was intervener meat before he
mentioned is that the certainly the xapi
are getting a lot of traction things
they've got like two hundred and twenty
thousand yeah and my host ability after
the conference will get two hundred
small because again like accountants
free even if you have a github account
you already have a username there so
just go in tied out and see what it can
give you okay
i we thing like can you share the
insights in terms of like micro services
are we seeing some kind of traction
where
micro services are better some kind of
applications than others yeah so I think
a lot of people just jump into saying I
want to do micro services without
actually thinking about the architecture
and Michael services like any other
technology
other places where they fit better and
located it's also dependent not just on
the technology aspect but also on the
structural feel team and are you able to
work in this approach where individual
people are creating services and then
someone need to orchestrate it across
the organization across say the users
and so I think a lot of people just go
over to micro services because it's the
cool technology and that's definitely a
good reason to go there it makes your
life more interesting you have a lot to
learn but the other thing to understand
is that it's still a little bit of a
bleeding edge for some people and so one
thing that we do always recommend with
adopting a new technology is not to jump
full head into this and actually start
your way we doing PLC's
be aware that maybe the first couple of
ones are going to fail be willing to
fail in the first one then gain
experience so as you become more
comfortable with micro services and
you'll be able to start basing most
enterprise systems on those
architectures okay I think in part of
your comments you kind of alluded to all
the next area and that you covered is
basically a distributed development
teams yeah and I think like when you
were talking about DevOps you talked
about obviously the developer cloud
service you wanted to talk a little bit
about that because it feels like you get
a great platform to actually kind of
manage the whole in though whole
development environment
what's developer cloud service gives
people is an environment where they can
manage the whole development team
working on a central repository of
issues of tasks and central git
repository well maybe multiple git
repositories but they are accessible to
everyone and everyone collaborates
together and again I'm getting the
documentation for your API is nice but
then someone needs to implement it
someone needs to consume it and having
one place where everyone can collaborate
on all the aspects share the same
environment across a
publishers and consumers makes it easier
to collaborate okay it makes your
integration among team members among
walls a much smoother and developer
cloud service which is a service that we
actually provide for free with almost
any other cloud product that you get
format is kind of the code thing that we
think will enable teams to leverage our
micro services in an efficient way while
they're building enterprise application
it allows them to not just look at and
building digital micro service but
actually look at the bigger picture of
ok what are all the micro services that
they need centralize the management of
all the code of all the team members of
all the stakeholders in one place ok so
you talked about developer cloud so it's
kind of pulling in your git repository
about your documentation and what are
the other things that it kind of pulls
in because it's like URLs so we look at
the Google cloud service is something
that enables two things one aspect is
agile development so this would be your
issue tracking the list of your team
members and then managing your actual
development sprints and saying ok which
issues are we going to handle in this
specific sprint and then tracking the
sprint progress and and then also
getting repos
basically understanding how your team
works this is one area it's key
management agile management the other
area is managing the old source code and
the lifecycle of your source code form
the planning stage with the tux through
a documentation design specs that we
share on a wiki all the way to a git
repository and then a build automation
system that can take your source code
and actually run a build test and even
deployment all in an automated chain and
connected to your edge elastic so one of
the nice things that we like about
developer cloud service is this face
ability of aspects from looking at a
code change what was the issue that
caused us to go and do this code change
in get then going and seeing
which bill got invoked as a result of it
which test succeeded which failed and
going and thing all the way up to the
deployment set all from one central -
code
so you mentioned obviously that
developer cloud service is free if
somebody wants but that's obviously with
it three of you get a certain article of
local produce if somebody wants to just
try it out commensal they can just sign
up for the regular overkill a cloud
style you get 300 bucks
I think we're offering it for 500 one of
them is a local college event and then
you can pick which services you want to
use and you can just check in the box
next to developer cloud service and try
it out and see how it works for you and
it's very easy to adapt to it it works
with multiple development environments
if you know how to use git if you know
to use the NPM maven and Gradle and NPM
or in node.js all of those things are
supported l I think people would feel at
home just talking at the UI it's also
very friendly like okay great well I
know before we came while we're talking
off-camera you mentioned you're
originally from this area so you come in
visiting so for those of us who are not
as familiar orifice yeah so stressful
what does a local really crave about Tel
Aviv or or the surrounding areas besides
that you know missing your family and
all of those things is there like any
kind of particular food or restaurant
you I would highly recommend yes the
nice thing about an Israeli food is that
it's a mixture of multiple cultures so
what I usually tell people is that when
I learned how to do software development
I wasn't really rich of course at that
part of time I'm not very rich right now
this is bad they go to food that we had
was a wiener schnitzel inside a baguette
with fries and it and then Hamas on top
of it so this is kind of a mixture of
the European Middle Eastern French and
even us-based
aspects all in one place and I think one
of the nice things from
me coming to visit a stoical at this
conference or other events is just going
to various restaurants over here and
trying everything else
one thing that is less nice is the extra
pounds that you gain when you go back
home so well looks like you're still in
pretty good shape so is the butter
considering it's lunchtime
I have you got a gastric juices going
exactly so thank you so thank you for
sharing and thank you for for coming
okay thanks Jerry thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
