Atlanta I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network and my guest for this
segment is Greg stack Nick
Greg how you doing today doing great bum
and so you work for Oracle tell me what
sort of trouble you get into there I'm a
product manager in the development tools
group and the area of the company that I
focus on is in our cloud so my team
develops a set of kind of developer
productivity continuous integration
agile tools called the Oracle developer
cloud service and as luck would have it
that ties directly into the session you
designer so tell me a little bit about
that session so that session is really
about the process that our team has
followed in order to go from kind of a
traditional waterfall in a more plans
slow kind of development group into a
much more rapid agile group that's
practicing continuous integration
continuous delivery and it's been
fostering a DevOps relationship with our
Oracle IT operations the title of your
session was implementing cloud-based
agile team development lessons learned
tell me about a couple of the lessons
you've learned yeah so one thing that we
found really valuable is in the way that
when a developer is working on their
code is we've mandated that developers
participate in like a peer review or a
code review system and just happens that
we built one that's integrated into
developer cloud service and so when a
developer receives like a feature or a
task or a bug they branch their code
work on the on the code but then before
they're ready to merge back into their
development branch or the master branch
they invite their manager or their peers
to look at the code and give them
feedback and what we found from that is
that depending on the type of
relationship it's a if it's like a
junior developer or like an intern who's
working on code then they can get
feedback and maybe some guidance from a
more experienced developer but then
sometimes it just helps to have another
set of eyes look
on your code and just telling you what
they think might be wrong in in
combining agile development and DevOps
process automation what are the possible
gotchas what do you need to watch out
for so one of the things that we found
was that having a solid notification
system built into your automated build
process has been really valuable so
we're constantly running builds we
probably are doing 50 to 100 builds a
day for our product and that's anything
from building developers feature
branches to doing integrations to doing
all different types of test Suites in
addition to production monitoring of our
services that are out in the different
data centers of Oracle cloud if
something fails and no one is there to
know about it then did it really fail so
for us we make sure that whenever we
have any kind of failure of our
automated processes that we're sending
out notifications and that could be
email based could be publishing to an
RSS feed or a chatroom or if it's a
really high priority at sending out text
and opening bugs on an individual basis
I mean any kind of change doesn't happen
without breaking a few eggs right
what sort of pushback did you encounter
in implementing this I would say that
you know when you talk about DevOps like
this if you like look at the Wikipedia
definition of DevOps it talks about a
cultural change where developers and
operations are starting to come together
and kind of break down the rule change
is the easiest kind of change sometimes
sometimes sometimes there's like
territory and then you know sometimes
they slip one side doesn't want to take
advice from the other side and those
kinds of things and so in the early days
of Oracle cloud that was one of our
challenges is just kind of working with
operations and being able to come up
with a good working relationship so that
you know we have consistent environment
that we're always developing against and
we have predictability in the way that
we are you know building out our
delivery chain
does one side of that equation have an
easier time of it than the other side
you know do the developers you have an
advantage over the operation site or
vice versa ah I think it's it just
depends on the company um for us I mean
I don't want to like throw anyone under
the bus or anything but from our
perspective we were more willing to yeah
it makes perfect video I think on our
site we felt like we were more willing
to adapt or open to it but we just had
to work together and things are much
smoother now much better now
have you had experience in in helping
other organisations adapt to this
particular change yeah so while
developer cloud service is a service
that is made available out in the public
cloud we also run it internally for all
Oracle development teams to take
advantage of so the same type of like
project based workspaces for development
teams is also hosted internally they
sound the same like code review tools
and see ICD tools that we make available
on the public clouds also used by um
Oracle development teams today and so
we've got a whole series of best
practices and tutorials to help teams go
from maybe a subversion based background
or other legacy source control systems
to go to get to learn about best
practices around get feature development
feature based development or get flow
development you know best practices on
how to use CI systems how to use binary
repositories all those kinds of things
is that information actually documented
internally within Oracle it is okay I'm
in a series of training wiki's and then
externally an Oracle public cloud it's
all different kinds of things videos
sample code okay yeah what's the one
thing you want someone who attends your
session to remember Wow if they jut one
thing down from your session what do you
want that to be
well um I would say that automation is
key Automation will help you in many in
so many ways that you probably don't
even realize the more you can automate
the more that you can be constantly
checking your product checking the
status running tests moving things
around to different environments in
automated fashion it pays pays dividends
so yeah for us it's been hot is the more
we can automate the better it is will
you be presenting this information at
other events in the near future I'm not
sure from doing another Oracle code but
we um but some of my colleagues have
been also presenting this this talk I
hope that we'll be able to also rerun it
at like Java one in open world okay two
things okay yeah great well thanks for
taking time to stop and talk to me if
you'd like more information on Greg's
session or any of the other sessions in
the Oracle code series please visit
developer oracle.com slash code you'll
find links to all of the previous events
as well as the events left in the series
I think there are six or eight now again
that's developer oracle.com slash code
for the Oracle technology Network I'm
Bob revoir thanks for watching and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
