the cloud native DevOps with my sequel
hands-on lab in this lab we're gonna
assume the persona of John Dunbar our
user interface developer we're gonna
leverage JavaScript rapidly combine
information from both our Twitter feed
micro service and our product catalog
micro service into a unified view a
next-generation product catalog for
alpha office so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing John Dunbar is
gonna do is grab feature for create the
alpha office product catalog and drop it
into the in progress swimlane after that
he's gonna go out to the program folder
and create a new repository to house his
code he's gonna want to import an
existing repository in this case we're
gonna pull in some code from github that
already has a pre-built UI to save some
time for our lab this will come in there
we go
you're welcome to explore this code in
more detail next we're gonna go out to
our build step and we're gonna create a
new build job to deploy this user
interface to our application container
cloud service our build job will do will
be set up with a couple of parameters
first under source control we're gonna
go to get and specify the new repository
just created next we're gonna go out to
triggers and trigger based on SCM
polling under our build steps we're
gonna add a build step to execute a
shell program and npm install' will be
the program we're gonna execute on this
code post build we want to archive the
artifacts and make sure we get all the
targets go ahead and press save at the
top and we'll build our job now for the
sake of time I will fast forward this
build a little bit this will take a
minute or two but when you're done this
is what it'll look like next we're gonna
create a new deployment configuration so
here we'll go out here we'll give it a
name
specify the name for our application so
we're going to call this our alpha
office product catalog UI we're gonna
connect out to our cloud test the
connection it'll work okay I can use it
specify note as the deploying container
we'll choose automatic and select the
job the build job we just did for the
product catalog Qi at the bottom we're
gonna include a manifest file it just
specifies the size of the container to
keep it relatively small for this in lab
I will press save at the top we see the
deployment process begin once we press
the start button alright when it's all
said and done we can actually click on
the product name here and we've got a
simple page that says hey you haven't
replaced or wired it to the rest
services so let's go ahead and do that
first thing we want to do is go get the
URL of our new github repository so that
we'll copy that and we're gonna go into
our compute V M and open the brackets
code editor here the right-hand menu
we'll go ahead and pull or wire this to
our git repository in the developer
cloud service and clone that code down
so we'll paste in the URL enter our
credentials for our cloud admin
right now we're going to go back to our
deployment step and what we want to do
is grab the URL for our alpha office my
sequel rest service this is the rest
service that contains the product
catalog information so we'll go ahead
and grab that we're gonna go into our
code and open up the JavaScript it
actually is going to call this rest
service so this will be in alpha office
CAS and we're gonna paste that in to the
variable at the top where it says DP
service URL we'll go ahead and drop in
this this path and then at the end we're
gonna put in products next we're going
to go back to our this page and down to
the Twitter micro service location copy
that link URL to deploy container and
paste in the path to that rest service
just do static tweets at the end we'll
save all of our code and now let's
commit and push that code back up to our
container back up to our git repository
so do that real quick
we'll have to enter a username to our
git repository in this case it's just
cloud that admin on what the password
that we used and you can enter any email
address here
alright next we're gonna just go ahead
and our password for a cloud item in one
more time and we're gonna push push this
code back up
now if we go back into the developer
cloud service when go to our code
directory we can actually make sure that
this push completed successfully so we
can right hand-side go into Refs
and we can see that just now the master
has been updated the master branch
similarly we can drill into the public
j/s folder and we can see alpha office
that Jas was just updated two minutes
ago so our code made it up to the cloud
if we go down the build what we should
see is a build job starting at the
moment the product catalog UI build is
spinning right now it's just completed
and if we go to our deployment will
deploy shortly there we go I did speed
that up for you and on the right hand
side we can refresh our page with our
endpoint and we should see the full
product catalog there we go now if we
drill into any of these products idle in
turn take the product ID of key terms
and query the Twitter information so we
can see any tweets associated with any
of the information around a given
product now last but not least we want
to make sure that we mark this activity
to build the UI as complete so we'll go
into our active Sprint's drag and drop
feature for into the completed channel
click Next
mark how long it took us hit ok and we
are done our UI is up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
