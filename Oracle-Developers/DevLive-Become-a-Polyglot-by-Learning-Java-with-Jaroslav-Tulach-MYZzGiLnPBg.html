progress my name is John Paul II from
Oracle technology Network and my guest
is Yaroslav did I do that right yes just
good so you have a session about
polyglot so talk so what what's the
general idea the general idea is that it
looks like that when you do a search on
Google you can find questions like words
do ultimate language Java JavaScript
Python something else and you will find
a lot of answers to these questions so
what we concluded from that is that
there is probably no ultimate language
but it would make sense to combine
languages and run them together in a
really effective way so what we are
working on and I'm from Oracle apps here
from Park we are working on Grouch am
which we call one virtual machine to
rule them all so that would be the
ultimate virtual machine where you can
run any language let them talk to each
other in a completely polyglot way and
also around them fast really fast ok so
that's the goal cool
so what other languages are you
considering javascript is on the list
oh all of them no discrimination so so
our primary work is in Java yes so it's
the ground VM that the name of our
virtual machine is a java virtual
machine right but on top of that we have
a system for effectively running in a
other language and if you want to port
your language it's really very easy you
just write a parser that generates AST
and then you walk the ast in is it an
interpreter and that's all and the
vision that we have is that you will do
this simple task for
language and we will do the rest make it
fast may make it polyglot and make it to
later so we will for example give you a
profile or debugger you don't have to
bother with that so we would really like
to create a system when you can
experiment with new and new languages on
steroids but safety okay so you more
like on the tool side it's a long time
it's run time together with to link the
tooling my origin is from NetBeans so
that's the IDE that has developed here
in black and so my roots are from
tooling but I'm also really glad that I
can work on the runtime because
previously when we basically did just
the tooling and could not influence the
runtime it was really hard but now we
control both and we can make the
necessary changes in the runtime to be
usable in the tooling so that's quite a
nice situation so so what are you
talking a little bit about the future
you have like one VM or virtual machine
for for every language but so where are
you today
like which language can you Eve okay so
or it would let's say like what are the
most likely languages that somebody
would use okay so our group is I think
we are something like 40 40 guys and we
are divided into various groups one of
them does the runtime system other part
does implementation of JavaScript
another part does implementation of Ruby
and there is also a group that is
working on implementation of a
statistical language called our yeah and
of course then well most of our project
is open source so so people really can
jump on it and do their research so we
have cooperation with universities and
some of them are providing
implementation of small talk some of
them are providing implementation of
Python and so on so on so like the
list of languages is not limited but
what we as Oracle edge deliver is genre
JavaScript Ruby and and our and actually
if you want to try it you can just
Google out growl VM OTN Oracle
technology Network and you can download
the virtual machine and play with it
okay
yes okay well of course and so any other
key points from your presentation that
you want to share oh that way so
basically what I did in my presentation
is to compare the speed oh yeah yeah so
so one thing yeah I currently I'm
working in or Eclipse for two years and
before I joined my college said
something like our implementation of the
Ruby language is ten times faster than
the fastest competition okay
I could I could not believe it so I
wrote a simple program which computes
prime numbers using chief of adult
openness and then I run it and I that
what I do in my presentation I run it
with Ruby implementation a and it takes
2 seconds to compute the list of prime
numbers and it takes 140 milliseconds on
our implementation so it's definitely
more than 15 times faster in this case
so that's a really nice thing but it's
hard to talk about it one needs to see
well right right so you can so in your
presentation you actually give like so
you you do the test and you want those
you Wow most of the presentation is
about coding and showing how to run the
code ok so we should have actually
plugged your computer and and you could
have shown that are you so I have to
consider around but you cannot do the
recording so next time so do you have
that also online or do you go out or do
you have like your guidelines how people
can test that yes okay so most of the
samples that I did I'm showing during my
presentation are
on my github account so that's
github.com /j to our flesh thief like
see favelas patinas so people can look
it up and there are some recordings of
my presentation or already publicly
available so if somebody is interested
in just google out learn java to become
polyglot and you should be able to see
this version of my one version of my
toes in the what's your favorite
language well I am rooted in Java I was
using Java for a long time so I tend to
like it but I'm starting to understand
why other people prefer different
languages and I have a slide about that
in my presentation as well and it
basically goes into a significant
question do you care about the code or
the data that your code is processing
okay because if you care about code you
probably end up with structured
languages with typesafe languages like
Java C++ that help you maintain the code
base but if you just are processing some
big data that come from a Hubble
telescope and you are looking for an
exoplanet for example then you rather
write your script in JavaScript or
Python and then just try to process the
data and throw the script away and the
next day start from scratch seeking for
a different data and so if you care
about data you probably end up with the
dynamic languages if you care about the
code you may probably prefer the
statically typed languages I see so it's
a big difference if you're working with
big data or not see in a sense right
well application so now so something
like these days basically everyone write
some programming right and those people
usually process some data right there is
just a significant or a small part of
people like me
or the guys that the right NetBeans IDE
or Java platform that really code for
coding don't process data but create a
runtime system and those are special for
so for them Java is relatively good but
but for processing data I feel they
understand that people prefer some
dynamic languages and what about Java
what are you fast about the JavaScript
since it's there is a lot of hype around
JavaScript here um so the JavaScript
benefits from the fact that right now
javascript is a write once run anywhere
there used to be a time when Java was
write once run anywhere but it's no
longer true we somehow forgot about the
browser so that's probably hard to fix
and and these days javascript is the
most portable language so yeah it's it
has its momentum and there is a lot of
innovation in in javascript libraries
that is happening in a browser but I
still prefer I'm the one who cares about
the code so I still like prefer the type
languages so so actually my pet project
is a very how to combine Java and make
it run in a browser so that's what I do
as my hobby let's say and how is that
going um yeah so I out my java virtual
machine that can handle that I created
API that allow you to mix Java and HTML
we are using that in NetBeans and there
is a munich-based company that supports
this whole ecosystem which is called
duke script something like like a
mixture of java like duke the symbol of
genre mixed with general script
basically forming a scripting or a
language or a system javascript was
originally meant to be also java in the
browser and so it's going well but like
many people got used to javascript
probably they can live without the types
but for the ones that prefer types this
is maybe a option to try so well thank
you thank you you're coming to us and
good luck with the presentation to that
and we will be back of shortly with a
different topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
