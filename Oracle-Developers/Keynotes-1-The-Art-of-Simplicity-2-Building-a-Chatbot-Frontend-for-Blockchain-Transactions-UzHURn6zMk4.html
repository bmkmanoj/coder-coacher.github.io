good
despite driving cars and computers
welcome everybody to our first orbital
events we're here in Los Angeles and
very excited all of you guys came to
help us kick off the or poco carpets my
name's Steven Chen I run the Oracle
developer community a non chair of
pencil I'm a developer evangelist so
whether we're the program committee if
you don't like a in the talk Steven let
us know we have a lot of great content
lined up for today
some of the different topics which
you're going to be covering today
machine learning and they are containers
micro-services and save lives chat box
and mobile and charts service little
favorite watch-chain of course just here
from the blockchain session databases
and big data devops tours and local
platforms and lots of fun talks actually
you're just mere chatting with Blaine
and he has some really cool IOT demos
for the last talk of the day so don't be
sure not to miss that that's gonna be a
fun talk so when we say to what's the
end yeah we like that it's a great of
content that we have to weigh everything
that people every developer really wants
to know if you want to follow the
schedule on your mobile phone please
download the app you can see it right
there just search in the in the App
Store for two events 18 and there you
can actually follow the schedule so you
troops there and and so forth but the
most important thing is you're supposed
to prompt me here what's most ok well I
use social media yeah I am a Twitter
stuff do you do that yeah I see well you
don't you should maybe pay attention to
the author through the handle but we do
have a hashtag for horatii code where
you can't follow along throughout all of
the Oracle sessions so we got 13 more to
come throughout the next couple of
months so you can if you on twitter you
can follow along there as well and you
can also follow and should follow
despite what Stephen was just say the at
Oracle there's a Twitter channel which I
was half joking but if you guys follow
up Oracle death
today and tweet something about the
Oracle code la event there's a high
likelihood you'll get followed back so
make sure that you actually if you're on
Twitter follow us back and we'll be
happy to to give you a little bit of
love back so we'd like to kick off the
events with probably the the most
prominent speaker in the Java and
JavaScript community who was gracious
enough to come out here and take a take
a small break from his book writing and
world travelling and all that fun stuff
so I'd like to invite up on the stage
Ben katsu Marin iam man cat - join us
what are you gonna be chatting about
today simplicity simplicity yes very
good so um the Gerald was actually
making this recommendation so we we need
to have you come and help out an Oracle
and give this talk to our employees all
right thanks thank you thank you enjoy
the patient that's a great speaker
excellent well thanks for the option to
speak here I want to talk about
something that we deal with every single
day well what we do at work is
constantly fight problem solving with
complexity so I want to talk a little
bit about complexity and how we could
possibly make things a bit simple and to
make things really manageable so that's
what I'm gonna focus on today well right
here in this room we have probably one
of the most complex things ever and that
is our human brain we are incredibly
smart we are innovative but at the same
time we get tangled up with emotions we
don't really think clearly a lot of
times and then clarity eventually
emerges out but after a lot of struggle
so why do things get really so complex
what's really hurting us in terms of how
we can do better and in terms of that a
lot of times when I spend time with my
children we talk about various things
and oftentimes the conversation becomes
you know into science and physics and we
talk about shutting doors cat
well shorting their head this mental
experiment he said what if a cat
sailed into this box you cannot see
through it and he said that any given
time the cat may be alive and dead at
the same time well takes a lot of time
to reason through things and I feel like
a lot of things in life are like the
Schrodinger's cat well when it comes to
complexity we deal with confusion she
has said life is really simple but we
insist on making it really complicated
so I want to ask the question why do we
really make things complex but I think I
have a reason that we do and the reason
is it feels really good we have to be
honest about it isn't it well if you
build something and your colleagues look
at it and they say gosh that's simple
you maybe feel a little let down you say
let me come back tomorrow we'll be
working on this and we want to give the
impression that what we have done is
important and to do that we often make
things a little bit more cluttered and
complex sometimes complexity cells if
things are simple maybe we feel like it
doesn't have any value so we have to
really fight the tendency quite a bit
well it turns out I don't actually said
and until any intelligent fool can make
things bigger more complex and more
violent it takes up the top genius and a
lot of courage to move in the opposite
direction
I wanna underline a few words here that
are extremely important and that is a
lot of courage and that is what I think
is one of the biggest challenges that we
have to face if you come up with
something really simple sometimes you
get ridiculed about it sometimes we get
critiqued by colleagues and it actually
takes a lot of courage to stand up and
say I don't need to make this really
complex here is a simple solution to
this problem that actually works why do
we want to really make this more complex
than it should be do you have that
courage is extremely important well if
simple we're sitting next to you in a in
a train would you even know that this is
simple and that is one of the things I
often find as a challenge I think almost
every single developer you come across
with would agree to the fact that we
have to make things simple so the
problem is not that we are in
disagreement
about making things simple the problem
really is identifying what that simple
really means I remember working the
group of developers I was constantly
complaining that a particular piece of
code was extremely complex after about a
few minutes of me complaining one of the
developers said hey man kid I just want
to speak up for the group you keep
saying it's complex but we collectively
think this is simple and I said well how
could you think this is simple when it's
clear it's complex can you tell me why
you think it is simple and the developer
said yeah because all we are doing in
this code is use a very simple FL
statement and and that's when it dawned
on me a lot of us don't know what
complexity really means well I pointed
out the problem is not that they used an
if-else statement the problem the
complexity came from that being repeated
seventy times in this code and that that
code being copied and pasted countless
number of times throughout the
application which means every time they
had to extend the application they had
to spend a lot of time and effort
changing every piece of code that made
the decision and the complexity blew
from the violation the try principle in
this particular case so we have to
really ask the question how do we really
even recognize this and do it well
unfortunately though it's really hard to
tell what simple errs as we have
understood maybe I can take an opposite
approach maybe I can try to say what is
not simple and maybe we can recognize
that and avoid so let me take an attempt
to that so what is not simple well
simple is not clever how many times have
you written a clever piece of code we
all have done that isn't it but why do
we create clever code because it feels
like our solution is worthwhile when we
make things really clever and and that
becomes really problem at all well let's
take a look at this example here for a
minute
public abstract class enum e extends
enum e just think about that for a
minute oh that noise you just heard is
your brain throwing an exception
that's when complexity kind of broods
over things
and these are not very simple things for
us to understand we kind of stare at it
and say her what does that mean really
well you know people often say how do I
office get my code and I often tell
people why do you want to obfuscate your
code your programmers write naturally
write self office gated code even they
cannot understand it after a week of
programming so the point really is we
don't really need to really take the
effort officer gate code we want to
really move in the opposite direction
well as it turns out I came across this
piece of code notice that float X in all
honesty I don't have a clue what X means
but whatever X is I've got good news for
you we now have half of it and then of
course don't tell me you don't
understand this code right because it's
so beautifully done and then when you
read all this code you're wondering but
I got some really good news with this
code at the end it returns X so the
point really is how do you really
maintain code like this when all these
become extremely cryptic for us to deal
with oh remember how we are told often
that when we work with things that the
object of programming models the real
world well we have to be very careful
with those statements like this one
developer took you to the heart and
wanted to really create an example of a
program that modeled flights and he
created something along these lines my
question is where were the other
developers well this guy was writing the
code somebody should have said dude
don't go there please don't do this to
us right and that becomes really hard
for us to maintain over time and that
becomes unbelievably complex for us to
deal with so complexity comes in several
forms but one of them is cleverness we
want to make things very clever and we
get trapped in the process after all
well the next thing I want to say is
simplicity is not necessarily familiar
we often confuse the word simple with
the word familiar familiar is what we
are used to familiar is something we
have seen a thousand times over and may
not really care to see it again and
sometimes we have this comfort that we
begin to feel what is familiar is
actually simple but the evidence is
actually to the opposite well let's
think about this for a bit if I ask you
what is this some people in the room may
be able to answer other people are going
to look at this and say oh my gosh that
looks very complex well it turns out
this actually is not that complex at all
in fact it is saying simple
uncomplicated casual and common you may
ask how did I know it I just use the
translator but the point really is that
we often get confused with things with
be unfamiliar with I travel them the
world I'm often in places where I don't
speak the local language it'll be pretty
naive of me to turn around and say
everything around me is complex it is
just that I need to recognize everything
around me is unfamiliar to me I always
keep asking this question to my
developers is there something that's
really complex or are you just telling
me you are unfamiliar with it one is
easier to solve the other one is really
hard to solve we don't want to deal with
unnecessary complexity but we have to
remove the unfamiliarity about things
quite often let's take a very simple
example here just to get a feel for it
let's say what I want to do is take all
the values here and I want to let's say
total the double of even numbers in this
collection how would I do this
first of all I'll say total equal to
zero well I want to of course output the
value when I'm done with this but what
am I going to do in between I'd say for
int I equal to zero and then what do you
do then you say I less than well in this
case price is dart well if I take the
prices value what do we call after this
is it length is it sighs is it count we
have to make a decision to that point if
it's an array it's a length otherwise
it's a size but then of course you stop
and ask the question is it less than or
less than or equal to do you ever ask
the question every single time the only
purpose of code like this is to make us
feel really
stupid because we get scared when you
look at it what if I make a wrong
decision with this and then to add
complexity we have to write that as well
then what do you do then you have of
course have to say if I came to add
insult to injury you say get the element
of that and then I could say is Martu is
equal to zero and then of course you can
say total plus equal to maybe the price
value look at all the complexity we get
dragged into well I call these as
accidental complexity and the reason I
call these accidental complexity is this
is not a complicity complexity that came
from the problem it's a complexity that
came from the solution we choose to use
and a lot of times we get dragged into
complexity like this
make no mistake a lot of us are very
familiar with the style of programming
it is called the imperative style of
programming I grew up as a kid
programming imperatively what I'm trying
to say in all those words is I had a
terrible childhood this was really
complex things to deal with but we don't
have to deal with so much complexity
after all we could try to do this very
differently let's give it a try
maybe slightly different way to do this
what if we started out by saying in this
particular example it's taught with
prices as we did right now but then we
will say given the prices will go
through an internal iterator we will
filter out given a price I want to say
price Mar 2 is equal to 0 for example
then perform a map operation over here
and then in this case of course I'd say
given a price maybe I want to double the
value over here and then maybe I'll
perform a sum operation in the very end
of this to perform the result of that
particular operation and compute it well
as you can see in here I even forgot to
double the value in the mess that I was
creating but the point really is the
code can become a lot more easier to
understand easier to follow we can have
a beautiful flow of the data through it
we call these the functional pipeline
well a lot of us are unfamiliar with the
details of functional programming but
one in I took a long time to really
figure out how to really use it
but once we become familiar with it we
begin to realize it's actually less
complex compared to the imperative style
of programming so on one hand what we
are very familiar with turns out to be
really complex on the other hand what we
are not so familiar with may turn out to
be actually simple in the long run so
the question to ask is are we unfamiliar
with things that are maybe simpler than
maybe familiar with things that actually
are complex so don't confuse familiarity
with simplicity so a lot of us are
familiar with the imperative style of
programming but declarative is a lot
more simpler and so what does it really
mean what simple has fewer moving parts
in it and and Michael feathers once a
tweeted I thought this was a brilliant
way to express it he said that in
object-oriented programming we
encapsulate the movie parts in
functional programming we illuminate the
moving parts that's a really brilliant
way to think about it because you want
to eliminate that complexity rather than
encapsulated because when he
encapsulated it's waiting to come back
to bother you when you get rid of it it
cannot trouble you anymore well simple
is not over-engineered we come across
solutions like this all the time for
example well Rube Goldberg made his name
by creating very complex solutions for
simple problems like for example coming
up with this very complex automatic back
scratcher but if you really think about
it a lot of us have done this at work
for our own projects I remember working
on a project where the developer had
taken a data from a database and gone
through 250 lines of code to transform
it into XML and then passes that down to
another function and that function
parses the XML performs a very small
operation and stick the data back into
the database I'm scratching my head why
go from the dare to XML and XML to data
and I called the developer and said I'm
looking at this code and he said isn't
that cool like No
why are we doing all this work here he
said
because this code is extensible I said
extensible for what he said rank it you
need to have a vision I said I'm really
sorry I don't get it what mission am i
lacking here where does the data come
from here what does it go here then why
are we going around the world to get the
data back here he said no no you should
understand the vision we should have in
developing software while I was saying
it I picked the phone and dialed it
because that excuse me and it picked in
hello hello he said is that you Venkat I
said yes
why are you calling me right when you're
in front of me I said you'd have a
vision I could be anywhere in the world
and talk to you now so we should always
talk on the phone even if we live near
to each other right well a lot of times
we get kind of carryover by complexity
and don't realize we ought to really
solve the problem we really have on our
hands and not get carried away by it
what simple is not really terse I want
to write concise code but I don't want
to create a terse piece of code for
example I came across this code on a
client project and I was doing a code
review for them and we were going over
code and we were trying to improve some
design and a developer showed this you
know brought up this file and then
quickly switched over to another piece
of code I said okay excuse me can you go
back to that code you just showed me
this was a code in production and he
said sure and I looked at it I said
would you mind if I take a photo of that
he said yeah absolutely go for it as
long as you promise never to tell who we
are to the world
I promise and I took a photo of it oh
sorry what I wanted to take a photo was
not this line the line that was below
this this wasn't production it said god
help me I have no idea what this means
and developers write code like this can
you imagine working on a project where
and I asked them why didn't you remove
this words he said that's the last word
of the developer before he died right or
quit so so there's a little respect to
the person who wrote it this is how we
feel about it when we write code
enormous complexity not because the
problem is complex because we cast to it
these are called self-inflicted boon we
create on ourselves and so here's an
example of a code
where I'm using a very verbose test to
write I have a set price and I have a
max profit on I have a fail I have a
catch
gars it's a lot of code to write we
should do better than this well it turns
out this isn't verbosity how do they
make it really concise I would argue
this solution from J unit 3 &amp;amp; 4 is a
terrible idea and the reason it's a
terrible idea is notice that while this
says I want this exception it doesn't
tell you which line actually caused the
exception I never want the test to fail
pass rather for the wrong reason and I
would argue this is not a concise code
it's a terse piece of code so what is
the difference between ters and concise
both terms and concise are really small
but terse is waiting to hurt you when
you least expect it so I want the code
to be concise and not curse so I would
rather read write it using a lambdas
this is what a unit 5 provides for you
in concept artists and so here you can
wrap that code in a lambda expression
and say I want that piece of code to
fail not anything else and this is
concise and communicating the intent
very clearly as you can see so we don't
want the code to be terse after all so
don't confuse terseness with concise and
simple as well well here's a beautiful
code by Toni her he says there are two
ways of constructing a software design
one way used to make it so simple that
there are obviously no deficiencies and
the other ones make to make it more so
complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies and we deal with this a lot
of times we don't even know what's
broken in a piece of code I remember
working on a project as I was going
through the code I found there was one
variable totally unprotected from
concurrent axis I went to the team and I
said excuse me I'm looking at this
variable it's totally unprotected are we
not going to have concurrency issues
with it and the minute I said this one
of the developers got very angry and
said hey vent kid this code has been in
production for three years what makes
you think you can come and scare us
today I don't know how to answer that
question but thankfully I didn't have to
before I could say anything one of the
other developers said aha but wait a
minute
remember how our record crashes every
two weeks and we have no clue why it
does so sometimes we kind of deal with
issues don't even know where the problem
could be potentially well okay so I
talked about a few things that are signs
of not being simple but it's only fair
that we talk about what is simple though
we said simple is not clever simple it
not necessarily familiar simple is not
curse simple is not over-engineered but
okay this is all what it is not but how
about talking a little bit about what it
might be well let's take an effort
simple keeps you focused what is the
most valuable thing in the world today
in the world we live in with tweets and
Facebook feeds and everything around us
do constantly distract us I think it is
our attention if a code can keep us at
our attention that is wonderful
if a code is not keeping our attention
we move away to do other things and the
problem is still at hand and the
solution is still away from us so we
want to really help to keep things
focused let's talk about this a little
bit let's say for a minute you and I are
programming we're not quite sure what
Java API to use and we're not even sure
how we would approach a problem what do
we do in this today's world you don't
get paid to take seven days to solve a
problem that every other person has
solved already so you might tell me bank
you're going to just quickly do a search
fair enough why don't we do a quick
search to find out the solution to our
problem well I'm going to go ahead and
bring up the browser to do a search
right away and the minute I go here
hey interesting what does it say here oh
look at that there's some really
interesting news up here about various
things happening mm-hmm
or even about Los Angeles here they're
talking about some brilliant company
well you know where I'm going with this
the minute I went there I got completely
hijacked with these stories and 20
minutes later on life what
trying to solve again and I completely
got hijacked with the process this to me
is unbelievable amount of distraction
that's out there what I came here for is
that little box but what I did got
distracted about is all these wonderful
things that are sure interesting things
no doubt about it
let's try this one more time if you will
so let's go ahead and quit that hey
let's do a search over here what a
beautiful picture over there I am not
sure what that picture is I want to
search for it but I'm a little anxious
about it what if it recursively end up
with yet another cute picture 20 minutes
later what was I trying to do a search
let me try this one more time let's try
this again I'm gonna search what can I
do at this point
search there is not a whole lot else I
can do how many of us use Google here
there's a reason for it right because
you care about your time and I want you
to think about this for a minute just
close your eyes and imagine this let's
not get convinced this as easy
remember what Einstein said it takes a
touch of genius and a lot of courage can
you imagine the day when this developer
went to his boss and said I've got the
search page working let's see it here
you go and the boss said what the heck
is this well it's a search page I see it
what what there's nothing here well I
put a button call I feel lucky well you
should do you think how many of us work
in companies where you can present that
kind of simplicity and get away with it
very difficult isn't it because the
minute you present something people say
show me something more I want something
here this is too simple but the
simplicity is the genius here let's make
no mistake the minute you click on that
but even if you before you click on that
button there is enormous amount of
complexity behind that button several
servers and algorithms and data
structures and
processors are running behind it but
they didn't bring that complexity to us
and say you suffer with it we don't have
to be distracted simplicity is the
essence this is one of the reasons why I
love pair programming
honestly why if I'm sitting alone
there's a beautiful statement called
shaving the Yak shaving the Yak simply
means you're not solving the problem
you're working on you're solving a meta
problem we all do that that is in us if
you're not shaving yak you are not a
developer we all just share the ax just
don't talk about it and if I'm alone and
programming I bring up the browser and
the browser says would you like to
upgrade oh yes of course click on it
next thing you get a proxy error 20
minutes later you're fighting something
deep down here and the boss comes to the
class and opens the class and says
excuse me what are you doing here in the
closet oh I wanted to search for this
Java API I turn on the browser it told
me do you want to install the upgrade I
clicked on the button got a proxy error
and everything is vague after this and
suddenly I don't know why I'm in the
class they're shaving the yak right now
and this week it dragged into quite
often well let's say you're prey prope
programming you're sitting it's somebody
and you're coding with them and you say
that your colleague says why don't you
just search for it you blink the browser
it says would you like to upgrade and
the colleague says mm and so like oh
never mind not now you so many acts are
being shared for that after afternoon
isn't it a point really is it keeps of
our focus to do what we want to do
rather than getting dragged into
something we shouldn't be focusing on at
the moment so the point really is our
fraction is achieved not when there is
nothing more to add but when there is
nothing left do you take away what a
beautiful Court I remind myself of this
every single day it is not what I can
add but what I can remove that really
makes things simple this is to me the
key behind refactoring I refactor a
piece of code not to add stuff but to
remove the clutter
can I make this piece of code continue
to work when it can have fewer elements
in it when it can have fewer things in
it and still it can serve the need it
does but remove all that complexity that
is in front of me to make it really
simple well simple eliminates accidental
complexity and hides inherent complexity
so we are dealing with complexity two
types of complexity one is inherent to
the problem
the other is accidental to what we do
and simple fails a lot less if I ask you
the question why is this cover circle in
shape I think most of us would give us
the reason immediately and the reason is
it doesn't fall in well here's the
question to ask yes it doesn't well it
doesn't fall in that's great that's a
good answer
I'm not saying it's not but if I came to
you with a request to create something
that doesn't fall in how many of us will
create it especially if you're a
consultant getting paid by the
complexity that you create I'm one of
them how would you really create this it
turns out here are the solutions that
also qualify for that and we would have
made more money creating one of these
shapes and all of them qualify they
don't fall in well it turns out there is
a year yet another important benefit of
this design not just it doesn't fall in
it doesn't matter how you roll that on
that imagine you are the dude who's
coming out of it and then adding the
very long day you're trying to put the
lid on while your colleagues are waiting
hey what are you doing trying to see how
to fit this in just drove the damn thing
over let's go home he's a beautiful
solution to have so the point really is
it is not just it doesn't fall in but it
is very easy to use it's intuitive and
it fails less and that is something we
need to really keep in mind as an
example though it's been quite a while
long time ago I remember this weird
experience when my child was very
small in the middle of the night your
wife wakes you up and says could you
please please go get the bottle for the
kid and you're about absolutely half
asleep your eyes could barely be open
and your problem at that point is to fit
the bottle with the lid I remember the
saying this sounds like an np-hard
problem to me right now right trying to
fit that in that is complexity you have
to deal with which is completely
unnecessary
and we see this in every aspect of life
when things become incredibly hard to do
so simple is easier to understand and
easier to work with that is a nature of
simplicity as well so here's an example
let's say I want to find if a number is
a prime number what if I can do
something like this is prime and return
number is greater than 1 and a stream of
data where I can say none match and find
if a number is prime what if I can find
all prime numbers well what if I do
something like this prime given starting
at if the number is prime returned that
concatenated with everything following
it otherwise skip it and return
everything following it ideally this
would be great but it doesn't work why
not
because this leads to what's called an
infinite recursion and it blows up
eventually hey great idea but hard to
implement or maybe we can try this a
little differently what if we can write
something like this stream dot ETA wait
and we can keep generating this lazily
and then we can limit to the number of
values we create well solutions which
are unfamiliar becomes enormous Lee
beautiful to use once we figure out a
way to actually do it and that becomes a
very compelling way to organize it let
me explain how this really helps what we
do well simple is very elegant and well
what about elegance really means well we
need to really appreciate elegance in
quite a different number of ways to it
why is this the world's famous painting
ever well the reason for that really is
that if you look at this picture it is
the most simple thing you could even
ever imagine there is not a whole lot
here there is no clutter
there's no ornaments there's nothing to
distract this is pure genius as we call
it and the man is genius not because he
created something complex the man is a
genius because he created something
beautiful elegant and simple that's why
we admire this I'm gonna talk about
what's called an architect's dilemma I
was in Boston and I was walking through
downtown Boston with my family we were
having a good time enjoying the the city
and I came across one thing that just
absolutely mesmerized me and this is the
Trinity Church
I stood admiring the church until my
family said dad we have to move now are
we calling the cops on you and what was
so admired thing that admired me it just
took any other Church isn't it
oh this is not the church I was admiring
what I was admiring is something very
nearby well next to the church there is
a building called John Hancock building
and when they wanted to construct this
building the city would not give
permission to build it and they said we
won't let you build it here because if
you build a tall building here the
beauty of this historic church will go
down so no and the architect of this
building said I'll take this challenge
when I finished this building the church
will only look more beautiful than it
does now without ever touching it so
what did he actually do he built the
building in a particular angle with
beautiful glass doors and my camera is
not doing the justice to this but I
stood there admiring the reflection of
the church on these classes telling
myself and everybody else around me
saying isn't that a stroke of genius
right there in the ability to really
reflect the church so beautifully that
you could just admire the church not
directly but through the reflection and
this again is very simple solution to a
problem at hand a lot of us cannot even
think about it and we're trying to fight
the solution when we can innovate
simplicity through it but it turns out
simple has to evolve let's make no
mistake we cannot sit down and create
something simple
nobody can in my opinion we kind of
create simple by evolving from various
things we do we have to take the time to
evolve it Richard Feynman said if you
cannot explain something to a first-year
student you haven't really understood it
this happens a lot
in my own experience I've seen this
quite often when I try to teach a course
or write a book about a certain concept
I find it incredibly hard to explain and
at that point I step back and say I know
why it's hard to explain because I
created a monster I have to simplify
this before I even try to explain it but
Occam's razor says we have two equally
likable solutions to a problem choose
the simplest often I'll share with you a
personal experience about it I was
writing the book on Java 8 this was
about a year to two and two years before
Java 8 was released and I was very eager
to write this book on Java 8 to think
it's priceless
but I also wanted to show some things in
the book which are really hard to do in
Java but you could really do with
functional programming in Java well I've
read some things before to prompt me to
do this here is an example of a
factorial and I can say if number is 1
return the number otherwise number times
factorial minus 1 well clearly know this
leads to a stack overflow error because
of an infinite recursion when the number
is very very large how do we really
solve this problem well here's an idea
I've read through some interesting books
and worked with some languages one of my
favorite books is structure and
interpretation of computer programs in
this book Sussman and Sussman enabled
sin talk about two different things they
talked about procedure procedure is what
you write they talk about process
processes the code that runs after
compiling transformation stuff like that
if you write an iterative procedure it
runs as an iterative process if you
write a recursive procedure it runs as a
recursive process but the real power is
if you can write a recursive procedure
but in turn it runs as an iterative
process that is when we can get the
elegance of the
and the performance at the same time so
this kind of optimization is done by
several compilers this being one of them
Erlang being another Haskell being a
third one a lot of functional
programming languages do this Scala does
this at the compiler level so disclosure
gloomy does this at the library level so
when he sat down with Java eight I said
to myself
aha these land would just do this in so
many ways
I know language like gluey justice at
the library level Scala does it at the
compiler level what if I can implement
technical optimization in Java so in the
middle of writing this book I started
playing with tail call optimization not
a good thing to do when you're writing a
book I spent about two days of my life
doing nothing trying to implement
technical optimization and here is what
I came up with further ten hours later I
came up with this solution while not
complete current equals current out
apply call complete is equal to current
art East complete just focus on this
while loop well the problem is this in
the book until the previous chapter I
repeatedly told the programmers avoid
mutability and Here I am with the
beautiful solution to a complex problem
which is doing mutability and I was
stuck honestly and I said they're scared
it for a day I could not know of a way
to remove this loop and the mutability
in it and I think I came up with a
brilliant solution to the problem and I
hope you will agree to what I did was I
wrote this in the book and I said be a
reader do you see that I'm using
mutability on this line number seven the
product the challenge to convert this
code to immunity is the left as an
exercise to the reader I thought this
was a really good solution honestly this
would have worked 30 years ago when we
didn't have the internet because I can
hide comfortably after writing a book
today we're on social media the minute
this goes to print somebody will tweet
and say oh yeah why don't you take the
challenge you were suffering show me how
it's not gonna work that is rephrase did
I said their meter do you see me using
mutability here
don't use mutability in every place you
can avoid it except places like this and
that really felt sick and I realized my
code just sucks I got to do something
different and honestly I said I don't
understand this maybe I will run into
one of my Java friends show them the
code and say what you think is there a
better solution
I said I'll wait for that then a couple
of days went by I moved on to write
other chapters and then I was on the
treadmill jogging as I was jogging on
the treadmill my mind completed detached
from the problem slowly I started
thinking about it and suddenly it dawned
on me I'm like oh my gosh I've been
looking at this problem wrong there's a
much simpler solution I never even
thought of it I jumped out of the
treadmill and ran across the floors of
my home with my children screaming are
you okay daddy I'm like no no you
understand God this problem figured out
ten minutes later I had the code working
so what did I do
well here's what I found out I can turn
the recursion problem into an infinite
stream problem just think about this for
a minute
what if I take every single function
call think of it as an object for a
minute then every function call is an
object then this object can form in a
collection it can form in an infinite
collection well all of a sudden when I
finish that a curse and I curse and I
say give me the next recursion give me
the next recursion and I keep getting
the next recursive object to execute and
and the minute I realized it the
solution is gone from complexity to
something simple with no mutability
stream that iterate the current call and
apply to get the next call keep going
until the problem is complete find the
first one
get me the result of it this is what
went into the book eventually well what
is cool about this though is it is a
lazy evaluation and an infinite sequence
it becomes incredibly easy once we
understand how to do these
functional mapping so a lot of times we
struggle with solutions maybe for days
maybe for even weeks sometimes the best
time we find solution is when you are
away from the computer when we are away
from the problem we are dealing with our
mind detaches and suddenly there's a
click and if somebody comes to you and
says how did you figure this out the
normal answer for that is a shrug I
don't know I just thought of it and and
maybe I say something you say something
I say something and you say something
I'm like oh wait that's brilliant answer
and you're like what did I say then and
you look at the solution we come up with
solutions that way which is fantastic
well Einstein said everything should be
made as simple as possible but not
simpler so always wonder is my solution
simple or maybe is it complex I might
think it is simple right now you might
look at it and say why are you doing
this here is an alternative solution
which is much simpler and I'm like yeah
what you suggested is much simpler than
I thought about let's go with it and
this is a discovery that keeps happening
almost every single day it is not about
my solution versus your solution by the
way it is about working together to find
a simpler answer and sometimes you may
have a better answer sometimes I may
have it or sometimes both of us will
come together and realize a better
solution in the end so we have to work
continuously towards it so is the simple
or can it be simpler than this I'm gonna
say simplicity yeast like showing us
can't the solution we come up with a
simple and complex at the very same time
it is simpler than what we had before
maybe it's more complex than what we
will do moving forward simple makes
things easy but let's nomic make mistake
simple is not easy at all to create it
takes a lot of effort to make things
really simple as da Vinci said well
simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication in life and every bit of
effort we put in to achieve that
simplicity in my opinion is worth it for
two reasons we make the current
at hand simpler we also gain the skills
we need to address complexity I would
say the very first thing we should do
really is to even have the sense of
complexity a lot of times we go through
for weeks and months sometimes and not
even realize that we are sitting in
front of something highly complex then
we should really so the very first step
is to develop that sense and the second
is to tirelessly work towards making
things simple and eventually not only we
make things simple we also develop the
skills to make things simple also in the
long run and I think that's pretty worth
it for what we do hope that was useful
glad to take any questions you may have
thank you we got about two minutes
delighted to ask any answer any
questions or comments you may have
please don't hesitate
thank you hey there thank you for your
talk that was super informative and I'm
in web development so there's not a
whole lot that I can wrap my head around
but I was able to keep up because the
points you were driving home are really
universal to all coding and all
programming so I appreciate that thank
you for like just diluting it down so
everyone can understand thank you as a
new program are getting involved where
do you think like would be a good path
to begin that's a really important
question and I'm not saying this lightly
one of the things I think we should
really take the time as developers
whether you're senior or junior is to
really implement a fairly decent
feedback loops I have gained so much
knowledge not because I'm smart it's
because there were kind people around me
who would look at what I did and said
you can do better sometimes people say
what if I'm wrong I want to emphasize
you're never wrong you've just done
something that could be improved that's
the way to look at it so ask other
people around you to review what you do
ask them to critique you ask them to
give feedback and and knowledge is a
wealth that grows when when it's given
not only do you gain I bet you they gain
as well because when they look at what
you have done they begin to think and
realize there are better ways to do and
one of the things I admire at young
people today is they pick up so many
things that I may not have time to pick
up so in the process we both really
become better so I cannot emphasize
enough review mechanism is extremely
important we're not just doing it in
Nova Nova industry we should do that if
he'd back loops are incredibly powerful
way to do this absolutely thank you
thank you reaching it absolutely thank
you just a quick question
premature optimization is a well-known
issue so I never come up with a simple
solution at the first so what do you use
to define if it's already time to
optimize or simplify versus that you
have to perfect the solution yet
probably dealing with more complex
issues right so that's that's a really
important question to ask when do we
begin to optimize
my recommendation has when it is complex
clean keep cleaning it up to make it
simple however to me optimisation has to
be driven by a result not by a goal to
optimize I think that's where a lot of
us fail we want to optimize the code and
I always ask people what are you
expecting as a result after your
optimization or I want to improve the
performance can you tell me what your
current performance is I don't know but
I have to be fast is not a good answer
so set a goal a and second see how your
code performs to that goal right now
third ensure that goal is really a true
goal I can optimize endlessly on a piece
of code if that has zero value for the
business I wasted my company's time and
my effort towards that optimization that
has no consequence so is the optimal is
the result relevant to the you know
business and finally the question is how
do we optimize given all these tests
that pass is the time to really look at
it so a very important question glad you
asked that but but we need to answer so
many questions before we can even sit
down to optimize and a lot of times it's
a foregone conclusion we can begin to
optimize even without considering it and
I think that's a bit of a disservice I
think that brings us to the end I'm out
of time
but I'll be hanging around today so if
you have any questions I'll be more than
happy to talk to you along the way thank
you for coming
hey thanks so much Bank at you so I
really liked your example of like a
treadmill and breaking away with work to
UM to kind of get a fresh perspective
and I have an optimization for you so
what I what what result are you trying
to get he's do what I found works really
well is not just coding and then going
the treadmill to think it's coding wall
on the treadmill
that is awesome something to think about
and actually I do that at home I have a
treadmill under my desk which I I code
on sweet alright thanks big round of
applause for venca so i'd like to
introduce our next presentation and the
first thing i'm gonna bring up on stage
has really been instrumental in making
and helping the Oracle code event to be
success he's very deeply involved in the
developer initiative I'd like to invite
siddharth Agrawal who's the vice
president of product management
siddharth thanks Pierre thank you very
much good morning so while Sean comes
and helps me not trip over these things
and get that set up I thought I'd start
off with just a little experience I had
about what would I say it three weeks
ago I was landing in Stockholm it was
about 9 p.m. in the night it was minus 6
degrees Fahrenheit people don't like me
too much so they send me to warm places
and the pilot announces we're landing
pilot announces what freezing fog has
rolled in so we can't see much but we're
gonna try to land and if we can't we'll
try again we have 45 more minutes of
fuel and I'm running okay so what's
gonna happen after that but luckily we
ended up you know making it fine so my
name is Siddhartha guru and I run
product management strategy across our
past portfolio application development
integration security management
analytics and I was a developer I
started my career at Oracle back in 94
as a developer I'm very passionate about
developers and being a developer so I
just let me see this guy
working that's not the clicker okay
the mousepad oh I thought I'd be kind of
disconnected from this laptop but I
guess not so safe harbor statement we're
gonna share potentially some futures
don't buy purchasing decisions based on
what I say the most of it is available
today so I wanted to start off with that
written an article and InfoWorld about
the trends for 2018 for developers and I
think some of these topics are very
clear you know server less how we go
into production with server less but
there are lots of challenges around each
of these for example when you think
about server less programming now you're
doing distributed programming you have
to think about eventing you have to
think about debugging across you know
functions etc chat pods you know
everyone wants to think about messaging
as the new paradigm of interaction and
chat pots are so easy but behind it
you've got natural language processing
you got actual intelligence you have to
maintain a state engine so it's it's
it's complex and how do we make that
simple DevOps I mean DevOps is amazing
it's given us so much productivity
agility in being able to do things
faster and with higher quality but guess
what today developers are spending maybe
almost 60 percent of their time with
DevOps and what does that mean that
they're not spending the rest of their
time that with that time coding and we'd
rather be coding lot more than managing
DevOps so how can we move towards no ops
while getting the benefit of DevOps
blockchain very exciting technology
everyone's thinking about it but what
are the use cases and how do we make it
simple to build blockchain applications
because you know getting the hyper
ledger fabric set up getting the block
chains to perform as hashes get added
it's hard and how do you get that to
scale and have security around it goes
for very business centric purposes open
source the innovation and open source is
amazing there are lots of technologies
that are coming up but the thing is to
get that open source stuff up and
running takes a little bit of time
whether you take kubernetes for
orchestration where releases are coming
out every six weeks how do you scale a
kubernetes cluster how do you make it
highly available all of those things are
things that developers have to worry
about or Kafka if you want to do
inventing Rd set up a Kafka
cluster highly skilled the cluster how
you bring it down there's complexity
around open source how do we make that
simple and find me machine learning you
know machine learning is the hardest
thing you know it's it's what everyone's
talking about but how do we get machine
learning embedded into our applications
or how do we benefit from machine
learning without even thing having to
think about it so those are some of the
things that we've been thinking about at
Oracle and you know the platform that we
built out and I'm not going to talk too
much about the platform but it's to be
able to build and develop and deploy
applications there easily for developers
to be able to integrate those
applications because even if you write a
chat part you have to be able to you
have to have it be able to talk to some
back-end so easily be able to do
integrations be able to publish content
be able to secure the content be able to
version the content be able to analyze
and predict there's a lot of data that's
out there but only 1% of the data is
being acted upon how can we not have you
be data scientists yet be able to get
value and insight from the data and then
more importantly be able to predict what
is it what is the insight that is needed
and finally being able to secure and
manage these applications I mean
security is the top spend item today and
so how do we make sure that the code
that we're writing is secure how do you
make sure the ones the code goes in
there is secure how do we make single
sign-on across Facebook messenger
etcetera very simple and then how do we
manage these applications where there's
a lot of log data there's a lot of user
performance data user metrics that we
have to pull together how do you make
that really simple so with that you know
no presentation is complete without a
demo so I'm going to start off with the
demo and I happen to be walking around
in the Oracle parking lot and no that's
not what I do on a regular basis but as
I was going to a c.b.c Larry Ellison has
this specific spot for those of you who
worked at Oracle of no Oracle there's
one spot and you better not park that is
actually security guard there I happen
to see his Lexus LFA standing out there
so I said hey why not build a bot to be
able to sell his Lexus LFA now if I
actually did that that'd be a problem
that but that's what this scenario is
based on is being able to sell his Lexus
LFA which happens to be slightly
expensive and someone really wanted to
put a cartoon together and
here's a cartoon to make it easy but
we're gonna this is the what the
scenario is going to be and this is
gonna run through the entire
presentation is that there's gonna be a
part that I'm going to use I'm gonna use
that to sell his LFA that's going to be
put onto a blockchain network using a
server less function and then the
blockchain network someone is going to
use it to buy the LFA yeah so that's the
that's the scenario and here's what the
architecture is so I'm gonna use the
chat part I'm going to show you how the
chat pod is built and that chat part is
called going to use Kafka and be able to
spin up and function that function is
then going to execute and put that car
onto a dealers network and then on the
other end when someone else tries to buy
the car they're going to be able to go
onto the blockchain network see the car
being available and then be able to
potentially purchase that car and that's
going to use the same set of
technologies on the other side and
through this will show you the chat pod
capabilities blockchain and server less
functions and I have a lot of help
because you know I'll have other people
come up and go through this because I
can't do all of this myself
according to them oh and here you know I
didn't you know move the car but you can
tell the car is moving I'm not a big fan
of bills but you know they're the car
moved across okay so let's go to the
BOTS piece of it so people are getting
very tired of apps mobile apps I fly a
lot and Oracle doesn't care to put me on
the you know my airline of choice it's
whatever is the cheapest so I have apps
with United Delta Lufthansa Virgin
Australia Virgin Atlantic Virgin America
every version of Virgin airline that is
out there so what I want to check in I
have to go in and have to check-in into
that app but instead what if I could
just friend facebook Messenger on
facebook Messenger the KLM bar and I say
check in it knows who I am
it checks me in and it makes it really
easy to bring up the boarding pass put
it in my wallet I didn't have to
download any kind of app I didn't have
to manage the application the upgrade
the lifecycle and even for build people
building parts it becomes really easy
because they don't have to build
mobile apps they just have to build a
BOTS and Facebook Messenger or whatsapp
or WeChat becomes the platform so people
are trying to move away from these you
know mobile apps to some extent and you
know messaging is becoming B platform of
choice and when people are trying to
build this conversational AI there are a
few challenges that they're experiencing
one is you know I need to integrate the
Alexa Google home whatever other voice
recognition input mechanism there is I
have to integrate with facebook
Messenger slack what's that we chat I
have to integrate with back-end systems
I have to make sure they're single
sign-on and security I have to be able
to manage that state engine I have to
have dialogue state I have to manage
multi multiple languages and it takes a
lot of AI expertise to be able to do
natural language processing machine
learning speech etc so those are some of
the challenges and so let me first show
you the bots that we built out so if we
can move over to my iPhone guys and
before I plug it in I'm gonna move off
of this wait where's the iPhone plug
then cat you've created some challenges
for me here I'm kidding I love that
simplicity talk I'm gonna get off this
main screen look at their 126 thousand
unread emails and that always doesn't go
across very well as people wondering
what I'm doing okay here we go
can you guys put my phone up there oh
okay hdmi 3c has given simple
instructions that i cannot follow okay
so here's the here's the bar and have
friended John's car dealership that's
the bar John's car dealership I wake up
the BART just by saying hi and hopefully
the BART is going to respond to me yes
welcome Siddharth interested in buying
cars sure no I'm actually selling a car
so let me pick selling a car okay we
offer competitive prices for clients do
you have a license plate okay let me go
to my phone and bring up the license
plate out here here's the license plate
and you can also got to see some
photographs of my family can you upload
recent pictures the car sure this should
blow you guys away here's the car and
that is in the parking lot of Oracle and
here it says wow it's already picked up
the registration number the VIN numbers
that means must have gone and done some
kind of search against Carfax and let me
make sure this is the real car right so
let me just go back and see more details
out here so I've got the registration
number transmission one speed I don't
know about that but you know that must
be some kind of error I don't know how
car just has one speed but you know the
LFA by the way there are only 500 LFA's
that we've been built it's a two-seater
so given our family of four I need to
sell this off so yes this is correct yes
here we go Oh what is the mileage on the
car well since I only drive on the 280
and I'm generally driving about 180
miles an hour I can only do that between
2 and 4 a.m. so I don't get to drive
this car much so I put in 1,100 miles
out here ok
ok Kelly Blue Book price is 375 K well
that was my list price these car is
supposed to appreciate in value but you
know they'll buy for 385 whatever I have
enough money I don't care about 25 30
grand this is OK with you yes okay so
that's the front end of the body if we
can come back to the presentation and
then I'll show you how the part was
built so here
in terms of what we built as the
platform that helps make it very easy
for you to be able to build these boxes
we built the integration into facebook
Messenger Alexa WeChat etcetera so we're
actually getting the speech-to-text from
the voice input channels we applying
national language processing on it we're
doing multilingual translations on it
and we're able to then have a dialogue
engine and AI engine on the backend so
all the front-end integration and then
being able to engage at Facebook
messenger which is what we were using
today is taken care of for you there's a
lot of AI that has been built in so you
don't have to worry about the AI weird
managing the state we're managing the
context we're being able to parse out
the entities that are part of the intent
that was submitted that's all being
taken care of by our
Power Platform I'm using cognitive
speech you know vision language
capability so you can actually do image
recognition also within your bar and
then let me show how this bot was built
so Shawn did you refresh the thing here
let me just see here I am going to the
browser now in terms of building the bot
so here we go let's hope I didn't get
logged off so this is our you know BOTS
UI mobile cloud Enterprise is the
capability in there I've got a number of
different BOTS and we're just going to
pick for example the selling bot out
here and here what you got is the notion
of intense so this is where we're able
to parse what the person is typing and
come back with intense so for example I
can I see some intense here by car I'm
looking for a car I want to buy a car
and if I go in here and I say you know
intent I can actually test you know what
the confidence level around the intent
would be so if I say buying Lexus for
example and there is no intent called
buying Lexus here in this list it should
it comes back at 43 percent confidence
so this is just the experimental piece
inside my application that gives me the
ability to see what it is and what I can
do is I can add this example right to
the the intense if I want and then I can
train the model again we give you
different ways to train the model in
this case machine learning is there it
takes a little bit of time to train the
model each time but that's fine and then
you can also go here and go to the bar
and let's say I'm going to selling the
car and this you'll see later on but if
I say selling car it actually will show
me what kind of responses it will
generate for me so it shows me for
example here this was yeah these are the
cars that are available that you know
could be sold etc now in here we've
created the intents the entities so once
we've understood the intent
we're also parsing through the entities
so we created some system entities in
here like address currency etc but you
could create your own entity like
dealership out here and say you know
name is one of the characters
sticks that I want to get for the
dealership so that now you can say
whether it's John's dealership or Bob's
dealership based on whichever dealership
it's being worked on
we've got resource bundles out here
sheepy in addition to the natural
language processing and multi-language
capabilities we have you can add in your
own resource bundles we're giving you
the ability to bring in you know custom
hooks so if you wanted optical character
recognition in here you can bring in
your own custom component objects in
here and lastly we have also created the
integration with the channels so here
for example you can see the Facebook
channel so we create a default
integration on Facebook you can do that
with other channels like WeChat etc plus
we're giving the ability to do web hooks
so you can bring in anything you want
you could create integration with Siri
there's the integration of Alex and
Google home that's already there so that
gives you some sense of how this you
know bot was built and if I go back to
my presentation here and go back
so here the elements of the you know the
the bot piece one is the channel
configurator that gives you the ability
to have various channels configured both
input and then facebook Messenger so for
example if there's a card layout and
facebook Messenger it automatically
takes care of that you write your bot
once and it's available across multiple
channels the dialogue flow capabilities
we tracking the context and the state so
if you ask for balance of your checking
account we're not asking you which
account you want to transfer done from
for money to be sent to mom if you just
said send $50 to mom we have a
conversational AI engine so we're able
to recognize the intense parse the
intense parse the entities and then
we're making it very easy to integrate
to back-end systems so be able to call
integrations in the backend to
applications be it's fast applications
or on-premise occasions so with that I
want to bring onstage Sean since I have
done all the hard work he's gonna show
you the easy work of actually having a
function being called that execute are
the portion of this demo thanks Sara yes
I'm all good great all right so so yes
I'm Sean Smith I'm with product
management with the server steamed
Oracle and we'll dive into a little bit
of the background what happens next
after the chat pod so you saw the the
front end with
but and then of course we have some
processing need to do right we have
blocked in the background there's gonna
be some processing in between those two
sides and how do we do that so we need
service functions but before I do that
I'm gonna talk about service a little
bit so so service is a category of cloud
services it's not a thing a certain a
specific thing it's actually a
categories or anything where you're not
managing virtual machines and installing
software and you know setting up
networks is serverless so even you know
Gmail is a server list sort of
experience right you don't install
anything you just send emails a fan or
functions is a service platform is the
compute P source compute element the use
of using server lists so you can imagine
you have a platform with storage with
compute with a networking the compute
part would be surveillance I'm giving
you the brief overview just for time so
why would you use service right well
it's cheaper typically then this is the
big thing the typical tipple experience
with service platforms is you pay when
your code is running so imagine you had
a piece of code that performs some
service if you did traditionally get a
VM install Tomcat and spin it up it runs
and runs 24/7 you pay all the time right
whether it's being used or not in a
service platform typically you only pay
when your function is being called right
so if no one's calling your code you're
not paying which is a huge huge change
now the other thing is in the service
platform using functions you're writing
small pieces of code small units of code
not giant monolithic 10,000 line
programs typically smaller ones and so
the smaller programs are much easier to
build faster to code review to
understand they'll be simpler right
because there's not a lot of code going
on gives you much much faster iterate
fix things change things try things new
things out of course having your code
deployed to a platform that's managed
for you means it's much more reliable
right so networking problems I fail over
problems all handled by the platform and
all of that that's simplicity that we
have in terms of these small functions
gives you more time to innovate right
gives you more time to to try things out
if you're not spending all your time
debugging large monolithic code code
bases give more time to try things out
and be more innovative so it's really
nice set of benefits around server less
which brings us to the FM project and
that's the thing I'm you know we're
talking about here today the FM probably
so it's a it's an open source project
it's on github
it's Apache 2 license so it's you can
use it for anything you'd like to do and
it runs anywhere runs on your path on
your laptop it runs on the cloud it runs
on your data center whatever you like
you'll notice I have highlighted the
word simple and I really enjoyed the
talk earlier because simplicity is kind
of the key and I'll show you some
samples of me using the using your FM
you'll see it's very simple it's not
that we're trying to be complicated
right we're trying to be simple we're
not trying to you know show how smart we
are we're try to make it as simple as
possible for developers and you'll see
that in the demos at the bottom end at
the bottom of the FM platform are
containers so functions are actually
deployed as containers which we see
containers as sort of the the atomic
model or the base of the building blocks
that would build a platform upon that
way we take advantage of the docker
ecosystem that's you know really taking
over we're pretty busy project so we
have you know 2,500 commits over 50
contributors we have people from from
within Oracle outside of Oracle all
taking place on github and we are
involved with some open source standards
so around the container native compute
foundation things like cloud events and
other standards are out functions
because functions is a pretty early
technology in the sense that there's
really a lot of people working on
functions but no standards that you can
really rely on today so we're part of
that in the conversation so our model is
very simple ok an F n functions like a
little piece of little piece of code
wrapped in the container it usually does
one thing and being does one things you
see pretty small and it gets its input
from standard input it writes the
standard output for the results and it
logs to standard error right this sounds
awfully familiar right so this is the
tried and tested UNIX model that's been
around for decades right a very simple
model and all the complexity around you
know where the logs go how do I invoke
that function how do i scale this thing
to handle incoming load all that's
handled by the platform right so the
goal here is to give a very lightweight
pleasant user experience and all the
complexity is pushed down the platform
so your life is developer is really much
easier there's a CLI so this was a
couple pieces there's a server piece you
can deploy again on your laptop and the
cloud on your desktop there's a client
to let you create new functions so FN it
lets you create a function FN run lets
you run on your desktop do some
debugging
FN test run some tests
your function deploy is pushed it to the
server and then call is a way to make a
call of that your function and all the
functions that are deployed get a rest
or an HTTP endpoint so you see here we
have a route to to a function I can
invoke the function from that route
that's automatically provided by the
platform so enough of the talking right
okay so I'm gonna be a code live so you
know fingers crossed right so I'll try
so I have an empty folder here I put the
top of the screen okay that's good if I
say FN in it and I choose a runtime what
program do what do I want programming
programming go here and I'm gonna call
this function hello okay so we basically
got a folder now called hello and so are
we have a very simple coding by
convention model we put functions and
folders and that's the name of the
function so if I create a function
called hello it'll go in and hello we
have a whole bunch of function of this
sashti starts to be really useful so one
- hello and you'll see what we've got
here a couple of files I'll just pop it
open and oops I should try that again
here I think to get code to open that
folder for me alright so I've got three
files here's the func go now if you
don't know go it's not not too important
but you see here it's a very small
program essentially reads some JSON off
of standard input and it's like a person
right with a name you construct a
message hello person the name and then
writes it back to standard output it's a
very simple function that's all there is
here I've got a funky animal file this
is just a metadata file tells us you
know when you're deploying it to go
what's the name of the binary you're
gonna invoke when you run the program
and so on and then we have a nice little
test file here the let says describe
expected inputs and outputs this is
Meryem is a black box type of test it's
just for convenience it doesn't replace
of course your unit tests entirely so if
I go back to my terminal here I can
actually type F and run at this point
now you see you're seeing building image
so you know we're using docker onto the
covers I built a container with that go
code and I run it if I type FN - -
verbose just to show you the all the
dirty details here when i do a run
you'll see a lot of stuff you might be
familiar with if you're a docker you
right so we're building doctor files
again nothing magical going on here this
is not the goal to again not to be
clever is to show you that this is what
we're doing is automating the process
making it very easy to deploy functions
to to doctor okay so I talked about
standard impose down and output and that
function you saw was taking us input
from standard input so I can actually do
something like this
echo and I'm gonna write JSON in the
shell which is like good times let's see
here so I say echo quote the name of the
person I'm going to talk to I'm going to
pass in here and we'll put in I'll just
put in LA well this is the worst idea
ever is typing JSON here I know pipe
that into F n run like that wrong so
because we care program with me if I get
that wrong let me know okay
so I basically sent in this JSON object
into my function it read that that input
it pulled up the name replied back with
another JSON object right so that's kind
of cool just simple piping now we're
gonna do next here is I've got it
running locally that's great I can
actually run FN test and it'll take that
JSON test JSON file and run it against
my my code here yeah it looks good so
I'm passing in some test data I'm
getting about what I want so a nice
little developer experience here for go
now I'm going to deploy the code so FN
deploy and they have an FN server
running locally on my machine deploy and
I need an application name so I'm going
to call the app la just to keep it short
and I'm gonna say - most local that's a
little bit of a trick to improve the
developer experience here now I won't go
into details okay
I've deployed that thing and I can see
FN apps list I got a couple of
applications one is called la ones Oh
code so la and I can say FN routes list
la and I can see that I have a function
it's called hello and it's available at
this rest and this HTTP endpoint so now
I can say I can say FN call my
applications lol a I'm going to call the
hello function hello
all right it calls it I can also do this
curl HTTP
Oh what Oh Pete thank you thank you
that's so I want support up here live
coding okay good
let's grab this URL here okay do that
and I can call that right so basically
that functions now running could be in
the cloud could be somewhere butts on a
server it's not my laptop anymore and
I'm making that call the experience when
using FM the functions deployed in the
cloud or locals is fairly similar I can
also of course do this now I can say
Carl - D and I'm gonna pass in that that
code we passed earlier here where's my
little piece of JSON I do not want type
again okay past that and I'm gonna go
pass it back to the same function so I
can actually run the same kind of code
and it wasn't supposed to server comes
back right so it's very very very simple
so that's this that's basically the
command that's the the core of F n very
simple multi-language support there's an
example with go let me jump back over to
here okay so that's great I can build a
single function it's very easy to build
a function package it as a docker
container deploy it to my my server and
run it but I want to build I want to
compose app functions together to build
applications and this is where the
functions world is going right now is
great we have a whole bunch of functions
but how do I build apps right how do i
structure them together so we came up
with FM flow which gives us a way to
compose together functions do fork/join
deal with concurrency deal with chaining
things together it's all written
currently supporting Java and so we
built on the Java completion stage API
or completable futures API and Java 8
it's designed for threads but we've
adapted it for dealing with functions
because I have these functions running
somewhere in my cloud right so I it's
not just running local in a local thread
or a local VM I'm running my function
somewhere in the cloud but I want a nice
API that lets me lets me orchestrate
them right now it's Java only we're
adding support for JSON Python and other
popular languages let me show it looks
like here after I explain what I'm
trying to do so we have our chat by
example I have a cell a car function my
boss comes to me and says oh that's a
great solution except that we have to do
a whole bunch of other stuff too you
need to go off and do background checks
usually make sure that car
was involved in a felony crime you know
do all kinds of checks for the FBI so I
need to do more than one single thing I
have to do multiple functions now right
this is that sort of why I wouldn't need
to orchestrate so I have a bunch of
things I want to do do the CARFAX report
criminal lookups FBI checks and so on so
using the the completion stage API I can
actually compose together I can actually
describe how to organize these I want to
invoke my cell car function then I want
to do both Carfax and Colonel checkup
and then I want to do all these other
things too so in a certain sequence and
what we do is we build a flow function
this is the orchestration function this
describes the flow right how this is
these functions are gonna be executed so
let me just show you what it looks like
in code now if you haven't seen the the
completion stage API before it can be it
can be a bit dense I had MIT but the
nice thing is a java standard api that
you can read books on and learn about
and apply here so here i am getting the
current flow I'm gonna go get cars goes
and gets all the cars in front of cell
or a check on I'm gonna go to process
that car and here you see me I'm doing a
then compose I'm invoking a function
CARFAX criminal criminal check and then
all those things are done I then want to
go off and print a message all right so
I've gotten got a number of primitives
here all of then except then compose etc
this is just Java so what's cool but
this is this is a Java program I can
think about I can debug with my
colleagues we can look at this go yeah
that's the right algorithm I'm not
writing some declarative XML to try and
describe some sort of flow this is where
we are today is currently a simple
declarative program all right so let's
just go look at go see what flow looks
like so I'm going to just change tabs
here and I've already deployed this
example so you see here I've got a bunch
of functions to get cars post as cars
and so on it's all running already now
I'm just gonna open the browser again
cuz I have an interesting piece here so
what I can do is I'm gonna basically run
the cell car operation right so I'm as
the FM call it's called OCO does the
application you saw that complication
before and it's called flow okay so run
that cell you do that I have a
visualizer here useful utility the flow
UI but lets me look
they're running off running flows so I
built this application with in Java but
of course that results in actual
functions being called and deployed so
here we see these code this code running
we can see that we've gone off and if I
click on a bubble here I can get some
details so the plates of the two LFA's
that I found here I was going to to deal
with to process I can then go down for
each of the cars remember there's a loop
right for each car please go and process
it for each car then go and do a carfax
and a criminal lookup you can see here
that as I click on each one I can see
the full stack of how did I get there
and what's going on in the logs this is
really cool for when things are working
it's really even better when things
aren't working so when things are going
wrong you get red red bubbles here click
on them get the full stack trace and
sort of debug your flow so it's really
cool development experience ok so that's
that's the quick quick and dirty of the
FM platform so just a few things to
think about we are building up a managed
service this is open source today you
can go download it if you want to come
to our hands-on lab today later you can
download it and try it out runs on your
on your machine but we're gonna build a
managed service where all the
infrastructures have taken care of
you're not building on your computers
you'll build on service experience on
Oracle cloud so that's coming later on
this year of course security is job one
right in the cloud so this will be all
integrated with the Oracle security
infrastructure so for reliability and
security and also you saw we had these
rest these endpoints right so HTTP
endpoint will be exposed so it'd be nice
to be able to use the Oracle API
platform to build out your API design
your API is mash them out be happy with
your solution and then go and implement
the functions behind the scenes so all
that's gonna be possible so if you want
to try it out yourself
FM project do go there we have links to
slack to github all the stuff that you
need to get involved we love to see you
see you there
all right now I'm gonna pass off to
jagdeep who's gonna now talk about the
next piece so functions have done their
job validated the car sale we're now
going off and complete the sales picture
with with the the sale at the cell
operation with watching all right guys
ok thanks Sean
appreciate opportunity so how many guys
how many of you have heard about Bitcoin
come on all right
and how many of you guys have traded
bitcoins made some money on one two
three four I hope you guys sold it at
the right time you probably sold it
February fifth for every six made some
money let's pretend I made some money
and I'm here to buy a car using that
money right so that LFA you just saw see
that cell I'm going to buy it let's see
how we do it and I'm going to use
chatbot again they're like two billion
people using chatbots right my daughter
if I want to talk to her 14 15 year old
that's the only way I can have a
conversation so I have friended about
let's see if this thing responds alright
so the two options here buying and
selling right he sold a car I'm going to
buy a car awesome
so these are some of the cars that Bob's
dÃ¶ner the guy the used-car lot right
next to my house has he has a Cadillac
he has a BMW here the ADI well that's
not what I'm looking for I'm looking for
a Lexus and if I can spell Lexus right
awesome well he's saying he does not
have a Lexus on his lot but he's part of
a network where there is a Lexus this
car looks beautiful this looks like
Larry's car I've never seen it actually
but I look for some details here
$399,900 a dollar short of $400,000 a
lot of dough hopefully I made that money
in that Bitcoin trade but okay I'm going
to say I'm going to buy this car so this
car now got transferred from Jones
dealer to bath dealership he's going to
bring it in he wants me to confirm I say
yes at this point the car got
transferred and he's asking me when can
I come and do the
paperwork I say and do a test drive I
say 2 p.m. tomorrow
so people who clap the loudest after the
session get to ride with me tomorrow at
2 p.m. in Larry's car alright so this is
how we went about doing it so we are all
set for tomorrow
so let's recollect on what really
happened here using a block using the
chat board it got transferred from one
dealer on to the blockchain and then off
it comes to the other dealer and we buy
it to untrusted parties were able to do
a transaction without a middleman that's
where the blockchain comes in right in
the interest of keeping things simple
where do you go for simple definitions
of things I go to Wikipedia so what's a
Wikipedia definition of blockchain it's
a decentralized and distributed digital
ledger used to record transactions on
multiple computers in a way that you
cannot retroactively Li change a
transaction that's what the definition
of blockchain is right from a Wikipedia
and what does it mean really mean the
how does this business transaction get
done this business transaction is based
on consensus between multiple parties
who do not really necessarily trust each
other based on a predefined business
logic so having no me intermediary in
there that's the key thing right that's
that's where the power of blockchain is
bitcoin is another implementation of
blockchain right Bitcoin is a way of
doing the same thing anybody can join
that network it's a permissionless model
and it's a shared consensus model in the
real world also these two attributes
that we talked about being decentralized
and collaboration this is how most of
the business was done this is how most
of the goods are exchanged this is how
most of the services are rendered right
and there are a lot of use cases for
blockchain in real world anybody doing
real-time projects at this point on
blocking or everybody thinking about it
as we talk to customers we'd run into a
lot of
use cases right a couple of key ones
that I would like to point out think of
a example like a airplane every part
that goes on that airplane we need to
figure out where did it come from with
it the genuine parts were used there's a
history of that part when was it
serviced it's a perfect use case for
blockchain I am buying a $400,000 car I
want to make sure that every part that
went into that car every repair that was
done was done with genuine parts and I
want a unrepeatable history of the
service done right and that's a perfect
use case for blocking another big use
case that we see is all these marine
shipping right there's so many parties
involved in that transaction there's a
shipper there's a receiver
there's customs involved all that
paperwork needs to be transferred that's
a perfect use case for blockchain take
simple things like doing background
checks having simple things like having
an identity digital identity everybody
has about 27 different digital
identities at this point how do you get
more control over your identity how do
you have not a single source which gets
leaked and then I will think of a quick
Equifax or anything like that you have
no control over that blockchain is
building systems to have control over
those identities can blockchain solve
world hunger probably but not every
problem this is the solution how do you
figure out which problem to put this on
I have some simple simple things to
VantagePoint simple is simple is the way
to go right if you're thinking of
transactions where there are
intermediaries involved which are
causing a lot of cost and lot of
friction that's one use case if you're
looking for something which has a you
want to figure out the audit trail or
the history on the transaction that's
another use case the third use case
probably is where there are a lot of
systems involved and you have to do a
periodic reconciliation or these systems
are across many different departments
many different organizations and somehow
you have to manage them and reconcile
them
later point that's a perfect use case
for blockchain right those are some of
the key things and when you're looking
from an enterprise perspective from an
enterprise the different there's a big
difference between how Bitcoin works on
blockchain versus how enterprises work
enterprises are looking for
confidentiality of the transactions
they're looking for security they're
looking for scalability not every
transaction needs to be out in the
public what Bob's dealer paid jewels
dealer dealership I don't need to know
he made twenty five thirty thousand
dollars I don't need to know that right
I don't need to know what is he buying
the parts for what has his cost I only
need to know what whether genuine parts
were used or not so there is a need to
break this big channel into small
private channels if you will and I'll
show you how we are doing that from a
service perspective and as it
enterprises there's a lot of buzz around
it but you haven't seen a lot of use
cases around it at this point
what are the reasons there are it's a
challenging stuff right it's not easy to
do this real-time what are the
challenges every Enterprise has a supply
chain system ie RP system all these new
systems that you put in how do you
integrate them into your existing
systems that's a key thing right on its
own as a silo does not exist these
systems all have to be part of an
ecosystem that integrations are hard yes
that's one challenge the second
challenge is for enterprise things need
to be enterprise grade right their needs
should be resiliency there needs to be
security all these things need to be
accounted for when you are building a
system and just bringing pieces trying
to stitch something together it doesn't
work for our enterprise also this
platform keeps changing rapidly there's
a technology churn going on right every
time there's a new standard enterprise's
want backward compatibility enterprise's
want to make sure that the investments
they have made or they can reuse their
value going forward how do you ensure
that how do you ensure the operational
challenges who's going to do the
lifecycle management who is going to do
especially in blockchain this becomes
how
because you are going across
organizations you're going even cross
companies if you will who's going to do
the life set back back up who's gonna do
patching all that stuff needs to be
accounted for so introducing the
blockchain service from Oracle what we
have done is we have basically a
preassembled managed service if you will
all that complexity that I was talking
about we have tried to take that out and
provide you with the service which you
can just one click you can provision and
it's off and running for you right at
the it's based on a robust
infrastructure and pass layer and all
the integrations that I was talking
about into your past services are all
taken care of in the the center of it
the blue box that you see it's a
hardened hyper ledger fabric
implementation and the reason we chose
hyper layer fabric one is we committed
to open source and the reason for our
choice of hyper layer fabric is one we
find it very modular right there there
are a lot of modules and plug-and-play
becomes easy
it's very permissions based if you will
you can define private and public
channels in it and it's very scale
scalable if you will right since it's
modular based based on and it's a very
programmable there's all the business
logic behind it it can be implemented in
containers so this is the service that
we are using and as we move forward I
would just like to demo this to you
basically go through the scenario that
we just talked about let's see if the
demo gods work with me here
so first let's go and look for that car
that just got transferred hey anybody
remember the license plate awesome so
this is not this is not the right one
I probably fat-fingered it let's let's
alright so here's the car on the right
what you see is the API details so
everything that we have done in that
service is exposed as a REST API so that
makes it very easy to integrate into
other systems and if I
that this is the transaction history so
what I'm doing right now is this is a
custom app that is built on top of that
hyper ledger and and we are reading from
that ledger and seeing what the
transactions are so what you see here is
how the car got transferred from one
dealer to another and from of that other
dealer to my name let me go back and
show you what the service looks like so
this is a dashboard on top of that hypo
lager we have various nodes running and
on that this is the dashboard what you
see here is in the last month how many
transactions were committed how many of
them was successful we can obviously go
change it and stuff I have five
organizations to Pier 7 channels I'll
walk you guys through it alright this is
what the this is what the organization
looks like so let me swap so Detroit
Auto is the founder member of this
blockchain network and all these other
dealers are part of it right there's no
central authority but some the detailed
auto guy is the founder member all the
others have joined that dealership what
you see from our organization proper
perspective all these blue nodes here
are the organization's and all these
green dots are basically the remote
computers that we are talking about this
is where the hype the ledger exists this
these nodes are what are committing and
endorsing the transactions if you were
right there is a there is a ordering
node which basically takes all the
blocks orders them and puts up on the
ledger and then there is a central
certificate authority if you will moving
along
these are the that's these are the nodes
running and one particular node that I
wanted to point out is the rest proxy in
ordered everything that we are doing on
the ledger can be done through REST API
and this is the rest proxy that you are
talking to
giving you a visual representation so
one key thing that I wanted to point out
so there are that we talked about the
open channel and having private channels
so this is one channel here which all
the dealers are part of so the ledger
associated with this all the dealers can
read off of right
but if Chad's dealership or any other
Jones dealership wanted to talk
to the Detroit Auto he can have a
private conversation so there are
multiple Ledger's going on here on a
poor Channel there is a ledger everybody
on that channel can read the
transactions but he can also have a
private transaction going with the with
a dealer here moving along so these are
what the channels look like I'll just
pick one save any particular channel to
just show you what the blocks are being
committed so this is what the blocks
committed are and then we come to the
concept of chain for chain codes are
basically smart contracts these are the
ways to make the deal with the ledger
any query you want to do any transfer
you want to do any updates you want to
do this is what you do it through the
chain code if you will this is how you
you first write chain code and then you
install the chain core this is just so
you come here upload the chain code file
define the peers that it's getting
targeted add once you have installed it
you go and instantiate it and the key
thing I wanted to point out here is you
basically can specify here how many
organizations that you want to endorse a
transaction so in some particular
transactions you want somebody some
particular person to endorse it or you
need three or four parties to endorse
and transaction before it can get
committed that's all that flexibility
exists at this point and the code for
this the the whole thing this is again
this is written in go basically
everything that you're doing you're
dealing with the transaction here this
is where your vehicle definition is and
if I'm going to transfer the call this
is there's a function definition here
which I will just use to transfer that
application so moving along let's go
back to the presentation here so this is
in a nutshell what the Oracle service is
right all the pieces that you see on the
left here are basically the building
blocks there's the admin console there's
a membership service all these things
are provided to you and all these are
exposed as REST API s and there's SDK
provided for it as a developer these are
the three key things that you're doing
you're writing the
chain cord or the smart contracts if you
will this is the business logic that's
get implemented these are the pink boxes
that you see and then you're building
applications on top of it using the SDK
and using the REST API so after you have
done that you basically go and just
configure the thing and the service is
up and running and you get all the
pieces of integrating it all the
operational pieces are all taken care of
so that's all I had back to cidade to
sum it up thank you
I left my phone up here so I couldn't
take photos and tweet but that was great
jiggly thank you so just to wrap it up
you know this is the architecture that
you seen of the car being transferred oh
I guess I have jig beeps portion on this
one let me just skip this so I just
wanted to share with you what we built
from an application development
perspective for developers so one we
have a complete CI CD pipeline you can
bring in your own for example Jenkins as
web hooks into the pipeline but we're
enabling you to use a browser-based
interface to manage crumbs to have agile
issue tracking to be able to have an
entire CI CD pipeline and it is also
container native in that it understands
that when you check in code in to get it
automatically builds an image if the
knows how to register it to a container
registry deploy a container and manage
it on kubernetes etc we're giving you
mobile and chat pod capabilities which
is what we showed so you have a cloud
service that enables you to build mobile
applications get location-based
in-flight insight analytics based
insight and also be able to build chat
parts like the ones that you saw or
making it very easy to build the chat
box API first development so everything
is mobile first API first so we're
giving you the ability to use apiary if
you go to a period or i/o where you can
actually test and design api's without
needing to implement them we will
actually based on the documentation that
you're writing create a stub of a real
functioning API that we call from any
language so that you can expose that to
developers who want to use those api's
get agreement on the contract and then
actually go to implementing the API
providing an API gateway that can run
either in our public cloud run on Prem
or run within a third-party cloud and
we're giving an entire lifecycle
management around those api's including
how to monetize those api is how they're
being used what's the performance of
those api's and then obviously WebLogic
if you have a logic we're giving you the
ability to run web logic as a service in
the public cloud and lastly give you the
ability to do drag-and-drop based
application development to quickly build
prototypes that you can validate with
the line of business folks to say hey
you know does this look like the user
interface of the experience that you
want or maybe even get you know your
user community to come experiment with
it and then you can either have that
generate all the code behind it or then
you can write that code yourself so
that's the visual development platform
and these are you know the set of
services that I was talking about and a
few more for example the event hub cloud
service is the Kafka based service that
was used so you have that open source
you know that you're using which is
Kafka we delivering that as a cloud
service so you don't have to worry about
scaling up the cluster as there are more
topics being created or their message
event storms that are coming through
we're providing you identity as a cloud
service also so integration with single
sign-on you don't have to worry about
that and now working on the AI platform
cloud service where we giving you the
ability to define your models be able to
train the models and very easily be able
to expose your models as api's running
on NVIDIA p100 GPUs with flash memory
and with 25 gig Ethernet between various
compute or a computing storage nodes so
giving very high performant platform for
AI and then we don't want you to think
about Oracle as just four Oracle
databases but you know you can
definitely use Oracle database as a
depository which is available as a
service where the operation the patching
the backup the recovery all of that is
taken care of by Oracle we're also
delivering that same experience with
Cassandra for no sequel based workloads
with my sequels of my sequel databases
you have those available as services
obviously you can run Mongo on our ayahs
and then integration the ability to
easily integrate various applications
just by doing drag and drop between
Oracle's on Prem applications to non
Oracle SAS applications or from Oracle
SAS application
to other non oracle SAS applications and
then finally an IOT platform so you can
take device data do analytics on the
streams of data that is coming in do
predictive analytics on the data and
most importantly have devices be able to
create service tickets within your
back-end applications be they SAS or non
Oracle SAS so that's the platform for
you available as developers lots of
momentum you know lots of customers here
3,000 plus apps in the cloud marketplace
of folks are exposing apps in the cloud
marketplace and we now leaders in
categories you know as defined by
Gartner Forrester another analyst and
we've created a single you know site
that you can go to for information that
is pertinent to developers from Oracle
which is developer or Oracle comm we're
adding more and more content to it and
please always feel free to give us
feedback on what else you'd like to see
also spread the word around Oracle code
this event is being live streamed today
so folks who not here can also be
watching this it will be recorded but
also different cities out here in Europe
in Asia Pacific and in North America and
finally you know we want you to come
experience the Oracle cloud so go to you
know cloud.oracle.com slash try it and
you get free credit and you can use any
of these past services to experiment on
our Oracle cloud so with that I want to
say thank you and wish you an exciting
fun hands-on event for the rest of the
day today thank you
all right so thank you soon all right so
we wanted to ask Siddharth to join us in
a toast for the first Oracle code event
we have some local beer here Angel City
IPA so here's to our cheers to our first
order it's a bit early in the morning
about here that's bollocks look so so

technology experts and competing for
prizes
Gerald here has one of the prizes we're
giving away the air block drone so if
you guys come and join us for the zip
lab you can try this out when this if
you can win that also we are focusing on
diversity inclusion getting more women
