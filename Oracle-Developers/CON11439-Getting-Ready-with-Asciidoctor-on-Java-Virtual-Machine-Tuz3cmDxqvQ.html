is I getting ready with our ski doctor
on the JVM my name is chad reed's this
is Michael speaker and rest almere I a
little bit about us we are two gigs a
gig that loves technology open sores and
share the knowledge we are both Mexican
sets out the funny accent you're hearing
and we also live in Switzerland so we
have twice the funny accent I will not
the chocolate yes would love to try
cheese we work for a company and swiss
company obviously named canoe actually
we love feedback we love feedback that
much that we are our companies the one
behind the voting machine so don't
forget to vote after this session and
well we can talk about that later if you
want a little bit at about undress he's
a java champion he's also our java
rockstar yeah but that's enough about us
the important thing is the top of the
hand and skied on so let me ask of the
people that are here in the audience how
many of you already know ascii doc or
ask a doctor or make use of vascular a
few hands okay perfect so this top is
it's going to be a half an introduction
to the ascii doc syntax the escalator
project and how you can benefit from
these two things inside the JVM by using
java based tools it's one of our firm
beliefs that the ascii dark syntax and
the ascii dr. project make writing
documentation much much easier and it's
already widely used many of the
publishing companies here except ascii
docked for writing books so you want to
publish a book with Manning or O'Reilly
you can write a book
in ascii log and send it so we as
developers is right here a technical
writer by the way now we will developers
and oftentimes I don't know about you
but at least is the case with with me
when I'm tasked with writing
documentation that's pretty much the
last thing that I do we I tend to
procrastinate a lot writing
documentation and it's in half of this
has to be because of the syntax the
format and the other is the tools
because when you bright documentation
it's not exactly like fire up your IDE
and start coding and do methods and
classes right that's that's fun dealing
with code and not so much with box that
we created but anyway writing
documentation is not as easy or fast or
as an enjoyable task as we will do with
the code but let me tell you that a ski
dog feels a lot like programming
documentation will see examples you will
get excited about what you can do right
now that that's what we want you to get
excited about writing documentation
because we know that we don't like to
write documentation we know that it's
important it's like tests we know that
we have to do it but we actually write
tests well doesn't know that's another
that's another topic and yeah the thing
is that when we are tasked with writing
documentation and doesn't happen so
often and it should be and then which
format do we pick do we go with HTML but
too many tags isn't it do we go with
duck book ooh there's a lot of XML do we
go with lotta just kind of weird syntax
Oh what else is out there do we go with
many of the office solutions click click
click click click it and just only a
paragraph done after three hours of
working with this thing that's does this
not really
I already I'll published author and it
took me three years and a half to finish
the book and it wasn't because I didn't
know the content I was at the content
was about one of the frame was an author
off so I knew it very deeply it wasn't
because I was excited about the content
it was because I had to deal with the
particular tool at hand which was one of
the office solutions is just just killed
my productivity and eventually my
publisher said you have to finish this
thing already and I did if I ever get
into writing another book it will
definitely be using one of the tools
that will see today so what are we going
to show you some examples how to use a
skittle with Gradle maven how to use top
ledge and some of the things that idea
provide for us you will be very happy
also we are going to mention how lazy
bones can make your life easier with
some templates but I don't want yeah
perhaps we're trying out some new terms
that you haven't heard before don't
worry everything should be clear once we
finish the talk also if you have any
questions just please feel free to ask
it at any time we also have a slot at
the end of the talks where you have
additional questions but whenever you
feel like asking something just let us
know I will be do our best to to answer
it so the thing that we will begin is
showcasing a simple ASCII doc document
single page and then we will move on to
bigger things and the first thing also
is how we can transform an ask doc
document into particular backing when we
say back and there is the final format
perhaps you have seen all the simple
text formats others
as markdown markdown is very easy to
understand is very simple and some would
say is quite trivial but it only outputs
to a particular banking in this case is
just HTML just found that a ski that can
be used to target different backends not
just HTML or XML file but also epub or
PDF or even docbook so this sample would
see today most of the examples will be
just HTML but it's just a tiny bit of
document or configuration that we need
to do in order to transform that into
different backends there's another thing
I like about oskido is that he provides
conditionals and I haven't seen that in
any other tool so this is a winner for
me yeah we say that writing
documentation in ASCII dog was a lil bit
like programming documentation we will
see that in a moment so let me turn into
here and this looks a little bit like
gibberish at first let me show you the
rendered document and then we can
compare and one next to another what's
going to happen what I have here is
already a Gradle build that is capable
of transforming this document from one
format to the other is anybody here not
familiar with Gradle we know it's a bill
to the runs in the JVM perfect that's
what I wanted to hear let's run the
ASCII dr. task which will transform a
ski duck into HTML by default then we
open that generated file and there is so
what do we see here title so meta
information about the authors a
paragraph with a link a section lists
and some code has syntax highlighting
and as you can see there's also a table
of contents right there that
uh if I click on this thing it should go
right there where the ankle is so far so
good let's look at the code as classical
there we go let's move here and this
move that over there so let's see it so
again we have a title what I would like
to point out also as I told you what I
feel it is the main advantage here is a
conditional but we said we have a title
and I will jump to the first section
because it's really easy to go from the
main title to this sections we have a
list this is the least we have links and
we can configure how to display the
links we have also variables and this is
going to be real interesting when we
change from Gradle to maven yes so we
call these things attributes but you can
think of it as just variables this is
just the definition of that and you can
apply anybody you want and what you see
here on line number five that is a
conditioner there is an if statement if
you will we have the negative personal
def if not def we can also have an if
value is defined and you can define an
expression that gets a belated in Ruby
because one thing is that the ASCII dr.
project is written in Ruby shock we're
talking about Ruby in a Java conference
well we also got jruby as one of the
alternative JVM languages that can be
run inside the JVM this and the second
project called ascii dr j which makes
use of JRuby to wrap around ask a doctor
so now you
be able to call ask you doctor within
the jb m and that's exactly what this
plug-in and the maven plugin do they
just reach into Ruby thanks to Jay Ruby
anyway what this condition is saying is
if these variable whatever name we just
decided to go with Gradle but it could
be anything if this burden has some
value define if it's true if it's not
false then inside these brackets right
here we're going to really find the
value for that variable that we just
already defined it now this is how you
make use of values of previously defined
variables what is happening here is that
what we were constructing this example
we notice that Gradle in esky dr. J have
a predefined set of variables or
attributes whereas Maybin and ask a
doctor has a much smaller set of
attributes so great all is aware of this
one this is highlighted but maven is not
so we're doing with this condition is
making sure that regardless of if using
maven as a build tool or Gradle as a
bill to the following a statement this
variable will use the right be or the
appropriate relative path to a source
main java because this is the production
code we want to include so now it
doesn't matter if you have a maven build
or a great deal or some other kind of
build all your relative paths are going
to be at their at the right place or
think about some parts of the
documentation that only makes sense if
you are rendering one specific output
and it doesn't make sense in another one
so you can define a segment of your
documentation between a conditionals a
typical use case is if you want to
generate a PDF out of a document that
can also be rendering html5 that you
post on the web and you want to collect
some statistics perhaps using google
analytics well you will have to emit
some JavaScript code for the html5
version but those JavaScript
sentences have no meaning for PDF so you
put a conditional there and if the pack
game happens to be html5 inject
JavaScript if it's not then the
javascript is not injected so again you
only need one source of documentation
and you can configure as many things
that you want okay let me show you
quickly before we get into the include
that another section here is we call the
second section and this is a live
example from a Java 12 15 on how to
create a new section we save this go
back and regenerate the file it's ok
we'll just don't do the clean it so we
fasted what did I save it now I didn't
save it save and so used to ide that has
out to save I forget to save in the
other editors ok so now it's there we
refresh and there of course you can
second section but let's look at the
table of contents it already knows that
so we can have an automatic table of
contents and if you happen to add more
subsections for examples just a matter
of adding new or just additional equals
symbols like this is a subsection 1 with
some text
and that's the BB yep and then we add
another subsection like that this is
subsection to save it in bulk the tool
once more refresh there we go the right
indication is that the only way to do it
ah no there are faster ways to do it so
I don't have right now they're the
feedback loop that we have this a bit
slow because you edit save trigger the
tool and then refresh one thing that we
could do in the case of the Gradle
tooling which I'm going to show in just
a moment how we set up the bill is that
I can have one plug-in which is called
the watch plugin oh yes I switched the
version of Gradle Gradle minus T ascii
this will invoke and leave their tool in
the background so what I'm going to do
here is add a new property which I know
is one of the default ones number i can
say true audio simply said number and
notice that Gradle keeps working in the
background and I do a refresh here and I
got the numbers so you have a big screen
you can split this on one side and the
other you got the document the build is
spinning in the background just save hit
refresh boom you're done there's no need
for a very highly specialized editor in
order to make use of the syntax I create
documentation that's another interesting
thing I mean we have many order syntax
out there and many other tools but this
one is so simple that you actually don't
need a tool to write it I think that's a
winner yeah of course they are editors
out there there are web-based editors
they are desktop-based editors that work
with ask a doc and give you
syntax highlighting and maybe a little
bit of drag and drop but they tend to be
simple because what the community wants
to do is give you empower youth so that
you can write a content as fast as
possible with as little steam tax as
needed so it doesn't get in the way and
the tool also should not get in the way
because otherwise you can see that in
the future these tools could grow as big
as the office solutions and we know how
these things turn out to be so the last
item that I want to showcase in the
syntax before we get into how we build
this thing is the section of code that
we see at the end so we got line numbers
and we got syntax highlighting that's
pretty cool but notice that the only
thing that we do in this section is
include make use of some variable and
then point to some file out there this
is the feature that sold me using ASCII
dog for technical documentation because
oftentimes when we write technical
documentation we had to point out to a
snippet of code from production orphan
tests and when a new release comes in
for the for the software well because we
update documentation at the last
possible time some of those snippets get
out there it very quickly but if we are
able to link to the production code or
the test code that we need to showcase
then this updating problem should go
away we are always in from Alice so this
is the code just 14 lines and the code
that we are showing right there are we
including its if I can select that it's
right here 14 lines of code and I can
show that there's nothing magic going
here again
add a new comment life from Java 115 and
then you didn't save no I did say but
because this is production code is not
ask your doc code I believe I need to in
this case manually activate the ask a
doctor task again and come and you're
making me look bad ah because the ID
said ask you dr. task is up to date yes
yes yes that's right again I didn't
change any ASCII doc content so the
Gradle caching of inputs and outputs say
well the esket auto task is done I don't
have to do anything but now there is
alright guess you guys are excited about
great on how to look look at how this
thing is done here is going to make it a
bigger so you can see it better so this
is just like an any other regular Gradle
build where you specify some plugins for
those of you that know a bit more about
Gradle this is the all syntax it doesn't
matter if you use the old synthesis the
new syntax plugins get applied anyway so
we got here the Gradle plug-in latest
version and some additional plugins i
will i'll shoot allows to work with with
the continuous build the important one
is this ask you that we apply the plugin
then we configure the ascii daughter
task we're going to say that we want
this to be of type book and you have
other types their default one is booked
we want to output to HTML but just as
well we could output to PDF i'm gonna
save that and some additional attributes
for example this is the they are like
five or six different types of syntax
highlighters that you can have code rate
happens to be the easiest ones to
configure if we want a table of content
if we want to have icons
and the icons should use the font
awesome web font then just by five home
and remember the Gradle variable that we
were using to figure out what was a
correct entry point for our source code
what it's right here I can change this
to Java one and go back to my ass Cadoc
here and change this to Java one and
that will make their relationship so
this thing is done and now I can look at
the generated output there is PDF and
there's a basic PDF with table contents
the paragraph and more things with just
the default configuration so yes of
course so the question is do I have to
install ailment additional rubygems know
what I need to do is define an
additional classpath element in this
case the ASCII dr. J PDF project gives
me access to this and perhaps the next
question is how do I find out about the
existence of this additional class pot
elements well I hope that the network
will holla dealin tested but if we go to
github ask adapter which is the homepage
of the whole project this is the home
page of the whole ask eductor community
here you can see the main one recently
updated 8 hours ago so we keep it clean
we'll see this in a moment and there is
the main one ask you dr. J and ask a
doctor J has some additional plugins i
will say so in this case you can look at
the source code but if you want to look
at the binaries
then we got to Ben Tre the organization
is called ask adapter to the maven
repository and it has around 11 packages
and so those packages are exactly that
ask you dr. Jay diagram epub the main
one ask you dr. J and finally ask you
dr. Jay PDF so this is how we can find
which jars we can add to our build in
this particular place once this thing is
done PDF is active in the classpath then
we can specify that PDF as an additional
back in as an additional option and the
same configuration that we have for HTML
can also work for PDF or you could
create an additional test that only
deals with PDF and have different
configuration than the html5 yeah okay
yes could we see now for Maybin all
right so for those of you that are also
keen in working with maven we have an
option for you I'm going to do a clean
here just so you know that I'm not
pulling any magic tricks and do a maven
clean also so those are the contents of
our current project there is a palm file
and there is our index document and our
production color so now I think I I
don't use maven that often anymore so
what I'm going to do is generate this
has to be packaged
this will compile the code tested and
generate that documentation then inside
target I get generated docs index.html
and look at that it looks much like what
we had in Gradle the configuration of
course is different is xml-based and
let's make a bigger standard maven the
configuration that we will know and love
our what are these things I should
notice these are the project coordinates
and then we apply the ascii dr. plugin
latest version is 152 we specify the
directory because the Gradle plug-in and
the maven plugin use different
conventions maven follows source main
ask it on and Gradle uses sword dogs ask
you doc but as you can see if you don't
follow the conventions you can still can
configure some of the entries we also
specify html5 at the back end because
maven plugin uses duct book as a default
background then we also specify the
things that we saw in Gradle like the
highlighter the if we want to have a
table of content and the root dear where
I think we try to make this happen with
the root beer but it didn't hold so
that's why we had a conditional so this
property actually we can delete it and
we bind the execution of this plugin to
the generate resources failed so it
should be enough for us to simply say
maven clean compile instead of package
and you can see that the ascii dr.
plugin
where is it having resources maybe
compiler I saw it there is the ASCII dr.
maven plugin is doing its job and just
as easy as that if you go to the
homepage of the maven plugin you can see
a readme with all the different
properties and configuration that you
can apply these are the basics the same
thing is true for the Gradle plug-in
there is a good red meat that explains
all the different and tributes that you
can apply okay yes but yes there's a
question about it we were as we were
hoping that somebody will answer
question the question is if I just need
to embed a specific section or just a
particular piece of code and let me
expand that question and let's say that
it's so deep inside our conditionals of
loop it's so invented so can I mess or
correct indentations so let's say this
is my funky license version 30 I when I
embed code production code I don't want
the license headed to appear so you can
stay our production code starts online
for and will end in line 17 we go back
to our index you notice that I've at the
end of the include macro we had we had
some brackets here we can specify
additional options one of the options
will be lines and we said production
code it starts at line for and ends in
line hmm do I care about the particular
in line we could reformat these things I
could grow and grow and grow so we could
say line 17 yes not a problem or i can
actually if you know a little bit or
ruby minus one
goes all the way to the end or the
particular a ride or the particular
collection so when I think it's line if
it doesn't work it will be lines and we
do the clean and compile again then
refresh oh it didn't work just fine so
it's night safe clean compile we should
probably use Gradle to have the a quick
feedback and well actually says it only
lines for ah yeah use the range notation
from Ruby if you use the comma it says
only that line and the other minus one
doesn't exist so if we use the range
notation then is going to go all the way
up to the end there but if this is not
enough what if we only want to in jail
or just include the main method hmm but
can we do well go here and use standard
comments and this is true for any kind
of source code just used comments and
ask a doctor will understand this
notation you say tag double column some
name for example main method and then
you end the tag with an insane myth name
main method I believe we need this the
big characters then we go back to the
index ask a doc here and instead of
using lines we say tax a methyl let's
give it a try i'm going to use let's
keep it with maven because that's what
the browser is open right now
and there we see oh you notice a problem
with the indentation you solve it to the
right can we push it to the left sure
thing you simply say in then equals zero
generate this thing and there we go and
as well as you can do in to the left you
can push it to the right and you can
even have nested tags and you can you
can use different tags at the same time
so this is precisely there is some why
building technical documentation with a
ski dock for me is the best solution so
even in the in the books when you see
like this nice hints like number two
when you refer to a number two inside
the code that's also trivial to do with
a ski dog that's why writing books with
with this it's really simple yes what it
surely is referring to is what we like
to call call outs so you see a dot with
a number somewhere in the source code
and there an annotation a caption at the
bottom of the listing here's how we can
do it again just using any regular
source code comment maybe JavaScript XML
or anything it's just a source code
comment you put this notation angle
brackets then go back here and make use
of that reference number one and this
would be output hello world we save
regenerate the document
and there we go and these things happen
to be a style ball to CSS so if you want
to see ash a real circle egg in the
other publishers perhaps then you can
tweak it so and you can have as many
reference if you happen to have a
reference that does not exist such as
known I believe that ask a doctor will
issue a warning there is your warning
there is index a dot 933 no coloreds
refer to this item number two so don't
feel if for some reason we missing
something it could also be the case that
we're adding more elements that
shouldn't be there so ask you doc will
tell you so isn't this cool we know now
we can have conditionals in our
documents we can have variables we can
define variables inside the document and
we can also have variables define it
outside the document like we saw here
with the Java one or like we have seen
here in the maven configuration we can
also include any kind of source document
we're doing it with Java you can
annotate you can include any number of
lines you can change the indentation so
this is pretty much what we need just to
get started you can also include images
and change with the number of the
sections have parts have chapters this
is what we need when we're writing books
okay and also another thing I usually
use a lot it's diagrams
we're going to the diagram right now
yeah so we will eventually need diagrams
in technical documentation be it maybe
uml diagrams like or any kind of uml
diagrams for a class diagram or just
free diagrams like boxes and arrows and
colors and text some people use
graphical tools some people use SVG and
I prefer to do my diagrams in ascii yeah
so let me show you another example I'm
going to generate the content first show
you how it looks and then show you how
we can create such content you notice
that now is making use of its
downloading additional gems one of them
is called a ski dr. diagram index so it
looks like this title some sections and
some nice colors right there in this
thing even dotted lines and an arrow
alright this project and this content is
generated using Gradle but let's look at
the ASCII dog sources there's a title
some additional properties right there
the paragraph and then another
interesting blog says data data is the
project that we using for generating
diagrams in ASCII we give it the name
for the image that will eventually be
generated right there and then we use a
simple syntax for creating boxes and
kinetic boxes and changing colors for
example we want this box to be really
really rare we save it
then generate again the document and do
a refresh and that happens to be read
the ASCII dr. D diagram and the the data
support is one of the many options that
we have there is another called shap
shape with double-a that requires you to
have Python install broccoli there is
another one for graph this you might be
familiar with this one you need the dot
program also local install and plant UML
for uml diagrams I believe you also need
some additional software locally
installed in Joe machine to work all
these requirements are a specific
explicitly laid out in the ASCII dr.
diagram homepage which is also available
from the github ask a doctor
organization now we have successfully
written technical documentation with
this this kind of support how do you
make this happen i am using Gradle going
back to your question about the PDF well
here this is yes diagram we add a new
dependency which type of rubygems is the
ascii dr. diagram ruby gem we also
depend on the JRuby plugin because we
need to locate a ruby gem expand it into
a specific directory and they making
sure that is a below in the class but
that's the reason why we ask you dr.
task now depends on the prepared gems
from jruby and we're a site with the
site which gym it needs to use now I
should mention something funny about
this project data data is a java project
which is wrap around in a ruby gem
called a ski dr. diagram which is made
available to Gradle using ASCII dr. J
bij ruby and Gradle uses a groupie
ESL for all these things to configure so
you know now you have groovy calling
into Java JRuby to Ruby back to Java all
the way and and seamlessly it just works
that's the power of the JVM polyglot in
the full glory yes exactly if we wanted
you can configure the same thing with
maven is just as a little bit more of
information xml and yes xml we don't
hate that xml that much but that's a
different thing so that's why we decided
to showcase the Gradle configuration
because it's actually shorter okay let's
go back to where we were so that was the
yeah that was fully the ascii dr. grade
of demo yeah plus the ascii dr. maven
demonstration again with you simply
going to the variables include macro the
conditionals and showing that you can
use the guy diagrams so if creating a
technical documentation with ask a doc
is great what about the documentation
inside the class itself what about Java
doc because japadog targets HTML right
and ask you dr. gates HTML is there a
way that perhaps we could use a ski doc
instead of playing shock it so happens
that there is a way and allow going to
show the confirmation for both cradle
and maybe first thing is let's look at
the Java code again we go to hello world
Java and perhaps you notice this here's
our title and this is how we print this
is mah no space code perhaps we want to
make this bold so we put 2 here and this
example maybe want to make it italic and
and here's a link okay so this is a ski
dr. a ski dog syntax now we go in let's
try the maven first again let's do maven
clean javadoc javadoc this will generate
the Javadoc for the whole project ok
let's go into target site happy dogs
index.html click on hello world and
there is italic not a space Cosmic press
bigger and bold for amazing much much
easier than dealing with the HTML right
not simply even the auto tag has the
right link right there so what about
Gradle we do cradle clean Java rock and
this should generate the Javadoc in the
cradle way and it's just a second there
is now we're going to build docs javadoc
index.html and there is one thing that I
couldn't fail to notice is that the
author link is missing something is
different here and I don't exactly
what's going on it could be that the
dark leg in bulk by cradle is requires
an additional setting and maybe has it
by default in order to add put the auto
tags let's look at the configuration
because this is the important thing
let's first look at maven we just need
to configure the Javadoc plugin so they
has access to a new doclet this is just
a standard configuration for the java
plugin we enable the ascii doclet class
we pull in the artifact the jar that
contains this class and some additional
documentation or configuration for that
the quad doclet but notice what we are
using over here those are properties
coming from maven and this whole
parameter is one big string this is how
the ASCII doclet homepage suggest us to
configure a starlet in the case of
Gradle is going to be much less XML of
course but very similar actually weaken
fee we add a configuration or come like
a scope to pull in the ASCII dalek
dependency and then in the Javadoc
configuration we enable that that jar in
the classpath we specify the main class
as we did with maven and that we set up
additional attributes perhaps this is
where we need to I will need to specify
the author attacks should be honored
which is apparently not enabled by
default in real and it's not really that
that difficult this attribute that you
see here these names you can give any
names you want this will be turned into
attributes that you can make use here
inside anywhere your document so this is
this is great we now can have technical
documentation and javadoc documentation
using the same format there is only one
particular teeny tiny problem there is
currently no IDE support for quicken
javadoc could be you if you happen to
write a Java top comments in ASCII doc
so we just have to just generate the
documentation and they will see it if
that's not a problem then let's go with
that if that happens to be a problem
then the only thing we need to do is
talk to the IDE Bendel's let them know
that we will need this kind of support
just file a ticket the community chips
in and we will make this happen buttress
support already yes definitely you can
see something with IntelliJ IDEA that's
the next one yeah this is we use this
plug-in pretty much every single day and
we know there are other options and and
we're going to showcase IntelliJ IDEA
right now there is a plug-in I believe I
have the first project open already
let's make this I think this is big
enough is the same project let's make
these texts a lil bit bigger so you see
is exactly the same but you notice that
this custom editor has additional
settings is not just a plain text editor
and there are two tabs at the bottom the
text view and the live preview which
gives you an idea of how the document is
going to end up looking the other thing
that we could see here is we can have a
table they are already providing a
macaron for tables okay so how many
numbers of rows do you want five by five
okay so we take five by five and with a
title there is so we can give it some
title here this dynamic table generated
with IntelliJ some head us some columns
and we go back to into the live preview
and there is our table granted it
doesn't look very much look here very
good I guess is the default CSS what if
we generate the file again we say clean
ascii and this will generate the file
again into HTML
build ask you dr. html5 index and
there's habitable and you can have cold
pan roast pan and other elements inside
the table is really quite simple yes
question
for section headers so what you mean is
that if i wanted to collapse this whole
head section sadly not yet not
intelligent but i do know that the
there's a group in red head that has
created a scale of support for eclipse
and they do have an outline which this
plugin doesn't have I don't know if they
have collapsible sections it may be the
case that they do have I don't know
exactly what is the current state of ask
a doctor support in that beans I think
they may have a simple text edit support
another thing we wanted to show you and
it was lazy bones oh yeah so how do you
start a project well if you look at the
palm file looks like pretty much but we
regularly do when we work with maven we
find something in the stack overflow
which search for it we go for it and
then copy and paste same thing goes with
Gradle we find something that works and
then we adapt but maybe has this concept
of archetypes I am not aware if there is
already an ASCII dark archetype for
bootstrapping a documentation project
but I do know that there is this other
project called lazy bones which I'm
going to showcase right here lazy bones
is the goal is exactly the same as maven
bootstrap moving archetypes I mean
bootstrap a project in certain way and
lazy bones works with more elements than
not just maybe also cradle and more lazy
bones is a command line tool once you
have installed how you can install it
download the zip or use SDK man as he
came man has a list of candidates and
all these things are the ones i have
installed through sdk you can see lazy
bones latest version and i'll need to
upgrade right now so now against lacy
I can say lazy bones list this will list
the number of templates that I had
access to there is this one I want to
use ask you doctor grayham now that I
know that I can say lazy bones create
name of the template and give a name for
example j1 as the project let's open the
project and substandard Gradle project
that has some default configuration
already and has a very basic ASCII doc
file hello from Java 113 and now we can
run this project and open the index in
less than a minute a new project already
working question yes
Oh
thank you very much that's a really good
question so so far we have dealings only
with single page documents so the
question is what about multiple page
document so let me show you one will use
case scenario this is coming from the
Griffin framework which is one of the
projects that we have we go into the
documentation and then click here this
as you can see is quite a number of
chapters and entries it would be really
really crazy for maintaining the whole
thing in one file so what we have done
is a split each chapter in its own file
I'm going to showcase that when I open
their good Griffin project which is
right here we look into how the
documentation project is laid out right
then it's a griddle bill and the other
thing that we did is you can see there's
a lot of a scale of documents where is
one important which is the index and the
index can include additional ask you
doctor so this each one of this is a
chapter so let's look at the MVC chapter
has some text on it and finally also
includes additional sections so now you
are able to break down your
documentation in multiple pages and this
can be turned into that and as you can
see there is images additional code
additional syntax highlighting those
colors that were telling you this is
just different CSS so you you can do
pretty much anything you need to do with
CSS and this document yes other question
the question is it possible to use to
the bootstrap yes it is you can pretty
much use any CSS you
the website that was showing you earlier
this Griffin framework because the next
thing is this one you actually uses
Twitter bootstrap the documentation that
you see here everything is written using
ASCII doc everything here including
these tutorials and I'm not kidding
tutorial number one with some icons all
these texts that you see here it's just
another set of ASCII dark content torial
tutorial number one there is this
information and this in page links
happen to be these things here now what
we're using to in order to put
everything together it's not just the a
scalar content and the CSS bootstrap we
need to put to have some kind of a
structure for that we use another
project called jaebaek or java bake
which you can use a standalone or you
can use a great plugin which is the
solution this private uses you just have
to go to jaebaek org and this will tell
you how you can start and configure this
project in this way you can generate a
static websites or static block content
I will totally recommend you to visit
the source file for the Gryphon per year
we have tons of examples of how to
configure different plugins in Gradle
and also you can use the examples and
from the files that they ask a doctor as
on a starting point those you go to
github com search for the Griffin
organization the Griffin project and
inside the docs directory you'll find a
Griffin guide and a Griffin side there
are plenty of tips and tricks to find
here and how to use plain ASCII doctor
in the guide or how to get together a
website with a skillet content in the
Griffin side
okay so here are some of the links that
we saw earlier the ascii doctor
organization and github that contains
links to every single other project that
is related to the st dr. community we
saw today the Gradle plug-in the maven
plugin the IntelliJ plug in and ask
adaalat if you happen to use the ask a
doctor Gradle plug-in and it doesn't
work correctly for you please let me
know I am the author and I should fix
that problem so for that I think we have
just a couple of minutes more so first I
would like to thank you for your time
for being here and we know you have a
choice thank you for choosing this
option if you have any questions or more
questions than we will happy to take
them yes
the latest release a stable one is 152
so the question is what it delays the
status of their Ruby to Java port well
ask you dr. itself is still written in
Ruby and the latest version is stable is
152 we are thinking in releasing 160
sometime before the end of the year they
will still be based on Ruby once this
one is released a new version of ASCII
dr. J will be released that uses 160 and
then the ask you dr. Gradle plug-in and
the male employees will upgrade so you
will be able to use that particular
version what's on a question the back
yes so the question is is there a nice
way to create tables based on CSV format
and besides the ASCII dr. format let me
point you to a skillet org this is the
main documentation site for the project
let's look directly into docs here we
got introduction information and one of
the important links here is the user
manual we click in the manual here we
had the content on the right side you
can compute with that obviously yes and
let's look at tables and here I when I
tennis SCS be so you can say format is
actually CSB and you can put in CSV
directly or you can use the include
macro and point to a CSV file as is as
much better isn't it yes another
question
can we write some kind of patient
processors
yep yes so the question is can I do
something can I pass process or purposes
they link to the files or the ASCII dr.
John 10 yes one last statement that I
want to mention that this thing is like
programming documentation ASCII doctor
actually generates an ASD of your
document which means you have access to
the AST you could do anything you want
like creating new paragraphs or dark or
decorating elements I do have an example
I think it's inside here in the the
ASCII duct or pig latin example and we
will finish with this one this is 9 this
is quite interesting I will do a clean
and then generate and while that is
think is happening Oh SDK use a previous
version of Gradle apparently the latest
version of Grail that I'm using is not
happy with this thing should be fine
with Grail 23 another nice thing about
SDK is that we can switch versions very
easily and you can have one version one
terminal and another version running in
another terminology yes so now that this
thing is generated let's look at the
code here we have a regular English
sentence the quick brown fox jumped over
the lazy dog and we got the pig lighting
equivalent I don't know how I don't know
the rules for pig latin but what I do
know is that i can create my custom
extensions like this one i have the
regular english base text and the only
thing that I need to do now is make sure
that a ski doc is able to understand
this ask you that has an extension
mechanism that can be done with
can use Ruby or any jbm language the
code for this extinction is it's
available on the web and the only thing
that we need to do is make sure that we
have access to that particular ast and
this is written in Ruby because it's
shorter but you can brighten in Java and
everything that we see here is just
finding the right place on when we need
to modify the content and once we do
which is this we apply the rules to
convert some basic text into its pig
latin alternative so in this way you
could do you could analyze what you're
including because you have access to
that ASD yes really interesting so thank
you very much for your time I hope you
have enjoyed the talk and please have a
look at ask a doc give it a try and let
us know what you think about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
