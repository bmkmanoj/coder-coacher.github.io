and I'm accelrys this is Andras Halmi
right so why are we doing this talk
address well mainly because we are crazy
about JVM languages I guess well I guess
it's already a well-known fact that the
JVM is a very very big place and Java is
not the only language that exists in the
JVM you can find the JVM pretty much
everywhere correct me if I'm wrong but
is it it's actually in Mars does it run
in the curiosity Mars robot hell there
you go we sadly we miss the the launch
of the Voyager so we're no longer than
or outside of the solar system but hey
we're nice days right well yeah we're at
Mars so you can find sure about pretty
much everywhere I mean chava DJ Mia but
what about the job of the language well
almost right but there are other JVM
languages out there and the reason why
these other alternative JVM language
exists is because Java language has some
problems it's really gay great we love
Java otherwise we wouldn't be here but
we also like to to dabble in other JVM
languages I guess that probably one of
the biggest things that people complain
about Java language is this verbosity
level now we also know there are some
other modern features that Java is
lacking but we're finally getting
lambdas is anybody get excited about
lambdas yeah well in lovely Ruby had it
we were getting honest after C sharp
we're getting lambdas
but she sure didn't in bed love that I
mean it's a concept way back but it's
still so we have more than 250 languages
in the JVM we would like to share some
of them with you maybe to point the good
things and the cautions of these
languages this is not a trash talk we
won't peek one language would say this
is the world so this is better they all
have different positive things that you
make one to look at them the people that
know us know that we have a very special
language in our hearts called groovy we
are very one we will do our best not to
push moving on you yeah I know you will
simply embrace it by yourselves this
closure we will like you to try groove
it first but that's the first Clause
disclosure after that we are trying to
be objective and impartial and I know
this is the third day of the conference
but they are still other talks are
remaining for the conference there is
talk on cuddling is it through later
today and there's of course this cripple
so if you want to cheer for Scarlett
groupie or close you later in the late
afternoon you can do it so and tomorrow
there's also the emerging languages is
crippled so some of the language Allah
will see today will feature tomorrow so
if you want to know more about those
things I highly recommend you to have a
look at those other two talks well we
are going to talk about several
languages and I want to ask endurance
why or how did we pick this languages
well there are many different ways to
classify these languages that's what we
refer by taxonomy we can go with a
static and dynamic let's let's do a
quick poll who hears likes dynamic
typing okay like I for you who think
hear things static typing is overrated
oh no who thinks oh yeah and the other
question I'm not the only one
static typing it's a must okay it's a
static typing or the highway yeah so you
can differentiate languages in in that
approach to typing but you can also
differentiate them in if they are object
oriented or they're a functional or post
functional or hybrid or logical or some
other kind of thing that is nothing that
what we are used to we can also
differentiate them if they are native to
the JVM so they were born inside the JVM
like bein it was born it was moved by
the JVM you guys for example jruby
simply embrace the JVM and those are the
guys that we refer as hosted those are
languages that existed before or outside
and jb m and they were later
incorporated into the JVM we can also
differentiate them by their maturity
level some languages i will see today
are close to one year old so then our
three or four others like Ruby is even
it's one here even older than job itself
and of course you can bring are you on
taxonomy based on whatever features you
do believe or you think are best for
that particular cell languages in the
category of world stylish languages will
like to point out groovy is colin
closure so scala was i think it began
life back in 2001 so it's really
well-established has had plenty of
releases there are many people outside
making use of the language many
companies important companies working
with it and of course it has a static
typing then we have groovy groovy was
born in 2003 so it's also well
established it has a big and a huge
ecosystem many different projects
ranging from web desktop mobile I
believe it's possible to run skala and
both scalar and groovy on Android
devices and well we see we can get for
get one of these things to Mars or even
further away and don't forget the
community groovy community it's very
open it's quite refreshing comparing to
add another language as show and then we
have clear Roger closure thing is it was
born back in two thousand late 2006-2007
definitely he made the news and if you
can look at the glog of closure we has a
lambda on it that is because closure for
those who you don't know it is at the
real derivative of list is a list
language I I don't know why it's about
Lisbon when I wasn't called we were in
college we were thoughtless I totally
hated that subject I almost failed that
one and the reason why I was able to get
a good grade on that subject is because
I discover java yeah and dated myself
that this is what's back in 95 but I
don't know what it's about less maybe
it's because he lives in enclosure maybe
it's because he lives inside the JVM but
I find closure interesting yes and this
online one min one slight change in the
syntax going from list to closure and
that's it so it's pretty much the same
language I have less I like your
pleasure weird we have the air deported
platfor so these three these languages
work besides list which was born outside
the JVM but it's now come like native we
have these three ones perhaps the most
well-known out there is jruby you can
run Ruby inside the JVM think that
Charles neutered showed few years ago
job one whales without any changes run
inside the jbean we also have tight on
these two land ports actually begin life
back in nineteen ninety nine or to
townsend hope they have a long time
running and the other guy right there
the the red rhino there is not one that
is Oracle's approach for running
JavaScript inside the JVM which is quite
fast
so again JavaScript wasn't born in the
JVM but now you can run JavaScript
inside of it which is definitely much
faster than the Rhino implementation
from Mozilla there are feel that talks
about NASA moon here at jawa so these
languages have a long history and so
they are proven and well well used and
widespread then we have the upstarts
these guys have no more than three years
in the making and they are making big
waves out there in the blogosphere and
they are gaining the fires of developers
first I would like to mention sale on
this is the guy with the logarithm
elephant I guess the they chose the name
salon because it's one of the islands
close to Indonesia where Java is the
approach they have is kind of weird in a
good way because they have baked in
modularity they think that building
applications going forward should be
done with modularity in mind so there's
no way that you can build a trivial
application without having some module
or a specking salon they also like to
that their vision for so long is to
correct and be done with the oversights
or problems that Java has so they're
actually trying to make a better job so
it's a shtetl p-type as a matter of fact
they announced to eat days ago that they
already gone into 10 beta release
they're getting rid bit getting very
very fast and ready for the 1l release
don't call me on this might happen by
the end of the year or maybe early next
year so they're really really close to
getting it shipped we also have cotton
from JetBrains cottman is another
statically typed language which is
heavily influenced by groovy in how the
syntax looks and by skyline and so on
the features that it has it's another
interesting language because they also
did this try to make it up
better job but they are more pragmatic
to to the approach they taking if you
look at a piece of code from cuddling at
first glance it's hard to know if this
is groovy or scallop because it is that
close but then you start to see some of
the features that come in and that that
makes it a lot should not marry and as I
said before there is a cotton talk later
by haddock if I know it's not your caddy
somebody else okay so yeah yeah you can
have more information as specifically to
cutting later and thirdly we have go low
go low is a dynamic language that relies
on jsr 292 so in bak dynamic and so it
requires jdk 7 and this is quite
interesting because it was born out of a
research project but it can actually
have some applications on what an hour
production space is it still in preview
mode they ship previous seven few days
back so just have a look at it I
wouldn't definitely recommend you to put
in production just yet just play with
him but it certainly looks very very
interesting promising yeah and finally
we have the guys that but we don't know
what they were thinking but it's they're
really really cool because they
certainly do things in a much different
way yes Gazoo that actually is not the
logo this is hard to get a proper logo
for goes ooh that's something that it
should probably fix if you look at gosu
it looks a lot like Ruby code but it's a
statically compiled the day closures the
closure of sin taxes is I guess it's a
little bit out there just because he has
a backslash before the arrow and it is
completely interpreted the compiler at
the moment does in do so it doesn't work
like it with the ER languages with aunt
and may
or Gradle that you just compile a bunch
of sources and you do these things
completing for aesthetic purposes and
fully interpreted so it's also
interesting considering there is a
statically typed if there is your cup of
tea then we have a phantom phantom is
interesting because it targets both the
JVM and JavaScript and dad met it's a
language for three different platforms
and it has a static method invocation
and dynamic method invocation if you
want to have a static method invocation
just to object that message but if you
want to do dynamic is object arrow
message is that simple there's no other
things that you have to do so that's
interesting they also have a different
approach to a packaging they call this
thing spots why because they had to run
body in the JVM I mean that night ended
on the platform dotnet has no idea what
jars are they have their own concept so
this guy had to do something else and
finally we have mirror for which there
is a talk later tomorrow by or today by
Charles and they will be at the emerging
languages crippled mirror is basically
Ruby dsl kind of like a DSL for writing
Java biker the best thing about mirror
is that if you already know Ruby and
you're coming back to the JVM welcome
back and you can still write Ruby like
syntax but the output is Java biker so
you can think about Mira as another way
to write Java code without the ugliness
of underboss city of the Java language
itself that's that's interesting ok if
we want to check how this languages are
here in trouble one how how many
sessions have they scheduled for each
language here we have enough death yeah
so when we collect in these numbers
unfortunately we couldn't grab the
numbers for the previous years for all
the languages because i see so happens
let's see in 2012 we had 20 talks on
rubia now we have 23 I know for a fact
that in 2011 there were 17 2010 16
2009-13 yes I said we loved groovy so we
keep testing and Scala has grown also
over time what's interesting that we see
a go soo phantom and go low have no
mentions last year but there's one
mission this talk but in two thousand in
2011 those goes to phantom and I cannot
recall the was an unfair one there was a
third language they had a specific talk
but again we were not able to browse the
resource for 2011 because for some
reason the all the proceedings for that
year are already lost 22 time static
versus dynamic because many people ask
or are really into that concept if
static or dynamic yeah so so when we're
collecting this data I thought where we
thought that the aesthetic languages
will win over the dynamic ones turns out
they are pretty much even so I guess
that this means the the never-ending
Wars of static versus dynamic will
continue so this languages can actually
work in both modes recently groovy added
a static mode so you can compile grube
in this inin static mode and you have
you can have speed very close to Java in
some cases even faster but you loosen
the dynamic capabilities the other way
around scallop has added a dynamic type
I think almost two years ago so you can
have some dynamic capabilities on skala
we who is their finger golos mostly well
definitely functional and as I already
say phantom phantom can work in both
modes as well without any other strange
bridges or things that you have to do so
yeah this is a guess
we don't have a clear winner if we
should go dynamic or static by the way
if you have any questions during the top
just raise your hand will be happy to
answer it as best as we can mm-hmm
particularly in to them functional so
object-oriented functional who here says
we should all do functional programming
interesting just a few years is object
oriented the answer is it procedural no
hands interesting that does this is why
this is called jawan no see one okay so
all most of these languages because they
were born inside the jvm o'porter to the
JVM they support object-oriented
constructs the ones that I put a dash on
it means that they partly support that
that mode so yes it's possible to do
functional programming in groovy but it
is not its main concern so functions or
closures in groovy are not side-effect
free so if you're looking for the
pureness of a really functional language
you're not going to find it there then
language is Haskell and that language in
the jb m is called frag a which you will
see tomorrow at the emerging languages
scrip oh so JRuby is actually that
should be functional mm-hmm tighten
those everything you can you can do
scripting mera is fully object-oriented
though I was yesterday night I was
talking to Charlie and he said it's
possible to use mera in a scripting way
just right now there is not just a
couple lines of code to get set up but
all the stuff will be ready in a guest
in a couple of releases I guess that you
can say javascript is a functional kind
of
language kind of guy depends on who you
ask gaaaah is fully functional and you
can do some object oriented a phantom is
mostly object oriented you can do some
function in the same way as course just
because they support closures but their
main point of view is object oriented
and half of these languages can be used
in in a scripting way they also provide
our rebel so it's very easy to get into
these languages just fire up the repo
and start coding and then you see the
output immediately another important
part is where where do you turn to learn
about these languages we know for a fact
that all the project leaders are looking
for people to contribute to the open
source project and they are eager they
usually donate their time to sit down
with people to help them understand more
the language or the project and for you
to work with them to give something back
to this open source project or languages
so here we list the websites for all
these projects one coolest things that
you see some of them have this the name
of language that slang org I guess
that's kind of like the new train so
we're waiting for the other guys like up
Kotlin to do the to follow suit have
coffee in dutch lang I the only thing
that is that it's different here I will
say is in a sworn which is a project
hosted on the OpenJDK so they are not
pushing it really like a full-blown
separate language like the other guys
but a anyway the documentation is out
there so if you're interested to know
more about each one of these languages
or just have a look at this links also
who is involved or who is in charge in
while in each one of these projects half
of these people are present here agile
yes and they're really happy to talk to
people and meet with them so
i'm i'm pretty sure do miss a student
charged subaru be Martin is the head guy
of skala rich Hickey his authority
creative closure Charlie's is around
here he is not the original author oj
rule he took over once the original team
decided that they will not spend more
time on it the same thing happened with
titan child on bus originated but a
different theme and the last thing that
I knew is that Frank was in charge of
the team I guess that is still true
Andrey is the guy that is going to live
to give the talk on cutting later this
day gabon is not here but I have seen a
manual bear heart and there's another
guy from red card also talking about
sale on Charlie's also hot so happens
that hey because Mira is Ruby for the
JVM so Charlie's involved Dean Laskey is
kind of like the timlin for national
Julian pump you guys remember this
application for packaging jars called
easy pack no you know what I'm talking
about well this this is the same guy
that is in charge now of go low so he
went out from creating a swing
application for installers to language
development and language research quite
a jump so why some of the reasons why we
think it's a good idea to play around
with these languages and spend some time
learning them well because sometimes
working with Java all day long maybe
told me and some of these languages
return or give back the joy of coding
sometimes it eliminates the verbosity in
your code makes you focus more on what
you're trying to do instead of all the
boilerplate they may provide you with an
easy way of doing things not only more
expressive net but they work with all
the boring part
so the purpose of these languages is to
do things different maybe better or for
us is encounter again our creativity
during our work but because when you
lose that passion and you only work it's
I think it's awful so this here is your
opportunity to return to that joy of
coding does not fit just not just feed
your inner geek but feel also your inner
child yeah creativity should be first so
when we were preparing for this talk we
set up an online forum asking people for
the feedback on which languages they
like and which languages they use in the
daily work which languages they would
like to try out so that's the short URL
in case that we will encourage you guys
to give yourself your feedback because
we will continue to gather this
information and I have a much better
understanding of how people embrace the
polyglot JVM at the beginning I put some
slides really quickly they were the
quotes of the many people that answer
the poll and now we have to go to the so
these are some of the answers that these
people have sent us so one of the
reasons they prefer to use prove it is
because of the native collision syntax
that the language provides I believe
that for JT canine it's they're thinking
in the roadmap to add this feature but
hey what is dedicated coming yeah and
after that too at least two more years
to get dedicate on right so you have it
right now with groovy and that's what
people like about it we also have they
say metaprogramming both compile time
and run
time I had to come to confess that the
reason why I enjoy groovy a lot is
because of his meta programming
capabilities yes that's that's how I was
as well as I gravitated toward the other
language I guess also a dynamic typing
is just the icing in the cake for me I
spend so much time with javascript and
PHP and perl you can see the mental
scars there but those are dynamic
languages and and i like that very much
but i also like the power of the JVM so
groovy in a census is bringing me back
and provides me with both things what we
have brochures we have had closure since
2005 no no surprises there almost 10
years where it's great for building
dsl's and it has probably the best
interoperability with java when you when
you load Ruby code from Java Java is
none the wiser it doesn't know if it's
groovy code you just call it as if we're
and their regular Java class and the
same is true from Java classes seen from
groovy you just consume them so the
there is no need for a special bridge to
call these things one another they like
best friends actually we sometimes we
called Ruby Jabba's dynamics best body
everything that Java cannot do because
he's afraid of where we can its color
what do people like about Scala is that
it has a complete and powerful static
type system is very rich you can create
your own types you can go crazy creating
types you can get lost in the woods
creating types but if if you actually
can create these steps and rationalize
your solution based on types and if the
compiler save those things then your
code and your program will work it has
txting type inference capabilities we
will have some of those capabilities
aight thanks to to the lambda stuff that
they're doing but in skala that is much
better they also have a pattern-matching
function feature which is not unique to
scallop but it lends itself pretty well
for doing functional side programming
and dealing with immutability they have
merged the functional style with
object-oriented so you can go both ways
as sometimes the creator of a scholar
martin referred to scala as a functional
language because of this be straight i
also we didn't mention but they are
traits in scala and the it has a
favoritism for going into immutability
dealing with it with just values and and
not mute so that the mutable state
doesn't get in the way all right
pleasure again less it has all the joys
of lists and all the drawbacks of lists
whichever they are let's stay with the
choice of place yeah so it has immutable
variables and values the ID the concept
behind the how close your list deals
with these things the way that that
which he Key has rationalized this thing
is that what you do what you have our
values over time so right now at this
moment in time you have a variable whose
value is 1 and the next time that you
change this thing you are signed to
write but is your somehow be able to go
back in time and look at that variable
at this point which body should we have
in plain Java this viral should have to
because we have we assign that value
directly to worry me is this a
distracted assignment but in case of
closure is you look at the value at that
process time it will be again one so
that's the point because once you assign
this thing is is set on stun it's in
irbil so you can go back and forth it
has because of this because it's
functional and because it has a very
good approach to immutability it has
built-in capabilities for parallelism I
has persistent data structures that the
limitation is quite interesting they are
very efficient in size the concurrency
aware building blocks are really really
good so reflecting on on things like
summer transaction memory and actors and
agents I guess is much easier to come by
in this language the the syntax is
concise is very very short as a matter
fact the whole list syntax feels one
slide whereas the other languages we
will take more than one more than one
there's more than one let's say and Jay
Ruby excellent meta programming
capabilities because hayes.ruby you have
the concept of open classes some of the
meta programming capabilities that
groovy enjoys we're influenced by Ruby
itself and i love the third answered
more than one said because it's Ruby
yeah why would you go with JRuby is
because it's Ruby okay the people that
know Ruby they enjoy Ruby they bask in
its glory so if they are able to use
Ruby inside the jbean much better as a
matter of factors out the gear Ruby is
the fastest implementation of rutile
ever a standard Ruby see Ruby is a
slower and this really grinds their
gears the Ruby community doesn't like
your movie why not because it's faster
it's because it's is tainted with Java
but nevertheless JRuby fans love it yeah
so the killer apps that we can mention
on these languages again remember that
some of these are well established so
they have had a long time to come up
with solutions for everyday problems
some others are just getting started I
guess for groovy well you can say group
itself for scripting capabilities is
good enough but out of the box we can
think of two things rels which is a web
desktop application platform sorry
ideals I said that's the best I don't
think there's a web application platform
thinking of something else
and and that there's missing something
yeah yeah he's spread brilliant oh well
no yeah great fun yeah but there's also
greater the bill to if if you okay let's
see some hands who here loves aunt okay
that's great and he really really enjoys
working with maven enjoy just you have
to know you have really enjoyed working
with maven okay any takers for Gradle a
few let me tell you let me tell you that
working with Gradle is refreshing
because you have all the power as and
where you could define anything you want
to but you have the conventions for
maven and many people are embracing
griddle just because that because you
have the best of both worlds in skala we
have a cap which is a library for
dealing with concurrency so plenty of
goodwill things there i think it's now
baked right into scala used to be from
the outside and else inside there is
also play that could say probably the
whole typeset stack it's a good thing as
a killer app for closure we had the
atomic which is a pretty much a database
but it's completely built enclosure it
reasons about your data following that
in sorry immutability aspects for jruby
well those rails and that's it giant on
he's been me rails what else for jadyn i
guessed it is this be so it's so easy to
ambit python code in the JVM because of
joy on so there's not a single killer
app that i can mention just beside a
scripting capability yes it's there
general right okay there you go j MRI
for cutting right now said is dsl's
capabilities again it's still in the
almost finished stages they can only use
side yeah it's heavily used inside J
brains they have a web framework also
and they will be having a release pretty
soon and so they're currently my system
six nobody second six plus something and
they have another release person ceylon
we'll see we're still waiting what these
guys are going to do mira i'm also very
interesting what these guys are going to
do nash phone that actually does have
that's the one named there's no longer
is called not gr so what these guys
wanted to do is create a JVM version of
not GS so get away with ugly transcript
do it in a jvm so that was not you are
and they have renamed this thing to
avatar dodges and so if you guys saw the
technical keynote back on Sunday they
say oh yeah from character is finally
open source and you can go to this link
and then i saw that and still didn't
understand what's going on with project
avatar at least i know that one of these
components is this guy no implementation
for the JVM and goal of phantom and goes
through there are still also in the
early stages so there there's no no
killer app that we can point you at did
I say JavaScript yes I have I said that
phantom can compile and run scored in
JavaScript turns out is not the only
language that can do this you can run
close your code in your browser by a
closure script you can run Salem code in
your browser just like that because
Salem can compile to JavaScript coding
also compasso JavaScript there have been
three attempts for getting Scylla to
compile to JavaScript I guess that the
third one is the slightly better than
the other ones but Scala is really great
for the JVM so I don't believe they're
actually pursuing getting full full
steam into JavaScript the same thing can
be said about groovy so there is a
project called air grew squid which
provides a way for you to bright blue
beaker that gets translated or transpile
into JavaScript but it is not like the
groovy committees
really pushing for this thing the other
guys are really really serious about
running their languages inside
JavaScript yes that is cuddling culture
and the tipa is because cuddling that's
Russian for 40 pod yes and what sorry
yeah I'm job as well of course of course
java okay so next so how to get started
with this ones we usually in groovy we
recommend you two ways besides the
killer apps of course first go with the
spirit and capabilities say that you
need to handle some files or connect to
a database or do some network or deal
with XML if you're tired of fumbling
around with XML map is in Java because I
don't know for some strange reason we as
developers every time that we need to
externalise some resource what is the
format that will reach out for the worst
possible format ever xml it has these
pointy things you know what else has
pointy things roses roses have thorns
have you ever tried to grab a rose right
and did you get hard yeah same thing
with XML but processing XML with groovy
is really simple testing the test I
cannot say a stress enough how great are
the testing capabilities of a spark a
spark is pretty much like a test in dsl
you are to yourself to to have a look at
this it is used not just to test Ruby
based projects but also java based
projects also et bien sÃ»r this before
became a given development yeah yeah
again so testing in the case of build
tools well there's great there's there's
nothing else there's also gained which
is a groovy version of n again no xml
just ruby because who in his sane mind
would try to do some kind of
iterative or real programming with XML
you remember and country right dunt in
skala i will say dsl's i probably need
the best approach to get started if you
also embrace the functional style of
programming so easy to get started with
the scholar if you think of it as a
better java so no semicolons utter
syntax reduce verbosity get into it and
also you should get a try to scan test
lesbi t because the name is misleading
SVT stands for simple build tool and i
believe is not such a thing well you can
also try a city the great thing about
SVT that Gradle doesn't have yet is that
it has an incremental compiler the Scala
compiler is a slow because it's doing a
lot of things for you but both s BTW has
this mode of having a comparing in a
warm state so whenever you change some
code it will compile it immediately so
if you have a much faster response is
now they have some feature see SVT is
losing its crown we don't just go where
you go now they have competition and
competition is good yes may that's
better okay pleasure well there's the
ripple it's just as easy as that just
remember this math track immutability
good mutable state bad oh don't go into
that ha and also there are no parents
don't worry about the parentheses there
are not there oh yeah now the dragons
not everything extinct so these guys
have saw some jealous problems but they
have also brought in some of their own
problems sure the first thing that the
that we saw in the survey is equality in
groovy in groovy hat we have operator
overloading which means that the equals
operator in groovy actually impose the
equals method because most of the times
whenever we have a string in Java and we
wanted to compare to something else what
do we do we use the equal to operator
and then what happens next we fail but
this is what we want to do with most
most of the times right and the same
thing happens in Scotland you can use
the operator itself but under the covers
there will be a method called that does
the right thing but because we have used
the equal seekers operator for comparing
these objects we have displaced identity
compression so this sometimes will get
in the way asing transformations we had
yesterday about honesty transformations
they are basically compile-time
metaprogramming how you can tell the
compiler to generate more boilerplate
code based on some conventions that you
can specify yourself depending on which
transformations you may use some of them
will step into each other to there are
too many ways to achieve the same goal
in meta programming if I were to list
all the different ways that we can do
metaprogramming I will be reading to you
chapter 13 or group in action second
edition which is really good by the way
it's almost there closures are not
side-effect free so again this is not
Haskell you have to be aware of that and
you had to fight all habits basically
use your pinkie to type in semicolon
laughs yeah I used to have this finger
was very string while writing Java
whatever I groovy is like oh this guy is
very lightweight now yeah well so you
can't have more than you can write
groovy in a job I ish way but if you
start writing it in an idiomatic way
it's good it gets better also in the
case of SD transformation beware of this
thing I'm not joking look at this mirror
hardly I think once you get the taste of
st transformations you acquire that test
and you cannot stop there is a good
thing beware still in skala people said
that they don't like that much implicit
well they like implicit is just that
employees had a way for a compiler to
enrich a type to go from one type to
dollar and adding more capabilities so
it's a it's kind of like a meta
programming way but in a static type
save mode but because you don't know
exactly which implicit is going to be
applied you might get in trouble so it's
great but don't over use it functional
programming requires a paradigm shift so
you're used to thinking in objects and
then say oh let's do this all do
functional oh you hit the brakes
immediately so be aware of that writing
your own operators i call this ascii art
because they're there are the only a few
rules that you must follow in order to
create your operators but nothing stops
you for writing an operator that looks
like a dead fish skeleton lots of shifts
and then a couple of equals and then the
last arrow yes you can do this thing why
not be careful with that and the
compiler could be faster the the type
save team is aware of this and then of
course the i guess they're trying to fix
it some time but just don't get mad if
your computer starts to to spin a lot
the cpu and then your your room is
getting hotter well the skeleton pass is
you compare it to the other ones it is
but remember this is what people have
told us it's not exactly what we say no
say in anything fragile and tell you we
have macros yet there were some how they
can follow that
beware of macros you have to be aware of
the things enclosure a lacy so you don't
get the value in me Utley again it's a
paradigm shift if you design with the
immutability in mind is much better so
you have to get into that mindset and
the tool in support could be improved
these guys are happy using the wrong
tool MX where they should be using BIM
the clip superc could be better and the
same goes for the other IDs yes love see
I go bin for JRuby the integration with
Java it's not seamless like in groovy if
you want to call a Java class phone from
JRuby you have to import these things in
the Ruby way if you want to call jruby
or Ruby from Java and that's a nice and
of course you have to learn Ruby proper
to make the best out of this thing so
this don't think so much in Java tears
but start thinking in Ruby terms we also
ask them if you were to pick a different
language which one will it be services
forty percent of the end I said I'm
going to stick with my current choice
they are loyal to the language twenty
percent of said said are probably going
with closure and this is regardless if
they were in the static camp or in the
dynamic camp for some reason they
believe closure is the answer temper
single day and said I'm going to go with
scallop and the rest peak languages that
have nothing to do with JDM I was
definitely not aware of rust or elixir
yes this is important because three
years ago we were talking about polyglot
in the JVM and people said new Java is
the only way to go we don't want to
learn another language the learning
curve it's too steep for another
language we don't want now
now three years after that people are
thinking about yes I would like to try
another language I would like to find
something else in the same platform so
it's for an see it was a good surprise
yeah we no longer have to when we talk
to people our public jvm this is a much
easier combat boot conversation started
instead of hey happy are you aware that
you run the different jbm language in
this thing is more like have you tried
this other jbean language yet so the
things have changed yes we would like to
thank the people have the racially said
you can publicize our name so these are
the twitter handles of some of the
people that have respond the they
deserve it and again that's the link to
the survey if you want to help us thank
you very much and so that's everything
that we have for the moment but if you
have any questions would be happy to
answer them yes over there yes sure ah
no no this is are the people that said
you can publish our names otherwise it's
you can choose to do it I known as
mostly so on which know
with
good more playing
directly involving
various language but they run blind
studies and test routes there are 200
find out what things
so you
I'm glad that now the essentials are
being recorded so that we can go back
and of course we can go back to this one
and say oh do you I really say that yeah
but thank you very much for the tip any
more questions No well so again please
remember in the emerging languages the
script ball tomorrow the script ball
later today cuddling and I guess that is
also a mirror talk later in the in the
conference so thank you very much for
your time and really highly recommend
you guys to at least have a look to any
of these languages you won't be
disappointed any of this will do if a
whether your static or dynamic or of
course you can also use the small talk
on the JVM or that was a talk already by
that gentleman at the back sadly we we
are pulling it after the fact but hey
you want to run the small talk on the
JVM why not so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
