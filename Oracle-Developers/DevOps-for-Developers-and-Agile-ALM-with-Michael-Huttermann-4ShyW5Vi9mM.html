Oracle code Berlin everyone's having a
lot of fun hopefully good great food he
said it definitely looks good and I'm
your host Javed Mohammad and I have with
me the final and the best session of the
day with Michael head Roman he's a hard
man to get a hold of what Michael famous
I thank you so much
so Michael is from JJ frog we've had
some of his peers actually on previous
sessions namely Baruch yeah and so you
had a session today about DevOps for
adults you guys come up with the most
interesting titles as a link Baruch so
the DevOps the Greek tragedy yeah so how
on earth did you come up with the thing
of DevOps by adults is there is there a
DevOps or kids also or like what's the
story I think that's really a story but
you know one night another shower I had
the idea to name it that way and you
know you have to be you have to find
some appealing names for those and today
I had two sessions write more a general
divorce one that was the starter the
DevOps starter kit actually at the
second one was more technical adult
session all right so what what kind of
here that you saw in terms of your
general overview session what was that
about
actually the set of brain the 21 so it's
about discussing it has a shades of gray
yeah 20 shades of gray okay now 50 yeah
I learnt it okay okay okay 20 not 50
okay to not almost ever in this is okay
head you know we have 45 minutes to
present and discuss that 50 once it's
okay tougher okay so yeah we just got to
give us the scoop so what can you give
us a few few pieces shades yeah of
course
so one is for example to use graduates
but I assume these are best for best
practices respect justice processors
actually to to focus on shared goals
between different functions including
development and operations above you
know improving the cycle time this puts
two it's using good tools particularly
that was also discussed so for example
great tools provided by 84 ok so we've
got this the DevOps process of
continuous build continuous integration
you know those tests deploy kind of walk
us through like so what are some of the
tools that you kind of talk about i or
exhibit in in this that the devops
pipeline okay i think that's a very good
question
actually it's a mash-up of different
tools mostly lightweight edge i tools so
above all the one of the major backbones
nowadays is for example each factory as
a backbone of the binary manager to to
manage to to proxy incoming and
outcoming binaries but also
orchestrating other tools in this
overall ecosystem jenkins for example
it's very important for the for the bill
for the bill to trigger the delivery
pipeline but also for example so no cube
for compute inspection to detect any
flaws and bugs in the source code but
also later on in the pipeline to to
examine the binary this x-ray is also
pretty common knowledge ease okay and
then were like chef and puppet for the
configuration and absolutely deployment
absolutely very good yeah absolutely
important aspect that's also very widely
spread nowadays to provision tracked
environments with Endemol chef or puppet
and also using the universal binary
positive major such as a factory to host
you that is it that is the jake jake our
product what is what is a frog make oj
focus
company providing first-class food above
all a factory for example bench way
x-ray and nowadays you can really manage
all different edge effect types this
Jeff for Katy factory including a puppet
manifest for example docker images
classic Java edge effect times and
anymore ok and I totally different know
which city are you from you mentioned it
but I didn't quite catch it I saw it
from cologne Cologne in Germany how far
is that from Berlin actually it's about
one hour by plane ok far away uh-huh
so the distances are not so anomalous to
us I think
uh-huh so those of us from the US who
are not too familiar with geography and
everything what what is there like a
much of a cultural difference between
Cologne and Berlin what what obviously
Berlin has a lot of history behind it
but what about what goes on in Cologne I
think they have different gear types
have different beer type ok not just
like ok I think there are some slight
differences maybe I will find it all
tonight why don't we either find it all
tonight you will find out tonight ok so
stay tuned we'll ever we'll be back with
my confession I shave that warm water on
another article code or we'll put it
into the intent to the description at
the absolute the other all right then ok
then so you're going to be going onto it
any is the Jeff are gonna be at any of
the article called event so yeah maybe
the Germany subsidiary of self occlude
with some activities today ok all right
so let's see what happens I see a lot of
people going out here and having fun so
let's see what happens maybe us also
time for for joining me for coffee you
