have seen some really cool things and
hopefully we can keep that going
my name is Uday Tati Raju I'm a
principal software engineer at Oracle a
full-stack engineer my day job entails a
lot of Java programming and the
occasional JavaScript I dabble in mobile
programming a sort of jack-of-all-trades
a generalist if you will let's get
started and get the safe harbor
statement out of the way we want to
radically state that the opinions
expressed in this talk my own not that
of Argos and you know the rest on to the
fun stuff let's look at the agenda I'm
going to start with a demo of the
finished product so what we did was
build an internal tool it's a pre commit
tool using verdicts the J PMS and since
this is a distributed system we also
wanted to track it and that's why we
used open tracing so I'm going to talk a
bit about vertex J PMS open tracing and
how all of those come together and so
let's start with the demo like I just
said it's an internal build tool it's a
pre commit validation tool sort of
similar to Jenkins or Hudson but we had
our own reasons to build this tool it's
darker native so it only runs on docker
and I've said let's take a look at the
demo
all right so this is the UI for this
tool
a typical build tool experience you
provide connection details to a
repository like it or github or perforce
whatever you define your build plan the
pipeline so it can download the source
code and build and test things like that
but this is a pre commit validation tool
not post CI or a CI tool what I'm going
to do is create a really complex
pipeline just kidding
I'm going to say hello work alright
let's give it a name and I can connect
to a repository but I'll keep this
simple this thing that you see at the
bottom that's the pipeline code you can
actually store that in a version control
if you want I'm gonna save it and then
I'm going to run a pipeline let's go to
the dashboard take a look at the
by plying thing it's done zoom in sure
alright so like I said it's just a hello
world pipeline it's just printing
echoing hello world but that's not what
this demo is about or this talk is about
so just wanted to simply show you how
the UI looks and we can then talk about
the backhand stack and the technology
stack and going to the details thing
that's pretty much all I have for the UI
demo one side note is that I used Oracle
Java extension tool kit it comes with a
lot of pre build UI components that you
can use so it was really fast for us to
use it to build this responsive UI just
a side note all right back to our
presentation so now that you have seen
the UI now what I showed you was I
created a pipeline and started a
pipeline right and the UI sent a message
to the backend which is the application
layer and it is built on top of verdicts
think of verdicts as something similar
to spring if you're familiar with spring
I'm sure you are and then we also made
use of the new J PMS that was introduced
in JDK 9 and we had some challenges
using J PMS because it's a new thing and
there are a lot of open source libraries
which don't yet support modular jars so
we're not going to talk about J PMS and
since this is a distributed system we
have new challenges in terms of
observability monitoring things like
that so it also does a little bit about
open tracing
let's start with verdicts so I threw in
a bunch of words so I'll unpack those
responsiveness we all know what
responsiveness is it's the ability for
the system to be able to respond in a
timely fashion to incoming requests
right and so if you build your
application on top of verdicts and
follow certain patterns you're
guaranteed to provide a responsive
system resiliency means that even in the
face of failures your system is still
able to respond and be responsive so
verdicts allows you to do that because
of the way you design your system you
compartmentalize various aspects and
distribute them so one failure doesn't
bring your system down elasticity could
be horizontal scaling it could be
vertical scaling but vertex allows you
to take advantage of the course on a
given system based on a reactive pattern
I'll talk about it in a bit and then it
implies a message driven methodology
sort of the reactive manifesto really
and so using verdicts you can take
advantage of these principles while you
build your distributed systems another
cool thing about verdicts is that it's
polyglot so we all know that JVM
supports not only Java but probably
JavaScript Kotlin the new kid on the
block groovy and a bunch of other
languages and so verdicts continues to
support these languages and the cool
thing is that it provides idiomatic API
so it doesn't feel unnatural for you to
try to use verdicts in JavaScript for
example and so you can mix and match
languages based on your team's skill set
or the task at hand let's say for
instance you want to concentrate on the
business logic and you also want to
experiment with Kotlin to reduce the
verbosity of your code by all means to
go ahead and use it or you can use
javascript in fact build mate uses Java
and JavaScript
when I say JavaScript I'm talking about
the server-side JavaScript the using the
Nashorn in
and so yeah vertex is Pollock that it
provides a lot of flexibility and where
it exists modular when I say modular I'm
talking about the general modularization
of code the core libraries pretty
lightweight doesn't mean it's not
powerful enough in fact it's the
opposite provides a lot of modules that
you can pick and choose based on your
requirements let's say you want to use
authentication and authorization you can
use that by picking a out-of-the-box
module with the core module you can
connect the databases Oracle database
MongoDB what-have-you and it supports in
a synchronous way of communicating with
databases everything about vertex is a
synchronous in nature and so it's a
fundamental paradigm shift in terms of
havi code and there it also brings some
challenges because when you talk about
JavaScript on the client side you we are
all kind of familiar with the callback
hell
and so vertex kind of introduces but at
the same time it provides a solution to
deal with it so it doesn't look too
complicated when you look at a piece of
code word X provides ways to connect to
other eventing and distributed messages
for clustering it uses a plug-and-play
approach you can use zookeeper you can
use hazel Cass you can use ignite or you
can roll your own one you can create
REST API you can use the open API 3
specification give it to vertex and
vertex will generate the REST API along
with the validation or you can code your
staps on your own so a lot of
flexibility that was my point anyway so
the central aspect of what makes vertex
awesome and responsive is this thing
called vertical it's loosely based on
the actor model where actors classes
communicate over each other with each
other using messages and these actors in
the vertex world are called verticals
and so one or more verticals will
actually make your makeup your micro
service you can deploy them in vertex
there's no concept of a application
server like Tomcat jetty I mean you can
use it but you don't have to so it's
very lightweight probably makes much
sense if you use it in the darker world
or kubernetes world it makes much more
sense to go with the framework like
vertex and there is a central even bus
that's how messages are passed across
these various services and vertex
manages the event bus so you don't call
vertex vertex calls your services based
on the incoming messages even loop is
also not a new concept
I mean if you take the browser for
instance the engine listens to various
events like a click event or let's say
mouse drag event right and based on the
event and the registered handlers it
calls those handlers right similar
concept here a vertical is essentially
providing certain handlers and it's
asking the vertex which is the engine
and whenever a message arrives at a
specific arbitrary address the message
is passed on to a particular service one
thing though about a single event loop
is that it's attached to a single thread
the affinity is to a single thread and
so you can't really take advantage of
multiple cores and verdict solves this
using what it calls a multi reactor
pattern essentially creating multiple
event loops based on the number of
course you can configure it and so
within a single system you can scale
across the available course enough talk
let's look at some code snippets here I
have two code snippets on the left hand
side is the Java code on the right hand
side is JavaScript code kind of looks
messy I thought I figured that out but
apologize for the messiness so if you
look at the right side code the
javascript word code
what we are doing here is creating a
hello world server it's listening on
port 9000 and it's essentially sending
out hello world from JavaScript to every
request that comes in it's as simple as
that and on the left hand side a similar
hello world server for Java same thing
listening on port 9000 you create HTTP
server you register a handler since this
is a simple example we're not really
making use of verticals as much as we
want to and so same thing respond to
incoming requests with hello world let's
take a look at a more complex vertical
example and like I said vertical is
nothing but a class which acts like an
actor in the actor model so it registers
to a message and it waits for messages
to come in and then it does some
computation stored in the database or do
whatever right so you can extend the
abstract vertical class that vertex
provides or you can implement the vertex
interface or the vertical interface and
these verticals are then deployed by the
vertex engine and vertex makes heavy use
of futures like I said it's a
synchronous so there's a change in the
way we program you have to make heavy
use of lambdas if you are using Java of
course and so what's happening here is
that we are going to get hold of the
event bus that's provided by vertex and
then we are going to say hey vertex
whenever there is a message on this
specific address which is a made-up
address it says for workspace colon set
up send me that message and I will
handle with it and so I have some
comments there you do some work and then
you can fire and a message so that's
what's happening here so you register
for a message incoming messages are sent
by vertex to your vertical which can be
this could be a microservice and so on
and be deployed but that would be an
overkill obviously but a bunch of
verticals together in a single JVM
instance can then make up your service
and so when you distribute it you are
dealing with the reactive manifesto in
terms of being responsive resilient and
all that stuff so that's a quick
overview of word X and if you recall in
the technology stack I said we built
will mate on top of word X and we
leveraged JPM s J PMS is the new
platform modularization system
introduced in JDK 9 actually it was
scheduled to be released in I believe
Java 8 but that didn't happen because of
lambdas and streams and because of the
complexity that was involved in actually
creating a generalized modularized
system right so finally in September
2000 we got the JPA miss its codename
was jigsaw I found where I'm really
excited about this granted we do have
OSGi which deals with hiding your
packages and other things but we never
had native support from the platform
itself and finally in JDK 9 JP MS
through JP MMS we have that so what is a
module in generic terms I mean we use
modularization everywhere throughout the
hardware and the software stack but
specific to the jdk a module is
essentially a jar which has some extra
decorations to it to specify or publish
its public contract meaning its API
source classes that the consumers can
use and also we have to provide or
specify the dependencies that the module
that you're building has on original
third party or the language I'm sorry
platform modules
other cool thing about JDK 9 release is
that the platform itself was modularized
so this opens a whole new bunch of
possibilities in terms of creating
custom runtime in images now if you are
using JDK 8 or previous releases we all
know that the GRE is one big thing
granted there are a couple of profiles
that you can use to reduce the size of
your runtime engine but you can really
squish it down any further but with the
modularization of the platform itself
now you can say I just want to use X Y &amp;amp;
Z modules and then you have a very
compressed small module and in this
container well that makes a lot of sense
so that is possible because the platform
itself has been modularized and all
modules have to rely on the base module
in fact this is an implicit requirement
so even if you don't specify it as a
dependency when you're building modules
it still works and all of this is
possible with the introduction of a new
construct called module info dot Java
right like I said you specify or as a
developer you specify the public
contracts the services or the classes
that you are providing and you can also
specify the dependencies actually let's
dig deeper so a new keyword has been
introduced called module and followed by
in my example I have used the reverse
domain naming convention that we used to
describe packages you can employ a
different strategy a new keyword called
exports has been introduced that is how
you tell the consumers of your module
that these are the packages these are
the classes that you are exposing for
consumption by third party and you are
hiding the implementation details
another key word is the requires word
that's how you specify the dependencies
that you have in order for your module
to work right in this case
specifying that the domaine module
depends on java base and it also depends
on the Apache Commons library and so for
the module info dot java to work
obviously we need some additional
enhancements to the existing tools new
command-line options have been
introduced like jailing previously I was
talking about creating custom runtime
images and so JDK provides us with a
command that allows you to build the
custom runtime image using j-link and
the java sea and other command options
have been enhanced let me quickly walk
you through the options or some
noteworthy options for Java C command
module part has been introduced this is
where you specify the dependent modules
when you are building a module
so let's say I'm building a domain
module and I realize rely on the Apache
comments module and it's sitting
somewhere within your file system you
have to use the module path to specify
the filesystem obviously we're not going
to hand code the java c commands we're
going to use maven or cradle or
something else and similar options have
been introduced in the ER common
sometimes you might want to know the
module name you can use the describe
module option too and it will print out
the details of module for deploying for
runtime the Java command has been
enhanced similar options have been
introduced the module paths to specify
where your modules live this modules
will tell you the list of modules that
your runtime application needs and the
most important thing is the dash dash
module option where you actually specify
the module and the main pass within that
module that's going to kickstart your
system I talked about modules and it's
all fine if you are creating new modules
but that's not the case obviously we
have to rely on open source or
proprietary modules
there are millions of them so how do we
go about using those modules while still
moving forward with the jpm.n well we
have this concept called automatic
modules there are two ways to did use
the automatic module one way is to use
the automatic module name entry in the
manifest file every jar has a manifest
RMF file right so you can append this
entry within your jar and then the JDK
knows how to use this module and this is
called an odd modular jar but you can
still make use of it using the automatic
module name approach let's take an a
look at an example here so I'm going to
pick the Apache common slang library
again so the name of the jar is Commons
- Langtree - the version named jar but
the good folks at Apache decided upon a
module name and even though the jar
itself has not been modularized we still
get to use it using a new name called
arc that Apache dot common start Langley
right even though the jar name is
different we can use this because the
manifest entry contains the actual
module name and so they have time - now
to modularize their jar but in the
meantime you can move ahead and use the
Commons library but that's not always
the case some library authors don't have
enough time or they are not really
bothered about J PMS I'm not saying that
in a bad way
so there is another way to deal with it
Java provides way a simple algorithm to
deduce the automatic module name and
that's to use the name of the jar itself
and remove the extension so you drop the
dot jar and then if there is a version
it will drop that as well and the
remaining hyphens would be converted
into dots but in this case there is
nothing else so the deduce name becomes
P for Java and
in the right hand side there specify how
to use that so it requires P for Java
that's it and IntelliJ and eclipse and
other IDs to have support for J PMS now
so it will actually let you know how to
use a non modular jar
which is very cool alright now that we
have seen the J PMS how to define the
module info class and the command-line
options let's take a look at how bill
matrons this is the command the runtime
command you're specifying the module
path so the light folder has all the
application modules that we built and
the J mods folder has the platform
modules and then you're specifying that
you want to start with the bill mate
node module as your primary means to
enter your application and the node
launcher is your main class to run the
application but they see a problem when
we run the system and this is because a
lot of libraries out in the world make
use of internal details of the JDK and
so what it's complaining about here is
that p4 Java is trying to make use of a
class which is hidden from the public so
it's an internal implementation detail
and with JDK 9 like I said since it has
been modularized you can't use those
classes but you can't just say you can't
use and be done with it so Java has a
way around it and in order to figure out
which class is using which internal
library you can use the enhanced
jaidev's tool which is an analyzer it
will go through the gr read the byte
class and figure out what is going on
using the JDK internals option it
actually allows you to concentrate on
the JDK modules only and so it's saying
here that P for Java is trying to use
the get property action think that's the
class and that's an internal
implementation BDL so
and a nice thing is that it actually
gives you solutions on how to deal with
it and in this case the solution is to
replace it with a public equivalent of
the get proper reaction class and that
has been available since Java 1.1 but
since we are not the authors of the
perforce client library I can't do that
so I'm going to say hey Java thank you
very much but take a chill pill let me
allow to use p4 Java for now and so the
ad opens does that for you so ad opens
and then you're saying okay I know this
is an internal implementation detail but
for now you P for Java access to the
internal implementation yeah once you do
that you're off and you have Bill made
up and running and I said when I talked
about verdicts I said that it's a it's a
framework that allows you to distribute
your application across JVMs whether
it's running on docker container or on a
VM doesn't matter but that brings some
challenges and this is not something new
we all know that when you build
distributed systems tracing and
instrument instrumentation monitoring
that those become difficult and how do
you deal with that many vendors have
found solutions but the only problem is
then you're tied to a vendor specific
implementations and open tracing solves
that problem
it's just vendor neutral platform
agnostic API contract that's it
whether it's Java or NGO or JavaScript
it just provides you with an API and you
have to find a concrete implementation
but then using that allows you to not
get tied to a specific vendor but very
simply change the implementation aspect
of tracing and it's really useful when
you are dealing with production issues
in a large distributed systems
fundamental concept within a distributed
or sorry open tracing is the trace
a trace tells you a story about the
request as it flows through your
distributed system right in this example
here that I have the client-side
JavaScript sent a message to the API
gateway asking you to start a pipeline
and a bunch of things are happening
behind the scenes and in a monolith this
is all very easy but when you have a
distributed system there things get a
bit more complicated so in the case of
build mate the API gateway is going to
send a message to the authentication
vertical which is nothing but a simple
service which is listening for messages
looks at the header and decides whether
or not the calories authenticated and
authorized right and once that's
verification is done asynchronously we
get a message back saying authorized or
not authorized and based on that another
message is sent by the api gateway to
the resource vertical and it could be
doing something like creating a build
object saving it in the database and
providing a message back and then the
api gateway will talk to the engine
vertical which is going to spin a
container and build your application so
but if you look at it 6 &amp;amp; 7 happen
almost immediately after each other and
that's because we don't necessarily have
to wait for the pipeline to end and so
we send a message we forget about it and
send it to o2 response back to the
client and that's what a trace is
essentially tracking it's tracking the
progress of a request once it hits the
server and passes through the various
distributed systems within your internal
network of course this is a bit of a
simplification things would be much more
complex and so a trace is actually a
directed acyclic graph and off spans
right what is a span a span is a logical
unit of work so it's a made up operation
name so in in my example here I'm saying
that start pipeline is
main span and so what you see here is
actually the same thing that I show here
but in a better way right you have a
time graph you have a span flowing
across the time axis and then you have
child's fans doing parts of the work so
authentication span the create bill span
and sending a message to the event bus
to some other system and then finally a
total response so when you are trying to
figure out the issue with you within a
production system then you can go to the
tracing to figure out what for example
if you're trying to see which one takes
a lot of time this band diagram would
help right but open tracing doesn't
provide an implementation you have to
get one and a lot of vendors are now
implementing open tracing natively and
Iger is one such implementation and
think it's provided by uber and they
handle billions of spans per day so it's
a very powerful highly scalable system
supports multiple backends cassandra
memory what-have-you and the cool thing
is that it provides the web UI where you
can actually go and look search for
traces or dig into spans and see how the
system or their request is flowing
through your distributed system
obviously you need to configure jÃ¤ger
and the global tracer that I show here
is actually coming from open tracer so
it's a public API and you have a
concrete implementation and you're
saying I want to use Jaeger as my
tracing implementation within your
distribution system so if you're writing
a lot of micro services you can instead
of using a global tracer probably use a
dependency injection mechanism to
configure your tracers and one cool
thing about Iger is that there is a way
to control the sampling rate obviously
in production you don't want to track
every request that flows through your
system and so there are multiple ways
in which you can configure the tracer
some of them my outline here there's a
way to remotely control the tracing or
the sampler constant on or off that's it
I use it as an example here and also
used it for the demo where every request
is tracked but you don't want to do that
in production and then there's a way to
rate limit the tracing in it and you can
say for every second I only want to
trace ten requests or you can roll up
your own and decide on how to trace but
of course that kind of adds additional
complexity to your system and you don't
want to overburden your system just for
tracing purposes and let's go back and
look at the demo of the Yaeger UI and
within build mate we have a link to the
tracer and so you see that it has a
couple of services or more than that
actually so we have bill mate node one
node two and server these are the
verticals essentially that have been
deployed and so each node or each
vertical are a bunch of articles
actually does a specific piece of work
and so you can track them down and see
what is happening within those nodes
let's see what happens with note one we
have a span here
again all of these are just arbitrary
names you can come up with whatever you
want to bill mate node 1 is the name of
the service followed by the span or the
trace name which is bill underscore flow
it can be much more meaningful than that
and then you see that there is a time
line axis and your spans are distributed
across the parent span which is the bill
flow they are cut in certain steps
happening here these are all the
messages going internally within the
cluster and you can drill down you can
tag your spans with much with more
information if you want to for instance
let's see what I have here I added a
build ID to it that way I can track if
something is wrong within my system or
with a specific bill I can do that I can
drill down and see what's happening so
which is very cool think that is all I
have so all of these come together and
that's how we build made using verdicts
using J PMS to modularize the code and
we used open tracing to track requests
that are going across the distributed
environment I think that's all I have
