presentation about extending your cloud
or back-end system to mobile devices I'm
llaves and CTO cloud product at a gloom
I gave him number of presentations in
this conference about Java on mobile and
with optionally how you could extend
Java to the enterprise but in this
presentation we start from the complete
opposite angle we start from the
enterprise before I start how many who
of you is a developer okay and who is
more a manager or business okay good so
I'll try to do a bit mix between
business requirements and code so i hope
to satisfy everybody in case you have
questions interrupt me and ask so first
of all java in the enterprise is i think
well established it's a most popular
development platform for enterprise
applications and it's very mature and
one of the reasons that is popular is it
there exist many many libraries lots of
you have lots of choices with different
strategies you can use java ee you can
use spring you can use micro profile
there are many web based training works
that can be used together with java for
example it can be an MVC based framework
can be jsf primefaces or can be a
javascript-based a framework there's
lots of lots of choices and the
enterprise applications and the web
front-ends are often very well
integrated with each other they are
often developed not by the same person
but in the same team so there's a very
good collaboration at least in theory
between the people developing the
backend functionality and the people
developing the
web from tent so that's the there are
years of experience in this area and
that's going that's going well well okay
going well it's not always the case but
it's a very common to have a web
front-end together with an enterprise
application developed in a company and
today many companies who have an
established web presence facing
increasing demand from their customers
partners users employees to provide the
mobile application towards the
enterprise functionality for example if
you have a ecommerce store you have some
enterprise functionality when you do the
transactions the billing and so on you
have a webform tent where the items are
good for sale but your customers say but
I'm also traveling and I want to make
reservations on my phone may buy on my
phone or I want to review my status of
what I'm buying on a tablet so more and
more people are demanding enterprise
functionalities on their mobile devices
mobile devices are not only used for
games anymore but also really for
business applications and actually I see
a trend that I saw about 10 years ago
and I hated that I have to say 10 years
ago because it makes me feel so old but
about I think a long time ago the web
was considered to be something fancy for
geeks but not were serious enterprises
when the series enterprise had a fat
client with some functionality but not
this this web client and that the web
that that actually started for sharing
information everything in the open and
so turn more and more into an enterprise
web and I think we're seeing the same
evolution now with mobile mobile which
is still very popular with games and and
I'm not saying less serious applications
but let's see there's applications like
chats
and so online dating applications which
we're seeing more and more enterprise
applications appearing on mobile as well
often those applications so if you
company get a question can you provide
me with an end up with an a mobile
application for your enterprise
functionality this application is often
the development of the application is of
an outsourced to a different team or a
different company now why is this
because if you want a very very good and
slick integration with the native device
you might go for a native iOS and the
native Android application but this
requires skills that you don't have in
your java team you're the java team
that's creating the enterprise back-end
doesn't know iOS or android so you have
to outsource that development if you
choose to do it an in a webview that
might then be done by the same people
that are dealing with your existing web
front-end but experience teaches
everyone i think that the end user on
mobile really prefers a native
application and not not not a web
application the browser or mobile phones
is used as a last resort if there's no
native application or if you only need
to access some information only once
yeah then it's fine to use the browser
but for a business critical application
if you don't have to redirect your users
to a browser that's a first of all it's
it doesn't give the presence that you
want and second it really does not give
the native feeling that other
applications are offering it's also
important that the mobile applications
they they are not should not live on an
island because those applications they
need to access the same data and the
same functionality as your web
applications imagine you ever imagined
you own an airline for example and you
want a reservation system you have a
reservation system on the web but you
want to make people to make reservations
online as well yeah I don't think you're
going to have a separate fleet with
planes that only fly based on
reservations from the mobile and from
the desktop so the the seeds are
reserved via the web interface should
match exactly the seats reserved via the
mobile interface so all the data and all
the functionality that is available to
the web applications should also be
available to the mobile applications
well it's not not really all the data
but at least the overlapping data should
be exactly the same there should be no
conflict and that that's a very very
strong requirement and it turns out to
be a huge it's actually the number one
issue amongst the sea CIOs of some of
those big companies that do studies
about what what's the biggest worry when
you integrate a mobile application
integrating with the existing enterprise
functionality is really considered the
number one issue and the number one
priority when working on mobile
applications also very important is the
the second here on the list the ability
to meet security requirements and the
reason I mentioned this security
requirements is because later in this
presentation we will make the link
towards Java and Java when it was
created one of the initial goals of Java
was to provide a secure framework so
security is one of the key requirements
in the key design criteria in the Java
ecosystem so you have a mobile you need
a mobile application you have an
existing enterprise application probably
Verbeck web backend and now you need the
mobile application and maybe you want to
do it in-house maybe you outsource it to
a development company but it anyhow
needs to access your functionality now
most of the enterprise functionality
today is exposed via web via rest
service so then
mobile developer will say well that's
that that's very good because we can use
rest on the mobile client we can make
HTTP calls we are directly or via a
framework and those can those can talk
to the backend so that's fine we just
use our existing back-end and we make
rest calls to the backend for example
give me all the items that we have in a
store but the problem is typically when
the back end and the web application are
hosted on the same server or in the same
data center you don't really worry about
lots of data being sent back and forth
between the the web component and the
enterprise component or the web
component will cash most of these things
so size of data being transferred this
less an issue in the enterprise
environment but the mobile you don't
want to do this you don't want to
transfer real big objects from an
enterprise back end to a mobile phone
bond wave is getting better and better
prices or the or going down but still
it's a it is expensive especially if
you're connected via 3G or 4G it's much
more expensive than if you're on a
roofie so you don't want to have people
being angry at you because your
application consumes all the bandwidth
and then they have a huge bill with
their telco provider because you
consumed all the bandwidth without
sending only the information that they
need it they don't need every item in
your store at the same moment apart from
the bandwidth it may also be very slow
so because you don't want the big
objects what I often see that then being
done in in an enterprise back end to
make sure that the mobile client does
not get the big object is arrested so
good and dejection API is great we can
add parameters we cannot connect
parameters for example we will add a
parameter mobile equals two and if we
pass a query with mobile equals two
we will make sure that the server sends
us not every in not all information that
is sent to the web component but only
the relevant information for the mobile
so we can distinguish based on this
power of the mobile is true and then
send all the data or just some data and
it's a it's great we can we can have
even more functionality that's mobile
specific by specifying this mobile is
true parameter we know that this users
on mobile so maybe we want to send
information that's most relevant to his
current location that's a that's that's
another opportunity that you have a
mobile that you that's less common on
the web so the mobile developer knows a
half now the enterprise knows the dymo
mobile let's now give all my
requirements to the enterprise for
example I want to have a not only mobile
is true but also location is XY then the
enterprise functional at the enterprise
functionality should of course be
extended because the mobile developer
says hey give me all the items or for
example giving all the restaurants that
much my criteria but order them by
distance from my location but then on
the end up on the web frontend you're
not passing the location parameter so
you will get exceptions there but you
can catch of course the null pointer
exceptions or you can use optional and
in the end it's going to be a complete
mess so while it is very well possible
to directly who use rest calls on the
mobile client it is creating a very
difficult situation on the enterprise
back end if they need to fulfill both
the mobile as well as the web based
requests I'm not the first one saying
this in the industry this is a
recognized problem so therefore that's
one of the reasons that of the past
years the emboss is growing in
popularity so embassies mobile backend
as a service and it is sort of a middle
layer between
between the mobile systems and an
enterprise functionality so the rather
than developers having to rewrite all
the mobile specific functionality in
their applications and emboss it
providing some common functionality
there are examples of empire systems for
example the Oracle mobile cloud source
but also glue on cloud link and then
came the any presence appcelerator and
so and well the definition of em boss is
still a bit unclear well not unclear
it's the the problem of the I personally
have with this definition is that it is
a it depends on the vendor or they
choose as a definition so in general
most of the embossed systems provide
data persistency and synchronization
capabilities so if your mobile
application needs to store some data it
might store it on the local device but
you want to make sure that it doesn't
get lost so it's stored remotely as well
and by using an emboss on a mobile
device you don't have to worry that well
this data I'm also now going to send it
to a server where it will then be stored
and so this functionality that the
numbers is doing synchronization makes
sure that if you need to synchronize
synchronize to a external database for
example that you don't need to do the
the separate queries to first do an SQL
sequel read compare if it already is
there and then check the versioning and
in case you are at the latest version
you can do an update and commit it back
in the database so that's a that's
taking care of by typical emboss systems
as well which is also very common and
important functionality because you want
to send data to your mobile application
for example there's a new action now by
two and get five for free so you want to
you don't want to write all the specific
code for doing this thing it's just a
common functionality that can for
example be combined with geolocation
you're traveling and you're in a
different city system can see that this
person is now here so I'm going to send
him a push notification that your
favorite starbucks or there's a favorite
coffee shop of you nearby where you are
you are now analytics is very important
in enterprise environments see I also
want to know it's actually when I talk
to enterprise customers this is the
first question they often ask they want
to know how many uses they have how
often they are using the app and what
exactly they are doing with the app are
they just browsing through a catalog or
the selecting individual items or they
go into the shop page and then going
back and so so that is that is a
internet price extremely important and a
user management well I don't have to
tell you that the value of a user is
extremely important in the enterprise
apart from facebook of course they they
are just doing everything for the
benefit of you but all the other
companies really want to know as much as
they can about you to want to send
targeted advertisements and so so the
more that company knows about you the
better they can help you device
management is also important because one
of the important aspects because often
you want to know or you want to make a
correlation between users that are using
this device are more likely to to take
this action or they are more likely to
attend this event and there are many use
cases that might some might be more
ethical than than than others but
sometimes prices are that you see in the
shop are different based on
the device that you're using so that's a
bit weird but information about which
devices are being used is extremely
important but also of course suppose
that you knew on the new feature you
know yeah but for low-end phones that's
not that's not that's not very well
suited so it will be slow and then you
see at your existing user user base and
you see how much person you have and you
see maybe we can have for this user's we
might have something else but at least
you need to know so these are typical
functionality functionality is offered
by ambassa systems so they are typically
presented in a in charge like this one
so this is a for the glue on cloud link
ambass that we divided the functionality
in some vertical functions like security
which is all over the place and
management and then the world a typical
mobile functions so like for example the
geolocation online offline push jet mail
functionalities and then the the
integration with existing cloud systems
and enterprise systems for example a
Salesforce plug in communication with
authentication systems social media
authentication like Facebook Twitter and
so on so that's that's the functionality
that's typically offered in in embossed
systems so while that is nice and it
removes lots of the boilerplate code
that you would otherwise have to write
in your application in your mobile
application but also in your enterprise
back end it creates a new problem
because because of the nice and clear
separation between mobile and
development mobile development becomes
even more isolated and when talking to
customers and partners in the industry
we see that one it that is also one of
the most annoying things that people
report it's a they have completely
different teams doing the
a mobile app and doing the enterprise
application and they have different
requirements and unless you spend the
huge amount of time in specifying all
the requirements to a very very detailed
level where you specify how much
milliseconds it might take for a user to
move from page 12 well to a more
detailed item and we also specify that
you should use a swipe gesture another
scroll gesture and so it often leads to
angry people because in the end the
business manager is not happy with the
end result he will go to his enterprise
people and they will say yeah but the
mobile application is not calling what
we intended and the mobile development
team will say I will we got the
requirements to do this so we just got
called that service and we we just
render what we got back so it's a it's
it's it's often very disconnected so
therefore one of the one of the good
things that I think we have in the Java
ecosystem is that if you have an
enterprise being application being
developed in Java you can also develop
your mobile application in Java and that
has a number of advantages you can use
your existing Java skills the skills
that you have inside your theme so you
don't need to get a separate team on
board for iOS or for Android you don't
need to outsource it to an iOS Android
specific companies and developers that
are working on the backend systems they
can at least review the code from the
front end and also vice versa it's
developers are often have the reflex
that suppose the dime PHP developer said
suppose the diamond PHP developer and
someone shows me Java code i'm going to
say order that i don't know let's java
and also the other way around if you're
a java developer
and the someone show show you some
objective c or swift code you might say
well no that's i'm not going to look
into this that's a there's a huge mental
barrier between between different
cultures in the program world so by
using java all over the place this
barrier got reduced drastically and we
really saw this with where we have we
already have used cases where both the
enterprise team and the mobile team are
using java and it creates a much much
better atmosphere because they talk to
each other and they reuse some of the of
the code of course as i said in the
beginning don't just take your back-end
code and put it on a mobile device
because that's simply not going to work
and your users will not be happy the
telcos might be happy because of the
communication bill but that's about it
so with Java being a very mature
language you have you have a very mature
solution as well on the client so Java
the white ones run anywhere idea of Java
is today actually more valid than before
because until a few years ago it wasn't
really possible to create real Java
applications on the phone because it
requires you to install Java and that
was of course not done even even on
desktops installing java is often not
done but today and i'm not going to talk
about it in this session because i did a
couple of sessions about it and other
students as well java is really you can
really create mobile applications
cross-platform in java you write them
once and you run them on mobile devices
and it's not just that you then have a
java business logic part and you then
render using the native iOS android
components or your vendor in a webview
no java contains javafx which is a
cross-platform UI framework in java it's
a provided with java sdk eight also
seven you
or do whatever with javafx the the java
contains a rich control set of controls
and widgets that can be rendered on
mobile devices as well and it those are
rendered directly on top of the of the
OpenGL ES layer so they are hardware
accelerated so they while they are not
physically the same as the native
buttons that you would have with iOS or
the native Android button the process of
rendering them is the same it's
immediately rendered on the on the GPU
as opposed to being rendered in a web in
WebKit or so then the it's still HTML
and JavaScript that needs to be parsed
and rendered by this single web view /
WebKit thing so if java vex you have a
you have a really real native look and
feel on the on the device so what what I
quickly want to explain here is that
with a gluon we have we have an
end-to-end stack in Java from the mobile
device to the to the backend so what we
already talked about in this in this in
the past week was a the group of virtual
machine and ahead of time compiler which
is a bundled together with the end user
application with a whole suite with an
SDK for client application development
that's all accessible we are a single
IDE plugins so if you're using NetBeans
IntelliJ eclipse there's a gluon plug-in
and if you use that you can create a
java application run it on desktop run
it on mobile all with that single
plug-in and then we go up to the cloud
and that's what so that's what this talk
is about just showing this to to show
that there's an end-to-end java a path
available we won't try to Duke Choice
Award for this technology so finally so
that's actually enough four slides for
me but I'm going to show how this can
work in a very simple
application a very simple application
but I will show the different components
so what I'm going to show is java ee 7
application that's running on the Bayaka
a micro profile which is a anyone
familiar with the payara micro profile
okay so that is a very lightweight
version of the java ee 7 classf is
application server but then with a
different well not with all the GSR in
J's ours in there we run this on the
Oracle cloud we use the Oracle gas cloud
so the infrastructure as a service so we
we added a Java 8 and the payara micro
profile to it and have it running there
should also work on the Oracle pass
cloud it also works of course on the
Amazon or any other system but this is
just we want to show that you your
application kind of run in the Oracle
cloud for example we have glue on cloud
link as an emboss in the middle and then
we have a java application running on
iOS so how does this look in a picture
on the Oracle cloud we run the business
logic and the web player in the payara
micro profile we will show that you can
see with the web player you can see the
application glowing cloud when you
change something in the application the
application will talk to glue on cloud
link and glue on cloud link will connect
to the connected mobile devices and
update the information there the
application that i'm going to show is a
very very simple notes application so
where a user can give a title and some
content and that is then a note that's
stored in the system and everyone who
writes notes can see the change of these
notes so i feel much more comfortable
now because i can now switch to code and
first of all
we are going to what are we going to do
first see if we have a connection to the
Oracle cloud yes we are logged in so
this is D this is just it infrastructure
as a Service Cloud and have a start app
script here what is this going to do
it's going to start it by our micro it's
very very convenient if you have a very
small application or micro servers and
you want to do already add water to it
can be easily done with a glass fish or
choir micro so we will start this the
application that we are starting is a
war cloud link rest connector work and
we will show what it is actually doing
so we are now starting this on the
Oracle cloud so there's no maintenance
window okay and when it is a loaded we
can go to a browser and let's see if
it's already loaded yep okay well this
on item in there so this is this is our
web-based a front end so i can add a
note and i can see the notes and i can
remove notes before we are going to add
something i'm starting the mobile
application but i'm not going to do with
the mobile because it would be too
difficult to show but the application is
the one so this is the real native iOS
application but i will it's probably
difficult to see it on the stream so i
will start it in emulation mode on the
on my laptop and that's this one here
and what is now happening is that this
application is talking to glue on cloud
link and glowing cloud and it says I
need all the notes for this application
wrong crowd link is going to ask our
service in the back end as so yeah on
the Oracle cloud for give me all the all
the notes that have been asked how does
it know where to ask them we have a
dashboard for managing your connection
to the cloud I'm not going to show the
application that we are really
connecting to because I don't have the
key and secret by hat but you can see
that you can define for your application
a connector for example we can add the
rest connector and this one then defines
that where your data should come from or
what operation you should perform when
some operation is performed from mobile
so here you configure the the whole
connection between the mobile
application and the backend application
so going back to the mobile application
I'm going to put this a bit here and
going back to the web application which
takes too much of my screen and let's
see if this works now if it doesn't work
it of course the network that's failing
if I can't blame it on the network I can
blame it on the Oracle cloud maintenance
window worst case I'm going to blame it
on a deep ir a-- instance but to be
honest all the tree or working excellent
in this conference so i think i should
blame me if it feels so from java one
this is a live test you should never do
that that
click we click on submit and you see it
immediately added to the to the web
application but look at the mobile
application it's there as well so and it
was like immediately when I pushed the
submit button so how comes that this is
going so fast that you don't have to
reload this well the mobile application
if we if we start it is going to ask
glowing cloud link hey this is me with a
key and a secret it's authenticated and
I want to get this list with this name
and when you have updates to the list
send them directly to me when I add a
note using the web application the
application is talking to glue on cloud
link and saying hey I have a new item
for this list so maybe you want to do
something with it maybe not whatever
glue on Cloudland NC or there was just a
mobile client who said give me all the
data and in case something changes let
me know so it immediately pushes the new
data to the mobile application so it's
there so and this allows you to do
synchronization between the back end in
the client wants to see some where
sometimes we wants to see some code okay
well let's do some improvisation and go
to NetBeans probably have to make that
the font size a bit it's a tradable or
do I have to increase the font size it's
good okay let me first show the the
client application it's actually so it
is a it is a java vex application so
this is all java so this is the mobile
application that you're seeing it runs
on desktop it runs on iOS it turns on
android if you want to to test it if you
diseased NetBeans if you go to task you
can see launch iPad simulator I always
device all the options to launch it on
your mobile device or in here you have
some of the JavaFX UI controls in here
that shows the the user interface the
most important class for this session at
least is that we have the yeah I have to
make sure that we're on the client a
colleague of mine for a 2d ed
application a use value we are name so
its client front-end and back-end client
and so on but here we have the v3
retrieve notes method which is called on
the client it's going to call gloom glue
on cloud link and it says I want a list
of all the nodes and important here is
that we provide some synchronization
flags least three through object rato
object right who by using this blue and
cloudless knows that if there's a new
item on the list or if some of the item
changes it needs to notify us and
because and I'm not going to detail this
is javafx with observables if the data
in an observable changes the UI
component will change immediately as
well so that's it for the client the
back end application is a simple
application with a rest interface and it
has a number of handlers for example the
list handler is what is this is the one
that will be called by glue on cloud
link so this endpoint is what you define
in the in the dashboard that I just
showed your end of the URL of the list
that you want and automatically glowing
cloud link will add the identifier in
our cases was notes so it will then
automatically call this this handler and
it will give you the list if we return
it as Jason the client will deserialize
it and so so here it will be shown so
here
we just make sure that if glue on cloud
link calls us and he wants to get a list
of everything here we return this list
so we survive it as Jason but the
important thing is here in order to
return everything we call node serves
would find all a note service so we're
now at the back end this is our
enterprise functionality note services
find all this is your very complex
business logic so this is shared between
your web application and your mobile
application so here you did you define
everything the very complex criteria
builder for for doing all weird stuff so
this is a real simple example in five
lines but you can imagine that this is
this is really where your where your
business intelligence is this is why you
should focus on as an application
developer so sorry so this is called and
then what you do in this handler is you
make sure that you maybe you don't want
to send everything because we now got a
list of notes from our application maybe
we don't as I said we don't want to send
the details because it doesn't make
sense to show that on the mobile so we
decide here what we are going to send
and not so that is how how our
application is talking to glue on cloud
link the last thing to show is what if
we use the use the web content to let me
see if I have web pages is probably so
the JSP that we were shown I'm just
using a simple JSP here so otherwise if
I choose in a web framework there would
always be people walking all out because
i'm using the web framework that they
had to use for the past five years and
that they hate so much so i'm using just
a simple JSP that probably nobody is
using but so the moment that a note is a
submitted via the web interface the form
that submit is called and then one way
or another the
ah we also using Resta for communicating
between the web interface and the end
application the I think this note
handler is called and what will they do
it will call the note service and create
a new node and also as I said here it
will tell glue on cloud link we have a
new node edit so Clark link serves doc
note added and what will this do this
we'll talk back to the glue on cloud
link so it will say that while following
a the URL convention it will add this
new note to to glue on cloud link and
then clone clouding nose oh but that's
from the list that has been asked before
by this client so i will sorry i will i
will send it back to that client so in
summary
that is how with a very very simple
example how end-to-end development in
Java can be done so this is really pure
Java and it works on mobile and I think
you can ask the people that attended the
sessions in the hilton about does this
work well on mobile well just had a
session with the NASA they were showing
how they are using the our mobile
technologies for the deep space
trajectory thing they do 3d
visualizations on a tablet and it's a I
was really amazed that to see that
myself money because the science behind
it is great but it's a it's a very
performant and it's a and so that the
nasa contractor who was showing it he
said that he honestly was so amazed by
how easy it was he in already had a
desktop application for doing this
visualization and just in a few days he
ported it over to to to mobile to the
globe using glue a mobile and it it
works like a charm and so this is this
is not just a research tool this is
really in production so you can you can
get this and you can use it in
production so I'm pretty excited to have
Java and went from mobile to to back-end
and with a glue and cloud lick in
between the synchronization between your
devices or synchronization between
devices and cloud systems is in short I
think it's very important that we do
realize that those mobile applications
is fun to make but when you realize that
it's important to get those applications
to access the same data that is in the
enterprise stores that is in the cloud
environments where all the functionality
is created and where the data is stored
so the link between the mobile cloud the
mobile device and the cloud is very
important I think Microsoft is actually
a good slogan for days it's mobile-first
cloud-first and I think that is the IT
slogan for the future Mobile is getting
more important and cloud is getting more
important so where will all the traffic
from the cloud originated from for
mobile devices and mobile
applications so that's a thing very
brief overview on end-to-end application
development use your existing back-end
application unless you want to refactor
it anyhow of course but you can use your
your existing functionality if you have
rest interfaces and you can make it easy
to have new clients mobile clients
accessing that functionality so don't
start rewriting it from scratch just
extend your functionality and you can
target the next billion devices thank
you do you have questions in case you
have questions you see my twitter handle
here and you can go to the glue on
website glue on HQ com for more
questions or catch me around thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
