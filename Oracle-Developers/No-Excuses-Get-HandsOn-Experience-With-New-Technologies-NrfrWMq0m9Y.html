here at Oracle Openworld 2017
my tech tip today is actually quite simple:
there's no excuse for not getting hands-on experience with new technologies.
The only way to learn is by sitting down
and actually trying things out,
as I'm about to do when I go to the
hands-on lab on Oracle Functions,
the Oracle solution for serverless.
I've read about serverless,
I've read a book about Amazon Lambda,
I've been having conversations about serverless.
Really the only way to actually find out what it is
and how you can make use of it is we're
trying it out yourself
Of course it's easy to try things out when
you're at a conference like this one where
people organize hands-on labs
and people who have created that kind of technology
are here to explain it to you and guide you through the workshop.
However, for today's developer there are so many opportunities to get code,
to download environments, to start playing for free.
Even on cloud environments you don't
need to bring in a powerful laptop.
There's no better advice I can give you
than to sit down, download the
environments,
start up your Docker container,  fire up VirtualBox to start virtual machine,
and try even the simplest things out for yourself.
Through configuration as code, people share [unintelligible] files
that will start up complex Kubernetes clusters
with all kinds of Docker containers.
The only thing you have to do is to start it from a command line,
which may be big step for people used to IDEs.
Before you know it a complex environment has spun up,
and allows you to start interacting,
even if it's nothing more than just a simple hello world example.
I've arrived now at the hands-on lab.
You can see the set-up, all the machines
waiting for people to get their hands dirty and their feet wet.
&quot;Certainly would be worth a try!&quot;</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
