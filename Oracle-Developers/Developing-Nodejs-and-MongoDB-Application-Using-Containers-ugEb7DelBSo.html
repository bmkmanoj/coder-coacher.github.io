many session since morning so my name is
Asha toaster party and I am the
principle platform specialist Oracle
Corporation and one of the things I
focus on in my day to day job working
with large enterprise customers helping
them solve their application development
or the integration problems and every
conversation I go into the first
question comes is what Oracle is doing
in terms of container how can you help
us figure out the micro services
architecture or building the application
using docker containers so what you will
be seeing in next 40 45 minutes is how
quickly you can get started with
container especially docker container
and how we can help our customers or how
you can learn from here today and go
back to your organization and start
using the container before I get started
I know this question was asked in the
morning as well how many of you are
familiar with docker containers can I
get a quick raise of hands quite a few
and how many of you are using
applications using container in the
production actually I don't see any hand
so that God will talk about it how we
can do that but before we get started
red containers are everywhere they grab
the food downstairs
there was a container and we all know
about the shipping industry where
containers are used to ship various type
of product across the world but of
course we are not in the shipping
industry we are 90 industry so what it
means to us and why it is important to
us and what comes to my mind is four
things container provides such agility
they provide us flexibility they do
provide us portability and isolation and
let's touch one by one what it means
agility as the IT developer our
architect to me it about it's about how
quickly I can build the application and
ship it to the production team or to my
end-user the next type topic comes
around flexibility we all are techies we
have been using technologies whether it
is mainstream cobol's or whatever it is
but
as we have seen in last several years
that we have got new technologies like
node.js popping up and we keep on
hearing new terms every other day so as
a developer I want to have a flexibility
to choose my technology stack not I
chose XY the technology and I have to
live it for years and years third aspect
is the portability the whole idea about
container is I run in on one environment
I should be able to take it to other
environment as well I built something on
my laptop and without any hassle I
should be able to run it on a UN
Environment of production environment or
whatever it is and third thing is the
isolation so as you can see this
container I got the oil car food bunch
of things same thing what happens and I
used to develop applications for a long
long time and I was and I've been in
this industry for 15 20 years as a
developer the thing is okay I am running
a Java stack on this platform don't run
the dotnet is tough because it might
have a conflict in libraries etc so it's
all about isolation but why the
containers are becoming so hot you talk
like three or four calls you have
sessions you have been since morning you
heard about containers and to me
primarily three things cloud whether we
like it or not like it
cloud is going to stay here and the
reason is not about I keep on hearing
from the customer cost-saving to me
cloud is all about agility how quickly I
can bring agility to my business owners
or to my organization and cost is of
course one option and the other thing is
flexibility so typically in the
enterprise as I see they have like two
or three cloud providers and in addition
to that they have their own private
cloud also so if container on one cloud
should be container on one on another
cloud there should not be a difference
if you run on let us say Oracle public
cloud you should be able to run it on
the other cloud providers as well even
in your laptop the third thing is micro
services we all like ice creams i love
ice creams but i don't like one flavor
right I may like vanilla one day I may
like chocolate ice cream one day so
technology stack let's say I started
with a Java developer dot
developer over a period of time a lot
definite technology so when we build the
applications let's say several years
back okay I'm going to build XYZ
application let's say building platform
right I would have a my application
server pre-decided
I will have a choice of language I will
have a database okay I want to use or
actual or sequel or whatever database
and I will live it as long as the
application list I don't have choice to
change it and what micro-services
provide us how we can functionally
decompose the application and how you
can evolve technology stack so let's it
exists a can example of building
platform right I started the basic
functionality customer comes in and pays
the billing but I want to add some
search functionality over there I want
to add some kind of a forum of comment
where people can say what the billing
system is awesome or there is a problem
with the billing system so I may want to
choose different set of technology and
if I use the micro services is not
really a new term but to me it's more of
a new style of architecture and
distribute architecture how we can build
the application third thing is DevOps we
have seen the Greek tragedy this morning
right so how the DevOps is all about how
the development and operations team can
work together I as a developer when I
used to develop the applications I never
cared how the operations will run and
manage it and if the problem comes it's
always a constant fighting so it's all
about how we can have a collaboration
and quickly build the application and
push it to the production environment
but we have been using virtual machines
and they have been solving a lot of
problems you got a huge physical
hardware and you want to consolidate it
that's where the virtual machine became
very popular and as you can see here
typically what happens you have a
hardware and use a hypervisor layer to
have multiple operating system so let's
say I want to use Windows operating
system or different version of Linux I
will have 1 hypervisor complete
isolations and I would use this one how
many of you are infrastructure engineers
or how many of you build the VMs
actually here any one of you I see quite
a few hand there are few fundamental
problems with the VM but full disclosure
here and full complete disclaimer
there are certain applications which do
require this sort of architecture there
is no golden hammer that ok I move the
container everything is solved VM sought
the different purpose there are problems
you need to be a solid infrastructure
engineer because it is difficult to
build it is not that easy to build
number one number two they are not as
portable so if I build a VM in my
private cloud I may not be able to take
a different cloud provider because they
may have a different hypervisor they may
have a different mechanism to
virtualizes and they are also difficult
to upgrade also it is not that easy all
in all I would say they add some in
efficient efficiency of course there are
benefits to that but the inefficiency is
the performance said you go have an
operating system running within an
operating system so that's what the VM
is but what the container is let's say I
am building an application it could be a
node.js Java or whatever choice of
language I choose I will have all the
dependency and binaries self contained
in the container and I can build on my
laptop very quickly and once I am ready
I can promote it to the higher
environment without even constant
fighting with it this is the environment
variable and you got to go and set up
XYZ variable into your operating system
it's more about Portability and agility
how quickly I can do that and as you can
see the architecture you've got the
infrastructure you have operating system
and one of the requirements for Linux
sorry the container is the Linux it is
it requires the Linux operating system
to run on it and and I'm going to show
you quickly how you can like know some
of you guys have done it but the guys
have not done it how quickly they can
get started with the docker container
because I was also in the same but when
the customer asked hey can you help me
with container I don't know I got to
figure it out and I started hello hello
hello what program and you're going to
see that one and then the this
application let's say I built this
different different application and I
package it and I can hand it off to
different people or if I'm in the
software business providing some
functionality I can ship it to my
customers as well very quickly now going
back to the architecture to doctor I
know we all have heard the name docker
some of us might have used it as well if
you see the darker architecture it
it is the fundamental architecture of
this is a client service and we have
used the client-server technology for
years and years and decades and decades
actually but the way the client-server
architecture is you have a single
component or single binary which works
as a client as well as server so you see
there are few things here about docker
host here and the darker host is
basically very darker engine is running
and it does provide you all the darker
daemon which runs behind the scene to
enable the communication with docker
client and the darker client for darker
comes with built in 8 API is of the
method silicon if you will like how do I
build the images images is nothing but a
abstraction or the self-contained image
of your application with all the
libraries etc and then you got the
registry it's the optional component but
what registry provides you a cleaner
handoff between the development and the
operation or even if you are publishing
some of the images and you would see
that couple of images what I built in
available is public if you want to go
and try it out you can try it out and
you're going to see it how quickly it
runs so how about we quickly go and
build the hello world program because
that's where I start every program I
want to learn any programming language
and I believe most of us might be doing
it who doesn't start with hello world
program they just go to build highly
available application anybody okay so
let's see the quick step what you are
going to see in the demo is I will open
my sandbox machine which is running a
Linux operating system and I will a
simple node.js which will welcome all of
you to the Oracle code event and thank
you for being here and a docker file
docker file is a template how the image
will be build let's say I am building a
Linux or some sort of operating system
could be open to or whatever I want to I
want them in node.js libraries on top of
it I want to put my code or any
environmental variables and then I will
build the image and push it to the
public repository and run it in the
container if you guys have a Linux you
can also pull it out run this command
with me and you see how easy it is in
force by the step you guys all will be a
dots and hello world experts I can say
that
so let us quickly jump onto this one so
this is my sandbox environment is it all
clear here okay good so as you can see I
already have a darker image running on
Dockery demon running on this one but if
you so I have this darker version
running on it and if you really want to
install on your machine actually you can
just run this command and docker engine
will be installed on your Linux
operating system once you do that you
have a code here which is a simple
server dot JS file it's a node.js code
and you can just get this code or you
can take it to get from there it one
size on this one it will print out a
message on the web browser welcome to
Oracle code event and I modified about
15-20 minutes back so in the interest of
time I will not build a new Dugger
container application so now I got my
image and the one most important thing
is darker file and remember you can
always get the images which are
available from the public repository
let's say building in node.js
application with Oracle also we have lot
of Oracle Linux images as WebLogic
images available you can download it
start playing with that or you can build
it own image if you decide to build your
own image the first thing you need is
apart from your code of course a docker
file so docker file i was talking it's
more of instruction if you give that i
want to build this image from here this
is my directory and more uppity
instructional bids you can just type it
out there a few commands and what port
and all i want to export it and once you
build the docker image as I was talking
that I can quickly running this command
docker
build image and you can also put the
version number I'm going to just talk
shortly on that
so you see darker build is the command
which is available out of Dockers once
installed or it will be available to you
this is the name of my docker hub
repository I show trip but you can have
your own pub repository or you can have
your private repository within you
magician this is the name of my image
and I can put let's save version number
v2 I want to build it once you do that
what it does it goes ahead and reuse the
dockerfile it takes the code and try to
build it of course in real life will not
be having code running in your sandbox
or local machine you can pull the code
also from doctor hub the repository as
well and once the image is as you can
see it's more of the layered
architecture I'd first get the node.js
it copies the code and it also exposing
some port and all if you want to expose
it and then once it goes through all the
strips your image will be built and you
can see that image available in your
local machine I can also also push this
image to docker hub repository or I can
run it locally so let's say as you can
see I built this image recently so I got
my code I first installed docker engine
I got my code and I built the docker
image and of course it's more fun if I
don't share with anybody right so I want
to share my docker images for that I
would run like I was talking about this
command docker push so what it will do
it will push to the public repository of
course if you are having your specific
repository in the organization you would
certainly be using that one so I would
say I get the v2
so now it is what it is doing it is
trying to push the code over there and
now we can quickly see whether my code
has gone to the darker hub repository or
not so I mean the docker hub but of
course we provide different mechanism
and you might have something specific to
your organization so let's see what is
the status on that one so as you can see
I have pushed this one few seconds back
the one which I if you don't define the
image it just takes it the latest one
actually now that is great now this
image is available on docker hub I can
run it in my environment on a different
machine where docker engine is running
or you guys just go and pull this image
and run it in your environment so let's
quickly run this image and this is a
darker run command and what happens
let's say I can pull the image but in
reality when I run the docker run
command if it is image is not available
in a local machine it will go to the
repository and pull it out actually so
what I'm going to do I am going to run
this one and once you run the image you
can see okay this images running
actually at port 9000 which I ran few
seconds back and now let's see whether
it is really printing that what I wanted
to print the welcome hello water what we
saw actually for that I will need IP
address give me a second
welcome to it's not that pretty but good
for a Hello word program right so you
can see and you guys can also install
and try to do it on your own machine if
you want to do it and you saw my
daughter have the handle actually what I
have so it would be all got the hello
world program everything it done but we
all know real world programs we all have
developed you all develop on day to day
basis it is much more than a hello world
program so for what do we need for
applications which I have to run in a
production grid environment I need some
sort of a clustering I need a
scalability it has to be reliable what
if my physical machine goes down and
what if my data center goes down how do
I make it happen so for that I have
built a demo application ecommerce
application which is using all those
features but in order to do that
clustering of containers you need some
sort of a technology there are various
option available like kubernetes how
many of you have heard about kubernetes
so sealant so and darker also provides a
native clustering mechanism a darker
swarm so what does the darker swarm does
right think about it as your containers
running across multiple hosts but darker
swad provides you a single interface to
all your docker containers which might
be running in a host so the concept is
very similar like a manager and the team
member right so there is a darker floor
manager which this all the scheduling
and discovery typically what we are we
all have managers right so we know that
they keep on figuring it out what we do
how to schedule or work saying the dr.
for manager does that and these are
birth or nodes and you could have one or
many containers running on the worker
nodes which could be participating in
the farm manager and this manager can
also be have one or two as a back-up
plan so let's say for whatever reason
this machine goes down it can promote
any other worker node as a manager you
can orchestrate all those kind of things
what the good thing is if you're
starting with the container which I
believe most of us or some of us so you
can start using the native capability or
docker container provides and get all
these benefit of native clustering or
load balancing and how
State across the containers running on
different physical hosts and when I said
different physical hosts this could be a
physical host running in a different
data centers as well as long as you
enable the communication so if you do
all those kind of things so and then you
you will be having a application which
will meet all the scalability
reliability and all those requirements
what we are looking in the production
grade application and again remember the
day one when you start this thing it is
not that everything will work like a
magic on the day one it has to evolve
over a period of time and you learn and
feedback and start improving those kind
of things so what I have done this is a
demo application what I have built
actually which is using a darker farm as
a clustering mechanism you could also
use kubernetes and all but for the
purpose of demonstration and I want to
use all the native capabilities what
docker container provides and I was on
one physical machine I have a darker
farm running which does all the load
balancing clustering and I'm going to
short click on what this ad 2 and 81 are
but darker node or worker know what are
running in a different data centers of
course in the in the Oracle cloud but
you could be running somewhere else also
it could be in your private cloud as
well and then I have got the MongoDB
back-end database running on all these
instances certainly some of you can say
this is the still not a production grid
application I know that for demo
purposes it is that but in real life you
will have a backup of your MongoDB
database you'll a backup or swarm and
you can do it very easily with few
commands you can do that and the docker
hub is the one where my next-gen image
is stored which you'll see shortly how
does it look like and access it and as
you can see all those different features
so what I will do when I go through the
demo I'll touch upon where all the micro
services can fit in and how we can do
that because we all talk about this cool
words right micro services DevOps but it
has to fit in terms of business and how
it can help the organizations now click
over to be how many of you guys are
familiar with node.js or MongoDB or have
used in some former shape ok
some of you guys right so of course
node.js has become very popular Java is
still the most popular language but no
Jesus is getting popular for variously
there's more of a JavaScript based
framework people are familiar with
JavaScript framework and it's more of a
simpleness and event-driven architecture
we all know relational databases they
have been around for a long time but
over a period of time last several years
even the no sequel database is coming up
there are various choices such as bongo
DB cassandra or there are many open
source available in the marketplace I
have towards the Mongo DB which is a no
secret document or in your database and
it stores the object in the JSON format
so for example if you are defining it
item in your product inventory it could
have ten or fifteen attributes to start
with but what if you have to add one
more attribute it is not always that
easy to go and alter the column or add
the column but the Mongo DB or any no
sequel database you can just define a
new key that will automatically be taken
care of that one so technology choice is
great clustering is there but one thing
we all need a solid infrastructure to
run our application so the Oracle
bare-metal cloud services of course you
could have your own private cloud and
all those things but for the purpose of
this demo have chosen the Oracle
biometric cloud services
just a quick thirty Seconds overview and
government of cloud services we have the
basement of cloud services available
across regions think about region as
geographically separated the area it
could be a west coast East Coast Europe
and all those things and each region
have three or more availability domains
and availability domain is actually a
physically isolated data center so in
case if one operator Center goes down
there few miles apart they are not like
few meters apart alike completely
different ISP provider
physically separated so in the event of
your ISP provider failed a specific IC
provide
ISP provider is still your other data
centers could be up and running your
application should not suffer because
one of the data center goes down and of
course you can have all these region in
case the whole region go
Donna can build all those kind of things
so as you have seen my application
previous architecture I have a D 1 and a
D 2 so this is basically 81 and 82 is
where my multiple nodes are the front
end application pieces are running over
there so now it's a show time let's see
how this all fit together and what works
here actually so I'll just quickly show
the bare metal cloud service and of
course it's a whole new topic altogether
on session for one or two hours but just
a quick introduction on the bare metal
cloud services and I hope I should not
face any internet problems so far it has
been good to me so once you have access
to the Oracle bare metal cloud services
you will log in and as you can see we
have compartments and again as I said we
can go on and on on this one but and
maybe add some adult time but let's see
the specific thing which I wanted to
show to you guys
where my darker worker notes are running
so as you can see I have configured the
compute instances you can quickly
provision a instance in Damon's cloud
service in few minutes number one number
two vibrated cloud service I talked
about the availability domain and how
fault alread database we do not have any
hypervisors so we taught that we saw the
VM with the virtual machine architecture
where we got all these hypervisor it's
all software defined and you get the
complete performance of full performance
for your infrastructure and upon and
also the starter time and if you are
running multiple containers on one
instance you get all the benefits of
this one so as you can see I have this
instance where my darker swarm is
running I have got the sandbox where I
build the hello world application it
could be my local laptop also but I just
have a sandbox which I can give it to
any developer I want and I have two
different availability domains 82 and 83
and my front-end application which
you're going to see shortly is running
on that application actually that that
that physical machine which are a
different availability domains so in
case my 82 or 83 goes down
would be still up and running and I
should be able to quickly move forward
with that thing so now that being said
let's quickly look into our applications
before I look at the application let us
look into the what do we call the darker
swarm clustering concept right so what
happens when you want to define the
darker swarm you of course you don't
have to install anything for darker
swarm the moment is store docker engine
with the newer version or darker the
farm is automatically available
previously you got to run some machine
and all those things but not anymore
but it's still you got to define that
this specific machine is my darker form
how do you know so you initialize a
specific machine which you want to sales
darker form as darker sharp in it and
once you do that you get a token so
whatever machine you want to participate
as a part of this swarm cluster you
would run that command and also taking
automate all those kind of things and
you could certainly go ahead and have a
whole clustered environment available to
you so let's say refresh this one so I
can quickly show you guys so once you
define any darker machine anymore any
machine or the Dockers for manager you
get certain commands automatically get
enabled for you darker node LS so what
it you can run only in this command of
leader actually so I am running this
command which tells you you know what I
have got these three machines which is
participating in my darkest part
clustering so as you can see here I have
got manager instance and the star means
this is the leader instance right and I
got two worker node here and the worker
nodes are I am going to show the worker
node as well where I am running my
services so what happens I got this
image next-gen and I just hang on for a
minute I'm going to show you that
specific thing this is specific image
what I am running this image I created I
push it to docker hub repository but
when I want to run this thing I will
simply run my
darker service commands of water darker
service does so let us say I define the
farm manager I hired the worker node
when I run darker service create and I
give the image and I say what board you
have to publish it will automatically
spin up the containers across different
worker nodes what I might have defined
it as if a part of my configuration by
default the farm manager also act as a
worker node but you can do the setting
and you can say you know what I don't
want this to be a part of the work on
node actually so as you can see this
service is already running on this one
and I just ran command on this machine
and once I ran command on this machine I
was able to see if I went darker peers
and darker Pearce's docker has not a
command but the few popular come on like
build and push and all those you have
seen docker PS is the command which
tells you what all the containers are
running on this one and what image is
running over here and as you see acted
like three four days back actually and
if I go ahead and look into one of my
birth or node which is this one and as
you can see okay quickly restarted I did
not run the docker run command I ran the
darker service come on a farm manager it
pushed up images automatically to other
containers and if I add any new
container or new worker node to my
docker file automatically that image
will be published or with it without me
doing anything it all provides the
scalability and all those aspects so now
I have my application up and running so
let's see something this application
what I have been talking for a long time
and I believe some of you might be
waiting what this application is
actually so this application is the next
generation e-commerce application and if
you see at the ecommerce application
first of all the top dealers Oracle free
cloud credits I believe most of you
might have signed but if not please go
and sign it is a top deal in my
ecommerce platform actually and what it
has it has a such functionality it has
the order status and of course I if I
search for it
I search for a product I should be able
to order it so let us say and the way it
is working when I type something I will
see what all the parts are available and
this is being pulled from a MongoDB
database what I've been talking behind
the scenes so let's say I want to buy a
MacBook Air and I see this product so I
see the listing of it so think about
this could be a one set of services
which might be running in docker
container and you will pull the data out
of it
and then once we pull it data out of it
I say ok kill con by item so think about
my search functionality could be using
the MongoDB or any no sequel database
for example or attorney sequel a MongoDB
whatever it is but the payment I might
be post-processing through a relational
database I might be using some Java or
some different type of language so I
could have a different technology stash
for my payment processes and I see all
these values coming over there my order
status could be coming from a different
service it could be cached into my
caching engine could be Redis or
currents or whatever I might be using
this customer services of course this
application you can see there are many
components to it and when you talk about
micro services you can completely
decoupled these components don't call
this phone number call it my sending
email to my email address if you want to
buy something here and then I have all
these customer services though different
frameworks or architecture and
everything I made I want to have
flexibility right and about the denial I
said this is all running on Oracle
bare-metal cloud services the whole idea
is you can see there are three four
functionalities but in the real world
application you might have a forum you
might have a rating for a product and
there are certain products fit for a
purpose it occurs no technology or tool
is perfect there are great things and
there are some shortcomings for which we
try to use different technologies but
exceed if we start thinking in terms of
distributed architecture which is not
really phenomena but with micro services
we talk a lot and not on that how you
can decouple and have different
components of your applications up and
running actually and like I got a few
only few hand served about micro
services
my talk about the enterprises right I
talk to all these fortune 500 companies
and say okay what exactly you're doing
microservices the first thing is oh we
are all into micro services but then
silk it very exactly you are here we are
thinking on it but my philosophy is okay
pick up a project where we can start
decoupling and start thinking how can I
build a application using micro services
architecture and make sure all these
service discovery governance and
everything is following in place any
question so far so in this demo it's
only the dots of what you see in the
service aspect is when I define the
darker form right
I had the different containers running
over there but when you start building
your actual services which might have
already appears and all those things you
will use something like Apache zookeeper
and everything for service discovery and
making sure so think about this right
the whole idea about micros original
container is I spin up something it can
be destroyed my URL and my API may
change the typical world I will just go
and hard-coded but with all these tools
such as Apache zookeeper even if you
change behind the scene where your
containers are running at least your
calling system will not be impacted
actually that's the whole idea
dr. hobbies' the jeebies right right so
when you talk about darker right so the
first thing I would like a word of
advice and what I have seen is people
think that darker a container is answer
to everything
so the real place where you should start
with containers and stateless
applications so when I talk about data
right so what my container has only a
piece of code but let's say if you are
running a MongoDB database or Oracle
database or any database for that matter
you should not be putting that in the
darker it you may want to use for
example virtual machine for that of
course the other is only four years old
but the real use case is what I see for
a stateless application in my case to
answer your specific question it has a
piece of code and necessary libraries it
should be few MB it should not be like
GB than GB which is the VM way and of
course that is why this complication
yeah so think about a stateless
application if you have think darkus for
a stateless application a stateful
application till the time you get a good
use case and we have a solid foundation
for this thing I would still go with the
BMV that's where the V ends are not that
bad but containers are the new way of
doing things actually
so let's say I build an application
using Java right or this one is
specifically node.js so no J's for
MongoDB to write the libraries so I will
import the libraries I will have the
libraries
let's put put the call container yeah
right you know so one way to example
right let's say we Java JDBC that that
was my background a long time back and I
still use it right so the library
version keeps on changing so let's say
my application using JDBC version 3.1
just take an example and I build a new
application the new application comes
JDBC version 4.1 I start building the
application and I give it to my Ops guys
that my application doesn't work because
now the JDBC 4.1 is running on the VM or
wherever it is but my application on my
coordinate JDBC 3.1 so I will put all
these dependent libraries and everything
within the container itself so that
there is no breakage actually so now
coming back to the point of four we have
seen so far how you can build a hello
world application you saw it this Asha
trip flash or a code event you can
quickly go and a downloaded image start
playing with there there are four or
five steps I believe these slides will
be available to you guys and you should
try it ordered once you start playing
with the hello world you can take it to
the next level that is how I learn that
is why how I started this point to my
good customers actually when there are
these kind of questions right so now
coming down to we have seen how you can
run the docker container bare metal plug
everybody may not be similar with the
command line aspect of it obvious in the
first aspect where you have
infrastructure a service do-it-yourself
container I got the farm and all those
things so as Oracle we offered also
offer a container cloud service so when
you sign up for trial account it
provides you a nice UI and you can
quickly define the container you can
also download something from public
repository just to get a feel of it what
it does how it works and once we start
answering those questions you can let me
start appreciating darker write what it
can do to your organization how it can
help you and reduce the friction between
your up
patience team and development team other
aspect is of course - you're managing
the container you are building and all
those things however if we talk about
the most popular languages right such as
nor J's Java PHP we also offer
application container cloud services so
in that way you don't even worry about
any container you just focus on your
code how can I build a simpler complex
for based on what requirement you have
for the code you focus on your code you
push your code and all those scaling and
managing of environment it's completely
taken by this service which is available
behind the thing to do the docker
but it's available as a part of Oracle
cloud so you can run the infrastructure
if you are running anything if you have
multi vendor or multi cloud strategy
they can go with this approach or if you
are just starting on this journey you
can try one of these options as well to
get more and more family run this thing
any questions on these services
specifically actually I know you might
have seen some sessions so now we talked
about why containers are hot now we are
back to where we started right
flexibility you start with the cloud
provider a or you start with the private
cloud at one point of time you may want
to minimize your risk you may want to
reduce dependency on vendor I was
talking to one of the large bank last
week and they said I whatever solution
you recommend me I want to go with the
multi vendor strategy I want to make
sure I am NOT building the same
monolithic application I am whatever I
do should be scalable not only to Oracle
but a different cloud provider so the
first answer was okay note there are
ways available but container is
typically the most popular way and cloud
is all about choices right you may want
to have it in the private cloud public
lots all about flexibility choices to
the customer and container if you think
about the container you can certainly do
that ice cream flavors decoupling so we
have seen the application which was
designing the e-commerce application I
had different components whether it is
searching for an item so think about
this right if you are a retail customer
not many of you may be or some of you
may be I may have a dip
and requirement for each functionality
or the application so on a Thanksgiving
Day or fairy tale application or maybe
month end data and banking customer
right there are certain parts of the
applications used widely and used
heavily and that requires that puts a
strain on the system but if I have a
decoupled architecture I may have a
twenty containers running for such
functionality or a specific badge or
what I might be doing but for other
starters and their forums you know what
I don't want to keep that from customers
right now let it suffer a little bit but
search and payments should work it
smoothly so be coupling application like
vanilla you like butterscotch or node.js
Java whatever you can choose right
technologies for the right purpose and
do that and time to market no matter
what we do when we develop some
applications at the end if it is like we
heard in the Greek tragedy right done
means released I may be a developer I
build something it's cool up and running
in my laptop or you attea environment
but if it is not to the end-user how
would I do that
so think about one benefit of docker is
let's say you are building some sort of
a website have you guys talked about the
a/b testing so in a be testing I just
got one nod maybe just the a/b testing
what it does let's say I building a
customer facing applications where I
want to change the background of the
application or color of the application
how would I know that changing this is
this background will turn into more
Deveny because people like this color or
with containers I can spin up a
container with new words and with new
image and use my load balancer I can
route certain requests going to the new
depth look and feel of my website and if
it goes well I can route more traffic if
not I can destroy and say thank you very
much so quickly checking making sure and
deleting the values so these are the
there are many more benefits but if
you'd summarize it flexibility
decoupling and time to market and
stateless application could be the first
way to get started using this container
mechanism and all those benefits what
people talk about the container seeing
is believing
trying is figuring it out how it works
in your environment and using
applications actually
any question find it in thing that you
want to touch upon again we got few
minutes so I think we have about 5-10
minutes so the reason is lot of
applications which are built in the
enterprise especially large enterprises
where they are monolithic applications
and they have been running for years and
years and people are afraid to change it
number one number two when they start
looking at this applications the first
approach is how can I reach after the
existing application and when you are
going from monolithic to micro services
it is not refactoring you may have to
really take certain components of it and
you may have to think in new ways that
design application is all about start
seeing the value and the benefits of it
actually any other question
so so we have like Oracle content or
cloud services which is more of a
managed services behind the scene we do
use those components and they are
abstracted away from you but if you are
let's say running this container for
infrastructure you may have to think
about what orchestration tool you want
to use so you have the opportunity to do
so like there are options available with
our infrastructure managed container or
the application container where you
don't worry about anything
you just focus on your code actually and
start doing it I would say yes but a lot
of people are not even using node.js for
example and node.js is one of the hot
language I keep on hearing from people
right so you can try it out and put in
the application container cloud service
and see whether it works for you or not
and then you can decide where you won't
take it from there content
yeah please sign up and try it out any
other question from anyone there are
customers using our infrastructure our
platform as a service and they are using
those tools and technologies and the lot
many customers I am working with who are
already either in the journey or they
are doing some sort of pilot with us
right now
but there are customers using the
service the other infrastructure and all
those what you saw they are already some
of them are there actually but if you
are specifically container perspective I
have to check on that but at the
capabilities of the cloud platform there
are several customers I personally
support they go and of course the bigger
co system there are many customers
running production load on the Oracle
cloud which I don't think that some of
them are but I need to specifically
check what when is the container whether
you mean the container on the bare metal
or container on the there are customers
who are products
I have to check but there are customers
I am working with outing pilot on that
one but bare-metal not no orchestration
tool when you say right so when you say
Oracle container cloud service you will
just define your images all the tooling
and everything is done behind the scene
by Oracle that will that is a part of it
application actually so when I design
the application cloud provides you the
solid infrastructure or domains that is
a part of your application actually and
you can expose those interfaces the API
cloud services for example right you can
expose those interfaces in the API cloud
service so that developer in your team
organization can go and discover those
services but it will the responsibility
of the customer because II don't know
some may be using PayPal some may be
using Amex or visa or whatever it is
that will be up to the business or the
enterprise's to use this little
you can you tell me where the one of the
key note on that one actually the API
clock said with this morning any other
