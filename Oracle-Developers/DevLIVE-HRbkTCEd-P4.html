developer community here at open world
2017 and I'm here with rural Hartmann
he's the director of Apex consulting and
he gave two awesome talks this week at
open world and today we're gonna get a
preview of his one on APEC mm-hmm take
it away
okay Thank You Melissa yes what I play
with me yes indeed I did two
presentations one on Sunday and one on
Monday the Monday one was about docker
called docker for dummies and apparently
there were a lot of dummies because the
room was packed the Monday one one was
about apex ten or forget
and those are two cool technologies of
Oracle and I was exploring a way out to
combine those two things
Oracle Jets are already exposed in Apex
but it's just a limited set of charts
and there are way more elements within
jet available that you could use if you
know just know how to do it and
initially that looks very complicated
but if you after a while you dive in a
little bit deeper it's not that hard at
all I wouldn't say easy but it's easier
than I thought before and it all starts
with reading documentation the
documentation of jet is very wide
there's a lot of stuff going on and a
lot of stuff that's not relevant when
you're using it in Apex so if you find
your way around so one of the things
that's not available on apex and is it
one of the jet components is something
like a pixel graph image like this
now usually it's so many people do have
no sleep and or other problems or
whatever it's just a graphical way of
showing stuff so what I did is creating
an plugin in Apex plugin is a way to
extend standard epic stuff with your own
custom components so if you're going to
application builder itself of Apex
can navigate to shared components and
plugins and we get a nice little error
again usually happen but this is a shout
out to people who run a favorite
oracle.com but the server playing on
great time etcetera great pressure so
instead in this plugins department you
can define a couple of building blocks
for creating your Africa your plugin in
fact there are usually three things one
is a piece of Pele sequel and the piece
of Pele sigil you used to define the
HTML that should be put out on the
screen and the second part is some
JavaScript use it as a helper function
and the JavaScript part is the link
between apex and yet and we can try
again if you see something right now
hopefully let's keep our fingers crossed
when I hated that one alice is doing it
again but
so it's keeping it up this way so it's
very consistent now in is giving me an
error so what else we could do right
there in there it's because in Jettas
exposed all elements with the sort of
helper functions and the input of those
film initializer functions is just a
piece of Jason Jason string depending on
the object you're using it's a different
piece of Jason and what we can do easily
from sequel feel sequel is generalize
and those parts we just linking together
in a plugin so we got a I did a nice
little demo about that on the patient
but unfortunately it doesn't run right
now in this project we are back now yes
we could try once more go into the
plug-in here we are so I see you see I
got a couple of plugins right here right
here
one of them is this piktochart element
and you scroll down here you can see it
is a little bit of oops let's goes the
wrong way we scroll down here you see
this little bit of sequel stop this down
a little bit
so we've got one block of little seagull
that you can see the screen right now is
a render function putting out HTML and
there but the just this is spitting out
divs and adding running one piece of
JavaScript calling the jet picture in it
so this is very simple block of Bill
sequel the second block of field sequel
is the Ajax function the function that
gets the data and creates adjacent
objects so that part that it's in fact
it's just a few lines of field sequel
again we're creating a respirator and
Rutger is the sequel that enters by a
developer to get the data out of the
database and with the apex Jason
function that are provided with an apex
we don't have too many manually create
the adjacent string it's great as forest
so this is all we need on that side
that we scroll down a bit dressed
JavaScript functions now piktochart ojs
in downloaded we could download we could
download it we could download it if we
as we had it should look like this and
what so what's in there is just one call
to and a jet component and get the ships
with a pack so you don't have to install
anything everything is already there did
you upload your slides to your blog or
anywhere where people can kind of get an
overview of the session all the steps
that I described right here that's
everything should be working but it's
just technical difficulties here all the
steps that I've written down in a couple
of blog posts on my on my blog and of
course everything is also written down
in the slides that will be available
later on from Oracle OpenWorld did you
want to give a quick overview of your
docker presentation or is that also
available on your blog if anyone wants
to take it did Ducker presentations not
available on my blog because of you most
of data is just live demo to show the
people what opera is about and how fast
it is and how easy it is to to use it
and you feel like talking about that
exactly I'm doing the docker
presentation a couple of times later
this year in a little polar events so we
have to come to Europe get do you know
what events you're scheduled for
I'm scheduled for Slovenia Croatia then
Germany delica and then the UK oeg so I
still got four events to go this year
is there any Twitter handle or specific
blog you'd like to shout out for people
to follow you you can follow me on
Twitter on the RO elh the rule ha that's
my twitter handle and blog you can find
my blog URL if you're looking at it with
a random I can share one more thing
which is a little add look at the shout
out
I'm running for the OD tag board of
directors right now so there's a voting
going on right now next two to three
weeks so I invite everyone who is a
member of auditor to vote for me thanks
for the opportunity okay enjoy the rest
of Oracle I will thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
