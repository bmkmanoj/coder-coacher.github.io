in performing the doctor workshop what
I'm going to walk you through in this
video is how to get your environment set
up really quickly so you can get up and
running with lab 100 so for starters
please note I'm at the base URL here and
github for library what I'm going to do
is actually hit f11 here so you can see
the screen full and scroll down this
page to our student guide click on our
student guide and this will open it up
the guide over here now there are a
couple options in this guy but today I'm
on a Windows 10 laptop and what I want
to do is keep my laptop intact so I'm
just gonna go with the VirtualBox setup
steps probably the easiest way to get up
and running and get this lab going so
first of all some hardware requirements
you'll need 20 gig of free storage in 8
gig of ram and the first thing we're
going to do on this computer is go out
there and grab a VirtualBox so let me
just go ahead and open this in a new tab
and a mouse up here and I'm going to go
over to our Windows host right here and
I'm going to download the executable for
this particular
install this version and then I've got a
workshop drive I'm gonna put it on I'm
just gonna create a new folder here
that'll be docker hol
so let's go ahead and drop that into the
lab folder now while that is downloading
it should be downloaded pretty quick I'm
gonna go ahead and open that folder in
Windows Explorer so that we can perform
the install so we're gonna go down to
workshops docker hol it's almost done
there we go one second the install is
complete so now I'm able to go out here
and just double click on the Exe I'm
gonna leave all the defaults here as
well as the default location click Next
it will blip your network temporarily
when you install it but just for just
for a fraction of a second so it next
and then I'll do install ok when the
install completes you'll see a screen
like this and you'll also see in the
background it will open up a blank VM
VirtualBox console just like you see
here now what you're going to want to do
is go back to your lab guide now and
you're gonna mount a mouse down and
click on this link here to open the
location of the VirtualBox OVA alright
and here we see a page like this with
our docker workshop OVA s what we're
gonna want to do is for each of these
files go ahead and click the download
button and we're gonna save this to the
same directory we put our other files in
so we'll go down here to docker hol and
go ahead and click Save alright now this
will take some time to download the
parent network speed but you can go
ahead and minimize this window wide
downloads and we'll just come back as
soon as this download completes ok it
looks like our download just completed
so we'll go back out here now we're
going to mouse up to our workshop ova1
file if we don't have 7-zip you'll
you'll want to use that to extract but
we're gonna go ahead since we have 7-zip
and extract the files here
okay as you can see it took about two
minutes for me to extract this we'll go
ahead and hit close now if you didn't
have 7-zip this is the link in the
instructions and you can see all the
steps I'm doing here in the video so now
that we've got VirtualBox installed and
we've got our files extracted for the
VirtualBox image what we need to do is
go back Cal so what we need to do is go
back out to our OVA and you're gonna
find this file that's called OVF right
here just double click it okay when you
double click it sometimes this window
pops up behind but you'll see in your
VirtualBox manager here you've got your
appliance all ready to import so I'm
gonna go ahead here and click the import
button and once again this will take a
couple a couple minutes to extract and
run and you should see the extraction
running here okay once our import
completes you'll see your docker
workshop is over here we're ready to
just hit the start button and in a
couple minutes we'll have everything we
need to begin with lab 100 it'll take a
second for a VM to power on but as soon
as you see this screen you're all set to
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
