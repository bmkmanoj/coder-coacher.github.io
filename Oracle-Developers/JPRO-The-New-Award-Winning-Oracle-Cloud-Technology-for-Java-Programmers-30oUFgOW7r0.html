talk about J Pro today and what is J Pro
probably not known to any of you because
it's a very new product it's was shown
for the first time at JavaOne in
September in San Francisco and was
awarded so people seem to like it so but
we have not really launched it yet so
it's not freely available for four users
we are in a better test phase still so
you can if you're interested you can be
a part of the better testing but it's
not quite finished yet so what is J Pro
it to bring to the point it makes Java
and in the browser without any plug-in
of course so it's I would say that
that's more or less the last piece of
the ecosystem which the market has been
really asking for because the mobile is
pretty well covered now with the Java
not from us but from some other
companies in the community and now when
it runs in the browser you can basically
run one piece of software one single
source on I would say any platform you
can run it on desktops you can run it on
on mobile platforms Android iOS and you
can run it on most browsers and it runs
in the cloud in the Oracle cloud as well
so so just a statement from our web page
where we present some samples and so on
how do we do this we basically take the
so called scene graph and map it to the
different end devices normally that is
the way to be use it for the browsers
and for the other native platforms we
normally run it natively but it could
also be done there which I come back to
so
here is one example which which I just
want to show to you
no loud speaker so it's not a big show
but this is a Java code all written in
Java it uses the media player you can
adjust different sounds and so so not a
very very special media player it is not
something rocket science but it runs the
Java that is should be new to most yeah
that's new to everyone okay so let me
introduce I don't think I need do I need
the mic for any recording or something
okay foreign key my our CTO and myself
from Jay Pro technologies AG in Germany
in Munich and we will try to give you an
introduction to Jay Pro which at least
gives you enough to be able to evaluate
whether it is an interesting technology
for you we are actually being a bit
crazy and saying you should use Java
instead of or at least as an alternative
to HTML Javascript which is a pretty
tough statement I know that but but we
have proven that for many use cases it
backs it makes a lot of sense and you
can also mix it as you like you can
embed Java components into existing HTML
pages and mix it with angular or
whatever type product you're just using
so it's up to you to use usage for the
entire app or for a web page or as you
used to do with flash and and applets
and zone in the past but here of course
you don't need any plugins so we just
picked
some from our own some samples here from
our own that page for you to have a very
quick glance at you can also see from
our webpage which I will give you the
link of later on here is a is an example
of I will just make it a little bit
bigger so this is an example of an
application which has been out there for
a while it's a calendar application the
planning tool is an OEM product which is
being used on different CRM systems
especially in Germany at least some TV
stations are using it and so this was
actually port not ported at all and or
adapted at all they what you see here is
this product without any change running
now in the browser so it doesn't really
have any data so it doesn't look so
extremely interesting but that is an
example of so to speak a classical
desktop application then we have a
prototype or a proof-of-concept or a
fashion shop here with a glass classical
look and feel for a fashion shop where
you can pick your different products and
you can look at whatever you want to buy
you can go into the details when you
come to when you go into our webpage and
look at those samples you can of course
play them in detail I just want to give
you an overview here so here's a game
which I'm sure you've seen before
so this is just to show you that you can
also create games not highly 3d advanced
shading games admittedly that Jo will
not be the good candidate for that right
now but for many of the games out there
you can have a platform which makes it
easy to create games here's another
another classical webpage which a
partner company of ours had been
implementing in JavaScript HTML and they
just made this to show that we could
also you can create this kind of web
page Lucan filled with standard Java by
the way I'm I'm always saying Java
I need a Java platform because many of
those samples out there are written in
other languages JVM based languages like
Scala and groovy and Kotlin all those
work as well so we are talk about the
Java platform the JVM and we say it
works with Java okay you can go back to
this is just a link to our web page for
you to see where you can go in and have
a more careful look this is our
presentation page for for Jaipur right
now just to show you you can write down
the link April dot IO and here you see a
list of different samples some of them
are very small snippets some of them are
a little bit bigger applications and you
also have a scene builder in there which
I didn't show to you now which is a UI
tool to create user interfaces so
there's pretty much you can have a look
at to study if you're interested so
okay so what was the motivation for us
to do this work because many people
think of it crazy everyone is supposed
to use JavaScript HTML today now is
angular or node or react or whatever
cold the average life cycle of those
products is reporting to the garden
group two years so you finish one
product a one project and very often you
will face a totally different technology
stacked for the next project so this
world is not ideal we thought and what
is pretty much given today is a Java on
the backend and the market amount is
nowadays it must run basically
everywhere the market requires a
solution to run at least Windows and Mac
OS and you have the Android and iOS
almost as a as a as it goes without
saying today that it must run and also
on Windows Mobile maybe and then you
have all the browsers you have the
desktop browsers at least was for and
you have all the mobile browsers they
even more out there on the mobile
devices and they have on the desktops
and then there are all the different
versions of all these browsers on each
platform so if you are serious of the
developer today that really wants to
create quality software you need a Kawai
workflow which covers I would say 20
browser is not exaggerated if you take
into account that the Safari on a let's
say Chrome on a desktop is not the same
as a chrome on Android on there
on mobile device so and then you have
all the different versions and the
market is moving into cloud I mean it's
not just hype that's where it goes more
and more solutions are moving into the
cloud which fits our architecture
perfectly and then I just heard I happen
to be a Norwegian and I just heard that
a Norwegian state telecom company is
planning in 2019 to implement 5g they
are running its foot test page right now
and I claim it's going to be a hundred
times faster than what we have today
this is a powerful statement and I plan
to what they okay there are the
marketing people but they say doctors
will be able to make remote surgeries in
real time before 2020 so bandwidth and
latency and those kind papac's are
moving in the right direction very fast
so if we look at the current situation
today we have as we said we have job on
the background on the back end very very
often when it's almost can't say always
but but it's very very often then you
have the desktops which are covered
pretty well with java technology or very
well i would say then you have the
mobile which today is being covered with
a set of different frameworks some of
them are listed on the left side here
it's a very very fragmented world and as
i said it is very dynamic average of two
years you need to change your
technology stack drastically and that
has big impacts also on quality
obviously nobody wants to invest a lot
of maintenance in the system which is
based on legacy technology and it also
has a very big impact on your own your
teens of course and on development
process itself you have all those teams
you really need a five to six different
teams today if you really want to create
software for all those platforms and
that is what the market is demanding so
then the sharing of the resource is very
difficult because you have totally
different technologies for the different
platforms so it's not an optimal world
so what we did a couple of years ago was
to say we do not agree that this world
is optimal and let's try to think about
what the ideal world could be and we
thought what if you can have one
language development language on one
platform and one technology for all
those platforms so that's what we of
course we are not objective but we see
as the green solution so how does this
look we don't want all these
technologies out there so I took that
away Java on the backend yes char on the
desktop Java on the mobile one single
source for all those platforms Android
iOS and Windows is not available today
admittedly on the technology we are
talking about but it could be done
anytime if windows will start catching
up again the desktop browsers all those
different browsers all those different
versions we would like to see that
different
you would like to see that there is one
browser to program against one browser
which is acting as a general browser for
all those different browsers that we
have to actually deal with and you can
run in the cloud we can have the apps
really running in the cloud if we wanted
all those updating issues are covered
very very well and you can have
distributed servers around the world if
you have a worldwide product you can
have them set up worldwide or you can
have it served worldwide so that you
minimize the latency so application
level was conveyed relate to one browser
instead of as we said 20 the individual
problems of the different browsers is
taken care of by je pro multiply the
application itself not by the
application programmers the application
program has one set browser to the
working games on define browser and the
entire application including the app
business logic even the presentation
layer can be hosted in the cloud so you
have no IP is being disclosed you have
everything running in the cloud you just
have the Jai Pro renderer taking care of
the presentation layer for the
application so with this setup we
actually have a true wara in in place
which is something we have been dreaming
about for for many years at least I have
you have one single source deploying to
all the platforms desktops mobile and
browsers
I haven't even mentioned IOT IOT is a
actually not a difficult case in this
architecture IOT is colored just as
mobile or desktops are the the RA RM
support is absolutely given and we are
also having samples running on the
Raspberry Pi for instance and and so IAT
is a very good candidate for this
architecture also because you have small
devices with little power that maybe
want to run very sometimes heavy
applications and then you scale it on
the server instead of scaling it on a
device which is not really very powerful
so
and now Jay Pro comes into play this is
the prosper from technology which would
work for all platforms
boost on in different projects in in
Germany because we are located in
Germany and this quiz max was it is
small simplification it's a quiz
application the customer came to us and
said I want to create a quiz app and I
need it for Android and iOS so we said
okay fine we can do the single source so
you you save a lot of costs and by the
way it runs in the browser and the
desktop as well so it was pretty happy
and now this is being rolled out and we
can just give you a small introduction
to what it does just for you to get an
impression so then we need to switch the
cable or now we don't need to ok we can
we can actually use the link yeah okay
so here we see a good good a good
example yeah that's a good idea
blowing up we see a good example of how
we here in bed to clients to one web
page actually and and this one is a good
way of for this customer to show to his
customer I mean this customer of ours to
show to his customers who are the
players for him to show to them how it
looked on all the different devices and
he can instead of having to install the
native app on an iOS device or go to the
App Store and do these formalities and
so on for every every release he can
just show it here in the browser he just
gives his customary link and here you so
to speak has a we have a kind of a
simulation of how it runs in the browser
because in the browser it's a I'm sorry
on the iOS and here in the browser
itself we have a simulation how it runs
on on a desktop or on a browser here so
we here have two different lines being
showed in the webpage and they can now
play against each other they can
challenge challenge each other each
other and so on so the play itself play
itself is is not so interesting right
now I think but this is showing how the
the J Pro can be used to to also show
nightly builds and show versions of all
the software also for demos and so on
through the browser just by providing a
link although in real life those
applications that you see here actually
are being installed natively at the
customer in the end but it's the same
source it's the same looking field it's
the same very using the system so I have
to speed up a little bit you know some
time
sorry
so now I I wanted to tell you a little
bit more in detail about the
architecture to look at the time here
because yeah so the architecture is
built upon the framework of Java ethics
we're using the API from traffics and we
are been we are profiting from or
benefiting from from the fact that Java
ethics covers a lot of platforms as well
it's a very robust and well-defined
interface what we do actually on the
server you take out a lot of things from
from it we fork it and and we take out
all the rendering part so that the cert
water runs on the server is very slim
and of course they don't need certain
things on the server when it runs on a
server that you will need when it runs
on a desktop for instance so this is
what we this is the the core engine of
what we are doing here and as I said
some of the arguments that you should
know about is that it runs for for all
the different JVM based languages it is
pixel perfect as I just mentioned IT
protection because everything runs on
the server there is no JavaScript code
that you can look look at in the in the
browser so if you are a product vendor
sometimes you will welcome this kind of
aspect and of course it can operate
interoperate with all the JavaScript
libraries because you sometimes have a
lot of things in developer that you
would like to use and it runs on the
cloud so here we look at the
architecture the upper part here is
drawing what we call the renderer the
renderer is JavaScript code which is
running it could well in the browser
it's JavaScript code which runs in the
browser and we actually serialize and
deserialize the scene graph from the
server from the Jade
server so and the apps themselves are
represented down on the left side here
they are then actually running in the
server so an overview of the
architecture it looks like this you see
the different renderer for the different
platforms because every platform can
have a renderer and can which is what
you need in order to let it run
centrally so if you want to run it
centrally in a cloud for instance then
you can do that also for desktops and
for for the mobile devices like iOS or
Android and if you create a renderer for
dotnet which is a crazy idea but you
could do that you could create a
renderer for those metal that result
would be that you write Java code which
runs on donut so it's an interesting
architecture but in practice it will
look like this in most cases you would
have a renderer for the browser which is
being downloaded together with the with
the page so you don't really have any
contact with it as a user and also has a
jape role programmer you don't really
deal with the renderer this is a set
technology which always is downloaded
with the with the browser and on the
desktops Android iOS you will run it
natively it would run your program
natively that will be the standard most
common setup
yeah here you basically see but if you
want as I mentioned you could also in
this case on this example it shows a
render on iOS which would mean you could
even have this render being a part of
the iOS browser that means you can use
your iOS device device the same way as
you use a desktop browser that means you
would let the application run in the
server and and use the native browser
for for the rendering part in this case
you will also not have any installation
on your local device so you have the
option you can do it either or normally
you would want to run it natively I
think so then I wanted to mention an
interesting opportunity that this
architecture gives to you as a developer
you can read some some simplifications
in your architecture which are really
relevant here is a classical three-tier
architecture which it shows the clients
communicating with each other
you see these gray lines on the clients
side down to the middle tier that is the
classical way that to two clients will
communicate with each other through the
middle tier and the middle tier would
then establish the contact to the
different services the micro services
rest services or whatever it is but here
with the Jaipur architecture you can
actually get rid of one layer it
simplifies your current solution a lot
so you can you can actually push the the
client tier down to the server to the
application layer layer on the server
and the communication between the
applications then become very very
simple
you utilize the the architecture of of
Jaipur to to make communication between
clients between users collaboration very
very very easy to program and this is
something we wanted to show to you now
in some chat which Florian will will
show to you how we can create in 10
minutes a small chat application ajikko
we need to switch some cables there okay
can everyone read the code the small
hello world application problems an
iconic AK can erect a new application
shaft of the hollow ball and I will show
you how to quickly make it very simple
chat application it's only has about
maybe 30 lines and it's very simple and
shows how we can simplify the
architecture with Schaefer as a
simplification isn't always good but
äj--
it's really good for prototyping and for
a lot of application it's very good I am
our chat application it has a list of
messages which we will define now
so it's a list of strings
and it it has a ListView which which is
based on this list with basically
showing a list and so the Condors a list
view is definite defined by the list of
messages we have defined above and
whenever the list of messages is
changing to list with other updated and
we also have a text field
and when when we press Enter the text we
want to add something to the list of
messages which then automatically
updates a ListView and we also research
the content of the text field to not
contain a string
let's put everything together on the
application
this is now very simple chat application
and I have to run it this shaper to show
you that we can really use it as
multiple users and I also have to make a
mess of messages to be static so it will
be ish when we start the application
multiple times on the server or users
will share the same list of messages
so as you can see the chat is working
with multiple users
let me quickly update how it's looking
because it's currently a little bit ugly
let's search one ambient background
window
doesn't work
now now it should be looking much more
beautiful I have to set the max instead
of sir pref with a night
I'm stupid
yeah now it's working and to round this
up I will upload the application to the
Oracle cloud so everyone can access the
application in the room at least when
you've got decent internet so I've
basically prepared an update script
which uploads the application it will
take a little bit of time
you
yes service
okay that's how to write a simple chat
application it obviously at the tropics
and then you have many users like
thousands of users you can't run
everything on on one server but when you
have a environment with where you know
how many people are using such specific
chat sessions and it's very easy to
write software displays because you
don't have to write code for communicate
in this direction the other direction
you just simply write it down you say
you've got a list of the content and you
update it and you don't have to mess
around with all the complex logic
between the browser and the server arm
yeah
I think we should repeat the question
maybe the question will be in folder for
the recording yeah the way it basically
works is that we we see realize the
scene graph which is being generated in
the server and this scene graph is being
interpreted by JavaScript code which is
our render on the in the browser so the
render in the browser is a JavaScript
code which is being downloaded with the
page and this JavaScript code is
rendering rendering in the browser what
what is the scene graph basically so
these are realizes and renders so but we
have not written it in JavaScript
everything in Scala but but then cross
compile it to JavaScript but that's not
so important
well first of all it's not like a screen
sharing application which sends pixels
and on we are sending objects so we are
sending the object of the same graph and
we only send the death does so so the
bandwidth required is pretty slim
and you will see that when you start
playing with the samples that you might
be surprised how work and well it works
so so yeah so so we actually have had
some some customers testing it for us
they have been comparing it with team
viewers and some other screen sharing
tools and they tell us we have to admit
we are not done much of it ourselves
they tell us that our bandwidth is
requirement is lower and many others in
a typical in a typical way the page
wouldn't refresh you can just country
continuous replication so yeah it
basically you can imagine a desktop
application may or have a login box when
you press login and some new content
appears but it's not reloading you
yeah exactly how it happens it's a so
everything is of course being executed
by JavaScript in the user interface and
then being serialized in the opposite
direction down to the server and and can
transfer it into a Java event knows that
one of the important things that you
don't need any plug it's based only on H
on public web standards so you don't
have to install anything I've got maybe
a small sample which doesn't really talk
take long to show the shape replication
you can easily put it as part of another
application so I've prepared a small
snippet which I can just paste into it
yet as fiddle which is a popular web
page for writing some code and see how
it's looking for us HTML volt and so
snippet basically import some JavaScript
pages it ends our one line of header
which state some chart and send it a
path and bad to cheaper applications and
send when it's loading it's generating
two applications in one existing page so
when you will have our big company web
page you can add shape through as part
of your own web page
we've we have a good very good
relationship with Oracle's if we don't
have a partnership on that level yet so
you would have to go to us but of course
we build up build up a partner Network
and see who those partners will be but
today today well let's say in a short
period of time and they launched at the
beginning it be a direct relationship
with us us meaning jaipur technologies
in munich i didn't really understand
what you mean I'm sorry yeah yeah right
yeah yeah well that's that's what I'd
try to explain a little bit during the
presentation but at cost saving is the
the topic I think and and because you
you you have a very much simpler
technology stack you have a safer future
investment in in Java I mean nobody
believed that Java will
yeah that's this is something we
unfortunately can't change overnight
today and we understand that this is
result thank you
sorry oh yeah yeah I'm sure I'm sure
there are things in that you could do
better in angular than in April
especially today I'm sure there are
things I don't know what it is but that
I'm sure there are but you can also have
a smooth transition you can as Laurieann
just showed you you don't have to have a
complete J Pro webpage or a complete
angular whatever you can you can mix
yeah so if you for example have have
some part of the UI which is for some
reason needs very heavy CPU processing
for instance which you don't want the
browser to do then you can use J Pro for
that and and you can have a strong
server as you want to do the processing
and just have a simple scene graph which
presents the result
no we don't to do anything yeah there is
a problem there of course of course
there are scenarios where it is
beneficial to compute on the on the
client side yes there is but there is
the opposite as well depending on on
what you want to compute you you have a
limit in your in your on your client you
definitely have a limit with this
architecture you never have a limit you
might have a limiting cost but you can
buy you can buy you can have an endless
scaling because you can scale on server
so yeah that's right you can have as
many as you like
theoretically yeah there is no limits of
course in practice would be that we
don't know any yes yes almost no we are
not 100% compliant the the 3d support of
Java ethics is not covered by us we can
mix with OpenGL you can drive OpenGL
from from your J Pro code or Java sex
code whatever but to have a set I
mention in the UI like you can do in the
effects we cannot support it
yes you can you can put it in there as a
part of the application yes yeah yeah
that's the most difficult question for
us because we haven't really been able
to be fine represented with the price
model yet a bit embarrassing but that's
the case and we haven't launched it so
but it's you need to have do it soon but
right now you can test it for free of
course
yeah yeah the the procedure right now
but I will change as I say very very
soon that it will not be as bureaucratic
right now you have to register through
our page which I showed to you and you
would give it then be a part of our
ticket system and you get a license you
can play with it and test it
yeah but that that will be easier very
soon yeah I'm sorry I lost question
otherwise it will be very impolite yeah
to split one yeah yeah yes yeah you mean
reactive yeah yes you can have yeah it's
actually the possibilities you have with
this setup is to have very dynamic user
interfaces very reactive yeah okay then
