technology Network and I'm here at
Oracle code Brussels and I am joined
with one of our speakers Philip Corrine
hey Philip how you doing hi I'm great
it's a really nice event today yes it is
we have had a really good turnout a
little over 300 people in a very very
intriguing space I I keep feeling like
right at 6:01 they're gonna roll out all
of our stuff and the raise is going to
start you know it's very fun not yet
maybe me me yeah maybe maybe later yeah
they need six hours to get all of the
you know all of the lighting just right
and you know yeah well that'd be fun but
today we've got some great sessions
going on you're giving a session you
tell us a little bit about what you're
going to talk about well I'm talking
about monitoring of applications like
pretty much from every possible angle
it's like operating system Network level
but also more specific to Java so we're
going into gem x metrics we're going
into distributed tracing with 15 it's
pretty much all the pieces you might
want to track and trace in your
application how big of an application
can I can I expect to trace effectively
with your methods well today I'm just
demoing kind of like a hello world
application which is probably the best
monitored hello world application that
you can do but in general I don't think
there is really a limit to it like you
just track and trace over as many
service and job applications as you want
and we'll just collect that aggregated
and then visualize it in the end nice
nice so why did you come up with this
approach well I work for elastic the
company behind elastic search lock slash
Cabana B and we do a lot of logging and
monitoring and most of it was very
low-level and was like very focused on
locks but you didn't really get all the
insights that you wanted to have in your
job application it was kind of not
enough and then at some point I figured
out like we have
bits and pieces in place you just need
to kind of put them together in the
right order and that's pretty much what
I've done it's just like configuring a
few things putting in a cloud demoing it
it's just like everything fell into
place like very easily was not that much
work after all so do you use your
application I mean a day in day out oh
yeah yeah sure there's so much data that
you want to track and monitor and also
internally every time we find out that
we didn't track and something at some
point we kind of fade later on and we're
always like yeah we should have like
look more into this and like so not that
you don't really find out when users
start complaining but it's just like
being more proactive and that is kind of
the entire idea like don't wait for
anybody to complain but like find out a
bit earlier yourself exactly well it
seems like this is the kind of
application that it's like you always
say to yourself
in hindsight if only but now you've got
the applications telling you before a
time sight yes that's that's really the
approach everybody should take by now I
think like don't test just or don't let
just use a test and experiment but
really see what what's going on and make
everybody a bit happier right so how do
you as a developer walk this fine line
between listening to what your customers
think they want and you having an idea
of what they would really benefit from
having I I guess conference is a really
a great way for that because you need
meet lots of other customers or
potential customers and users and it's
just like you start off with something
you have an idea you put it out and then
you're kind of waiting for the feedback
of people and just to see what is really
their problem and what they want to
solve and every now and then somebody
will come up up afterwards and tell you
like oh this is really neat then but I
need this other thing and then you can
kind of start building stuff for they
say like oh this solves everything and
then we have like maybe you want to do
this more and then they come up like
yeah that
would be neat it's kind of like we take
one step and then we kind of go out and
see what people want to do it kind of
like one step at a time and you just
keep emerging and getting better at
stuff so this is pretty much the
approach and that's why I conference is
also great
yeah the balance is that's the tough
part striking that good balance because
you know we all know that there are a
lot of technology companies out there
and say here's your product what's your
problem
and you know there needs to be that
that's balanced yeah and it is not
always that easy that you just say okay
this is the solution like sometimes
people need to experiment a bit on their
own and figure out what is right for
them and it's just like you put out the
tools and then you can just see how it
flies basically I have a question for
you what was the first application you
ever wrote I like the first I'm not sure
you could call it an application but we
at school we started off with Google
first column right I'm not that old it's
just like the stuff was pretty outdated
and yes careful yeah yeah some of us
thought that was like it's like it's a
bleeding edge yeah it was bleeding at at
some point but not not when I was in
school anymore I guess
exactly and I guess like everybody I
started doing some simple games so I
gotta know practice and go there or
something like that it was only tech
space but it was that was kind of the
starting point and yeah not the top of a
skull was a bad language but yeah
luckily we have evolved a bit further
since then okay here's another personal
question for you which editor do you
like to use
well I'm using IntelliJ now you are yes
I'm guy that said IntelliJ today
that's a I'm not sure if this is a good
thing or a bad thing with just about you
have a crowd yeah it's a Java crowd yeah
for simple stuff while I prefer like
text editor like sublime or VI but put
Java development this IntelliJ right on
okay okay so I read this very
interesting research report and so as a
result of this research report I can
tell you whether or not you're going to
get a raise next year you want to know
how I'll know how do you know which
browser do you use I'm using Chrome
you're gonna get a raise
well I hope so I always tell my
colleagues according to this research
that people who use Firefox or Chrome
are more than 30% likely to get a
promotion over people who use Safari or
Internet Explorer that's interesting
do you know why why you're expressing
your preference and you are showing the
initiative to go out and download and
keep it updated right and that shines
through everywhere baby right exactly as
opposed to some other people who are
just like they're obsessed by whatever
whatever
oh yeah I just follow along okay it
makes sense you're just not a default
kind of guy tell us where we can find
more about your presentation about you
the team you're working with and some of
the activities you're participating yeah
generally twitter is probably the best
place like for most people to find me
good um so okay you wait a minute though
the weirdest Twitter handle I've ever
seen what is with the Twitter handle me
yeah so the Twitter handle comes from my
last name which is cran kre mm right and
if you rotate those letters by 13 you
get to my twitter handle which is Sierra
which is X er double-a and the nice
thing about rot13 is that kind of like
if you rotate it again you get back to
the original one so you don't have like
what decryption encryption you have the
same thing and when you use in the
beginning of the internet quite a lot to
kind of hide messages it's not really a
good encryption algorithm but for my
Twitter handle it was perfect
I think that's very cool benefit I just
came up with something that had the word
Oracle in it that wasn't taken already
but I like your approach I might I might
be evolving my twitter handle comes with
me anyway well thank you it was so great
talking to you my pleasure all right
take care and we'll be back later thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
