Oracle OpenWorld 2017 I'm Bob Brevard
with the Oracle developer community and
my guest for this segment is Helen Hill
School Howe she's an Oracle ace director
Haley told the folks at home what you do
and where you do it what do I do
that's a good question so I run a
company called miracles inland it's a
consulting company small one I do my PhD
at the University of Helsinki I'm
working on that and my research is
related also to machine learning which
is a topic we are talking about today
indeed yeah and I'm also an ace director
or plays director and ambassador for
amia user groups so I have several hats
to wear so depending who I talk to and
speaking of those different hats now you
actually you were involved in three
sessions here at open world before we
get to the one on machine learning
briefly described the other two session
the first one was about private cloud on
Anjanette systems we were talking about
my customer with my customer about their
access exudate us and they OPC ace and
at the moment they are upgrading the exa
data's and I'm actually the project
manager manager for that progenitor so
we were telling people how the project
is going on and we were explaining that
we actually have the gateway servers of
latinum support built on the OPC a
because we didn't didn't want to have
any more machines and they data center
so we decided we will put it on the OPC
a so it's quite an interesting story
interesting and what makes it even
special that this customer they have all
their databases data warehousing just
the operational database is everything
on those exudate us and it's working
perfectly great nice story on Monday I
was talking about database design which
is of course one of my favorite topics I
wrote the book 2015 about database
designing with or acoustical developer
data modeler and that was about the
topic on Monday I was also talking about
JSON data guide on Sunday
a short five minute talk okay because I
think people are not familiar with it it
came on 12 - it's a very interesting
functionality in Oracle database so I
gave about five minutes a quick overview
what it is and how you can use it and
then I also had a Victoire women in
technology talk on Sunday right yeah
that was I was given a topic how to
raise the next generation developers I
have two sons the elder one was studying
computer science at the moment so I was
and how old is your eldest son almost 21
I know they grow fast
they come so fast I don't get any any
older about the kids we could we could
stop that yeah I think I think we can
machine learning is it's a term that is
in the industry press and in general
press quite a bit but what are we
actually talking about when we talk
about machine learning that's a good
question everybody has their own
opinions so to me machine learning means
like when we are learning we learn by
experience so we we make mistakes and we
learn and so on and that's how human
beings to learn but machines learns with
algorithms so machine learning is a lot
about algorithms and there's a lot of
terminology around machine learning and
in my talk I try to explain those terms
the terminology how things are related
to each other and what kind of things
there are in machine learning because
machine learning is a very broad area it
sounds like a very narrow niche thing
yeah it's actually a broad area so it
needs different kind of skills and
depending on your skills you might find
your position from there now there are I
know from reading the abstract to your
session there are several different
models in machine learning how do you
know which model is right for a
particular project and how do you know
which algorithm and so on and so on so
all this is about what you are trying to
achieve and it all starts with the data
this sounds very stupid but you can't do
machine learning without data so it all
starts with that I
trying to build a demo with crappy data
ended up with no demo so it really
starts with the data you have to have
data so depending what kind of data you
have either you already know what's
inside it you know like the columns in
the relational where we call columns you
know what the data is about then you can
use certain things or you have data you
don't know anything about then you have
to use other kind of things for the
machine to kind of interpret for you
what possibly could be in the data so
depending what kind of data you have and
what you are trying to achieve with the
data you select different routes
different paths and sometimes quite
often if you don't know the data you
first use the one path to find that kind
of knowledge from the data and then you
use another path to use that knowledge
so depending what kind of data on what
you are doing but I think this already
explains that there are so many things
that nobody can say that I can't do
machine learning of course not the whole
thing may be right back something in
machine learning and the use cases for
machine learning are just there's no
limit Wow it can be anything from fraud
detection to predicting how should I put
my shelves in the store and this kind of
things do this all the way to world
domination oh yeah you and I were
talking yesterday and and you mentioned
something that I found very interesting
and very funny and I'll let you kind of
set it up but but you described a
particular factor a particular aspect
that is indeed a Mis misconception about
machine learning then you think is
scaring people off from taking advantage
of the opportunities that machine
learning presents talk about that yeah
that's math mathematics so that's the
scary part so people think of course
it's algorithms algorithms are math but
people think that's all and I should be
some kind of machine ears to be able to
do
this kind of computer science anything
to do with machine learning because it's
algorithms but that's that's really not
true there's so many other things than
just math but I think it's from the
school system people are like thinking
math is too difficult for me it's just I
don't get it I see it often I have given
this presentation a couple of times at
the Oracle code events already and after
the session every time couple of people
come to me and say oh I was relieved
I said why because I was very afraid you
will just talk about math and I won't
get anything and I will be just stupid
in the audience everybody else will
understand and you're just you know
explaining math things so no it's about
many many other things too and
understanding all the algorithms to the
details is definitely not worth it
so when you find the right algorithm for
your purpose then is of course good to
understand what the algorithm is doing
sometimes even not sometimes it's enough
to know the algorithm will do the job
sometimes you want to understand the
details depending what you want to
achieve in my presentation I will talk
about very briefly about metrics so
depending what kind of metrics you want
to have for your machine learning like
do you want to understand what the
computer is doing is that a metric for
you so this kind of things will affect
that too so if you don't care you just
want to have results you don't have to
know anything about math but I really
find it funny people are so scared of
math I think it's the schooling system
that scares us well it's like we talked
about yesterday you have to know math in
order to pay your taxes yes exactly and
when you go to sales you have to know
how much it actually cost is it really a
cheap price or not yes they use these
tricks they just put 50% discount but
the price is actually the same it was
yesterday they just raised the price
you're supposed to take that on faith
and go ahead and buy the thing that
concerns about math aside what what
advice would you give to developers that
that want to get involved in machine
learning what what first steps would you
recommend I would say that you are
probably specialized on one technology
whatever it is one programming language
one tool whatever you start and start
with that and if you want to have just
the whole picture let's say the data
mining side of it
sequel developer it has this data miner
integrated in a tool use that then you
can just draw a picture you know how
things move what algorithm what model
and so on and you will just see what
happens so if you don't want to use a
particular programming language you can
use sickle developer and understand how
the flow goes that's I think for me
single developer was the easiest thing
to start with okay but if you are using
particular programming language you have
libraries that will have those
algorithms try them see what happens if
you use those libraries what will happen
with your data that's the way to learn
so I think having real practice with
real data will give you the insight into
machine learning and then you are not
scared anymore because it it becomes
concrete are you presenting anywhere
else after open world is there anything
on your calendar coming up this fall are
you talking I get home I stay there for
a week then I go to Slovenia then I go
to Croatia then I will go to Denmark
Sweden Norway Finland then what's next
Morocco devoxx Morocco okay German use a
group you can use a group I think that's
about this year racking up those
frequent flyer miles oh yeah that's not
seen him already and if you can't make
any of those public appearances you can
you can connect with Haley on Twitter @
@l e from finland and give a blog yes
helene from salon.com
kelly from finland calm and another URL
you should remember is developer
oracle.com you'll find all south of
arsal trip great content for developers
on
gene learning and microservices and chat
BOTS and a ton of other stuff so check
that out Kelly thanks for stopping by
talking to me today and thank you for
watching stay tuned for more from the
developer lounge here at JavaOne and
Orville open world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
