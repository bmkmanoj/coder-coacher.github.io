software consultant for fishbowl
solutions based out of Minneapolis
Minnesota and the clock starts now
today I'm going to show you how to set
up some basic intense with Oracle's
intelligent bot cloud service we're
going to use the tech tip bot I created
for this demo so we'll go into the bot
and we'll click the button to add a new
intent the first intent we're going to
add is the greedy intent so if the user
says hi to the bot we want to make sure
our bot can say hi back this is one of
the first things you'll want to make
sure every chap I can do so actually
we're going to have this in our simple
bot the second one we're going to add is
an example of capturing an entity so if
a user wants to know the weather in a
certain location we're going to need to
determine what location that is Oracle
service has actually built in some
entities that we can use and one of them
is the address entity so if we say what
is the weather in Minneapolis it will
capture that city and send it back with
JSON so we can actually or set it to a
variable so we can figure out what C
they're asking about so the conversation
flow starts with the intent set and this
Maps what the user said to our different
intents so if the maps to the greedy
intent we're gonna say hi I'm the tech
tip bot and send that information back
and if it maps to the weather intent
typically we would want to build in a
call to some kind of weather API so we
could get the exact weather but in this
case we're just gonna print the city
back to show that the bot correctly
correctly captured what to see the user
is asking about so you can see that
howdy wasn't actually in the list of
examples but we were able to still
identify that as the greeting intent and
you can also notice here that we
identified San Francisco as the city and
we echoed it back and we said it was
sunny so that is how you set up a simple
intent or two simple intents with
Oracle's intelligent bot cloud service
what did you think of that tip I'm happy
about it we want your opinion thanks for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
