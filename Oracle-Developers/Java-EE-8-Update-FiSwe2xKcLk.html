of the specification leads for the Java
EE 8 platform my fellow specification
lead Bill Shannon is here in the first
row say hello bill so the purpose of
this talk is to give you an update on
Java EE eight where we are today and
then an adjustment in focus that we're
proposing to make to address current
trends in cloud and microservices usual
disclaimer what I'm going to be talking
about is either work in progress or work
that we're proposing to do so don't base
financial decisions on what I have to
say I'm going to start with a brief
recap some background material and then
we'll review our original proposal for
java ee 8 and what we've accomplished so
far I'll turn then to the ways in which
we're proposing to modify these plans to
address recent and emerging trends in
the industry towards cloud and
microservices and finally since this is
very much a big-picture talk I'll
conclude with some pointers as you how
you can learn more about the details of
some of these proposals at other talks
here at javaone how you can contribute
and then how you can influence what
we're proposing to do so the road to
java ee eight of course started with
java ee 7 our initial goals for java ee
eight were built on the success of java
ee 7 focusing on and building out work
we had done in the areas of html5 and
web tier enhancements ease of
development which has been an ongoing
theme with us and improvements to the
Java EE infrastructure we generated a
lot of excitement with the EE 7 release
and that's seen in the adoption that
we've had there are a host of compatible
application servers
that you can use for the platform you
can develop and deploy to any one of
about twenty compatible jovi six and or
java ee 7 compatible application servers
there are hosts of user groups I've
listed a small subset here many have
adopted jsr projects which we really
welcome for their feedback there are
hundreds of publications job
opportunities and so on so let's turn
now to where we are with Java EE eight
today when we started to formulate our
plans for java ee eight we had this
agenda of items we wanted to build on
from e.e seven at the time meant many
many of them along the same lines and
themes but before we launch the ee8
proposal and before we define any
specific jsr ease we started with an
extensive community survey and we got
thousands of participants in the survey
somewhere over 4,000 participants to the
three parts of the survey and we fed the
results of this into our planning
efforts and the results of the survey
had major influence on the shape of the
jsr proposals for ee8 when we launched
ee8 about two years ago so i'll be
talking about some of these so these are
the major Jai SRS that we identified as
part of the plan for ee8 CDI which since
its inception has played a central role
in providing ease of use for the
developer JSONP the Jason processing API
building on the work that we had done
any e7 and Jason binding which is a new
jsr which complements Jason processing
with a Jason to object mapping facility
servlet with an ambitious agenda for
HTTP to support jax-rs for reactive
clients server side events integration
with Jason be
a new action based MVC jsr to complement
jsf the component based MVC framework
that we've had for many years updates to
JMS to continue the trend towards
modernization and simplification that we
began in EE 7 and updated management jsr
and a new security jsr to simplify and
modernize security in the platform and
then finally being validation which was
just launched in the last couple of
months which we had anticipated for some
time which is again a new 20 GSR so in
addition there are a number of planned
smaller updates maintenance releases to
existing jsr s that are part of the
platform and these maintenance releases
we've already done one of them with
common annotations will be driven by the
needs of the major jsr s at the platform
we're not otherwise planning any other
maintenance releases so I want to look
at all these jsr s what their goals are
and where we are with them as of today
so the goals for CDI were focused around
making CDI more modular and for
supporting use of CDI outside of Java EE
containers and this was in response to
strong feedback both from within the
Java EE community and from the job
broader java community as a whole this
work has entailed the split of the CD i
SPECT to make clear which aspects of the
CD i spec or core CDI that is common to
both java SE and java ee environments
and then those parts that are specific
to use and SE for example the
bootstrapping api for bootstrapping a
CDI container in an SD environment and
which parts are specific to Java EE so
in addition to that the CDI expert group
has been addressing a number of requests
for enhancements from the community such
as asynchronous events and
observer ordering and these are both in
the recent early draft to which the CDI
expert group has just published so Jason
processing was added to the platform in
EE 7 it's obviously a key technology and
is becoming increasingly important for
modern applications not just at the
browser or the data export level for for
these applications that is through rest
with your web socket but also at the
data to your level with the emergence of
many no sequel databases that that use
JSON as part of their underlying data
model so the goals for Jason one Jason
pe11 were to keep it up-to-date with
emerging standards Jason pointer Jason
patch and Jason merge patch to add
editing operations for jsonobject and
JSON array and helper classes and
methods to utilize the java SE eight
lambdas and stream operations and
there's a very nice you can think of it
as a query capability over over Jason
documents that was introduced as part of
this ah what happened okay back to our
regularly scheduled program okay so
Jason P has published an early draft to
last year but it's essentially completed
all of the agenda items and it's jsr
proposal when we did our community
survey Jason binding API was one of the
most requested features from that survey
it was the number one requested feature
in that survey so what this does is it
provides a mapping between JSON data and
java objects so it complements the json
processing api and thus closes the gap
in the platform support for Jason
technology to facilitate ease of use
that provides default
mappings between classes and and json
text and then customization API so you
can customize this mapping and it gives
us a standard support to handle
application JSON media types for jax-rs
so jason b has been making great
progress it's completed its public
review and it's a very active expert
group so jax-rs rest has become central
not just for the html5 support but it's
becoming increasingly important for
service to service communication for
communication among microservices some
of the areas on the jax-rs agenda
includes server sent events support for
reactive client api hypermedia
improvements and integration with other
j srs and frameworks of particular CDI
jax-rs has not yet released a draft
although the expert group has been very
active but the RI for jax-rs namely
jersey is is has been making good
progress and in some ways it's ahead of
the spec because of exploratory work
that was done with in jersey so that are
i already has implementations for some
of these features including service in
two vents and reactive api's now for
those areas where we haven't yet brought
them into the standard of course what's
been done in Jersey could be considered
preliminary work it doesn't entail that
the end result will be what's in jersey
today but rather that's of course up to
the expert group the big-ticket item for
servlet 40 is support for HTTP two which
is now a proposed standard from I ATF
and the stated goals of HTTP two are to
address the limitations of HTTP 11 in
particular for performance that is
reducing latency supporting parallelism
without requiring you to have multiple
connections to achieve the parallel
addressing the head of line blocking
issue giving you some facility for
server push at the same time retaining
the user visible semantics of the
existing HTTP 11 protocol so in addition
to providing server-side support for
HTTP to the servlet expert group has a
task of figuring out how to best expose
relevant features of this protocol so
that they can be leveraged in the
programming model for example server
push which was which allows the
application to determine the order in
which data is exported to the client and
in fact in the early draft that was
released by the servlet expert group
there is in fact a push builder API that
was done was added in that draft okay
JSF is certainly mature technology it's
this jsr is intended to address smaller
scale features rather than big ticket
items and it's driven mainly by requests
from the community some of these
enhancements have have been made are
better integration with CDI WebSocket
integration support for Ajax method
invocation class level bean validation
and support for java SE datetime support
so JSF has completed an early draft too
but actually it's addressed a much of
its agenda nearly all of its stated
agenda we filed a new jsr for an
action-based model-view-controller
framework so the idea here was to
provide a compliment to the JSF
component-based MVC framework so in this
case it's the task of the application to
turn to turn the HTTP two requests into
actions this isn't intended to be a J
are out of whole cloth but rather to
leverage existing technologies so for
the model leveraging CDI and being
validation and then at the templating
level facelets and jsps so this jsr has
published already a public review draft
GMS 20 did some great work in terms of
simplifying the core JMS api's and
leveraging CDI in its programming model
one of the things that it didn't address
was what we have today with message
driven means and ironically message
driven beans were once the simplest ejb
type but by far no longer so one of the
major agenda items for this expert group
was to continue this work with a
simplification and generalization of
message driven beans in addition there
were some smaller items that the spec
lead wanted to address increased
portability between application servers
and better support for JMS and XA and
bad messages so JMS unfortunately hasn't
made much much progress although it's
completed its early draft and that early
draft has the additional flexible md BS
the Java EE management API this is a 2
dot 0 but it's a rename of the existing
old j2ee management API which is you can
imagine is quite antique at this point
so the idea here was to provide rest
based management api's as a replacement
or rather to supersede the old style ejb
based api's of the j2ee management jsr
it was intended to be a superset of that
functionality to basically capture all
of the functionality in that earlier jsr
but simplify it and make it rest based
and in addition this jsr had hoped to
include a simple deployment api
unfortunately
sjs are really hasn't gotten off the
ground okay security the security jsr
has a really ambitious agenda the goals
were to simplify and modernize ja ve
security in particular by leveraging CDI
some of the CDI features such as
interceptors some of the proposed
simplifications included ap is for
managing users and groups password
aliasing which was an agenda item that
we had tried to introduce in java ee 7
and never really were able to complete
ap is for role mapping metadata for
authentication security interceptors
much along the lines of the
transactional interceptors that we had
added in java ee 7 but a really flexible
way to to handle authorization with
support from CDI and then finally the
last of these jsr is being validation
which is the expert group is now up and
running this was filed just a couple of
months ago and its main goals are to
leverage updates to java SE 8 and
address request from the community for
additional features and these are some
of the features that the jsr lists as
being relevant to the e SE aid agenda
mainly constraints that can be applied
to collection items support for the
date-time api use of optional java SE
optional repeatable annotations and
other features ok that was a quick tour
of what was originally proposed for java
ee 8 so where are we today this orange
dot is a kind of pie chart is intended
to represent a loose capture of the
status don't take a picture of this this
is kind of I don't want to this is a
little loosey-goosey because I'm not too
good at these pie figures so some of
them should probably be five eighths
instead of three quarters so I'm should
be
one quarter but some of our jsr s have
essentially completed the agenda items
that were proposed in their jsr
submissions even though their they may
be at one of the early draft stages or
the public review state whereas others
have made considerably less progress so
for example Jason P and and JSF have
essentially completed the goals and
they're in their proposals Jason B's
been making excellent progress it's
completed its public review CDI this
probably more accurate as a five-eighths
but I can't do that so whereas some of
them have not yet gotten off the ground
such as management I'm not going to
fault bean validation because that's a
new jsr and that that expert group is
actually quite active okay so in the
meantime where are we now well the world
is changing or the world has changed
current trends are a lot different from
when we launched Java EE eight two and a
half years ago so the industry is moving
on there's much more focus on the
ability to deploy applications into the
cloud and when we launched Java EE eight
docker didn't didn't even really exist
so the landscape has changed
considerably and there is also a
definite trend towards microservices
based architectures where instead of
monolithic apps apps are architected as
highly distributed smaller scale and
reusable services and there's more
emphasis on dev ops so while it's
possible today to run your Java EE
applications and cloud environments java
ee isn't really focused on supporting
what are currently cloud native
microservices style applications so we
think the bottom line is that we really
need to adjust because we want the
future of Java EE to be viable for these
next generation applications there
composed and deployed differently in
cloud environments they are more loosely
coupled they're more modular they
require have somewhat different needs in
terms of scalability and flexibility
composability update ability and
reliability so we need to be able to
evolve smaller scale independent
services quickly and consume cloud
services from other applications okay so
how do we address these challenges okay
so I want to talk now about our
proposals and keep in mind that these
are proposals okay this isn't nailed
down at the end of the day the expert
groups are going to have a fair amount
of say here you can have a fair amount
of stay here and I'll give you pointers
at the end of this talk as to how you
can channel your input okay so what
we're proposing is to retarget the Java
EE platform to address these shifts and
cloud and Mike reservist as architecture
and we think that this can best be done
with a two-fold approach first of all a
relatively constrained adjustment and
focus to java ee 8 and then for java ee
9 longer-term more in-depth work
targeted at what you could consider
enhance support for cloud and
microservices that leverages work that
we're going to be doing in java ee 8 our
intention is to run these two efforts in
parallel so that we can get started with
the longer-term issues and an areas
before we finish java ee eight so
tracking what we're doing in java ee
eight and building upon it in parallel
i'm going to cover the first of these
areas that is the java ee eight changes
in this talk and then in the follow-on
talk in this room at four o'clock our
colleagues receive more Donny and Josh
door are going to be talking about
proposals for Java EE nine ok so our
goals are also to provide a migration
path so this isn't a radical departure
it's to provide a migration path to
cloud development and deployment for our
existing Java EE customers and to
provide a migration path to
microservices based architectures for
our applications thus retaining backward
compatibility with Java EE so here's
what we're proposing in terms of
revisions to Java EE eight there are
some additions and some subtractions to
achieve a focus that we think is more
appropriate to address these emerging
trends our plan is to basically more or
less tie off jsr s that are almost
complete and in that category i would
put jason p and j SF jason be as i said
earlier is a new jsr it's been making
great progress we believe it's essential
in this new environment for servlet it's
critical that we complete the work for
HTTP to support so that'll continue is
the number one focus of the servlet
expert group rest is obviously a key
technology in cloud and microsomal be
reinvigorating the jax-rs work with a
focus on reactive programming model and
for greater resiliency the addition of a
circuit breaker api within within jax-rs
you can so for security we need to
reorient a bit we believe it's essential
to address requirements 40 off and open
ID and secret management the agenda for
the security jsr is already extremely
ambitious
I think so we may need to adjust that
agenda plus or minus 4 to accommodate
these new features within ee8 and areas
that perhaps don't make the security jsr
and ee8 will obviously become candidates
for EE nine we also need to prioritize
in terms of those areas where we think
we need to cut back or not pursue
further so GMS is a mature technology
and while it would have been really nice
to have flexible JMS md bees as part of
the platform our current thinking is
that our efforts would be better spent
if we looked at some of the newer forms
of eventing and messaging that are
emerging today and receive and Josh will
be talking about some of that so we're
proposing instead of JMS 21 as the
inclusion in Java EE 8 to roll back and
include JMS 20 the existing management
JCAP eyes aren't really extensively used
and the management jsr hasn't made any
progress so we're proposing to stop work
on management 20 for MVC this is I
realize this may be a little bit
controversial but we think that the new
MVC jsr will be less relevant in this
cloud environment so we're proposing
even though it's made good progress
we're proposing to stop work on the MVC
jsr on the other hand we think that we
need to file some new jsr s in
particular for configuration and this
has been an item that we want it to
address for quite some time and that's
now becoming more urgent and new
configuration jsr as part of java ee 8
and also a JSR for health check api's
again thinking forward to
you service based applications that are
highly decomposed where you need to
worry about the health of the
applications that you're talking to and
the services that you're talking to and
in addition some basic support for
multi-tenancy which we're thinking does
not need to be a separate jsr so this
slide summarizes our rationale for these
proposed changes that cloud apps really
need to rely on remote rest calls so we
need some circuit breaker API to add to
the resiliency in this area and this
will be introduced our proposal is to
introduce this as part of jax-rs perhaps
it can be extended to apply to other
api's as well and then focus on security
with OAuth and open ID which have
emerged as the norm in cloud computing
and secret management which has been on
our agenda for a while we need to
externalize configuration we need a
basic config API some more sophisticated
apps will require support for
multi-tenancy so we'd like to provide
some base level services here that can
be relied on and again for resiliency
health checking in terms of dropped
functionality as I said we're proposing
to stay at JMS 20 rather than advancing
to JMS 21 and we think that cloud MVC
will be less relevant for cloud apps so
we think that MVC will not be so
important here and as I said earlier our
current management GSR is not widely
used this is the slide that aneel showed
in his keynote yesterday for the
proposed focus areas for java ee 8 and
java ee 9 I've highlighted here in the
darker blue those aspects that we're
proposing to address in the context of
Java EE
so this will be like the first phase and
then the more advanced aspects are
targeted for java ee 9 so if we look at
some of these in programming model not
full-blown reactive programming in Java
8 but rather reactive client API in
jax-rs support for HTTP to jason be
lambdas were appropriate and new jsr for
externalized configuration and an API
for addressing for accessing
configuration from potentially multiple
sources basic support for multi-tenancy
circuit breakers and health check API
for resiliency and then a number of
enhancements to security so I want to
look at these briefly in a little bit
more detail
so for reactive reactive style
programming is more common in
cloud-based environments where the apps
are more distributed and there's
increased latency so you don't want a
secret asst API you want some kind of
callback mechanism where threads are not
going to be blocked we're going to our
proposal is a migration path to a fuller
reactive programming model in Java EE 9
in Java EE 8 we're going to take a few
steps in that direction with reactive
clients in in jax-rs
so the idea with circuit breakers is
they're important to improve resiliency
and fault tolerance in distributed
systems by isolating failures and
preventing those failures from cascading
so they give you a generic way of
dealing with failures in remote
invocations so we want to avoid the
situation where you know developers have
to write extensive boilerplate code
two-hander handle failures and
standardize on a basic circuit breaker
API um we're envisioning this is again
as a first step by introducing this in
the jax-rs client api the approaches
that I've listed here straw man
approaches that our team has has been
thinking about whether programmatic or
whether declarative with some annotation
based approach and then we want of
course this to be configurable and again
these are strong and things that you
might want to configure like the
sampling frequency or the time period or
you know what's your threshold for
triggering a circuit breaker I should
mention that jax-rs the the Jersey API
the RI for jax-rs has been experimenting
with circuit breakers it's it's you can
use hystrix circuit breakers with Jersey
right now
so again like circuit breakers health
checking is needed for resiliency and
there's no standard here you want to be
able to check the health of other
applications of resources servers micra
services today since there's no standard
you would expect them all to report
health differently and you like more
than just a you know yes there's no
response I mean ideally you'd like some
semantics health status codes for
example or the reason for failures or
you know what about the dependencies of
the service who's healthier checking so
our idea is is to file the jsr with the
rest with a rest-based api and then
relying on json for the actual data that
gets passed back we'd want to have some
kind of configurable context path and
notice that circuit breakers for example
could leverage potentially leverage such
a health check API
I talked about this a little bit already
you know rjs are for security is really
ambitious but we think we need to add
support for OAuth and open ID connect to
the agenda oh office is complex it's
hard to use and it'll be the task of the
security expert group to evaluate how to
improve that how to perhaps introduce
simpler ap is that will capture the
semantics ditto open ID connect so this
may or may not entail a reprioritization
of the already ambitious agenda of the
security expert group so configuration
configuration of an app needs to be
externalized we want to separate the app
from the configuration of the app and we
need an API to deal with multiple
configuration sources to perhaps support
layering and override of these sources
so that you can not only configure a nap
but potentially reconfigure a nap as it
moves to a different environment you
might have multiple instances of an app
that need to be configured differently
and you may have different stages of
your app where each stage of the app for
example a development stage of the app
versus the production stage of the app
would need to be configured differently
so we want to standardize a mechanism
for configuration define how you can
inject configuration information into
the app itself how you can layer
configuration and how how you can work
with issues immutability so there's been
a fair amount of community effort in
this area you know apache tamiya delta
spike spring config so we need to
leverage what's already been done and
learned in this area and I expect that
our spec lead for the configuration work
we'll try to bring together
our experts from these various
communities to to help with this effort
and finally multi-tenancy we'd like to
do something simple here I realized that
this might be less obvious than some of
the other areas we've gotten some
feedback already that well this should
probably be optional for those servers
that really want to support
multi-tenancy but the basic idea is to
provide some kind of structure or some
kind of information for those
applications that are more sophisticated
that need Ted and specific routing or
need to be identity to identify who the
incoming tenant is we tried to do some
of this in java ee 7 we didn't get very
far with it but i think it's time to
revisit those proposals and to see if we
can converge again on something fairly
straightforward that can be leveraged by
these more sophisticated applications
and you'll show this slide in his
keynote these are the jsr s that are
part of the java ee 7 platform if you
look in the platform spec you can find
the long laundry list of AP is that are
required pieces of the full java ee 7
platform in java ee 7 we enhance some of
these as full j srs and other cases some
of them were just maintenance releases
and a couple of these technologies were
defined as optional so it's optional for
a platform an application server vendor
to implement some of these api some of
the older ones like jax-rpc jacks are
are optional for the Ender to implement
but they're still part of the platform
and they're still part of the reference
implementation this slide summarizes
what we're planning to do or what we're
proposing to do i should say in java ee
8 this is our revised proposal so and
apologies to anyone who is colorblind
here the ones in dark blue our existing
jsr s that are being updated in java ee
eight their part of the list of mange
ASRs that I went through in the
beginning so these jsr s are like dot
one or two dot o releases or in the case
of Sir little Ford Otto release down at
the bottom Jason B and security were
newly introduced in the Java EE 8
platform our intent is to enhance and
continue that work and complete those
jsr s security will also be part of a
big part of Java EE nine and then
configuration and health check our new
jsr s that we are planning proposing to
file as part of the reinvigorated ee8
work so this is the road map again if
you went to the keynote you saw the
slide before so where we are today we're
gathering feedback and I will in a
minute give you pointers as to how you
can give your feedback
and we want to get those new j srs off
the ground and then as we go forward
we'd like to complete java ee 8 by java
one next year you know that specs rit ck
the whole thing complete in parallel we
want to advance work on java ee nine
have that work well up and running and
have some kind of EA for java ee nine
and then I realize this is quite
ambitious but we'd like to complete a
java ee nine release within two years
that's the goal okay so how can you
contribute first of all take the survey
you know we really want developer input
the survey is now live it asks you
basically how you would view as
important or not important some of the
features that we have some of the AP is
that we're proposing existing ones in
Java EE eight and some of the new ones
some of the areas we could address and
longer-term items for java ee nine so
please go take the survey we'd love to
get as many responses as we did to our
ee8 survey you have technical comments
or even political based constructive
comments about some of the proposals
that we're making you know what should
be in which should not be in in addition
to blank fields in the survey where you
can fill in in the survey you can also
send technical comments to the users
list for the platform jsr you can join
the JCP it's free there's a JCP
membership drive that's going on right
now in the hacker garden area in java
hub you can join the JCP JCP now has
different contributor levels so if you
don't want to be a full-fledged expert
you may not have the time to be an
expert you can register as a contributor
to various expert groups and be
acknowledged that way so go find out
about joining the JCP
the URL here lists the jsr s that are
part of the platform where they live how
you can track their progress so it gives
you access to to the jsr project pages
and adopt a JSR we think adopted jsr is
another really great program for
channeling feedback you can get together
with other like-minded people or not
like minded people and disagree and as a
group channel feedback for an expert
group our spec leads really like this
adopted jsr mechanism because it gives
very constructive feedback okay so what
I'm going to leave you with here is a
long list of talks where you can learn
some of the details I realize what I've
said has been extremely high level the
next talk here in this room I will do a
deep dive into some of the longer term
proposals for more advanced platform
work the speakers for this had so much
to say that they've actually split their
talk into two pieces now the second part
of that talk is again I believe it's
here in this room and it's the one
called portable cloud applications with
Java EE so part one right now and then
part two tomorrow afternoon at this time
and we have a buff tonight I forget
exactly where the buff is whether it's
here in the hilton but the Java EE for
the cloud buff where you can meet with a
number of the spec leads and again give
feedback on these proposals if you like
them if you don't like them if you have
questions and won't understand more
that's a good really low key way to to
get your questions and answers and so
far as we can give you answers and
that's basically it I'll take any Q&amp;amp;A
and yeah
wait is this survey ending well we're
trying to advertise it as much as we can
here at javaone oh sorry okay the
question was what are we doing to
advertise the survey you all can help
advertise the survey where every one of
our speakers on this list should be
advertising the survey because we really
want to get a lot of feedback so you
should see a slide that is the next step
slide and most of the talks that you're
going to be going to from our team with
the new proposals how long is a survey
going to be open I would anticipate
several weeks but I don't have that
information that's a great question yeah
okay the short form of this question is
what's happening with javed nana what
are we doing about it ah we have a team
that's currently looking at how do we
deal with this and where are we moving
stuff too and I think it's a little
early for me to say exactly what those
guys are thinking but yes we're working
on this to be quite honest I wasn't
aware of the Jason be moved so i can't
really comment on that yeah Reza
bits of input you can use my job a
guardian serve a hundred percent serve a
blue top answers all the questions that
you have similarly the microfiber group
has been running a survey as well I'm
sure they'll be happy to give you
results with their service degree do you
envision these surveys being used
together Reza just raised the issue of
The Guardian survey and the micro
profile do survey and yes we've been
looking at both of those so thanks for
posting that the if you go to the let me
go back here if you go to the Java EE
spec java.net project and you look at
the mail archives there's an email there
that Reza just posted on the users list
that has the URL for the survey results
so that's the way i go to look at the
survey results you can look at the
survey results to the Guardian survey
their micro profile do has their survey
results and I forget whether you need to
go to google groups or or where to
access those but John who is back there
can tell me how you access the micro
profile do survey but you have them up
today where can you see that on your
website
oh I thought you had preliminary results
up at least I had seen something anyway
good a micro profile do and if you sniff
around there you can find some
information as to the feedback they've
gone let me see if anybody else has a
question before I take you again is this
the only guy asking questions well okay
so i think our ee8 plan is a fairly
modest plan which you know given the
goal seems pretty straightforward and
the new jsr is configure than trying to
draw in for some time the health check
jsr is the pretty constrain jsr and then
some of the emphasis has shifted like
for what we want to do with security and
a little bit of what we want to do for
jax-rs i realized that a few of the
things that I've said or that we're
proposing might be a little
controversial for example I heard that
there was some controversy around our
proposal not to continue MVC so I we
want to hear from the community we want
to hear about what we've proposed which
will influence the outcome but I think
for Java e8 you know this is pretty much
the direction we want to take for java
ee 9 that's longer term and there's
still you know there's still a lot of
investigation that needs to be done
before we file the jsr s we need to
actually address what's going to be
covered in what jsr with those jsr czar
so there's a window where that still
needs to be nailed down come to the talk
that's being given in the next hour so
that you get a feel for what's being
proposed and you can channel your feet
back I think that question is better
better asked to that spec lead yeah it
is very ambitious um well I can't really
comment on the resourcing at this point
we're still kind of working out who
would be speculate for what jsr and how
the emphasis is going to go so it's it's
a little early to do that I think the
ee8 is much more predictable we have a
fairly high degree of confidence that we
can do java ee 8 in in a year yeah well
okay so over no raises the issue of
profiles / what we're proposing
basically for ie8 and ie9 so of course
we already have the web profile so could
we so how are we going to address the
potential issue of subsetting i assume
what could be subsetting plus super
setting for EE 8 and EE 9 this is
something we've been discussing
internally I think it's fairly safe to
say as to whether whether or not we
should think in terms of a profile but I
think it's really premature to to get
into that at this point until we get
further along and then
obviously these decisions get influenced
by our expert group so for each 90 lish
ooh of you know ii eight is building
upon s EA te nine builds upon se9 there
should be no surprise at this point se9
is adding modularity how do we leverage
that these are still longer-term open
issues back row in the blue I'm sorry
but you're so far back I really couldn't
understand your questions Oh je cache um
yeah so we would love to see je cache
make progress we had hoped to bring in
je cache in EE 7 there are some
integration pieces that need to be
addressed for it to be part of the
platform if that expert group can get
reinvigorated and do that then I think
that would be a good addition and I
think our expert group our platform
expert group would certainly welcome
that yeah way back sorry the guy way
back less rope
sorry ah well depends on when they
actually get the work done yeah
um insofar as we were thinking you know
jax-rs that's near term but we'd really
like to have some kind of more
generalized circuit breaker that could
be leveraged elsewhere as well so your
answer short-term versus longer-term I
think it's kind of both um it could I
think once we get into the work within
jax-rs then we'll know better I think
that's a question good question for him
actually there are two of them Oh
recently recently I would try next week
hmm is the I think you should talk to an
eel yeah
oh sorry I should have left those logos
on when I when I took those slides I
know when you'll had the logos yes we
expect glassfish to be the reference
implementation yeah those are goals
those are targets yeah well you have to
you have to put stakes in the ground
because otherwise people don't don't see
the urgency but we think there is some
urgency here certainly for ee8 we want
to be aggressive with ie8 Wow ok I think
that's where the java.net questions some
of our some of our expert groups are
already using github for mirrors of
their projects so I think you know that
that can be on the table I think it's
too early to predict that we would do
that but i think that's certainly a
viable option to consider yeah yeah
well some of these at least 48 these are
already existing jsr s with existing jsr
agendas in terms of the ones that we and
in fact except for some additions like
to security where we do expect the
expert group to have considerable input
there that's quite an active expert
group even though they haven't released
draft yet but there's a lot going on in
that expert group so the expert groups
definitely address the jsr agendas now
for the ones that we're proposing to
stop work on I think under the JCP rules
we could just simply do that and i'm
looking here at patrick we could just
simply do that but before going there we
want feedback from the community do you
do you folks agree is you know give us
your feedback yeah
I think your questions will be answered
in about an hour if you stay in this
room okay I got two more minutes yeah
until we have another solution I would
expect them to get started on java.net
but that's just me I don't make that
decision yeah
well there are a lot of contributors to
micro profile yo who are historically
also contributors to our expert groups
some of them are former colleagues who
are here in the audience and yeah you
know we certainly expect that
collaboration to continue that they will
continue to provide input to our expert
groups you know some of the the member
companies are leading jsr s that are
important jsr s for the platform and
those jsr s are continuing and we're
folding them into the platform so I
think you know obviously there's a
little bit of disagreement between the
the some of the approaches here but i
think the end goals of you know having a
platform that's viable for microservices
and well targeted for micro services is
the same okay well thanks everybody yeah
good discussion and channel your
discussion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
