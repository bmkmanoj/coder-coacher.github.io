Jim bruised Anzio from the Oracle
developer community and I'm here with
Alex key from Oracle Alex welcome thank
you Jim nice to see you you too and
we're gonna have a conversation here
about dotnet and Oracle DB
and so you did a talk earlier today yes
yes so how did that go went well it went
well I think a lot of people you know
they know Oracle they know net they
don't know quite as much about the
Oracle cloud whether you know using.net
an Oracle DB so I've been you know my
talk was about introducing people to how
to get started using Oracle database and
dotnet within the Oracle cloud you know
now some people know a little bit about
Oracle database know a little bit about
that net maybe a little bit about Oracle
cloud but putting it all together you
know that that's the thing that might my
talk was intended to do I'm interesting
and how did it go what was the reaction
was there any sort of you know where any
sort of reaction that you can think of
from actually from the audience yeah it
seemed the audience liked what they
heard you know they they were very
receptive and you know there are large
amount of people who are database Oracle
database users and dotnet users and many
of them are new to cloud in general and
but cloud really appeals to them simply
be especially application developers
because they don't want to have to stand
up hardware they don't want to have to
buy a bunch of hardware or figure out
how much they need they just want to be
able to rent it and cloud is perfect for
that
and then managing it they don't want to
manage it either you know that they you
know they have IT staff with that but if
they're kind of a small number of
developers they don't have an IT staff
so you know in the past they would say
well you know we would like to use
Oracle database but you know it's you
know we have to get no specialist you
know to set up our hardware our IT
infrastructure and then and then a DBA
well now you don't really all need that
you can just get it from the Oracle
cloud get databases service going and
you can get started right away and use
just what you need and as your
application grows you grow with it add
more CPUs as you need it all right
interesting how long have you been
working on this project dinette and or
clock well ever since dinette started
which is
while ago well yes so I've been at work
or a long time 2002-2003 actually maybe
even 2001 as far and actually I don't
know as a side anecdote I went to
college with one of the one of the
creators of asp.net Scott Guthrie was
actually now pretty high up at Microsoft
it's just kind of a side anecdote and
but we both went to the same school and
and he was one year ahead of me but he
went to Microsoft I went to Oracle so
but you know he's doing a lot of things
on cloud as well so you know it's where
we're doing a lot of things in cloud and
for for my team we're very interested in
getting our customers be able to use the
Oracle cloud because because we find
there's a lot of value for especially
application developers a lot of value
yeah this is actually when I went to
Ginsu I mean so you haven't done it at
Microsoft obviously in Oracle DB you
know at you know obviously from Oracle
how does this how do you work together
with Microsoft on some of the easiest
solutions yeah ever since I started
Oracle I've been working with on a
Microsoft focus so when we when I first
joined it was like oh lady be and
windows so Oracle database on Windows
and using a do all ADB and then dotnet
came along and supported the ATO dinette
with our Oracle data provider for dotnet
so there's been for our our customers is
you know a lot of them are using dotnet
in the middle tier and then Oracle
database and all they care about is
getting the two to work together you
know the developers like net they want
to do c-sharp they wanted to vb done it
they've got DBAs and IT folks I love
Oracle database wanna use Oracle
database take it most out of it so what
we try to do is find ways for the.net
developers to get the most out of the
Oracle database most out of Oracle RAC
better availability out of their dotnet
applications to the Oracle database and
that's what we're what we really focused
on for last 15 or so years as we're
helping the dotnet doors and we've seen
actually a lot of help from Microsoft
because they want to make sure that
they're dinette developers can use all
the technologies that they want to they
wanna yeah whether it's from Oracle
anyone else
they can't use cuz otherwise you know if
you leave it to some other technology
then but the developers are gonna go
there because they just want solutions
ultimately whether it's companies or
individual developers they just want
solutions to work and that's what well
we as a company and my team is most
interested in so you obviously have to
work very close with have to work very
closely with Microsoft yeah yeah yeah in
fact we we have regular contact with the
microsoft.net team and visual studio
team to you know make sure that what
we're doing is it's gonna integrate with
their next version to understand where
they're taking their product so that we
can be prepared and integrate with it
when they release so in terms of
platform for local DB I mean obviously
dotnet it's gonna be big what some of
the other you know platforms out there
that are major well in terms of middle
tier yeah yeah Java obviously Java is
probably the biggest dotnet next just in
terms of number of developers those two
are the biggest and I know there's a lot
of hype well I may be hypes the wrong
word there's a lot of interest yeah
that's that's probably more appropriate
in the open source technologies but what
I found is that the open source
technologies have become very spread out
you know you know one technology comes
along and it gets very hot and there's a
group of developers that like it and
another technology comes on that
improves it improves on it and you know
those more developers go to that and
whereas Java and.net have kind of stayed
tried-and-true and have evolved have you
know they're mature and a lot of the
more a lot of enterprises have chosen
that as them as their preferred platform
because of maturity also because of the
commercial support you know as much as
you know something like mainframes are
still around why because of there's this
commercial support as much as its you
know an older technology and not to say
there's not innovation in Java and.net I
think a lot of times they they take
what's best in the enterprise world but
also what's best in the the open source
world and adopt those things into their
into their technologies and involve that
and and make sure that it's
battle-tested so that when enterprises
use it and they'll be able to use it but
make sure it's highly performant and
highly available which is what they care
about most so now with this transition
to clouds and now talk about you know
dotnet Oracle DB and Oracle cloud yeah
so what's the relationship here with net
in that yeah well so yeah what we've
done is in Oracle cloud infrastructure
we've we have windows available you can
use Windows 2016 2012 r2 2008 r2 and in
there you can run dotnet framework and
run that for anyone with your net apps
and in fact the elbow right now it's
available right now and the fact the
session I did was showing just that and
that I had just it was actually I only
had three slides I showed three slides
and runs all talk my whole talk yeah
that's excellent I know well you know
that's what developers want to see you
know they want to see powerful they want
to see the code they want to see you
know something doing something
interesting with you know the IDs and
code so I I stuck with that and I showed
how to take a asp.net web app deploy it
to Oracle cloud infrastructure running
iis and Windows and 2012 r2 and then use
that to access the Oracle database and
how simple it was and I did that well
took me about 25 minutes but only
because I kept talking and talking about
okay but if I just had to kind of push
it out I would be able to do it probably
in 10 to 15 I'm just just real focused
on it and then I'll show the
client-server way to you know you can
also do on-premise dotnet to Oracle
database as a service in the cloud to so
it's a lot of ways to mix and match
we've got the Oracle cloud machine too
so you can always move that on-premise
or say I want to just have the cloud
machine in Oracle's cloud and just like
Oracle management so you know Oracle we
try to provide a lot of ways to make
that transition through the cloud
because I know for a lot of enterprises
is a new paradigm for developers they're
probably more flexible and and my talk
was geared more to developers because
they're like more open to like hey let's
try something new and see if it works
yeah we're enterprises are more like I
know what works now I'm a little afraid
that it might break so but you know we
give you the on-premise option to use
cloud if you want if you're afraid of
that a little a little more risk-averse
you can you can always adopt that all
right so you can use net with
infrastructure and service
and we're also working on a.net platform
as a service is that if you're not
interested in managing that Ned and the
patching and the operating system things
like that that's not available now not
not right now no but we're working on
that that's something that we're gonna
provide in the future because at Oracle
we actually just care about providing
you solutions you know the the fact that
you know whether it's someone else's
technology or ours we want to be able to
provide you the solution so that you can
do what you need to get whatever
application you want done that's that's
ultimately our goal okay great
super well I'm actually also interested
in your impressions of the event here
because you mentioned earlier that this
was your first or yeah this is my first
Oracle code I'm quite impressed there's
a lot of people here
I heard almost a thousands yeah very
impressive so so I I'm very excited I
wasn't sure what to expect going in
because it is my first Oracle code but
we hadn't had a good turnout this is the
second year that actually this is the
second year that Oracle's running this
and this is the fourth or fifth event of
this year for this year and then we'll
leave here and then we'll go to
Bangalore next week okay so will you be
in Bangalore we'll be in Bangalore but
we're giving us a second separate talk
this one I'm talking about best
practices for high availability without
net and also best practices for
performance so you know I go from the
beginner to the advanced we will stop by
actually maybe you can stop by email do
another session we'll do it I'll
definitely want to stop by another
session well Alex thank you very much
for stopping by appreciate it no problem
Jim any time and we'll be back soon with
some more interviews see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
