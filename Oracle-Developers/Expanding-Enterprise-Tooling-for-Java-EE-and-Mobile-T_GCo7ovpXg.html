QR code reader on your phone and you can
you can connect to the Oracle Wi-Fi will
have a little fun later on show you guys
a feature of jboss tools as we talk
about mobile and development on that so
Who am I and who's this guy right here
my name is Jay belounis I'm a mobile
platform architect for red hat and I'm
formerly the aero gear project lead in
the lead of richfaces and this right
here is max Anderson he's a colleague of
mine at Red Hat and leads up all of our
tooling efforts yeah give him a little
support moral support not an official Co
speaker and yet on stage for assistance
so how many of you guys use one of these
three IDEs on a regular basis wow what
does everybody else use I'm kind of
curious I clit just straight eclipse
okay all right I see I should have had
that up there ah alright so so anyway
these are these are for the most part
except for straight eclipse which is
really good all by itself these are
these are three of the big java ee IDEs
out there right NetBeans from son jboss
tools and jboss developer studio from
from Red Hat and then IntelliJ as well
so I just kind of mentioned something
about jboss developer studio and jboss
tools I wanted to kind of explain the
difference there jboss tools is the open
is the open source project and has all
of the individual plugins available so
you can kind of pick and choose what
plugins you want to include where jboss
developer studio is has an installer and
it's prepackaged you know that with a
makes it easier to install and kind of
get get started without worrying about
installing specific plugins however if
you want to if you want to kind of pick
and choose your plugins because you're
an eclipse ninja then jboss tools would
be would be a good way to go so jboss
tools all by itself has quite a bit of
functionality in it that includes
application server management
rest and web service endpoint explorers
which will show you guys in just a
little bit it also has really good CDI
and jsf in HTML integration so whether
it's quick starts or linking or our
wizards you know that type of thing it's
very good with with different
configuration files it also has a full
jpa support so for example hibernate
obviously and and and others as part of
EE and then source control test
framework integration wizard scaffolding
really everything you'd expect from from
from a Java EE tool so what I'm going to
show you now we're going to kind of go
back and forth between some demos
showing you actual v bosse tools &amp;amp; J BDS
jboss developer studio I should say and
and the slides so how many people are
familiar with jboss developer studio
have downloaded it used it a little bit
know a few people all right so we got a
few people in the room that's all right
so what you see here is the is the jboss
central page so this is kind of the home
page inside of inside j DBS now
obviously this is eclipse so these are
just advanced eclipse plugins on top of
on top of the core eclipse and what we
have here is a bunch of quick starts and
tutorials news about news about red hat
recent blogs things like that kind of
help you get started and so the first
one i want to show you is the html5
project so this is this is basically a
wizard to help you get started when you
click this it's going to load up this is
effectively a maven archetype they were
it's backed by a maven archetype and
it's going to automatically check to
make sure you have the things you need
to be successful so whether or not you
have a runtime another and other support
there then like a lot of like a lot of
these you're going to be able to put in
project names packages things like that
default locations and then you know keep
modifying some of these values group ID
artifact ID for maven that type of stuff
including things like table suffix
suffixes and in some other settings now
I'm not going to go ahead and and
actually build it I already have one
right here that was generated from that
exact thing and from here there's a
couple things that are really neat that
jboss jboss developer studio does for me
being a mobile developer rest
architecture is really important for me
it's really important I think for for a
lot of newer clients because it really
decouples the server from the from the
client implementation and so one of the
features of jboss developers to do I
really like is the the jax-rs web
service browser so right here through
part of the part of the project the the
tools actually scan your scan your
system find your endpoints and then give
you a good listing of them from here you
can actually write or not right click
double click on them and it will
actually take you to the source code for
the actual endpoints you can kind of see
your library of what you have available
and then another really neat neat
feature here is that you can actually
run the rest endpoint and see what's
going to happen you bring this up a
little bit so here you see that it's
actually going to call you know the
localhost 8080 and it's going to call
the the restful endpoint now here you
can modify different things you can add
headers pretty much just play around
with the restful endpoint and then when
you're ready you can go ahead and submit
the request and it's going to actually
trigger trigger the request to the
running server the server happens to be
running right now I have it deployed to
to a local jboss 771 instance and so
here with the web tester or the web
service tester it really kind of makes
it a lot easier to test your endpoint so
you don't end up having to do you know
full deploys and then play around with
command line or you know not necessarily
command line but browser URL statements
that typist
so next what I'll actually show you is
the application itself that's up and
running the html5 QuickStart is as the
name implies it's based on on an HTML
client front-end talking to through
restful services to a to a JAX jax-rs
java ee backend one important thing to
note about that is that the this is
going to be a desktop version and then
i'll show you in a little bit a little
bit more about the mobile version so one
of the neat things when you have the the
server loaded here and you have the
application here itself you can see how
things are synchronized and it knows
when things get out of sync so you need
to you need to either republish or clean
or it'll do some of that automatically
for you so here what I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to bring this up in a
in a web browser and you might have
noticed what I clicked on let me go to
it again what I clicked on was show in
there's a few options here right there's
there's different web browser options
you can look at it the file itself what
I chose was the web browser via via
right live reload server so this is one
of the newer features of jboss tools in
jboss developer studio and so let me go
back to that browser I'll see if I can
shrink the page down a little bit so we
can see things happen all at once so
here's the base here's the base page now
once again this is this is just a quick
start this is just that help you kind of
get the lay of the land and the initial
functionality in place make it a little
easier to get started and explore the
technology so here what we have is a
pretty basic front end where you can
just register new members now I'm going
to go ahead and just put in some some
junk values here now you'll notice just
that you'll notice that when I regit try
to register and I don't have this filled
out this is this actual alert isn't
something that I've created this isn't
something that I programmed this is
actually function
ality of some modern browsers like
Chrome and Safari we're based on the
based on the form that you use let me
find it in here quick one second
so here where I have email for those who
see if I can zoom in there alright so
here is where i define that the HTML for
that email form and what I've actually
said is a that it's type email and that
its name is email I've defined a
placeholder for it so that's the that's
kind of the shadowed the shadowed text
behind that input field and then it's
also required and if you put all of
these things together a lot of modern
browsers not just in mobile devices but
in but in things like chrome as I
mentioned will actually automatically
handle some of that functionality where
you see the you see the the value in the
back but then it will actually check to
make sure that the value is there that's
valid so I'll just go ahead and put in a
junk email there now what just happened
is the html5 client actually just sent a
rest for restful request back to the
server and got that got this added to to
the database that's backing this up and
then the demo itself has some links to
kind of show you the the restful call to
go get the sea the JSON of the different
values so now another thing that I
mentioned was the live reload one of the
nice things about that is that it's
really going to start to shrink down
your your kind of your dev test cycles
right so you don't want to spend a lot
of time modifying a page and then seeing
how it looks modifying a page seeing how
it looks by full redeploys that type of
thing so what we can do here is I'll
just pick I'll just pick a value in and
go change it one second let's say will
change it from html5 quick start to
hello Java one
Oh see see if I can do this quick we're
to show up who have to modify the wrong
one sorry that was for the host for
mobile so I'll change this to hi javaone
at the start of the value bring this
over I'll go ahead and save this one
you'll see that really quickly just add
it in the high java one you'll see a
little later where we actually integrate
that functionality with with our mobile
a mobile scan and a mobile front-end
that you can then then develop on more
all right let me jump back to the slides
for a second so there we just pretty
much just talked about some of the
basics that jboss tools have some of the
newer features that are that are in
place but I really didn't talk much
about mobile i know i mentioned
mentioned a few a few teasers for later
but when we want to talk about mobile i
think it's really important that we
first kind of talk about what the
different application types are because
these will really make a big a big
impact on well a the skills that you're
going to require but also the tools that
will help you get the get your job done
so over on the Left we have straight web
apps if any of you have been to my other
talks I like to kind of go through these
I think it's important to talk about so
over on the left you have straight web
apps so this is when a browse a phone or
a tablet or even a desktop browser
accesses the standard web right but for
for a mobile application on mobile web
application it's going to do things so
that it it's formatted correctly for
your device can take advantage of some
some basic device functionality such as
some basic geolocation or accelerometer
support that's actually available with
with some browsers but you're going to
be using technologies that you're
probably already familiar with you can
use jsf right jsf produces HTML pages so
you can certainly use that you can use
things like quit or straight html5 or
you know when i use that term what I'm
really talking about is an HTML webpage
JavaScript and CSS then there's
certainly some new new api's and and and
tags and things like that associated
with with html5 I'm not going to dig too
deep on that now on the other end of the
spectrum you have got native
applications native applications is
where you you know obviously you're
going to be using the tools and
languages of the native platform so
that's objective-c and xcode four for
iOS or Android java.net for Windows
Phone things like that now what you're
going to get out of that is you're going
to get the best function at you're going
to get the best impact in your access to
device capabilities the best performance
possible things like that now somewhere
in the middle and again this kind of my
next slide I talked about requirements
but the slot in the middle we're kind of
talking about hybrid applications these
are kind of a mix between between the
two there's several hybrid application
frameworks out there like accelerator or
patchy Cordova we'll talk about those a
little bit more in a bit that basically
allow you to use web technologies to
create native applications effectively
what what a lot of these do is they in
one form of another wrap a web page
inside of a native application and then
provide some sort of JavaScript bridge
or way to access native functionality
soon with that you can get access to
contacts and calendars and things like
that you still need to have a little bit
of knowledge of the native devices but
you don't have to you don't have to be
an objective-c expert right now on the
other hand there are some negatives to
it which we kind of talked about on this
slot this slide as well so why how do
you make your choice how do you
determine which one of these of these
approaches to take it really comes down
and I think it's really important to
know it's really coming down it really
come
down to requirements in some situations
you know you might not need a native
application if you're not doing heavy
graphics and you you know you're not
building a game you're building a
form-based enterprise application a
hybrid approach might be a great way to
go if you need access to things like the
camera and or contacts and calendars
things like that or you know can you can
you get away with the mobile web right
because that definitely has some some
benefits as well you've got you've got
fair performance based on a browser
right you've got limited capabilities
but it's also a paradigm that in our
enterprise we're already very familiar
with with how the web works and how to
access access some of that functionality
so you know what I would say is and as
part of what we did on the aero gear
project is we don't want to make a
choice for you we're not choosing one
approach or over another and I think
it's important that you know you pick
the right answer for your problem and
then be flexible you know things don't
work and one of the people one of the
guys on my team here actually had a
really good example of that you know
Facebook switched from html5 based
applications about a year ago they put
out some some developer blogs and things
like that they they switch from a hybrid
approach to a pure native approach but
at the same time they actually ran into
some problems with that because they
started to be limited on what they could
improve on the server because they had
upgrade times on on the native the
native apps either through the app store
we're just having the functionality
available so they actually fall back to
a to a mobile web approach if something
happens on the server if the version
version numbers are are off right so
that's kind of an interesting example
where they they went native but they
have a mobile web fallback right all
right so let's talk about some of the
tooling that's going to be required for
the mobile web all right what do you
what do you need as Java EE developers
and developers are familiar with these
technologies what do you need to to be
productive with the mobile web I think
first and foremost you need quick starts
and scaffolding and tutorials and I help
you navigate some of the
some of the minefields like you know
viewports and responsive design
principles or device detection things
like that then you know we already have
tooling for restful services but then if
you're going to use projects like jQuery
Mobile for example jQuery Mobile is a a
project that's part of the jQuery
foundation so jQuery most of you
probably already familiar with the most
popular JavaScript library in existence
their mobile project which will show a
little bit later allows you to allows
you to create good-looking mobile web
sites and you might you might want to
have a palette available and we'll show
you what we have it for that for kind of
building an application pretty quickly
so then you're also going to need some
way to to view that mobile website
quickly so that you don't end up having
to you know deploy to a server bring up
a bring up a real phone or something
like that you want to be able to go back
and forth pretty quick and then you know
obviously you know I'm a little biased i
do like open shift which is red hat
spass offering so it is it's also quite
useful to be able to deploy an
application up to the cloud so that you
can easily access it from from your own
device on the same network or from or
you know let your QA department know
about about an update that you just
pushed up to the cloud so that they can
test it so let's go and take a look at a
couple of the demos there now let's see
so this is the same this is the same
HTML file see if I can zoom in a little
bit make a little easier for you so this
is the same HTML file that showed you
that desktop page when you're creating
when you're creating a mobile website
there's a couple things there's a couple
ways to detect your client are and what
your client is so you can know what to
display there's a principle called
responsive design which is where you use
CSS and JavaScript triggers and things
like that to effectively modify your
page on the fly if it's a mobile browser
a mobile browser that's accessing it
another approach is device detection
either server side where you know
there's different projects available for
for detection it'll tell you server side
if you know if it's an admiral add your
Android device accessing your your
server or not there's also client-side
detection which is what we're using here
so we're using a project called
moderniser and let me show you where
that is so right here we have moderniser
it's a JavaScript library that helps
make make determination of the
capabilities of the browser so here
we're using it to determine whether what
the resolution is so in this case max
width of 640 620 the start of a quick
start that we have available on jboss
tools and so you can kind of load this
up pretty quickly and get started and
kind of play around with it yourself so
the other part that I wanted to show you
is that this is actually a jquery this
is actually a jquery mobile application
and so as any as anyone used jquery
mobile anyone familiar with with how to
use it and play with it so in in jquery
mobile you basically set up a bunch of
pages and then you have things like a
header and a footer and things like that
available then you fill in your content
just like you normally do
all right now I'm going to show you what
this looks like actually on a web
browser or on a mobile browser and I'm
sorry see and to do that I'm going to
use I'm going to use a new well
relatively new piece of technology
called browser sim and so with browser
sim what that was was a that was because
the screen resolution of the of the
projector was smaller it basically said
should I truncate or should I go try to
go full size still so here you see the
the web page if you access it from a
mobile phone all right and so this we
have shouldn't walk away yet I need to
point at things so here you have things
like the the side panel there is
actually now in jQuery Mobile just a on
information icon here the list of the
list of developers that exists is right
here still and including that the user
that I added and then of course you also
have the the input field as well right
you can kind of go back and forth with
with home so I'm going to show you how
not only the jQuery palette works but
the live reload as well so what I'm
going to do is split this bozo doing the
QR code yep oh yeah okay so we'll do the
QR code first so those of you who
earlier was able to get a QR code reader
on your phone what I'm going to do is
actually go down to the to the deployed
application and I'm going to go show in
external the web browser on an external
device so what this does anyone who
wants to come forward and or or if you
can get it from where you are this
should actually load a local local
addressable URL to the application
itself does it work you pick it up
he's good clothes max got his to work
but he's the tooling lead so it doesn't
count it work cool excellent so so now
what I'm going to show you guys is that
the live reload will actually function
with all the way out to your devices so
first what I'll do everybody other
people are still trying to use it i'll
give it a second what i'll do is show
you another function another neat
feature of the browser sim so here this
is this is effectively an iphone skin
but there's lots of skins that are
available all the way from different
galaxies galaxies and android devices
other iphones things iPads as well but
the what i want to show you guys is a
pretty neat function again it's just
asking me if I want to truncate what
what we have here and I'll rotate is
this one what we have here are two
browsers with two different skins but as
I as I go through them there it's going
to automatically keep them in sync for
what page you're on now this is really
useful in my in my experience anyway for
checking the CSS in this page structure
because if anyone's ever done mobile web
one of the really frustrating things is
there's always little little changes
right now of course this isn't this
isn't a live device but it gets you
pretty pretty close so the fewer times
you have to go access that live device
the faster you're going to your the
faster you're going to be able to get
out get out updates all right so now
what I'm going to do is for those of you
who got the QR code to work you'll be
able to see this as well I'm going to go
ahead and add a jQuery palette item so
part of what you get with with make it a
little bigger here
with jboss developer studio is this
jquery palette and with this you get all
you get everything all the way up to
full pages and grids which are you know
basically a page layout to specific
buttons and things like that and so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
and drag and drop a I'll do it right
into the home page the content page at
the home i'll put a toggle button in
there i'll just pick a spot and it
brings up a pretty useful wizard and
each each one of those jquery pallet
items will have its own wizard that
allows you to change things like the
label and whether or not it shows is
disabled links that might be might be
available stuff like that so i'm going
to leave it like that and now i'm going
to go ahead and I'm going to save the
save the page and what you'll see and on
your devices if you have it is that the
page automatically reloaded and you see
the jquery pallet item showed up there
including on here and you can see with a
different layout it actually spaced it
differently so as a developer I might
need to go in there and kind of shift
things around or adjust my CSS that type
of stuff I already now for those of you
who got the QR code to work were you
able to see the the live update no you
did ok accent were you on the same page
or maybe you ok I'm not sure would it
work wouldn't we when the phone is
asleep I don't know odd depends on a
browser it's endemic browser should work
yeah refresh the pace and then she'll
pick it up again ok all right excellent
excellent so let's see was there
anything else I wanted to show on this I
don't think so nope all right so let's
go back to the let's go back to the mo
to the slide deck for a little bit now
the other the other part of the
development we just kind of covered the
base that mobile web tooling tooling
functionality we have now we're going to
talk about hybrid application
development and what we can do there
because now of a sudden we're crossing a
gap we're crossing a boundary we're
talking about native development right
we're not talking about objective-c and
android java although we can get into
that a little bit later we're talking
about hybrid application development
where you can use some of the same web
technologies you're used to but using a
project like Apache Cordova for example
we'll be able to show you integrated
tooling kind of make your life a little
easier and get started with that all
right so as I mentioned we are going to
use apache Cordova how many people have
ever built an application with Apache
Cordova same couple of hands keep coming
up all right so Apache Cordova for those
of you who don't know who don't know
used to be called phonegap in fact a lot
more people know that it no it is the
phonegap name and I just threw the image
over on the right because it is it's an
example of one of those hybrid apps so
it used to be known as far as phonegap
but it was donated to to apache and in
apache it was renamed to Apache Cordova
one of the great things about this has a
very strong open source community and so
not only does it have the base the the
base hybrid functionality where you wrap
a website and it provides a JavaScript
bridge in a native functionality there's
also a really strong plug-in ecosystem
where community members have created
different plugins right whether whether
that's for things like PayPal or in-app
purchases Facebook integration different
things like that well talking a little
bit about the aero gear project one of
the projects we have at Red Hat related
to mobile now we're actually creating
some plugins as well and working with
them so I did mention that there there's
some challenges when you talk about
hybrid as well you know like like almost
everything when you're when you're
talking about web technologies and and
browsers it's really a right almost once
and run anywhere right they're really
there in my experience just isn't it
true right once and it just runs
everywhere automatically there's always
some browser tweak
there's always some CSS something that
needs to be modified right and so
there's definitely some of that in in
Cordova as well so as you're as you're
creating an application sometimes you're
going to have to have a little check in
there that says well if it's if it's
this this type of samsung phone I need
to tweak something there's also the
performance considerations I hinted at
those a little earlier and you know you
have to remember that this is at the end
of the day this is still an interpreted
website that's running as a native
application right so if you need live
graphics or you know gaming or really
high performance then you might want to
think about going full native but if you
if you're running a situation where you
have you know enterprise forms or like
an expense system or something like that
if you don't want to maintain multiple
code bases by by target device type then
Cordova could be a good approach for you
and there are others I mean we're just
we're talking about Apache Cordova and
we have some integration for them but
there's others like accelerator and
trigger io that offer and sencha touch
that offer similar functionality so 11
tricky thing with all of those is
tooling and that's the tooling can be a
little tricky with with how to get
access to device api's and how to how to
avoid long dev test cycles right like
I've kind of mentioned in the past one
of the key things is reducing the time
required to test changes that you have
and it's even trickier when you're
talking about device api's because a
browser a standard browser just isn't
going to be able to mimic device api's
and we'll just kind of show you how how
we handle that so one of the things I'm
going to show you is a new new
technology called Cordova sim and that
also has support for live reload it also
has device and API emulation using a
separate project called ripple now this
lets you have a Cordova application and
then basically tweak the brow tweak the
browser
into thinking it's a native device and
you can tweak things like the
accelerometer the geolocation stuff
things like that we also have project
wizards and quick starts all around
Cordova right now we have built-in
support for Android and iOS through
Xcode and we also have the ability to
export a project that's the project
export functionality into a native
either a native Xcode or Android project
and let's jump over and show you some of
those so I'm going to go just go file
new other helps if I spell it right and
we've got a hybrid mobile Cordova
project that we can run through now in
this for those of you who are familiar
with like Apple where you have
application IDs and they have to match
and be be somewhat specific the same
thing does apply here so I'll do Cordova
one in this case and then i'll name this
cordova one and then the IDL do org dot
aero gear now when I go ahead and say
finish here it's actually just went out
and created a Cordova application right
here for me and inside of that we've got
plugins so this is where we have plugins
support so you can you can use some of
the plugins that are available through
through Apache Cordova so you don't
you're not limited to just the the base
functionality there and then this is
this is kind of the neat part in my
opinion anyway this ww folder that's
really the the heart of the Cordova
application that's the web page that
literally is going to be shown when the
application starts up on a device and to
show that when I go ahead
and right click on the project and what
you'll see it's a couple of different
options here you're going to if you you
can run on a physical Android device if
you have it have it plugged into your
machine you can use the Android emulator
which if any of you know the android
emulator does take a little wild out to
start up so we're not going to demo that
one right now or you can you can run it
on the actual iOS emulator right or on
the cordova sim so i'm going to start
with the iOS emulator itself and so
what's going to happen here is it's
actually running through went by a
little fast i think so it actually just
went through an Xcode build you got to
see some of that scroll by it so it
created an actual iOS application
wrapped in the wrapped in this this
functionality now this as you can see up
here is the actual iOS simulator and
this is a skeleton project right this
isn't this isn't meant to have a whole
bunch of functionality so to help you
kind of get started so really what this
one's doing is it's just showing you a
device is ready message so that you know
that it's actually started up well
alright let me go ahead and close that
and shrink that back down now the next
thing I wanted to show you about this is
actually show you the cordova sim itself
and as i mentioned one of the nice
things about is being able to kind of
tweak some of the device the device
api's and so what I've created here is a
very simple Cordova application just
called pong and the index dot HTML 5 is
the html5 the index dot HTML file
contains some additional JavaScript and
functionality to basically show you a
pong game now if I load this up in the
iOS simulator there's that Xcode build
happening right here by the way guys
let's see the Iowa just starting up one
second what you'll see here when this
pops up is is a touch to start and this
is great and I now know my application
will deploy here but one of the
negatives about about the the iOS
simulator itself is that you have
limited access to actually kind of play
with things like geolocation or or the
accelerometer you can change hardware
you can you can rotate you can lock it
you know you can simulate simulate a
keyboard you know different things like
that however if you want to if you want
to get in there and actually modify
modify some of the functionality it's
actually a little easier in my opinion
to just run it with Cordova sim so with
this this is again that's just
truncating because it's it's a smaller
viewport so here what you see is the
cordova sim and it's very similar based
on some of the same the same technology
as browser sim right so you can you can
do screenshots debug enable live reload
in this case there's nothing to really
live reload this isn't a server based
application change skins that type of
thing but what you'll see here is this
is the this is the ripple kind of the
ripple control panel where you can
change things with an accelerometer that
i'll show you in just a minute you can
trigger certain events so if the device
is ready or you know a pause button that
type of thing geolocation network
settings and you can tell it where it is
that type of thing now for this really
simple demo right here the only thing
that really matters is going to be the
the accelerometer here so now you kind
of have to be kind of quick because the
ball kind of moves fast is you can
actually play with the accelerometer and
it will I'm still not very good at it
but so you can see how this will let you
this will let you get part of the way to
not have to load it onto a device
because the emulators on your machine
are going to be a little faster to
access but I mean at the end of the you
are going to have to
finish your development and testing on a
live device as well so let's see I think
that was all the things around Cordova
that I was going to show right now we do
have multiple version support of Cordova
coming up so Cordova as a as an open
source project releases quite quickly so
we're going to have multiple versions
multiple version support kind of like a
runtime manager out there and we do have
a configuration wizard so you can see
here and this is all based on on the
Cordova config.xml so you can modify
things like what functionality you need
preferences splash screens so you kind
of saw some of the different splash
screens that are available to the court
over one is the default then obviously
you can actually just see the straight
XML as well so let me jump over back to
the slides because what I really want to
talk about is what's next in Mobile
tooling because what we have already is
really great but there's something a
little near and dear to my heart which
is the aero gear project and we're going
to be adding more functionality around
aero gear and what we offer their into
tools now did anybody make any of my
earlier talks this this one no couple
all right same hands from before awesome
so the aero gear project was started
it's a it's a JBoss community projects
been around for about a year or so a
little bit more I guess and it's really
dedicated to mobile development the idea
here is that we don't want to make the
requirements decision for you we're not
going to tell you you have to do hybrid
or you have to do native we have support
for everything from mobile web hybrid
and the native Native Client SDK s and
the idea here is that we give java java
ee developers but just developers in
general a common approach a common way
of accessing server site functionality
handling server-side security
integration things like unified push
which which we've demoed a little bit
i'll talk about in a little bit as
well and then other features like that
we're working on like offline data
encryption and and data sync as well oh
so I kind of already touched on these so
so we have a unified push server which
we just released a little while ago I'll
show you a little bit more on that some
security items and we also have of
course what I think is really critical
Doc's tutorials best practices stuff
like that so I do want to talk a little
bit about the error unified push server
because it is something that that as a
project we just released and it has some
really neat functionality basically what
this does is all of the mobile platforms
have some way of doing native push right
the messages that apps get to send you
and say you know hey the new solitaire
tournament started in the like 3am right
I disabled that on my phone because it
was waking me up but for Apple it's
called apns so Apple push network and
for Google Google Cloud messaging and
then another one that we chose to
actually get quite involved in is called
simple push by Mozilla that's for their
new firefox OS operating device that is
coming out and it not only works with
firefox OS but also firefox browsers and
in the similar fashion Google Cloud
messaging works with Chrome browsers and
then Apple push network works with
Safari the project itself the unified
push server is built around wildfly but
it's also available as a service as a
cartridge on redhat openshift am i doing
on time 10 15 so it's also available on
openshift as a cartridge with an
administrative console and everything
else so you can get a get a count on
openshift which is I think I mentioned
earlier is a Red Hat's platform as a
service which lets you launch java ee
applications or or Ruby or rails or you
know lots of different options there
so on openshift you can actually just
stand up your own unified push server
define multiple applications and and
then set up the right credentials and
registration so you can actually control
the push push messages out to out to
your different mobile clients it is rest
based in a rest-based but as I mentioned
we do have an administrative console now
this I'm not going to go through every
step of this just in the interest of
time but the aero gear unified push
server one of the key things it does is
it handles application creation so as a
developer you have to go in and get
certain certain keys right you have to
you have to get an application key an
application secret so you don't want
anybody to be able to trigger push
messages you also have to set up
variants so one thing because it's a
unified push server you can set up let's
say a sports app or an ESPN application
inside of that application you might
have an iOS version you might have an
iOS premium version you might have an
android version or a Firefox OS version
or just a mobile web version for example
so what we let you do is define those
different variants and each one each
system has a different way of handling
handling set up that set up Apple for
examples kind of complex we can talk
about that offline and oh and I right
over here is Matias he's actually led up
the push effort the push unified push
server but what this lets you do is we
have you can set up the different
variants then you go build your
application you go build your mobile app
that mobile app is going to have client
SDKs in it that we provide that will
know how to register back to the server
and then we also have like sender API so
that the J for example a JBoss back end
or really any back-end can trigger push
messages and then filter either by by
user by group by device send it to
everybody lots of different things like
that but that's a different show so
what's the future for
davos tools and aero gear really it's
just more more of the same of what
you've already seen but with additional
aero gear support put in there to give
even more functionality right out of the
box so we're talking about aero gear
push server integration so you'll be
able to stand up a aero gear push server
on openshift or locally with just a few
clicks and then you can configure it
create cordova apps or mobile web apps
that already take advantage of it we
also we also have things like an Xcode
template and android templates to help
you kind of get started on those other
platforms as well for native development
then we'll have a whole bunch of project
specific wizards and for or again the
web native that type of thing we're also
looking at some custom Cordova plugins
right so one of the features were really
excited about is local storage data
encryption so we'll be able to so we'll
be able to securely store data on the
device if the device got lost or
something like that but to use it with
Cordova it'll be a lot easier if there's
a plug-in available so we're going to do
that as well and then just some more
some more functionality like that
basically as much as I can get him to
commit to so here's kind of at a high
level some of the some of the timelines
and and project plans for the developer
studio back in August there was a 70
release that's where the library load
and browser Sam and jQuery palette came
out in December they're going to release
71 which is where you're going to have
full support for things around Cordova
plugins the Wizards the Cordova sim that
type of stuff and then basically next
June or that time it will do another j
VD s release where we'll have a full
aero gear support unified push
integration stuff like that now the
actual aero gear project we actually had
our one dot over lease way back in march
where we added initial crud crud access
so create you know create read update
delete functionality for restful
endpoints as well as some security
integration unified push was just
last August and we're working right now
on security focused release then we'll
be looking at offline and data sync
functionality and we're hoping to have
air gear to die out obviously as a
community project sometime around april
so before i get get two questions one of
the things i always like to talk about
is involvement in open source i really
can't stress enough how important i
think it is to get people involved and
this this this image always kind of I
don't know it kind of struck a nerve
with me because a lot of people say well
I'll commit to that project someday or
I'll put a bug in I know I found it but
I'll do it someday but that someday
never come so what I'd like to do is
just kind of encourage you guys to get
involved with the with the open source
projects that we have we've got a lot of
friendly people on the team not just my
team but but Max's team as well except
for max I'm kidding he's a very nice guy
and so here's your some links on where
you can where you can kind of get
started whether that's github or you
know our IRC channels Twitter or just
following through with our Docs and
stuff like that so with that we've got a
few minutes I think yes we've got 10
minutes for questions and maybe I'll ask
you guys some as well so does anyone
have any questions I know a lot of
people didn't raise their hands as far
as mobile its current mobile experience
all right so then I'll have a question
for you guys how many people have mobile
requirements coming up right you're here
you're you're here for a reason right so
ah that's that's what I was expecting a
lot more hands so so yeah that's that's
definitely something we've seen quite a
bit right so for the most part I don't
know if anyone wants to kind of stand up
it or tell me but are you guys mostly
mobile web looking at mobile web are you
looking at native functionality
undetermined anyone what undetermined
all right
mobile web for sure okay yep great
anyone else hybrid what are you looking
at for for hybrid what was that okay yep
okay all right well anyone else all
right well then I'll let you guys get
out of here a little early looks like I
got the after-lunch slot alright guys
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
