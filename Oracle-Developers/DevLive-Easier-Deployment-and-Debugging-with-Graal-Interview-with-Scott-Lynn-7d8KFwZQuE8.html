Atlanta I'm Bob Probert with the Oracle
technology Network and I'm here with
Scott Lin Scott's one of the session
presenters at today's event Scott tell
me what you do for Oracle I'm in charge
of Oracle Linux product strategy and
what do you do that makes your boss's
nervous in that position more than they
ever want me to do that give me a 120
second version of your session today
127 okay well what I'm going to be
talking about today is how we can take
virtualization to the next layer the
next layer of the stack into the
language environments thereby making
making the the containers much smaller
allowing us to be able to deploy even
more making development easier because
by removing cross language boundaries
and how we can also make deployment
easier because there aren't as many
environments that need to be patched and
updated within a container every time I
need to two containers deployed so so
I'm going to read the title of your
session here it's polyglot development
and deployment through language
environment virtualization that's a
mouthful yeah what does it actually mean
okay you got to break it down so
polyglot language development
if polyglot development is what's really
going on today in the in the cloud space
you have multiple languages being used
because you want to be able to use the
right language for the right job the
right task at hand so for example you
might use JavaScript for a web app you
might use R for data manipulation data
analysis or Scala or some other language
and there's a there's many many
languages today however even in today's
modern environment we have legacy code
and even legacy code can even be just a
couple of years old in some in some
environments where you have Ruby code or
you that you now want to move to some
some other language
which some companies have to do you have
you have your developers want to use
particular languages because they like
them or they feel it's the right tool
for what they need to do but you really
can't support 50 or 100 languages so you
have to limit it to a certain specific
number a certain subset and oftentimes
that's non optimal so what graal allows
us allows us to do this is what I'm
going to be talking about is this new
open source project that Oracle Labs is
created called growl and what it allows
us to do is to deploy virtually any
language in a single environment and
actually deploy multiple languages in
that same environment so you can have a
Java Script for an end that talks to an
AR back-end that's talking to a database
for example and there isn't there isn't
the normal the normal requirement of
creating say a JSON file to actually X
you know send a command over to our
engine and then have the our engine
execute and send a JSON file back with
the data in it you can literally just
transfer the objects back and forth
because they're in the same language
environment so you mentioned it growl is
an open-source paid to it's an Oracle
product but it's open source no it's not
an Oracle product ah okay yeah it's an
Oracle project project so our labs
organizations a lot of people don't know
oracle has a labs organization where we
have people that do pure research and
you know we oracle has a commitment to
the open source community into building
open source and being involved in an
open source we have thousands of
developers that worked on open source
projects every day and the labs about
six years ago seven years ago created
began to create they wanted to create a
virtualized language environment that
you could run virtually any language
inside of to get rid of these problems
and so that's what they did so how can
how can developers get involved in grow
well so first off it's on github so you
can go to get and you can get involved
immediately with it all the source code
is available freely there you can
download binaries from or
Oracle technology Network to get started
and that's that's GRA al for you keeping
score at home yes it is it's actually
Dutch for Holy Grail okay okay so where
are you off to next are you going to be
talking about growl and Kali got
development at other events I am I'm
going actually I'm going to Oracle code
Sydney oh I'm gonna be talking about
we're all there take a couple of books
actually at Sydney there's going to be a
big surprise around girl
oh really yeah I'm not going to say
anything try a drum pad it was away okay
Oh our CL underscore Linux is a twitter
handle that you can follow I'm sure if
this guy has anything to say about this
news about growl it'll show up on that
Twitter stream everyone I've spoken to
about growl has gotten really excited
about it I invite you to take a look at
it go check it out you know you can
google Oracle growl and you bring up the
OTN page so you can find it easily take
a look at it it's you know it's going to
make development debugging it's just
easier it'll make deployment easier and
we really want people to be involved and
add more languages than the you know
eight or nine that we already have so
that it can be used everywhere cool well
you heard it here get involved coming to
you from Oracle code Atlanta I'm Bob
brew Bart this is Scott Lin stay tuned
for more videos from code Atlanta talk
to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
