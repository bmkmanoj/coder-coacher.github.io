Smith's show I'm Laura Ramsey and I have
that Jeff Smith with us here how you
doing Jeff just Jeff will do I'm doing
good good good it has been a big week
welcome to Oracle OpenWorld
2017 we're in the Oracle developers
lounge it's very lounging very
comfortable it is we've got a lot going
on I'll tell you for sure you can see
not only I would think this would be
your favorite demo have you been in
there have you voted early and often
just to be polite I did try the beers
was your favorite the open world beer it
was very well very good
oh one yeah IPA I like the sour as well
okay yeah good well thanks for being
there for us and just to be a team
player yeah take it one for the team
okay so well big week what do you think
of the autonomous database oh they're
gonna start off with the big stuff first
let's go well has the attention of the
entire community I believe DPA seem to
be mixed opinion I'm excited how come
well no one should know more about how
to run a database and take care of it
and keep it secure and keep it up and
keep the data ready for recovery if that
needs and implementing patches than us
and if we're gonna offer a fully managed
service and it should be fully managed
and if I'm a consumer I don't care about
the next patch I just want to know that
it's patched and my stuff is up and
ready to go okay good yeah well that's
the whole that's the whole thing I mean
making it easier on the end-user making
an easy make it easier for them to
develop their powerful apps instead of
spending resources and time on patches
so yeah the
I think DBAs have an exciting
opportunity to do more data specific
management and work and empowering their
developers to get the most out of the
database and they don't have to spend as
much time on what some people call the
janitorial type of work
exactly yeah they don't have to keep the
floors clean they'd eat the design you
know what the next what the next floor
is gonna look like yeah terrible analogy
I did not rehearse that oh well so I
what does it mean for developers though
I mean does it mean that everything is
going to be kind of you're not gonna be
able to get at anything using your
terminal anymore you're gonna have to
just trust that when you click on the
icon things are gonna work I mean it's
it's fully managed but it's it's so
certain things will be locked down we
don't want someone to be able to go in
and nuke a critical directory off the
operating system and then complain that
their fully managed system isn't working
anymore but no they'll have full access
to the data using the same drivers the
same API is named access points as they
always have okay good yeah yeah so tell
me what's new with sequel death so
that's another big question okay wait a
minute wait a minute stop okay you
changed the version number yeah we did
what were you thinking what are you
doing well so we went from version four
got something to 17 got something oh
yeah it's kind of pole-vaulted over yeah
so we so the product Risch originally
came out in December of 2005 right so
that was our kind of version one space
ok for the next 10 11 almost 12 years we
consistently would put out a major
release once a year ah and we would slam
a whole ton of new features and on that
annual basis okay we decided this summer
to start to a quarterly release cycle
right so
every three months give or take users
can expect incremental updates so the
faster access to bug fixes and feature
tweaks and improvements and so the
versioning sequence now will be last two
digits of the calendar year followed by
the quarter okay
are you really gonna have that hoppin of
updates come on it's gonna be kind of
like alright Jeff is like okay I was on
vacation so let's see if we can get we
could get those things in let's change
it from red to grey go the the nice
thing about it is in six years I can
tell you exactly how old your software
is just by the version number you're on
I won't have to memorize when version
3.2 came out versus a version 20.1 I'll
know exactly how oh that is and the
other reason we did it is the versioning
scheme for the database itself is
changing so I think they announced this
week penny Averell did oh what's new in
version 18 yeah database so to follow
that versioning scheme so it's less
confusing to customers they'll know if
they've got version 18 of sequel
developer it should be totally good to
go with version 18 of the database okay
well I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dis
anymore laughs but it does seem a little
bit like a Rip Van Winkle move it's like
what park my car there on Oracle 18 oh
my gosh yeah that was a long blackout
yeah yes so it's kind of fun to mess
with users too late
where were you version 15 is out No yeah
very good yeah very very good all right
so what else is new besides your version
number so a year ago we released our new
command line interface for the database
sequel CL yeah and that's taken off and
we spent the whole week talking to
customers just thanking us for this new
utility to work with they just love it
and we just keep adding stuff to it
yeah good we've built a new JDBC driver
for the DBC okay so first off a won
friends over here all sense for
what JDBC I know what JDBC is but yl
what did I say Oh
logical we build a new JDBC driver for
Oracle oh yeah got it okay that's okay
dvb-c it's Wednesday it's been a long
week SDK nine so it is rest it's at rest
powered drivers that's a type three
driver there's a middleware component in
between your client and the database and
that would be Oracle rest data services
why not so we can now make the database
available via rest via HTTP instead of
having to make access available via
Oracle net or SDI so that is exciting
for us we've got a data source somewhere
that isn't available via traditional
means you can stand up rest Data
Services publish an endpoint and your
java applications that can speak
immediately the same way they always
would using the traditional Oracle
driver nice well it makes it a little
bit quicker and easier few fewer cursor
strikes in order to get at your data
source that's good yeah that's nice
now something that might be exciting for
a broader audience or especially in the
core database spaces we've built a
version of sequel developer that will
run directly in your browser you've been
talking about this for a while has a
very creative name sequel developer web
yay
is it out no what oh but it's soon
enough we can talk about it and show it
off a little bit you know this is the
trade show or we get to say the future
is here and says yay near future
hanzou excited yeah so for our cloud
customers with database services
eventually they'll be able to in their
cloud console give me a worksheet let me
run a query let me visualize my tables
see what's going on let me do some
database administrative tasks and the
keyboard shortcuts the look and feel
will be extremely familiar to anyone
that's already using sequel developer
version more on our version 27
which is about the time that you're
sorry just like 17 dot something 18
dozen well that's great
that's really good yeah so for someone
don't want from one of these developers
right maybe has not had the opportunity
or privilege of working with an Oracle
database before they see this new
managed systems available and they sign
up for it and instead of having to
figure out again the driver stuff the
client installs the config there's just
a link there right in their browser that
welcomes them to their cloud services
okay are you ready to go work with your
data no right so ease-of-use and
accessibility for all of our users but
especially for the folks that are new to
the Oracle stack that's I think good
nice good deal offering that's great I
love to hear it so anything else that we
should be keeping our eye on as you know
on our roadmap oh we're just always
building stuff today we're working on
data loaders we're working on open
sourcing some stuff oh yeah let's talk
about that for a minute well it's not oh
come on
but I will say we have a ton of sample
code snippets that folks can pull out on
our github page okay on the sequel
developer project off of they can have
oracle spot so tons of stuff for people
that are liking the sequel CL right
which opens up things like JavaScript
interaction with your Oracle scripts we
have like 30 or 40 sample scripts up
there we have a Java FX extension for
single developer users that want to see
how our own effect screens work with the
really fancy visualizations and we built
a sample app in there that shows
dependencies between code objects and
we're getting ready to dump out ton of
really cool stuff in there so if you
like our parser if you like our format
or if you want to build that into your
own things that that's the kind of stuff
we're working on very near future too so
that's kind of sample code not
necessarily new features
sample code now and then eventually
things that we use ourselves we will
make available to developers that are
interested in doing the same things
we're doing great well well done that
sounds good sounds really good so what's
new with the Ord s any little update
there since calm couldn't make it calm
he's over there at the beer oh I'm just
he's not there I promise he's talking to
customers at the booth yeah so we have
again version 17.3 of res data services
it's out right now as an early adopter
good ok so fancy way of saying data sure
so if you go to the community page and
to the to the words section there's the
link for that ok and two major features
in there the first one for folks that
build these awesome ap is for the
database and they want to share those
with others and make them easily
accessible and testable we now support a
swagger style API Doc's nice yep
so we produced the jason that's a
swagger 2.0 compliant you paste that
into a swagger editor and you get a
really rich not only just the doc set of
the endpoints but a rest client itself
that you can test them and it also make
it easier for other REST API frameworks
to discover what they can hit on your
side ok good
the other big thing we've developed is a
sequel endpoint that allows you to run
ad hoc sequel appeal sequel and even
limited sequel plus scripts via rest
nice so you can post up an ad hoc query
to an endpoint and words will run that
for you and bring back the results down
in a JSON document which we've built to
power things like sequel developer web
right you have crazy folks like you and
I up there writing select star from
queries and a browser and then we've got
to get that to the database somehow good
so we built that rest point for us we're
making available to other users that
want to use that carefully and securely
nice it could replace things like
database links and applications where
you need to get it from
access to data and you don't know the
sequel in advance right well that's good
yeah yeah good we like to build things
for us and then sometimes share it with
customers that's a good way to do it
because if it's working for you you have
a good head start then you can just like
incorporate you know some of the user
feedback so like with your early access
to ORD s how are you guys collecting
your feedback so you know we're very
active on Twitter yeah we have the blogs
yep but then also in the developer
community site okay
there are forums there and people can
post up their questions really the only
way you can't do it today is via support
because support doesn't support beta but
worse we're very easily found
okay calm slash rest YouTube channel
Twitter feed blog links everything you
need to do every and it's the easiest
URL oracle.com slash rest slash rest go
click on that right now yeah okay well
thanks for dropping by Jeff as Ksenia
I'm excited I'm really sorry that I
couldn't get my the show network running
on the old laptop there because I was
really hoping to next year take a peek
at that next year maybe next event will
let you live demo it for everyone okay
they have a lot of faith in their
development abilities if they think that
I can live demo their stuff as a matter
of fact we've decided that we'll david
peek and i decided yesterday that just
about everything before we release it
it's got to be laura tested and approved
or tested or approved oh i want to
sticker proof by number 27 and whatever
number you want to be thank you ten
number ten I'm a tenth okay all right
well yeah you remember that movie ok bye
everybody Joe thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
