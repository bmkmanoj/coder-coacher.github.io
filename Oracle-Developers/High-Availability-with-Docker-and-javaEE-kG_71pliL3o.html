times don't you go all right okay let me
just press start here right so we know
when it's about to finish ok good
morning everyone so thanks for being
here thanks for for you know first
sessions at javaone let me ask one thing
who wasn't at jag Sunday yesterday a few
of you so thank thanks for you guys for
being one day early at javaone and we
had some very good sessions at Jack's
Sunday yesterday so we're going to talk
here today a little bit about about
containers importance of containers and
you know how how we can use darker in
java ee together and this so this this
session is based on an article that is
online right now so if you want to take
a look that's the URL right here and
it's a it's actually a series of three
articles is going to go that they're
going over at the otn website and it's
just the first article is up I think
they're putting the second article in a
few days and so we're going to talk
about all those things here today and
with me I have two good colleagues here
I have al de morais elder is a java
architect in brazil and he's been
working with java and java ee for a long
time and he's been working with
containers you know for about a year now
right and so put your hands together out
there
thank you and here should my mother side
here i have on drab under a car value he
is his workmen if me a tus cloud for a
long time and he's the guy that's that
implemented hours are container solution
we're going to gonna briefly mentioned
this at some point and so he's been
working with with container darker and
ansible for quite some time now right
and andre is is a java con sutra natsumi
technology so put your hands together
and ran thank you thanks very much and
I'm berna Sosa i'm known as the guy with
the flag and there's a reason why I'm
nonpareils the guy supplied right so you
know and I'm a Java developer for a long
time and I've been I know my main
focusing in its peers help you guys
improve your developer career and I
think that's that's what we're trying to
do here are in terms of with containers
containers are probably one of the best
technologies right now in terms of
career discussions so we're going to
talk a little bit about that too okay
and so you know all of you know java ee
most you know most of you raise your
hand saying that you're using java ee so
you very very familiar if that's with
that image in how we package things with
with java ee right we know we have all
the containers so you know it this whole
discussion about containers it's funny
because we've been talking about
containers on java and java ee for a
long time right so what is what is the
relationship between the java contains
one interesting thing is that this how
many of you remember this image you say
it's java chu ee here right that's from
the Sun time right you know that's
that's how that's how things were shown
at the Sun time when Orko took over
things got a little bit more boring its
exact the same image but it's just like
no no fun no callers so I kind of like
this one here better okay so
you know so so we've been talking about
containers for a long time and the whole
discussion here you know what the idea
that we have in terms of containers is
that you know you you package your
application and there's a lot of things
your application needs that you don't
package with it right so you packed your
application and then it's just the
smallest thing that you can have that's
that's you know different from whatever
he's in the container and then you can
easily move your application from one
container to the next container right so
so makes things a lot easier instead of
we moving things like big stuff we just
move what we need our application is
right that allows this whole discussion
of containers is what allowed java ee to
be available everywhere lots of
different servers and i'm just showing a
few here but you know you guys we're
going to use Tommy end up in the demos
so you know you can actually have you
can move your application from from
those different containers very easily
because on the application of what your
packaging all you have is the
application itself right only the
container has lots of more stuff but you
don't have to carry all those things
around that's really good it's very
helpful we do this all the time in our
houses right you know when you open up
your refrigerator I'm sure there's lots
of little containers there right because
you pack things inside so you can take
from the refrigerator put in the
microwave take off the microwave put it
put somewhere else it's very easy to
move things around and and so on the
softer word we also have this same
notion in Java EE word now the problem
is that ok so we're moving things inside
inside containers moving from one java
ee server to another java ee server it's
more or less easy not not not such a big
problem but there's many more other
things right you know we have os's and
we have the application server itself we
have a lot of libraries we have the job
of it or machine we have a lot of
configuration that needs to learn need
to do so if we're going to move so it's
easy to
but if we just set up this whole
environment it's not so easy it said you
have you have all this work that you
have to do to configure on your
application server again and in another
place so if you want to move you know
instead of moving from from wide fly to
weblogic or something like that if you
want to move from I don't know from
amazon to your laptop or vice versa
right make sure from your laptop drama
so I might make more sense or if you
want to move you know if you if you have
some you know you could have something
running your laptop and going to put on
a test machine or test server it's it's
a lot of work to recreate this
environment right and and lots of things
can go wrong and everything so we have
you know we have thought about maybe one
interesting teen that we could do is we
could pack things even more right so we
are packing things inside and inside the
jar and the ER file the war file maybe
maybe we can pack more stuff inside a
container right so baby so basically
that's when the soft the softer
containers came about in darker well
actually softer containers are not a new
thing they've been around since they're
late late 70s or early 80s we have we
have containers more recently i remember
when i was working at sun sun had you
know on solaris and open solaris it had
some irish zones there was a pretty cool
container technology all of this was
really good but let me ask one question
here who here who here consider yourself
a developer write code yes okay that's
javaone right most of us are here now
who here consider yourself operational
guys you see very very few right that's
normal so those guys are raised their
hands they know about containers for a
long long time right because continuous
has been mostly an Operations thing
right a lot of time so we've seen many
many times you go to your company and we
start talking about containers and it
develops like oh we have no idea what
that is it's very cool and then you go
talk to the operations guys say oh yes
we were used
energy right every time we give a veto
machines or developer it's not a visual
machine it so it's a container and they
just think the virtual machine so yes it
is the operation is know about
continuous fog reform for usually longer
but for us developers containers are new
because they're really there weren't the
past they were really hard to work with
right it was hard you know those guys
know very well it was you know it's it's
yours even solaris zones there's
actually very easy it was pretty hard
you know it was hard to use it was hard
to package things and it was especially
hard to move things around it's not so
it's so cool to move things around so
then that's when docker came about
doctor showed up you know maybe two
years ago about two years ago and and
doctor came with a proposition there was
you know that we should standardized or
actually they came up with a good
packaging for container so docker
doesn't use anything you know that's
that didn't exist before so a lot of
people think oh it's darker ready for
prime time well dr. use linux container
that's been around for a long time so no
should she should be okay to run but
what dr. introduce it was a packaging
standard right there was the exist
before so now I was so the same thing
that that happened I think this is the
similarity with java ee the same thing
the java introduce you to introduce war
files and ER files that allow you to
packaged applications in move your
plication from one container to the next
that's what docker did write it created
a packaging standard that allowed us to
well he wasn't a standard right and when
you start it was just a doctor how
packaging but now everyone uses it's an
open-source everyone uses everyone
agrees that's a good one or it's a
reasonable at least so it's you know
it's available everywhere and that's
that's what makes it powerful especially
when we are talking about you know we're
going to talk about in a minute how this
how does benefit but if you think about
the words the real
containers right when you're talking
right after the Second World War you
know even you know doesn't want to talk
about like those big metal box is right
that you put things inside you all know
y'all here know how we we ship it things
before containers existed right because
you all here watching Titanic right so
you remember Titanic and Jack and Rose
they're running under the ship and
they're like you know their hand in the
ending mirror or in the glass of the car
you all remember that scene right the
thing that you may not remember very
well is that behind them there's all
kinds of boxes and things tied up by
ropes and gnats and all this kind of
things because on that time the way you
move it things around major shipment
things was putting in all kinds of
different size of boxes and put one box
by box inside you inside the ship and so
you have to tie things up you know in a
in a specific away and put things in the
right way and that was time-consuming it
was hard you know you're expensive to do
you have more a lot of labor to do these
kind of things right and then what
happened right after the Second World
War we came up with a standard right
what is this thing what can have a big
box instead of lots of small box let's
put a really big box and so they you
know you can imagine that you know he
started a big box was this big and he
thought the big boxes this big and
someone else had the people cause this
big and so at some point we agree okay
let's have the same size of big box and
we put everything so now it's easy to
put things inside right so he might put
bicycles inside the container he might
put me inside the container he might put
I don't know toys inside a container and
it is easy in the dogs there's a guy
with a big crane that he moves box
around he doesn't care what's inside it
seems very interesting that once we have
that competitive rement we jump it from
you know containers today it's so
important that lessons about six percent
of the ships in
word Carrie containers and they carry
ninety percent or everything that we use
so that's how powerful the shipping
industry become because they
standardized on the size of container
what why I'm talking about real shipping
because that's exactly where we are
right now right we're we finally
standardized it or we agreed on a size
of a box for softer containers and if
you think about this year you know 2016
it's when google announced you know put
up there i think i think they did a lot
in the last month of 15 but you know in
the last 12 months google announced
their container ships right amazon
announced the container ships early this
year who else microsoft put their
container ship through early this year
so we're in the first level in of the
first wave of container ships right the
first continue the real the first real
container ships were able to carry
hundreds of containers today container
ships are able to carry tens of
thousands of containers right so that's
what we are in the software industry
right now we are the first ships of
containers and a lot of things going to
happen the next few years a lot of
things going to you know a lot of a lot
of people are not using containers today
a lot of people have to lots of
different or lots of questions it's
secure it's it right way right way to do
it and so in the next few years
containers are going to completely
change the way we deliver software right
because because once you're able to
packaging and what what this has to do
right you know we're talking about you
know you think about those few guys who
raised their hand I think most of them
are right here there is a hit their
operations guy right how do they work
it's like okay so I have to you know you
say your developer developers won't
change your right and the operation guy
wants stability so you are developing
they say okay you know we're doing this
Java thing right we're going to run
application or Java VM and the
operations got okay so Java VM I know I
start like this I stopped like this I
back up the java TM this way I know how
to do disaster record that's okay that's
good
and then you say okay so now we want to
use this application server so can we
use wide fly or glassfish here okay
while I'd fly glass fishes that run on
top of the JVM okay so I kind of know
what to do this a little bit more
difference I learned how to do this I
arranged things I came back up with
backup things okay I know how to handle
the application of server that's good
all right I can do that okay so can we
run out now this PHP application well
PHP well page p is a paci right so i can
just run a patch the same thing okay we
can run PHP and then sir oh we have this
now cool stuff here is going to be to do
a small package that we want to do lets
you use Ruby oh no no no stop now I'm
not going to use Ruby I've learned a
Java I've learned java ee I've learned
apache i'm not going to learn everything
that you guys throw at me let's
standardized things right now we're
going to have this one you know this
particular version of java this
particular version of tradition server
you can't run anything else because
you're making a big mess here from our
confusion for me right isn't that how it
works and now we are stuck in Java 15
right that's never gets upgraded because
the operations guys say oh you know you
can't do anything like this so what
containers bring to the table is that
you know once you have the containers in
place once you have the cranes they're
able to handle the containers your
operations guys it can handle containers
so if you get a job application put
inside a container you get your your
java application put inside a container
you get your PHP application put inside
the container you get a ruby application
put inside the container you give to the
operation guys the container right so if
they know how to start the containers
stop the container how to backup the
container how to the disaster recovery
the container how to get the container
just learning locally and moving to the
cloud how to run the container on amazon
and assure at the same time right they
know how to do all those things because
they have the tools to run all that and
once they know all these you know you
are free to innovate as much as you want
inside the container and the operational
guys are free to handle
manage the containers as much as they
want right so I think this is the
business every everyone here start you
know the one of the bigger words it's
that we see everywhere it's DevOps right
you know everyone talking about DevOps
and there are some companies they're
doing DevOps in an interesting way they
get everyone they put everyone the same
room and they say okay so this is the
small team here and you will handle
everything right that's a good way of
doing their fault because then you don't
have that and ops you just have one team
the worker when most of us are not not
not working like this right most of us
have a dev team and an obscene and we
are now trying to work together what is
the best way to work together containers
right because contain is the right
interface between operations and
development instead of for you we have
like this crazy weird interface that we
know I sent your jar file in you run
wherever you are and that doesn't work
very well when sing like that you know
we have the rights the rights the right
interface and so now we can work better
together so that's why it's so important
to do this now the thing is when you're
trying to do containers right you're
already doing Java EE so okay so how I'm
going to start right there's lots of
different ways we're going to talk about
some other crazy things that you can do
but you know how do you start them let's
make a very simple step-by-step way that
we can start getting your job the
existing java application and put inside
a container just so you can see how that
works ok oh yes or whatever how that
came back so can you hear me it's ok ok
so let me show you a little a little
demo very simple demo how do you get a
start we should talk it and you have
your first containers burning in a head
available environment ok so first of all
you need an image dr. English ok so New
York up on occasion yeah you need of
course you need our exact job
application so you have your job
application already raining maybe I war
file or jar file
foil okay so we will build a new tummy
image running your application here so
you choose our application here is java
one app dot war will tell the doctor to
build this image and we will give a name
to this English ok so here we are
customizing I image with Tommy Apache
Tommy and I will show you how with my
application could be your application
your application that's running right
now you could put a replace on these
comments and create a new image with a
passion at the end of the comedy we have
a dot right there this dot is showing to
the doctor that we have a docker file
here is what's the other match q happens
here so we are telling the darker how it
should build our G's image is a partial
Tommy English ok the most important part
is the beginning very beginning from
comment this from common is telling
docker hey doctor we have added a docker
hub image partial Tommy English that is
already done it's a very beaut so we
don't need to start from scratch ok we
can he use a image that's already
already done and keep customizing it for
our application ok so at the second we
have they add comments OD service xml
file where we put some setup for high
available environment ok so we'll
basically we have a cluster a partial
Tommy cluster then we put tomcat users
files you have some users for
administration we have Tommy xml file to
put our data sources the jdbc jar file
for posturing at the end of the comment
we have an environment variable where we
informed previously
our application we are set things up
here okay so we have actually to the
comment so we built our come in ish so
okay we have a mission right now how
this image will begin in a container we
can create containers so basing it on
our own image okay so it was dr. Koh we
have a name we expose the ports and base
it all Tommy award at the end we want a
cluster so we will do it three times
could be ten times Saul 12 times and we
put a lot of balancer here the
interesting interesting here is that we
don't need to build the image as we did
with our Tommy English we can he use
directly from the docker hub so in the
end we have a peg because I don't need
sure to customize this toy in jenks load
balancer so we just refer to him to it
and build our image for our our
container for any jokes ok so we link to
our hosts or partial Tommy houses and
then we have oh let me show you we have
that any file argument it's we can can
work with the environment variables in
the decree h of the or containers so we
have these variables pointing to our
containers and give you a name to our
application so the daily junks could
could could see that our container ok so
then we start our containers that we we
are ready created we split the create
and the starch steps we could do it in a
with just one step we using dark around
so it creates and start the containers
in the same way all right so at the end
we have is the architecture we have a
browser pointing to our application we
have an older balancer point to our
three hoses
apache Tony all right so i will show you
right now this little little devil
raining here okay crazy part
you guys see this let's just mall yep
there's my lose my eyes are fine it's
okay so first of all we need to build
our our image let me check
this is a comment that i'll show you
that will built our image so just run it
interest part that you may you may
notice we have these steps and the
doctor is saying removing that may
intermediate container removing to make
each container darker uses container to
build containers okay so in each step
that that it's wrong it will do a yellow
container and it's a graduate to to
another steps this is important as if
you have a new version of your
application and you reboot the image dr.
doesn't need you to run all the steps
again he will cash these steps that
don't doesn't change that didn't change
and just run the step date change that's
your application it's just two
interesting things on this that as you
can see we are we are putting the
application inside the container so as
first of all is the last step of the
dockerfile is the epic is adding the
application so what we are doing is that
we're not having an image that we add
the application when it's running we are
we are building what we call an
appliance that is an image that has
application of course it's a simple
plication but it could be a very
sophisticated configuration so your
application is already configured
running inside the container so you
don't need a step to install the
application to contain when it's already
running so you're going to do the whole
thing at one thing and we're adding
applications the last step that means
you know once you once you put this in
your beauty I plane you don't have to
recreate the container then the whole
image every time because doc are going
to cash and all these steps and just
going to add the application in the end
so it's it's a it's a good way to do it
so once we have the image we will create
the price the containers let me show you
can i push it okay so this is the
becomes this we just show you so it
creates three a partial Tommy come
containers and one any giant load
balancer so okay my containers are just
created and i will start them
so we're now they are starting it up
three containers anyone oh I'm sorry
okay don't start okay let me show you
so very simple is showing you the
diabeetus is answering that request and
the the load bars will do our router
robbing they are already starting to
make the Kawara
not the other so the IP is changing and
17 when is to starting okay we are good
morrow so the for two to three so the
the load balance in our is doing the
road robbing and showing who is
answering that request so we have this
this architecture is very simple demo
okay but showing you this hi available
environment verse very few comments very
simple way very fast we can run for
containers in livermore just your
computer okay give back the war too
brutal and so one of the things that
that it's it's hard first of all he's
running on his laptop right so he's
running a full you know like four
machines in his laptop and containers
are it reuses the kernel of the
operation sister you're using so they
are very light so it allows you to do
developments in a very easy way and now
once we have those containers we can we
can we can do the next thing that is
move them choo-choo much where of course
it's one you don't have high
availability not in a single laptop
because laptop fails everything goes God
goes no everything's appears right but
but you can now move the same containers
to a real environment where you can
separate these containers in multiple
machines and then that's where the
orchestration tools come out come get
the things even more interesting because
the orchestrations to skin separates
those containers in different machines
even automatically for you so we got to
talk about this in a minute but you know
it's really good you can actually have a
complete environments with everything
that you need for your development
machine and now if you're going to do
this testing for example let's say you
have your Jane
Gene's doing your beauty pie plying you
can have the same containers run your
test your test environments you can have
the same container to run your QA
environments it's much easier for you to
handle the whole pipeline like this now
one of the interesting things is that
you know if you if you're going to do
well the most interesting thing that
we're talking about earlier is the
packaging right containers allow you to
package those applications right and so
and the biggest innovation that darker
are did was probably not not simple to
packaging but the idea that once you
have an application that's packaged you
can now put put those packages available
somewhere right and how a list of
existing pre-configured containers that
you can reuse right so you basically
have like a huge amount of container
that that's either you develop and you
put in your own register or it's
available for you because other people
did like open source containers today
you have I'm not sure if you guys took
notice of this but Oracle did this
announced it yesterday on the key nodes
that they're going to have like the Java
you know jobs going to be available in a
darker image right so as far as I
understand orc was going to have their
own register right where you can
download the java vm if you go for red
hat for temp red hat terms have the
wrong register with all the Red Hat's
products for template you can download
as a container image but you know you
can also go to dr. hub there is the the
center where you know everyone has can
put your containers there so you know
you have rested for Amazon hyper as soon
as you have had their own registry
Google have their own rest so you have
we have more and more registries where
we have those containers those images
ready to run put available and if you
if you do if you need a development
pipeline you do a report artifact
repository like Nexus or act artifactory
those guys today they they also have a
doctor registering side so you can
actually put your you know the ends of
your build process can be a container
image that you upload your naxos
repository for example and then when
you're going to put visiting in in for
testing or QA or production you can
actually download this from your next
report story and run it locally in your
in your environment so containers of
make it very flexible for you to package
your whole application move the
application to different places the same
thing that you did before with your jar
or ER file on your application server
right that you would have the
application certainly you download your
jar file from your nexus a report story
just to run it now you do much more than
that you have the whole thing your whole
infrastructure actually you can have the
whole you know the whole package all the
containers are you using together to
make that run so if that's if that's
like this a the application that elder
showed was very simple just a simple
application that doesn't have any
dependents and everything we can we can
do better than that right so let's say
you know we have the term application
server like we just get one of those
containers from one of those registries
and you know every application requires
a database so let's get a post agree
container for another Institute for
example every application every
corporate application also requires some
kind of messaging curacao so there is a
very cool activemq container and they
have everything together we can use but
you know today the best applications
today I also do no sequel right so let's
get a Cassandra no sequel container so
we can connect all of those guys right
and together we just reuse those those
ready to use containers and we can have
a much more sophisticated architecture
just by reusing infrastructure that has
been created either
because you created before you know in
your prepackaged those containers and
you put in your registry or your
downloading from dr. hub or whatever
other rest are you using right of course
you know we also we're going to keep our
in giant load balancer and pointing to
all of those our Tommy eat containers so
you know you can have this whole
infrastructure that we can run right now
once we r going to show this in a minute
but i'm just going to going to finish
the slides here but so once we have all
of these that's a cool stuff is that we
can we can now have a several ships
right there are providing container
infrastructure several ships that are
providing you know the tools and the
cranes that we need to actually manage
our containers so i just put a few of
them here some of them are open source
some of them are products that you can
tell you can acquire you know as I said
amazon has there's their container
service up and running google has it a
container service up and running if you
want to do also IDM does the same it's
going to do an open source a project for
example an open shift is running with
Cuban et's you know so you can have an
open source infrastructure you can run
your containers so basically right now
the biggest probability that we have
there is have to start doing in our
projects is to start implementing those
you know those containing platforms
inside our companies so our operations
guys can actually manage and run all of
those containers because of course it's
really good that you can you can package
things in a very big iron box but what
happens if you get to the docks and you
only have people carrying or carrying
big boxes right so you're just going to
have you know those is all people to
carry you aren't one box and that's not
going to be
right actually going to be even more
it's going to be even harder right so we
do need to implement those those
infrastructure we have open source
infrastructure like open ships and
communities for example we do have
products you know oh I don't think I
mentioned that so jeal astok is a breeze
is a product for example it's an
orchestration to that that is a product
that you can that you can install and he
orchestrates all your machines so once
you have those organization tools then
you can decide where your containers run
or actually you can even let the
infrastructure decide where the
containers run right so both cooper
needles or jelastic or openshift they're
going to do you know you're going to
upload your containers you're going to
set the parameters that you want and
you're going to latch that there are the
infrastructure manager we use jelastic
in our in our continuing for structure
all docker images the cool thing about
you have an orchestration to like
jelastic is that once you know jelastic
has or what we call what they call a
live migration of containers so
basically once you start saw your
container the infrastructure decides
where the container is going to run in
all the machines that you have available
so if a machine fails its since you have
the live migration feature it
automatically restart your containers
you not know the infrastructure down
losing data I doubt losing even your
session of your users right so users own
don't realize we are able to do today
things like migrating from one cloud to
the other so you can you can get your
container in migrated from let's say
from from asier to Oracle cloud for
example or from Oracle cloud shochu
amazon you can migrate a container live
he doubts you know it migrates are the
same IP keeps the same connections he
migrated out the data that's in memory
right so you know those the
orchestration tools allow the operation
guys to handle the infrastructure any
way they want right because they're the
ones are going to decide where things
should run where
how big the machines are words the cloud
provider you going to run ads it's going
to run in house or external you know you
put in their hands of the operation guys
all the operation that you need right
but developers can actually create their
containers and put the containers of
another thing that you can do with the
orchestration tools is that you can
separate your environments you know you
can have like a developer environment a
QA environment in production
environments with difference and you
know different users have an access to
each one of those environments so you
can do things like for example you can
migrate your you know you're having a
developing environment you developers
are experimenting with things once
things are ready you can migrate that to
your QA environment and so once it's in
QA environment developers don't have
access to that anymore and the QA guys
can actually work through this the same
thing for production you can actually
move things into production and just the
operation guys we have access to that so
and then you're going to move everything
your application needs not only the your
jar file wherever absolutely everything
the application needs right so with that
of course we are here at all open ward
and orch was talking about a lot about
Oracle cloud there oracle has acquired a
company that's thus are coached
container orchestration so you're going
to very soon you're going to see their
orchestration tool also so but we're
going to show how we can get the same
contained an example the same contains
the runny on elders machine and we're
going to run this on a cloud environment
you know so actually just show here to
know you're going to help of course your
your your cloud environment is going to
have some kind of orchestration tools or
kind of some kind of management in this
case here we're just starting and
environment and we're going to run this
exactly same containers on Oracle cloud
just to show how that works okay we're
going to show
switchr his left over there let's see if
it works so because the debate yes go
ahead keep preparing you but because the
biggest benefit that we have with
containers is how is is to ease our
shipping process right in wish when we
ship we're going to put in a different
environment than our develop so he
developed in his laptop we're not going
to put in production on on a cloud
server and it's not showing over there
you know realize that right so we're
going to put in a call on a cloud
environments and and we're going to
download this these containers since
Moses but in we're going to show here
okay no so we're going to show here all
of the you know we're going to download
all those containers from docker hub
right because we're not we don't have
our own rasa here there's a question yes
we can Nexus Nexus or artifact sure but
next we use an axe in particular but yes
you upload your whole the whole binary
of the images right so on so naturally
this is yesterday a doctor registry
basically right so it uploads all the
layers of the images and so it's a whole
binary off the image itself and so when
you when you're going to do this thing
here I'm not sure we didn't show this
but I'm going to show we're going to
download the image right did your i
downloaded right so there are done well
okay so so when you when you name an
image on Darkar its go so ration
download the image to run your on your
machine right so you can you can that
reg ready download true from you can
point your Nexus server and then you
download from your next to server
instead from docker hub okay hi everyone
good morning
I will start yes you can have to load
okay then you notice I can't you hold
I'm tied here okay yes you hold hold for
him its technical problems with the mic
let's do an assh to oracle machine we
have a prepared instance to to run the
containers let's start running the
containers I have to remember the
command somehow
dr. Ron dash dash name post Greece we
were starting their post agree DB SQL DB
we said we are setting the port oops
there's mistake here I said that image
name is post Greece javaone so that's so
that's the image that you prepared to
run here right yeah it's it will runs in
foreground I will just
it's easier to see
let's run the activemq container
this machine is an Oracle Linux 68
a pre-installed docker here
so you are downloading another machine
from from from dr. hub right not another
image for local hub and now we will run
Cassandra DB
sup a genetic specific operational
let's accelerate this a little bit let's
make a copy paste from here yeah so all
of these all of the commands and all of
this those images and everything is on
is on on github right so you know if GUI
it's all here all the commands are here
yeah so if you wanna if you want to take
it you know I saw some people people
taking pictures before but you can go to
github and you can download all of those
images out all those files and you can
run all these yourself right yeah so
let's do copy paste my things better
than you so you're so you're running the
Cassandra imagine right
now I run Tommy application image it is
a tummy with the with the application
oops yes it's this one
over n 3 comments at us here will be
okay master musician you have helped to
beauty image first okay that's one one
thing that would think that we didn't do
here is that elder did not how did you
not upload his finish image to docker
hub right let all right instead of
instead of we download you from dhaka
have the imagery just going to build
here but if we had an axis container
connected then we could we could do this
almost redo the image i have a preview
image you have a preview okay so drawn
this let's run this instead of the are
dressed test yes okay and this is test
you have LG boots oops i forget the user
okay nope typo right
oops
oh you're in the wrong machine yeah this
happens a lot okay when when you go to
the wrong machine that's that's hard to
do that thing's works okay all right
okay now it works okay okay so now you
created it created containers right so
again all these is on github and he's
just going to create the end Jax
container to be the load balance for
everything and now we can access the
application
sorry
I don't Oh get hub all right okay yeah
so el de morais that's yes let's just
just finish working here and run
ok just this one hour and so Ronnie no
absolutely okay demo modes okay so
basically we still have a few minutes
for questions here but basically we the
whole idea is that it makes very easy
for you to opportunity to create our
infrastructure and move your
infrastructure you know from your
development environment to your test
environment to your production
environment even two different cloud
providers right and why he's to working
here let me go welcome to questions so
you I'm just going to put the you around
a minute as soon as you finish here so I
so everyone can see question here right
okay so basically what we're doing here
so so Tommy we really told me to do the
simple demo because Tommy's you just
need to copy the jar file right but if
you're if you have a more sophisticated
way to install it in weblogic for
example you could do the same thing
right you could but you you're going to
have to use whatever your application
server needs to install the application
but usually what one you usually do is
that what we do today right is that you
create web logic application server for
example you install it and then when you
have a new version obligation you upload
this new version application chewed up
to Ronnie a weblogic right so what we
are doing here is that we are creating a
immutable server that's the container
right so so basically when we start we
configure the container on your doctor
file you would do whatever weblogic
needs installed application on weblogic
on your container and then you're going
to generate an image with that
application already installed on
weblogic right and once you have that
then instead of starting a weblogic and
then install your application whenever
you need for example you're having too
much traffic in your website you need a
we need to show handle more you just
start a new image with your application
right installed but it's specific to
your question how do you install
weblogic you need to use whatever I'd
logic provide you to install it right so
you can you can run do some darker no
problem it's not it's not a problem for
you to run whatever it is but on tomcat
is easy because it's just copy your
files okay I think he's French
export what no no I have nots okay but
okay yes okay we can show that so so his
question is no the Ranger have user
Ranger so and if we can show how you
orchestrate things yes we can show that
let me can you log into yes so I'm going
to go to the next question why he logs
into two can show to log into jelastic
JC okay so he's going to log in and I'll
get back to you next question there
isn't someone here right here okay so I
have to repeat crash of course so his
question is about licensing and in how
oracle license change so so licensee is
important you have to consider because
you are installing and running or
whatever vacation so so if you're
running an open source project you
should you don't have to worry but if
you're running something like oracle
weblogic on water code database or even
oracle java right you have to worry
about the licensing and i don't know
what the licensee is for weblogic in
particular but Oracle has been
announcing that they are moving and to
create their own doctor images for
everything so they have creator docker
image for java there are created dr.
images for for oracle database in
weblogic and so actually Bruno Borges
has a oracle weblogic docker image so of
course if Oracle provides that to you
they're going to provide analyze that
allows you to run right the one thing
that you probably cannot do is download
yourself Oracle put in a midget and well
actually let me rephrase that you can if
you have a license for oracle database
for example weblogic you can install or
web lodged in a container and put the
container in you're interning for
structure what you cannot is get that
contain an upload that container to dr.
hub for example you cannot do this
because then you would be distributing
or weblogic and you don't have the
license to do that right but you can do
this in your internal infrastructure if
you know if you have a license for the
product so but if Oracle provides you
the container then you know it it's
whatever lies that they have but I don't
know the details of Oracle's license in
particular right but in terms of work or
you can use work or glass efficient that
works fine okay hmm yes we have we do
okay now the judges see it did you say
yes
sent a notice college essay toast large
okay yes right so more questions here so
we use we use jail asking our
environments so tues cloud uses jail
elastic in our environments but we know
we do have several custom running with
dr. swarm as an orchestration tool we do
have customers using Cooper Neely's
orchestration tools but we ourselves in
our infrastructure use yes okay actually
I actually I'm think we're going to have
because we don't we're running out of
time I'm going to have to show you later
okay but basically ah or let me see if I
have time to where's my phone is there
any more question why I tried to log in
here yes go ahead
okay that's a very good very good so
what we are doing here in the demo it's
a very simple thing that we are
specifying the name of the containers
right so his question is if we're using
ancient engine acts how do you specify
the names of the 702 several containers
of the servers to do this so we are
using a very nice engine max load
balancer that it has different
configuration the one we are using here
is that we just pass in the name of the
containers right and so yes just the
name of the containers and its its load
balancing on all those containers but
the same the same image allows you to do
a dynamic process where you know if you
name your container you don't have to
have any configuration with your name
your container in a certain way it
recognizes that those containers when
they when they get up right because it
keeps looking at the darker the darker
events you know so so when a container
comes up it sees that the container
comes up and add to the load balance
automatically so you can do both ways
yes right so in then you can again it
can automatically redirects for the
containers that you name it okay right
so what did the configuration that we
did here is a very simple one it's fix
it right so we have just three
containers and we fix it is all right so
they're not going to keep me out of the
room right are we can I just show one
quick thing it's okay so before you know
laughs because the time we have we have
one minutes yes we have one minute let
me see if I can log in here so
here
bloggers know gaming here
you
surface ok so there's one more question
there before everyone leaves because
we're out of time so if you like the
talk vote for us if you didn't like to
talk come talk to us and complain okay
so question huh
mm-hmm
okay so yes okay right
okay so so so the first question was you
know how do you how do you manage
resources so we're going to show this in
a minute how you know assuming assuming
he logs in right here but we're going to
show in a minute how we can manage and
other resources and how you can you can
do in terms of the load balancing
particular as i said before you you know
depending on the configuration for your
load balancing and in about monitoring
you can have either you can have
monitoring on your orchestration tools
or you can add monitoring you know you
can have other containers they're going
to monitor your containers you can you
can you can do a more sophisticated for
structured right so in terms of I'm
sorry I'm mrs. o generous okay so so in
terms in terms of jelastic first of all
you talk about stateless contain just
really that's an interesting thing
docker is a stateless container so that
means you know if the container dies if
you lose all the information in the
container but doc is not the only
container solution exists right so
jealous uses although you were truth
with darker packaging uses underneath it
uses the vetoes or containers from
openvz and they are actually stateful
containers right so you could do a
stateful content but we are basically
using darker and we can we're managing I
stateless containers but even when
stateless containers what gel ask does
it migrates you know when he migrates
containers from one machine to the next
he migrates memory and data and
everything right so even if the
container is stateless why is to alive
you can migrate from one machine to not
to the other keeping all the information
okay so yes so so this is like an
orchestration tool so that's the so you
know you have for example someone asking
about you know can you see the
containers in the machine so you know
you can you can have machines in all
different zones right so so here we have
machines and all kinds of difference
difference harder zones here different
different cloud providers so
can see there is a DAB glasses a sure
there is ova there's lots of different
different clouds in another place so
these are the hardware actually and you
can see in anyone in this hardware you
can see for example all of the
containers they're running on this
particular hardware and you can manage
each one of the discontent is you can
actually see each one of the containers
here and you know kind of drill down on
to see how much memory it's runny you
can actually put limits for for users
how many I know how much memory or how
many containers are things like that a
user can can manage so so no you those
are the kind of things are you going to
be able to do you know either on on i'm
just showing one here but you can do
this on cou benitez you can do this on
the dock or swarm the more and more
advanced that those tools become the
easy going to be for each of managing an
orchestration all that ok i'm not sure
if that's you know just a quick quick
show because we're totally out of time
here ok guys thanks very much thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
