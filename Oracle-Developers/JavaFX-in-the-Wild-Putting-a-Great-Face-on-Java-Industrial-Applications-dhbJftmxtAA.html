with a company knowing kolel say college
group and here it would be presenting
two works we've done in the last few
years in Spain in the door for Spain so
i will be talking about javafx as a
clean part of a n2n present application
then a in to industrial fields one is a
port in the north of Spain the other
will be a building where we are
monitoring damage in this building so
okay i will talk about these two
applications they have the common ground
they are end-to-end applications in
which the clean is a in july effects and
we have the server side with a java
yessir okay i will talk about two
applications the first pro yet it's this
user interface we have therefore the
port of santander the second project
will be this and write for monitoring a
building first of all let me present you
with a few slides the adults a group in
Spain okay so a colored say is a small
company but already more than 30 years
in the market in Spain in the north of
Spain we have a leading company in our
area giving turkey solutions security
telecommunications pretty diverse c5 in
certain technological areas and excuse
me for that because it was supposed to
be a wired connection that is not
working so it's only Wi-Fi may be doing
the webview am using here in this del FX
slide is not working properly it takes
sometimes to load okay so this is the
web page
this is the actual webpage I invite you
to look at it whenever you want so many
areas security fire alarms
telecommunications competing products
climate installations tansen media
services integral maintenance renewal
energies and the part where I come in is
somewhere sorry about that so we're
enter key solutions integrating and to
end up applications okay so let's move
to the fs pro yet ok so just few slides
to present a city where is a philly this
project isn't and there in the north of
Spain maybe you know about this place
because it's very useful people coming
from many countries to visit the city so
this is the port a there are the bay and
we have here the port
okay this is an actual picture from
around two years so this is the ferry
already there on the port and that is
the terminal and I will show you later
that's a pole along this building's
there are several a offices and checking
boots and so on so okay there is this
company this maritim intercarrier
between a brittany france or england
france and spain has this Ferris this
very big ferris I can do it with Wi-Fi
right now thank you so it takes as you
see forty thousand cars a year to two
hundred thousand passengers per year
more or less and this company's you know
that they look for a ports where they
can a they can make more profit so if
the port doesn't move to new
technologies or new buildings new
equipments the terminal gets old and the
company goes to another place so the
government in Santander in Cantabria put
101 million dollar 1 million euros
pretty much 11 dot 3 million dollars to
upgrade all the installations in the
inner part and this is where a company
called say getting and
the bigger hair by the part of santander
to upgrade with a physical installations
like this both you can see in the
picture this those are boots for
checking or the other boot is an office
outside the terminal and also they
install these LED panels you are seeing
on the boots or over the office or the
big LED screen behind the office they
were in charge of insulin fiber optic
connection between the all buildings in
the office in the port okay so it was a
very heavy sorry about that okay
ok
we will you only have three months to do
the job and I was in charge of all the
software stuff and we'll talk about
later and this is what we have pretty
much to to do install LED panels not
only installed but controlling and set
the message and the stuff I wanted to
display to for the people of the theory
also instructions sensors in the cabins
us or given cabinet temperance alarms
and also a low and entry gate with a
automatic checking so for all of these
we have this layout with this schematic
we did all the fiber optic connections
and install all the Quitman all the
switches the ple see everything from
from the scratch in three months hey
this is more or less the layout from
from the left you have the ED entrance
and now we have four votes for checking
now this is more or less two or three
kilometers so this is this quite long
distance an office checking for the
police to check the passport the
terminal and the end the ferry there and
feel a kiosk for security and civil so
we have to install everything and a
after that connect with software for
stuff for Brittany Ferries so this is
the the application and we'll be talking
about this is the client part for the
Brittany stuff so Brittany Ferries stuff
this is not for the people not for a
feral users but for the stuff so they
can assess for instance to the LED
panels and change the message to
advertise for instant date
table for the necessary or when is the
boarding a going to the work so I for
this user interface i use gel effects I
started in April 2012 so it was short
edge effects too but the very first
version of the RF x 2 and we use Java 7
for sure and we use several controls a
good i will be showing so in then in a
few minutes a Christian controls are
ready to show the status of the LED
panels if they were switched on or off
and in the right in the left you have a
all the dependencies that we can we have
something to check or control people is
usually a Spaniard so usually they use
it in Spanish but it's an international
company so we have a automatic change of
language and we can control most of the
equipment like panels a light so all so
i will be showing what we can do in this
application for example with this simple
indicator custom controls from the
deviator stress project a i did a slight
modification so i could click on that
controls on the left i could click on it
and switch on or switch off the l LED
panel the lights on the boot or allow
the light this a new climate system to
be on or off on the right they are only
a status alarm so i cannot click on them
because they only the
only reading the status so they inform
me if the error green is good red is
very supporting with the whip is
Europe's a batteries or the temper
because the Doris has been open so
moving a few to the back in a how can we
assess to the status of a LED panels and
so it in our client application injure
effects so we use this a PLC Adams 6050
a with realize so we can connect to the
physical equipment and with the pins and
we can set on or off the equipment and
we have somewhere we can see if the
input or the output is in its on or off
ok so the the main problem here is we
need to connect this with our client
side and also we have to connect all the
Queen Minnie know in the whole area and
part to a server so in the server we
have a bake-off plc which is in charge
of connecting to every of the nine or
ten ten atoms we have already installed
throughout the port and a be a Modbus
protocol we read the status of every of
the inputs and outputs in this island so
we program and we make me will make the
code to read this a dis Adams and now we
have it we have all the readings in the
PLC so the next step is to take out the
readings from the PLC to the Java server
okay now when we have the reins in the
yellow server we connect then we r
celebrates or rest food restful web
services to the ER FX clean application
and we can see the status and we can
interact with a car with the equipment
for instant we can click and send the
order BRS cool status abrs will services
sorry to a server the server connects to
that plc and this plz send the order to
the atom in the place where it is okay
so you have we have these cabinets
throughout the report they the offices
so we can connect everything through
through the network okay
as I said we have a Java server in the
terminal a so we can access to the PLC
to retrieve the data so we perceive the
data so at any time we can go to the
server and check for the data from the
last day the last week so for that we
use custom controls custom controls from
a video FX trust a project as I say
before there it will show you a new
control we use we can use to check the
date in the initial date and if I final
date for a period of time so here we can
check and set any rate we want or change
the hour that we want ok by the way you
hire not it's already this is not a word
point this is a javafx presentation so
that's why I can I can I am able to run
their the control i'm showing you ok and
also if you have seen me with problems
with these lies moving forward or
backward it's because i have a leap
motion controller with me here and with
my striped jesters it goes on on a
forward or backward as i move my hands
sometimes occidental occidental tree so
this is problem sometimes ok now a a few
things I could show you here ok
let me this is an actual string from the
port so now in Spain should be around a
twelve o'clock in a night so this there
is anybody there but we have CCTV
cameras all around so I'm connecting to
one of these cameras okay so this is a
web you and just by letting the URL and
the query parameters a that I need I
cannot explain the straining right now
so I can for instant I come for me
okay we are on Wi-Fi so sorry about the
connection but you know the streaming
takes more time that any other that okay
well this is much more or less the same
I used to connect everything so from the
user interface I led the user the
brittany ferries stuff to connect
through the application to the server
I'm from the server using the back of
plc connect to another oven for instance
in this booth and sweets on or switch
off the panel the lady LED panel and
also to send the message we want i will
talk about now how can i send these
these messages but for that I will have
to splain just a little bit and really
fast hey how these particular panels
need the info tool to get loaded so they
cancel this this message it's okay so
this is the beautiful comment parts we
use to connect from the server and this
is the natural sober that led provider
gave us but it was a windows standard
application so you can edit for every
LED panel you can add DC sports every
spot is just the diarrhea in particular
area where you saw some messages or some
pizza so we could not take this out
easily and put it on our graphics
application so we have to find a way to
make our user interface so we can send
these messages to the LED panels
this is under some elder files the
support needs so we have we luckily have
a source code of the activities they
used to make the connection to the LED
panels the problem is we have this
source code in C++ so at the end we
change this to a Java code it took more
or less one month to change all the
stuff and adopt other protocols for
communications it was really hard
because it's you need for that to go to
a very low level when I'm in low it's
really low all the patterns might bite
by bite you know to make all the
sequences so the driver the support
driver installed in the LED panel
understand what you are sending okay so
we have to go down there to make all
these protocols check it before for that
we have to deal also with fonts and
images because LED panels you cannot
sewed all the colors with one for
instance these particularly panels have
only three fun three tones a so we have
to convert bmep files to be meaty
prepare a impropriety format to be able
to send this image to the panel and also
the same with the phones we have this
small LED panels at our office so we
could play with it add up the protocols
test it before doing it with a real
panel SATA port
but after that we could pretty anything
we want it so this is these are the
files and the format we have to to write
the despots the rotations the test we
are if we want to display the name of
the file with a image format in the
fonts and so on ok so this is a real
panel it's the samee need a limit but
you can see a pretty much the same
message we've been sewing from this
commercial software and from a the
application we are going to talk about
right now which is a coastal custom
control which i call matrix panel so
this is a real control yours you can be
seen it on the JavaFX slide so a I start
working in this custom control so the
staff could make the message preview it
before actually send into the LED a real
planet because it takes about me to deal
with the fonts besides where you have to
put the message and so so this actually
works pretty pretty well and I was able
to implement more or less of all the
transitions the effects you have to you
can so then under led by the rear panel
so a you can define several areas and
several spots load images I have the
very same protocol to transform the pvp
files to be mighty
and several efforts so pretty much it's
a clone of the real planet but digital
and easy to to use so here I want to
make a special mention for a giraffe
extra steam they are they haven't down
and standing work for the yard effects
community so I'm proud to be part of
this team they let me in and when I was
working with this and for sure i want to
thank Google for his amazing work still
serious libraries before in dhreen in
html5 and now for showing in jail
effects and if you know you can access
these controls mattox panel between the
end but many other cool const custom
controls a just going to end the effects
traps got up okay so if you are
interested in using this control I will
have to solve just a few lines of code
what you need to do is for now just use
the Builder when the builders will be
deprecated we will talk about the link
later but for now you can use a builder
in this builders you just need to say to
set the number of LEDs you have white
and height and you can set that in
pixels the dimensions of the of the
controller going to display and you can
see their width and height are 500
pixels but the custom control adapt the
form to be related to the actual led you
are going to display ok a for the
contents you have this class called
content and this builder and it's breezy
you can just a right contributor create
dot and you know in your ID it will show
you what options do
for instance you can t you can choose
the color of the LED panel you can
choose if you are going to put text or
images you can set the origin where you
want the XY coordinates or the size of
the area you are going to display the
messages what time do you want what
phone do you want I did pixel by pixel
bit by bit all the phones yes a director
is in the defect which is effect scroll
left so you can you can play with the
labs if if you want to change this last
a faster of lower and then you can set
up house so the effete ends and it holds
and start again i will show you life
later okay and this is pretty much it
you can use the very same area to show
two different contents and you will set
a the organ of rotation single or double
content for instance i use it in the
part to change the language first
showing in english and then saw in
Spanish well as in fact they as tough a
wants to do it okay it's easy to have a
custom control the problem is okay I
need a tool for adding this in an easy
way not by code I cannot tell the people
brittany ferries staff okay go on code
click the message no I need an
illiterate rated an editor like this you
can see here so every line you show in
the in a table is just the content of
one particular area I call it a spot so
this is pot holes for instance a limit
and you can see
you have to set the area you have to set
the speed you can choose the effort you
want i will show it right so a these are
samples of both panels LED panels we
have already there and let me see if
this works right now it's working ok the
width is no Wi-Fi is working so this is
a natural and really good connection in
real time to the message the message is
already stored in a database in the port
so I'm assessing to all of them I can
choose a what panel do I want to see for
instance this is the entrance at the
entrance panel this is one of the booths
panel and it's so in the logo of
Brittany Ferries ok this is actually
done by loading web one picture and
using a whole area to solve this this
message can go for instance is this
another booth ok this is just a one
message at the entrance of the gate door
where they tell the drivers the trucks
go and park your trailer there ok so you
can see here we have to just to two
lines the rose on the table each one
holds part of the message the first one
holds limits and the second one just a
text for this text there is a blank
effect ok so if we want we can send this
effort for instance to scroll left
okay and we can change a speed here so
let me save this okay here we are we
have this scrolling effect it stops and
mr. or all over again sure no for now
for now I just I save here for demo
purposes but it's not going back I
disabled I disabled the button for that
so there is no worried at all okay so
this is pretty much with what you can
change the font if you want a bigger
font the problem with that is that you
don't see all the message that that's
why we need this preview to avoid errors
before sending the message okay
well one more thing a related to custom
controls is this is a schedule or wiki
scheduler we have here sorry ok this is
the recent version but i will show you
later so I as I said before it was in
2012 there were nose and by that time we
have no this control effects project so
I have to do this double slider by
myself I pick some code for someone and
I blog about it I will put my blog
address day later and I use this develop
lighter to fix a at what time do I want
to switch on and switch off the LED
panels because these LED panels are very
power consumption and they consume a lot
of power and we have to save as much
energy energy as week so this is an
actual view of a for sample LED panel
the panel at the entrance and we are
going to assess also in real time this
is numb panel number three it's one of
the booths panel so today is Monday what
I think maybe it's nearly two strings
pain already so I'm going to change
because now all of as you can see all of
the panels are switch off because 10
table but I'm going to make a slight
modification this is going to be sent to
the port okay so we are trying to sweet
song I'm not sure if it's already oh
sorry by the way that
can do it again
now I will click here and this order
will be sent okay so it takes a few
seconds maybe a minute also to send the
order to the LED panel because we have
this task and the background running and
checking if for every minute we are in
schedule to switch on/off switch of the
panel after the task fun that finds out
that you have to say in order to the
panel the panel also a facade has a
rouille and relay and so on and it takes
a few seconds so if we are lucky maybe
if you will see it otherwise if you want
to ask something about this right now
because I still have to I should move to
the next slide so so
as I said before a we have a java server
and this device our values a ABC
protocol to connect to the back off
which is a PLC or embedded piece a PC
and this one is connected by by the
network today to all the atoms so in
this boot we have another here installed
at the very end of the port we have the
backhoe and they are all connected and a
this ndd order by modules protocol to
switch on the relay or switch it off
it's just that's it okay the panelists
not working maybe we will come back here
later
for the moment I will I won't change
anything because the bread is already
working in I have to attend mainly java
changes in inversions i will talk about
that problems with the other scenes so i
will talk about in a second priority i
will move on see this is not sweetie
down
ok
well and the third part of this period
was related to this gate which is
motorized a gate and there is a
checkpoint so the track the track became
a traffic stop just in front of the door
and there is a magnetic inductive loop
and still there on the floor so we can
have a signal if there is a track or not
on the door okay so there is this
checkpoint there is more or less like a
usual kiosk you can find and we have
this GFX application also they're ready
for the driver to checking and insert
his data and print a ticket and a 20 key
open the door so he can peek or drop the
trailer also there is a very sane
application for the Brittany staff in
case they they can attend the operation
in the office so this is also a part of
the editor where they can a not only
insert the data but check below if there
is a trap or not if there is a track
they can open the door from this button
and for sure everything is persisted in
the database so they can access at any
time the list of real operations done in
any period they want to tick okay so i
will be speaking of another different
project it's mainly the same structure
as we have a server plc connected but
you know the the place is completely
different
okay for this one I will go to regular
PowerPoint
okay so we have this building in
Canterbury also from wrong it has around
150 years and it's in really pretty bad
shape it has many damages in the walls
so this this building is inked in
camellias is a very touristic place in
the north of Spain and you can see there
the main entrance of the building and
this is the inside you see this whole
leska folding a structure inside to hold
to support the bolts and you can see for
instance in the picture on the right
about this is an actual crack between
the the the bubbles of the arc so there
is this group in the University of
Canterbury this building a technology
group they were in charts of studying
and evolution of the damage and see if
it was critical and they have to make
another measures besides putting this is
structure to hold the search the
building so this this group was in
charge of histol stirring this censored
you can see in the pictures they these
are for measuring cracks you know if the
you put the cylinder and you get you can
get by measuring the movement the
cylinder if the crack is opening or
closing you can make a measure of a tilt
on the wall with this type of
transmitter you put a tape in the
picture below between two walls and move
every movement of this world the
relative movement is measured by this
this be stayed on besides we'll check
the winter the wind sorry win the ratio
with the wind speed and temperature and
humidity
in the building inside and outside so
this is a picture of an equipment we we
use to communicate to all the sensor
from a a PLC which is this selected in
yellow ok this is the back off we use
this is a PLC or embedded pc and it is
connected a byword through all the
terminals I will see we will see later
and it's also connected to this
industrial pc where we have our 07 ok
besides we have batteries in case
powerful predator and so ok this is will
how we connect everything we have the
master the back of we saw before we have
three stations station 1 2 3 and
different terminals these terminals you
can see in the in the picture they are
just plump you can you can plug then as
you want as many as one and you can have
you can insert the wires of the sensor
straight to the Twitter minute we use
that card which is and high-speed
Ethernet to connect everything so we
have everything connected and now if we
have traffic from our server to this
this plz so this is a layout of the
charts we are monitoring and in in these
colors we see the this different three
areas we are measuring with these three
stations well actually there are two
because the three are the third area is
completely not operated because it's
unsafe to access there and they don't
want to get into it because it can fall
apart so i will be talking about three
button in fact they are only two station
working
they're okay so this is a view of the
sensors we are going we have installed
they're real sensors are listed on the
left and this is a different icons I
used to to show this same sensors on
this layout so now we have to assess the
measures and display it in what some way
here so these people a as I said they
are in charge of studying the devolution
of the damage can have secure office and
they don't need to go to the place to
get the message so for that as I said
before we have this plc a install it and
in situ in the place if you are familiar
with with this it's a busy but otherwise
it doesn't matter so I will go through
this easily we have to create our own
variables and get these barrels from the
plc so for instance you can see below a
input from the crack meter or input for
incremental whatever an output because
we have to transform to make a few
mathematical operations to get the real
value and then we can access from our
dealer server we define the very same
variables and send them through a DC a
protocol to the PLC so we can get
communication involve ways and we have
readings and also we can write if we
need it in this case we are only reading
because we don't need to change anything
on the sensors we cannot do it anyway
okay so now we are going to talk about a
client part so this is the web page and
we used to assess through a web star ya
rockstar
so before in without here somebody says
no it was yesterday actually i think a
with he doesn't like and the other web
star okay i have to do it because I in
for a very few initial months I have to
take care of every upgrade in the
application check if there is something
wrong I have to make a few breath and so
on so for me it's very easy to make
changes and make lines immediately have
through this technology have they have
this attached to the new version
instantly but we have it has very few
issues maybe we can talk later if you
want so this is the actual layout for
the client application it's also basted
in a tree view a day at the lead with
different areas we are going to show and
in the center we will be sewing could be
otherwise a going to be otherwise the
layout of the other charts so for sure
we need a login and apply entity to the
data that is to the data and this is the
actual javafx version of the layout of
the other charts as you can see below
this address this color areas we have in
the layout so it was done with a SVG so
i have this cut drawings I support it to
english bay in space there are I to the
departs loved all the parts and move
them to the xml file so it's quite easy
to move all your drawings or your cut
cut pro points in this case and also for
the late sensors all over all of this
sensor Dioner they are not images they
are also
SVG files no just a bitch home run from
cut okay so this is a picture of an
instant I will show it life later so
this is a picture of one of the areas
with up 12 readings or real readings in
that moment so you get in the name of
the sensor and below and read the
reading area for that I included this
compass to solve in life changes the one
direction i will show you did this
terraria which is all 0 values because
it's not working ok so in in both
projects i've been using this very
impressive tool which is symbol de
sheriff exit symbol that for me it's
very very utility very very little for
me for doing the very first draft of the
application so it's very easy and to get
something ready to go to the to your
customer and discuss discuss with him do
you like this do you like that I'm going
to do this that way and then if they
don't want it you can go back and do it
another way you can change easily the
the background everything so it's a
really useful tool to make projects and
go life very easily very fast so I i had
this a different effects Mel files one
general for the main view and this with
a layout of the building so i can go
back and forth with
all these sensors and arias I have to
show okay one thing happened as I was
saying I one of my first visit to the
customer I saw them the first preview of
the application and for me it was a
surprise because they bought a very big
flat screen and when they saw the
application on the screen it was really
big screen for us a small application
and it was very empty space many NT
space so we decided to since I had a new
combo so we can split the main view
actually a we can split it in four views
so in the big screen equals more
reasonable so a for that I i use this
tutorial for a phone angela they said oh
so you can manage several screens with
several controllers for its effect
effect xml file and also we have to fix
the disabled display divider for that
there is no public access to the class
to the content divider so we can use
these ccc sado classes okay we also did
this certain tool so you can get a
picture of several hours dates this also
and you can see values you can change a
not only the hide you can change the
value on the x-axis plotted against her
body variables ok so here i was talking
before about the other versions suddenly
few i think it was the last month they
call me because
you see there is a button there they can
store they can make a snap snap shot of
lab the charts and store it on a file
they call me because if this button
didn't work anymore it's on earth turns
out it was in the Java 7 25 upgrade it
was up there was a bug just in windows
with this application with this version
and if you are you were using web stuff
java web start so that was the case and
the case was a pretty hard back because
it was ready to swing and the app
contest return null so we can assess to
swing or we can access to a few a
Princeton what I have selected in red
which is they emit 0 we cannot attach
that a written note so we have to move
make a workaround for that okay yeah i
just finished with this this is a SS
later again use it to see the real
measure and the limits in which the
sensor is all right eat the sensor is
happy is having values outside this
limits it raised an alarm okay so this
is pretty much it this is a and at all
to a dialog to change the mail addresses
and the time you have to do you want
well to get measures and so on okay so
my time is out i have just few minutes
for questions if you want just say that
for me these two projects have been
really really interesting projects to to
be in contact with many new stuff like
was the effects at the beginning they
allow me to get into this community this
amazing community and for sure they
helped me to be here today present
engine so I really like this this is
parents and willing to share it with
everybody and transmit my sword basic
experience here so you have questions I
will be glad to answer it no this is all
done in the back in nature a server
custom is that you have to define your
variables and use a ABC protocol which
is proprietary back off to to connect to
the PLC so but you have to write all the
code so in the dr server also in the in
the back of just for this last prieta
use rest is sure sir just if you allow
me just one minute
yes they have all the stuff but I didn't
want to go to the cold because i have
many hours to talk about the coast so if
you're interested we can talk about the
code and how it's done the model to
connect a restful services with the JFX
part because we have you know you have
to do bind the values coming from one
threat to the threat gfx thread so okay
just just one minute
okay this is real and this is actual
values coming from san tan there you can
see here if you have it we want to offer
this area we select the area with min
get the values or just ask the server to
get on the data retrieval data and
plotted sites well any question
