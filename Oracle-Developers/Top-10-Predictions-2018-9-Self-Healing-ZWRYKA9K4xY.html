autonomous applications both the
application that you as developers built
and the application that you received
from cloud service providers where these
applications will be self-healing
self-tuning
self patching and being able to self
scale themselves based upon need in
order for this to happen
there'll be management cloud
capabilities where you're able to
aggregate log data user performance data
from the web tier app tier data based
here
user experience data etc into one
repository and be able to apply domain
specific algorithms to all of this data
to be able to say what should the
thresholds be for my application what is
my server topology so we'll be able to
set up baselines automatically of what
the threshold should be what the server
topology is and then use anomaly
detection to be able to tell when we're
exceeding those thresholds so it becomes
easier and easier for developers because
they don't have to tell ops what to set
as thresholds when to set these
thresholds how to manage these
applications and now they can use those
capabilities in their own applications
to make their applications autonomous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
