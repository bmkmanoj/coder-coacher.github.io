Tech for 22 years in July and I have had
website called Oracle based comm for the
last it about 17 years in July I think
and the result of that website which
looks a bit like that if you google for
anything and you find that it's I'm
really sorry it's what I do in my spare
time because I have no life and as a
result of that I got invited to the
Oracle aid program which is a pat on the
back to say thank you for being involved
in the community and I've got to speak
at some cool places around the world
including here so that's enough about me
what are we going to talk about today so
I'm predominantly a database guy I'm an
Oracle DBA and a pl/sql developer so I'm
guessing you've figured out already that
I'm very database centric and I think
that's cool so what we're going to talk
about today is what's the point of all
of this JSON and rest web service stuff
very briefly what's Jason which I think
this crowd probably understand anyway
what's odd and why I think that's
important and then talking briefly about
how to get Jason in and out of the
database really easily the slides are
and the PDF of the slides and also an
article that backs it up is all on my
website and there's examples of how to
do all of this stuff for real so if you
don't want to write anything you don't
have to it's really easy to get hold of
so what's the point okay
speaking as a database guy and a data
guy the our DBMS is now considered
legacy by most people as a result one of
the things I've done for the last 22
years pl/sql development is also
considered legacy I'm not one of the
cool kids how do I keep myself relevant
well if I was doing this presentation a
decade ago what I was telling to people
was you should be publishing all of your
pl/sql as web services maybe xml over
HTTP
or soap web services later and then now
it's all rest Web Services and Jason so
the way I think we can keep ourselves
relevant is to fit into that world as a
pl/sql developer now I don't think we're
in a position where we can dictate terms
to the rest of the world back in the
past when our DBMS was king then it was
very easy for us to say hey we want you
to do something install this driver and
conform to our set of rules nowadays I
don't think that particularly possible
and I have this kind of thing going man
in my head that if I force someone to
install something on their PC then I've
failed if I force someone to install
something on their server other than the
database server I'd possibly failed so
one of the ways we can do this is to
expose everything on the database that's
useful as rest web service services and
typically that could be XML rest can
actually be anything it could be FTP or
SFTP but typically it's going to be
Jason nowadays why Jason well this is
probably the nicest quote that I use
when I'm doing this presentation to
people who aren't particularly ofay with
Jason Jason sorry but I call it Jason
click sounds nicer and it's intact for
serializing objects are raised number
strings billions and null it's based on
JavaScript syntax but it's distinct some
JavaScript is not Jason and some JSON is
not JavaScript so I think that's one of
the nicest descriptions I've seen in its
core we have essentially a name value
pair where the name is just like a key
and the value can be something as simple
as like a literal but it could also be
object array number boolean null we've
also got JSON object we can have one too
many of key value pairs comma separated
surrounded by curly braces and that
forms our JSON object
and remember our I was going to point to
my screen there which is quite sad and
remember that
you can't even see that it doesn't show
up at okay so remember that this value
here could actually be a whole one of
those and the other thing to remember is
inside these curly braces those don't
have to be uniform there can be
different types as they are here I've
got a number and a string a JSON array
is a comma separated list of stuff
surrounded by square brackets once again
each of these the elements can be
completely different and can be made up
of complex elements as well so it's
actually really simple syntax but really
quite powerful at displaying data which
is what it's all about from my
perspective wise jason important well
while we were all arguing about where
the java was better than dotnet or a.net
was better than java javascript kind of
came in and took over the world so we
have to do whatever the JavaScript
developers want now and that's typically
Jason to get data out of the database
why because it's incredibly easy for
them to convert jason texts oh pointer
come on there we go to convert jason
text into an object that they can work
with in the app server or on their
client and it's incredibly easy for them
to convert a javascript object into
jason to serialize it and put it
somewhere like for example into a
database so very handy for people who
prefer to use jason that could be dotnet
developers it could be Java developers
also but definitely for JavaScript
developers but from a data perspective I
think it's also important because I can
think of it as skinny XML and me and
skinny in the same sentence fizzle so
this probably won't shop very well for
you guys at the back but what we've got
is some tag-based xml here and the same
data represented with jason and what
I've got is a single department with all
of the employees for that department
listed if you're an Oracle person you'll
recognize where this data came from and
if you're not I'm not going to tell you
so if we look at that what we've got is
a minified version of the XML is about
768 characters a minified version of the
JSON is 470 characters so it's smaller
smaller is good if it represents the
same data because I have to get this
stuff over a network and anything that
makes it smaller is a good thing but you
might say to yourself I've kind of
cheated here by using tag based XML
because I could have used attribute
based XML and made it smaller and that's
true it would have been smaller but it's
still not going to be as small as the
JSON version and I think the JSON
version looks a lot easier to read so
from my perspective even if I don't care
what the developer wants I kind of like
it because it reduces the size of the
size of the payload which is good for
performance so I'm an Oracle guy I don't
work for Oracle I actually work at a UK
university at the moment but I work with
Oracle Tech so how do i make myself
relevant in this world well one of the
ways I can do that is to make sure my
database can provide information using
rest web services probably the easiest
way to do that from an Oracle database
is to use a tool called ODS which is
totally free so it's just a war file you
can either run it in standalone mode in
later versions of ODS that's supported
in earlier versions it wasn't I could
also really under tomcat or WebLogic or
GlassFish and they're all supported in
under those environments it used to be
called the apex listener because it
served one real purpose initially which
was to front an application called
Oracle application Express or Apex
anyone heard of that yeah okay cool so
it used to be the apex listener and that
was essentially a replacement for a tool
called mod pl/sql or the embedded pl/sql
gateway so you'll have seen it in
diagrams like this which isn't really
relevant to today's talk but just want
to show you kind of this
here sits in front of the database and
allows you to take metadata at the
database present it as an apex
application and life's amazing okay so
that's where you would have
traditionally seen it but then in
subsequent releases it became so much
more than the apex listener which is one
of the reasons it got renamed to the
Oracle rest data services or ODS the
reason it's important for me is because
I confront Oracle databases from 10g
onwards and make them enable them for
restful Web Services it also has some
other functionality I'm going to talk
about and some that I'm not going to
because I've never tried it so
apparently it confront Oracle's no SQL
database but I haven't done that so
importantly though it still serves its
original function as well has anyone
done any web toolkit applications pl/sql
web toolkit ones okay so that's exactly
what apex is it's an application pretty
cool one but an application written in
the pl/sql web toolkit and Ords can
still front that so no problem but it's
not the most interesting bit of it in my
opinion
how does ODS enable me to front the
database as web services pretty simple
logically I have a URI that comes in and
then I go through a map and buying
process so if I've said this URI maps to
this database call that's cool if I'm
passing in parameters then it will use
those parameters to map into buying
variables in the SQL or pl/sql call and
then run that on the database the result
from the database determines really
what's going to happen on the way out if
it's an SQL statement that's running the
output from that SQL statement gets
converted to CSV or Jason on the way out
depending on what you want interestingly
it won't produce XML and that's
intentional but then on the way out if I
called some pl/sql then it's up to the
pl/sql to make sure the right
comes out using the equivalent of the
web toolkit so two real ways of
determining what to do here I can either
let all to do everything for me by
calling SQL or I can call pl/sql and
then push out the correct content so how
do I get JSON out of the database really
easily now the examples I'm going to
show here are very simplistic they're
not what I would necessarily call
real-world examples but it allows me to
put as little code on the screen as
possible so we'll talk about that later
assuming I've got Ord installed which is
can be as simple as just read one config
thing and start it up on the OS then I
have to tell the database that a schema
is enabled for ords and the way I do
that is do allow it to do proxy
connections has anyone ever done a
connect connect through on a user so you
can connect to a user to connect to
another database user essentially that's
all this is doing it's saying I've got a
schema called test user 1 and I want to
be able to get to that from ODS so it
does behind the scenes a grant connect
through and I've got a URL mapping in
this case I'm being bit silly the
mapping you'll see in red is test user 1
it's not very practical in I wouldn't
really want to expose schema names as
part of my URL but it serves the purpose
for this example so at that point the
schema is enabled I just got to tell it
what I want to do so the simplest
example of creating a restful web
service is this I can define a service
in a single call to the database using
the odds package defined service and
here what I've done is said I've got a
module called test module 1 a module is
just a collection of templates or
patterns notice the module has its own
base path its own you want piece of a
URL or URI I then got a pattern which is
another piece of the path
and the URI in this case a very simple
one / M sorry M / and then I've got to
have a handler so the actual work that
gets done when it sees that pattern so
my module can have multiple patterns and
my pattern can have multiple handlers
each handler is associated with a HTTP
method and in this case I've said that
get is going to be associated with a
query and that query is select star from
M so it really doesn't get much simpler
than that
so if I just enable the schema do this
straight away I can access that data
through a restful web services via ODS
just to give you an idea of what that
looks like if that's my base URL to
connect to my database with Rewards my
schema alias which I've not really alias
to test user 1 is part of the URI
my module definition on my pattern slash
test module is part of the URI and /m is
part of the URI in fact that makes up
the URI how do I know which action that
I should do I know because of the HTTP
method and so in this case if I call
this from a browser the default browser
action is get therefore I would call the
method I've just decided to find so that
URL will now with its ugly aliases that
I would never expose through a real
person and allows me to present data
from the database as a restful web
service in this case just to get handler
if I were to do that it would give me
that and that's all fine if I printed it
up you'd see that which is Jason so with
very little effort as a pl/sql developer
without having to learn any new skills
and without having to worry about new
infrastructure I can do this am I saying
this is the best thing to do no am I
saying if I started a new project I
would pick this over one of the other
technology
stax you're going to hear today no but
if you are a pl/sql developer who is
desperately trying to stay relevant then
maybe this is a good option as a
stepping stone to get you there I'm also
not saying the other methods are better
they're just different so this isn't the
best it's not the worst it's just a way
of achieving the same thing okay
so let's look at something that's a
little bit different a little bit more
complicated rather than defining the
service in one go I can define the
pieces that make up the service
separately so in this case I have
defined module I've got a new module
name and a new path associated with it
I'm defining a new template it still /m
but now I'm going to define a new
Handler and the handle is a bit more
complicated it takes in a couple of bind
variables which you'll see at the far
end because my pointer is totally dyed
and takes in two bind variables still
the same pattern that I had before but a
different module now what this allows me
to do is actually pass some data in I
can use a very sort of clumsy way of
getting the data in and like I can just
pass them in on the on the URI like that
or I can upload some Jason to get the
data there but in actual fact I think
this is probably the worst way you can
use this tool and if you're a place
that's been working with Oracle for a
significant length of time the chances
are you've got a lot of pl/sql already
written and if you have why don't you
just expose that pl/sql to the outside
world as web services rather than having
the developer on the mid-tier
having to do all the individual pieces
so for example I work in a university if
I want to create a student do I really
want the developer having to do the 50
or so inserts updates and deletes to do
that from the middle tier when I could
actually call the create student package
that does that work and just make sure
all the data to past in a single go and
the reality is although the examples
here are very simple I would typically
expect a web service to pass a binary
payload of JSON and for the pl/sql api
underneath to split it all up and decide
what to do with it once again am i
saying this is the best route no it's
just a route if you're a JavaScript
developer you're probably not going to
want to learn pl/sql to learn how to do
this and you should do it the way that
best suits you but if you're coming from
a database background maybe this is the
easiest way to get yourself into the
game in this example I'm going to do the
work myself but I'm going to cheat I'm
going to make it very simple so I have a
procedure called get M Jason it takes in
a parameter and they opens the ref
cursor if the parameters present it uses
it if not it doesn't it then does open
JSON object using Apex Jason when you
install apex into the database you get a
bunch of api's with it that are really
quite cool and this is one of them apex
Jason allows you to very easily easily
generate jason or pass jason read it and
shred out the information from it so
I've opened a JSON object I've converted
the ref cursor into some JSON data and I
close it so this is actually not very
cool it doesn't do very much but it
gives you an example of how you can very
easily generate jason within pl/sql and
will be more of that later so I have my
procedure takes in a parameter defines
the red cursor opens the red cursor and
then generates some jason by default
this is pushing it this out over the
Gateway so odds will just deliver it as
it's pushed out I now have to define a
service to associate that with my pl/sql
so i do a new template call in this case
chess module for with /m p-- again and
then I do a handler for this a get
handler that has m / is its pattern
and this time I'm doing sourcetype
pl/sql and calling that stored procedure
without any parameters so that's going
to give me all of my data the second
template within this same module is has
got a bind variable after it in the URL
and then that's associated with the same
stored procedure just passing that
parameter in now remember if I was
passing in a large amount of Jason I
wouldn't want to deal with individual
parameters I'd just send the whole
document in as a blob and then shred
that internally and deal with it and
that's the way you'll probably end up
using it but in this example just a
single parameter and with that what I've
got is two ways of calling this piece of
code now I can call it with a URI of
just m p-- to give me all of the
employees or URI with M and the employee
number that gives me information just
about one employee so I'm going to leave
that at that point there and talk about
how I get data into the database because
I think this is probably a bit more
relevant because I'm guessing all of you
have done something like this maybe with
mod pl/sql or the embedded pl/sql
gateway before possibly but getting
jason in is probably a bit more
interesting once again very simple
examples though so the rules we're going
to work on are the HTTP header defines
what action I'm going to take typically
what we'll have is get is pulling some
information out but not changing
anything in the database post is like
creating something you'll often see it
mapped in simple examples to an insert
but it's creating something of business
value like say a person or a student or
an address or something like that put is
an amend or an update of that data but
once again something a bit more
substantial than just an update of a
table in a database I would expect
normally the interesting thing about put
is it normally serves two functions
which is to update it if it's there or
created if it's not
as a database guy I don't like that
implementation but that's what most
people do and then delete remove
something so once again that could be
say lots of updates to mark things as
deleted or actual deletions or whatever
so in my opinion mapping directly onto
DML statements is a bit of a disaster
it's not ideal for me but I totally
understand if your development is 99.9%
Java or JavaScript or dotnet why you
want might want to do that and there's
actually better ways of doing that than
this as a thing called Auto rest which
turns it on automatically if you point
it an object but because I'm a database
guy I want to do things at the database
end sorry and so let's look at some very
quickly some examples of put post and
delete well it's pretty simple really if
I've got an API that creates an employee
then I just create a method of post and
call that passing in the parameters or
if it was a large amount of Jason just
passing in a blob and shredding that
internally I'll talk about that later if
it's an amend I can do a put and amend
that employee if it's a delete I use the
delete method and I remove that employee
happy days very simple and that's really
all we have to worry about in terms of
the binding the URI
and the method to the pl/sql so it's
incredibly easy I mean like childishly
easy for a pl/sql developer so just
remember that when you're doing a put a
post or a delete you can't really do
that directly from the browser unless
you write a little HTML form or write an
application or use a rest client and
what I typically do for testing is I use
curl on the command line because it's
very easy so imagine a situation where I
have my URI that ends in M I want to do
a post I need to make the header content
type of application Jason
and then I want to pass in a raw payload
of some JSON data and what Ord is going
to do is it's going to take each of
those parameters and map them to the
equivalent parameter as for my bind
variable when I want to call this from
the command line like curl to test it I
might do this curl - I just means I see
some headers - X allows me to say that
it's a post in this case binary data
binary just allows me to point it at a
file which contains that raw payload and
then I've got my content type defined in
the header application Jason and I've
got my URI and I call it I see the
output I see the Jason come back or some
horrible error message if I've got it
wrong and life's good so very easy to
test whether you want to use an
application and rest client or just do
it from the command line using curl 12c
comes with a whole bunch of stuff out of
the box that's really useful when I'm
playing around with Jason how many
people have got 12c in production 12c
release one how many people were so
super keen they put 12 - in production
in the few weeks it's been out sensible
people okay so the support for EM Jason
varies depending on the release you've
got in 12c release one we have a bunch
of conditions is Jason Jason exists and
Jason contains that are part of our
database functionality I'll have a quick
look at those in a moment remember you'd
have to write anything down it's all on
the website and I'll point you back to
that at the end I've got some functions
Jason value JSON query JSON table that
are pretty useful and then we've got
some functionality called soda simple
Oracle document access which basically
allows Oracle to fake being couchdb on
MongoDB I my opinion on this is if you
want MongoDB you should probably use
MongoDB but if you're a place that does
predominately Oracle processing and
you'd like an XML document store for
some reason then this is kind of a neat
solution and because the data is
ultimately in the database you can use
lots of cool stuff to query it and make
it appear relational even though it is
actually being stored as blobs in the
database so a little bit niche I think
but that's just my opinion so let's have
a look at some of these things very
quickly so is Jason is a condition
there's no new data type for jason in
oracle 12c it's just in a varchar a blob
a club and n club whatever you want but
I can define a condition either to say
this has got to be Jason in this column
or it's got to be strict Jason so I
don't have silly things like hanging
commas and stuff like that that's really
handy because it means Oracle haven't
had to build anything extra into the
engine to cope with things like data
guard and all of that sort of good stuff
it took ages to get xml type through the
various pieces of technology when they
added that into the database but with
jason it's really simple because it's an
existing data types it's using existing
data types i can also use this jason in
a query so i could store the data in say
a VAR c r2 without the constraint but
then select data where the data is jason
and so i can do that in a query as well
so I can have a column that has both
jason and non json data and tests for it
jason exists seemed a bit odd to me when
i first saw it and this with jason you
can have the same value by default
returns whether an item is present book
contains null or not present at all so
this allows me to test if an item is
present but has a null value so for
example in this case i've got contact
details and i'm saying i want the phone
number element to be present but i want
to test that it's a value of null so i
won't get the data back if the element
isn't in the date JSON document so you
know that station exists
jason value hey not a surprise it allows
me to pull back values
but the important thing to remember
about Jason value is it's only simple
types returned I can't use to use it to
pull back complex objects like arrays or
JSON objects we'll get to that later
here
Jason query can do what Jason value can
do but it could also bring back complex
fragments of Jason so in this case I've
said bring me back the whole of the
contact details not just the phone
number for example so that's those but
there's a really cool feature called
Jason table as anyone used XML table
before okay so this is XML table for
Jason what I'm doing is I'm doing what
looks like a Cartesian product against
the documents table and I'm defining
columns and mapping them onto the
contents of the JSON document so I'm
projecting columns over the data which
allows me to very easily query the data
energy 18 documents and it's that
complex like I've got nesting I could
use a with clause to pull out pieces at
a time to work through that data and
I've got an example of my web service of
taking a more complex JSON document and
shredding it with a couple of JSON table
statements so pretty cool and if you're
on 12 - a lot of stuff you might have
done with JSON query and Jason value
actually gets rewritten to use JSON
table behind the scenes so pretty neat
Jason contains is used with a special
type of index which is adjacent search
index you have to have the index looking
like this in release one so that's just
straight out the manual with my
different name on it that allows me to
use jason contains which is like a full
text index search for jason so pretty
handy in 12c release - we've got a whole
bunch more
first of all similar to what happened
with xml all the jason functionality got
moved into its own manual now so it's a
little bit more consistent we have x SQL
jason available as anyone used SQL xml
before things like xml forests xml
attribute xml AGG yeah
so cool this is the same but for Jason
really I'll give you some very brief
examples of it which will vastly
oversimplify it but I've got to get
through the talk pretty quickly and all
of the Jason conditions I mentioned
before are now available natively in
pl/sql in 12:1 you have to select them
from jewel or something like that to use
them they're now all native to pl/sql
and we get a bunch of JSON objects and
that we can use to either build jason
manually or pass it manually in the
previous slides I mentioned Apex Jason
which i think is really cool if you're
not on 12 - if you're on 12 - you should
probably ditch Apex Jason and use this
stuff because it's pretty neat so let's
have a very brief look at some of that
stuff
Jason object not really that sort of
thrilling to look at but what it allows
me to do is define key pairs and it
builds me a JSON object in this case if
I have four rows in the table I get four
rows coming out each with its unique
JSON object built up with those key
pairs and comma separated if I want to
aggregate data I can do Jason aggghhhhh
once again I've got a key pair and it
advocates those into a single array now
looks pretty simplistic but remember
that value could actually be a call to
one of the other functions I mentioned
so you can nest them to create complex
documents JSON array can you guess what
this one does it produces a JSON array I
can put in any values I want comma
separated and it builds up a JSON array
of those values one row for each one row
produced for each row of data that comes
into this and then JSON AG not
surprisingly creates aggregates multiple
rows into a single JSON array once again
looks very simplistic but remember the
input to these things can be caused to
other jason functions other SQL jason
functions
for example you're not going to be able
to read this but um maybe you can I've
got a JSON object core which is
departments so it's going to be a list
of departments in there I've got an
array of departments with a department
name a department number and a list of
employees and the input to that is
adjacent AG of JSON objects defining all
the employees so by nesting calls to
functions in functions I get a single
output which is kind of like the data I
showed you before a list of departments
each with its eternal list of employees
if you've used XML SQL XML you'll go oh
yeah that's really normal if you've not
that will look horrendous to you but
it's really quite easy once you get used
to it so I also mentioned that we have
some new types available in 12:2 which
would allow us to either pass or create
jason programmatically and i'm not going
to talk about them individually but
there's an article on my website about
it and i think as someone throwing their
hands around a very nearly run out time
no okay
so what we've got is a bunch of objects
to define JSON objects creating arrays
and what i can do is i can loop through
some existing data and programmatically
decide how many items are in the array
process them define decide what the data
types of the things are inside the array
and do something with them standard come
back standard sort of code you expect if
you're manually passing jason and if
you've tried using something like apex
jason before or PL jason and the package
on the alexandria library then this will
look fairly familiar so pretty easy to
use so that's what's in 12c some quick
mentions of things prior to 12c release
two you should definitely consider
getting apex installed on your database
even if you don't want to use apex
because you get things like Apex web
service which allows you to call out to
for web services or soap web services
and those can be restful Web Services in
XML or Java
you've got Apex Jason which is as I said
a really good way are passing or
creating JSON documents if you're using
odds I actually kind of hate this
functionality myself but if you're
predominately a middle tier developer
that doesn't ever want to touch pl/sql
that's fine you can turn on auto rest in
a schema and then by just saying I want
this object I want this object it will
actually automatically generate rest api
for you so you can query and insert
update delete that particular table like
I said I don't particularly like that
sort of idea because it's lots and lots
of network traffic to do individual
pieces and that makes DBAs cry so not my
idea but it's there if you need it in
the next version of ODS they're also
going to allow auto rest of packages
package procedures and functions but I
do not believe you will get the full
gamut of functionality everything will
be a put when you call it and so it's
not true rest but it's close and I
haven't talked at all about
authentication but ODS comes with some
great authentic ation options you can do
the classic things like basic
authentication but you can also do
several several Roth to flows including
things that require user interactions so
the sort of things you'd get on a mobile
phone where it requires you to agree to
something all of those sort of flows are
supported it's really a bit weird if
you've never used it before if you've
never used OAuth 2 but if you have used
it it's pretty straightforward and I
could have actually started this talk
with just use SQL Developer because odds
is built into SQL Developer and you can
put point and click without really
knowing much about it and get it to work
when I started to look at odds the last
thing I looked at was SQL Developer
which was a mistake because the
documentation is not the best and
probably the easiest way to learn it is
to use SQL Developer to connect to it
and then play around with that and you
can see all of the pl/sql and SQL you're
generating so pretty easy to get going
so my own feeling and I said this at the
start is that I've spent 22 years
playing around with Oracle databases and
in that time I've constantly been trying
to make people use the database more
efficiently banging on to people
repeatedly about how they suck and how
you know I'm amazing or something is not
really a very good way forward and it's
also a lie but if we can present what
we've got to the outside world in a way
that they're happy to consume that's
great if you're working in a company
that's got a 20 year investment in
pl/sql why wouldn't you present it to
the middle tier developers or even
client developers like this why would
you rewrite everything you've got into a
new infrastructure that a new with any
new programming language on a new
infrastructure if you could just present
what you've got in a usable form this
may be the final solution or it may be a
stepping stone while you redevelop other
things and that's fine it's not a
problem
but don't discount what the database can
do so that I can have a job for a bit
longer
okay so and I have this web service
sorry this web page that I mentioned
please show that it's not going to show
let's try again at this website Oracle
based com on there there's a very very
simple there's a very simple page called
Oracle based comm slash workshops that
isn't indexed on the search engines but
it's got this tour this talk has got two
names depending on the audience and PDF
so
I'd article I think the article is the
best route into it because slides don't
really do very much for me the article
has got everything I talked about today
in there but it's linked from that page
it's really easy to get to and what's
important is it actually has links to
really doing this stuff as opposed to
just showing silly examples the
difficulty with the presentation is you
have to always talk about really simple
examples there's nothing like the real
world and that kind of sucks so if
you're interested crack on over to the
website have a look and I think it'll
all be there and explained for you there
are new versions of boards coming out
all the time
so I actually wrote to the developers
just before I stuck a to this talk and
said is there a new version about to
come out that means what I said last
time is a lie and they said funnily
funny you should say that because of the
new version you act very soon which will
have a bunch of new cool stuff in if
you've got any questions either now or
you can grab me now I love talking about
this stuff if you're too embarrassed to
ask questions from the audience which I
was this morning and you can grab me
later I'm happy to talk about it my name
is Tim the websites Oracle based com can
you guess what my email address is yeah
Tim at Oracle based comm but you can
catch me on Twitter Facebook Linkedin
whatever I'll do my best to answer if I
don't know the answer I will definitely
know someone that does and even if it's
kind of like I've never heard of this
before
chances are I know someone who works in
that field so drop me a question now
anyone yeah
just into the mic please so that they
can hear the question I can be
embarrassed when I don't know the answer
I'm sure your website my name is Felix
I'm from University of Birmingham I only
started with her in January and
unfortunately the development
environment of god oracle 11g
some of these like old epic
candor on in 11g yeah sure
apex urn is fine which University in
Birmingham University of Birmingham
demand in Edgbaston yes I'm surprised we
haven't met
when I say no started in January
oh okay yeah I'm guessing you're on the
new core project okay yeah so and you've
actually got when I get back you've
actually got 12c database and the latest
version of wards waiting for you so we
it depends it really depends on yes odd
confront anything from 10g upwards Apex
will install into anything from 10g
upwards it's really not a problem and at
the place you work you have got nothing
lower than 1104 and there were a bunch
of databases that were on twelve one or
two you've got no twelve 202 in
production sorry twelve 201 in
production because I haven't put it
there yet because I'm too cautious and
also isn't a problem it's just a
question of me knowing that you need it
okay so have a word with Adrian Lydia
that's a bit scary in there any more
questions from people I don't almost
work with it among anyone else okay
I'll speak to this guy in a minute then
yeah okay you can cut that from the end
of the presentation if you want okay
thanks very much come and grab me if
you've got questions I'm happy to speak
Cheers
