development manager for open mq for a
long time I've had with me Amy Kang
she's a you can't hear oh sorry okay so
i have with me Amy Kang she's been on
the project longer than me and we're
going to talk a little bit about web
socket and what we've done for trying to
bring web socket to the JMS provider
that we have an open mq so this is our
obligatory safe harbor slide so
basically I think I heard it best what
what this says is don't believe anything
I say so we're going to talk about JMS
20 we're going to talk about issues with
web scaling and talking a little bit
about well I'll explain what we did with
them bringing that into JMS and how we
extended it for web sockets will give
some code samples and then talk a little
bit about how we try to wrap everything
up at the end okay so GMS i think i did
a show of hands earlier i'm going to go
pretty quickly through the JMS 101
section basically it's a AP java api
that allows you to provide a loose
coupling between senders and receivers
and then JMS manages all the persistence
the JMS servers manage all of the all
the details and controls that you need
for keeping those destinations separate
and and data flowing through with lots
of different messages flowing through
different destinations in different
kinds of messaging paradigms so you can
have point-to-point messaging using
queues or you can have published and
subscribe using topics there are many
JMS servers I'm sure you're all aware of
more than one you have your favorites
they all have a different collection of
additional features and anyway so that's
all I'm going to say about JMS 101 so
essentially it's an n-tier tech done let
topology
we use TCP to exchange messages between
a JMS Java client and that coordinates
where they serve a back-end server or we
call it a JMS broker JMS too if you got
to Nigel's presentation earlier he gave
a very detailed explanation of
everything in GMS to that was really our
simplification of the API the first
simplification in over 10 years adds
several new features the most the most
important one being the addition of JMS
context and the simplified what we call
the simplified API if you didn't catch
his talk you can look it up in the I
think all these slides are supposed to
be posted afterward so conch was it talk
5 9 19 mm anyway and there are also lots
of lots of web pages I think that or
more and more web pages that are
describing jam is two point oh we're
getting a lot of good reception for JMS
two point oh I think it's a well needed
and much about time that we got around
to updating the spec html5 so GMS 2 c's
provide some simplifications html5
basically is solving the need of being
able to bring multiple streams together
and providing a rich client application
that actually runs in your browser right
so for the longest time I don't seem to
me for it seemed like for the longest
time there were a lot of trouble wit
with html5 with browser support but as
time progresses more and more browsers
are are enabling html5 support I'd like
to say it's in all browsers but it's not
and I guess I'd say most notably there
are several mobile a couple of
significant mobile browsers that are
still not quite up with the html5 there
have been many talks about html5 here if
you were interested I'm sure you you
caught several of them
okay so web-scale messaging with the
basic JMS the biggest issue with JMS is
it's a it's a very rich and a high
fidelity API you can do pretty much
anything you need to do with messaging
via the standard of JMS however it's a
if you try to map that to http right you
run into this problem of HTTP is single
direction right so many companies
including we have tried to simulate that
using polling but that creates a lot of
problems with scaling out to the web not
to mention that web scaling makes it
difficult to be able to distribute the
JMS client to all the all of your web
applications that want to use it so a
couple of diagrams on it show you so
when you send a message in JMS we want
to give you an acknowledgement that you
actually got that message to the server
before you move on to the to send the
next message so you send you receipt you
receive the acknowledgement you send it
again you see you've sent another
message you receive another
acknowledgement so to do that with HTTP
in a single direction you have to do a
lot of simulation of polling so not only
does the client have to pull find out
did I get an act back but the servers
are also pulling to see did I get a new
message there's a lot of extra overhead
that we that it has to happen to be able
to simulate this in a unidirectional one
socket so we do exactly this this is I
pulled it straight out of our manual we
have a what we call tunneling servlet so
we have this extra servlet that we
deploy to into a servlet container and
it manages all of this HTTP traffic it
does the polling and it basically does a
conversion from HTTP to the TCP
mechanism that we that we use for open
mq okay so WebSocket wise WebSocket
going to help me so web you probably
seen exactly this somewhere else but
WebSocket provides a full duplex
communication basically it's a exchange
between your client application and the
HTTP server the
allows the socket connection to be
upgraded to a full duplex tcp light
connection this is so I was trying to
remember what my last point there was we
added WebSocket h2h to java ee 7 jsr 356
was the provides a standard API for
accessing web socket in Java EE and
there were many examples if you've been
to a lot of it's a little funny coming
at the end of this but I'm there been a
lot of sessions on web sockets and Java
EE if you don't have something to go try
out for some samples with WebSocket you
might try the GlassFish hands-on lab
that has some very rudimentary examples
code samples that you can download and
compile in with web socket and learn
learn about how to use web socket and
java ee project tyrus was the reference
implementation for WebSocket basically
that was driven by the jsr that's
available as a standalone component that
you can you can download you can use it
in your applications what this gives you
is the stant the JMS stand i'm sorry the
chávez standard for web socket so that
you can so that if you want to write
your applications using a standard your
java applications you can use web socket
they have samples available when they
have a full Javadoc is also also
available grizzly so grizzly is a
server-side component that lets that
helps you manage all of your serial i/o
and it lets you it provides a wealth of
features from the server side to help
you well we use it on the server side I
think you can use it in multiple
dimensions but to help you with anything
you need for serial i/o what we care
about is for this talk what I'm
interested in is the web socket
interface it's basically a building
block that helps you
manage all the incoming threads it
manages a collection of what they call
WebSocket applications and it makes it a
lot easier so you don't have to write
all this code you just bring in grizzly
and then you're writing to the single
set of api's for grizzly Grizzlies used
it a lot of different projects already
glassfish enterprise server uses it we
use it in class we already used it in
glassfish mq and then tyrus to be honest
iris uses it as well so when you bring
it if you bring a few views Tyra's
you're actually bringing in grizzly
yourself so what do we have to do to
take open mq and add WebSocket support
to it alright so like I as I said
earlier the original JMS client uses it
communicates via a standard tcp socket
grizzly ask support for TCP sockets but
it also has support for web socket so it
we use grizzly on the server side and
then we use tyrus so that we're writing
to a standard API in our client a JMS
client application and and then we the
combination of those two allows us to to
provide web socket and act in in the
Java API case we can use web sockets
without even have requiring much change
to your to the original JMS application
so we started off with the tunneling
servant like sort of lettuces is another
diagram similar to what i had earlier
and so we have the brokers talking TCP
the tunneling servlets doing a
translation and then managing all the
HTTP clients that are currently
connected and then all of your JMS
clients are are talking are converting
today of a we have a JMS client runtime
that map's the JMS API requests to an
HTTP protocol and that's what that's
where we we started we added in tyrus to
the JMS client runtime so now instead of
using an HTTP request the tyrus
combination with them with grizzly maps
that to a WebSocket connect
so we can get a full duplex JMS
connection straight from your Janice you
java JMS client back to the broker so
grisly it allows us to send and receive
the remote end points it also defines
the things called WebSocket applications
and it uses a WebSocket engine that
manages that that collection of engines
what this does is lets us extend the
broker so what we use to use just for a
TCP connection now we can just like we
use the TCP connection we can now use a
WebSocket connection as well so this is
the block diagram of that so you have a
you can have any number of web socket
applications and then grizzly manages
all this it manages the threads for us
and it provides a very high capacity
high throughput mechanism you can use
the key feature that we were interested
in was being able to map well we had to
map since we're using web sockets all
the all of this traffic over a single
port and so grisly provides that
capability and we just write to us the
same API I can't really say enough about
how about using grizzly because when
they extend grizzly to add support for
other protocols right since we're
already since we're kind of buffered
we're hidden from from that protocol
support or that the i/o support grizzly
gives it to us almost for free so so if
you're writing server-side applications
i strongly encourage you to check
grizzly out so the putting it all
together right so now you've got your
java application it's basically
unchanged with the java with the JMS a
client runtime because we hide all of
the WebSocket connectivity and then it's
communicating over the WebSocket port
and it's some talking to the GlassFish
broker glassfish mq JMS broker which is
also using web socket
alright so that's all that's that's a
way to do for a WebSocket so let's talk
a little bit about stomp not all your
applications are going to be written in
Java there are several different api's
of protocols that you can use to to also
perform messaging one of the most seems
to us one of the most accessible
protocols has has been stomp which is an
acronym streaming text oriented
messaging protocol this is defined well
currently stomp lives in a project at
github I think they moved it just a
couple of years back but it's basically
a text-based format when we first
support it stomp in the 1010 version or
11 we you could just test it out using a
telnet connection fact that's how we
download it to most people is so it's
very convenient and your applications
your client-side applications can just
create a text stream or you know they
can just send text down the through the
serial i/o port and and then they can
get make an exchange messages using this
protocol it's important to note that it
is a protocol right and there's a lot of
JMS servers that supports Tom but it's
not JMS okay so there is a in terms of
the complexity or the richness of the
API stomp tries to simplify that ever
maybe a couple handfuls of of api's but
that's all that they provide in stone so
you exchange that simplicity for being
able to to provide greater access to
your to your applicant to more broader
access to your applications so with the
Grizzly support / web socket and the
fact that web socket is built into your
html5 applications I could just write
JavaScript using the web socket API it's
the JavaScript creates the web the stomp
protocol and
we'll take those messages will suck them
into open mq and we provoke we grizzly
will route those messages to our stop
WebSocket application JSON obviously
another very common or Hugh BIC w'ite is
some language it basically allows you
json that the key thing that JSON brings
to the table is very extensive language
support over fifty eight languages are
currently have some kind of a binding
for json so primarily we are I think of
JSON as being something that I mean use
in a scripted form in my scripted JMS or
lie scripted client applications but you
III couldn't I am NOT a language expert
but there were awful lot of language as
an awful lot of what appeared to me to
be obscure languages that I'd never
heard of that have JSON support so it's
very universal so what we were trying to
figure out was well how could we map you
know how could we map messaging to
through JSON and so we just we thought
well let's try to try out a simple
mapping of stomp we'll just use the same
protocol that stomp provides and then
we'll just create the use the using the
key value mechanisms that that JSON
provides we'll just map that straight to
to a stomp protocol and then we can use
the same WebSocket implementation so now
so yeah this gives two choices right you
can take your original application or
you can take a client application and
you can write directly to the stomp
protocol using the JavaScript in web
socket API part of html5 or you can use
JSON to create that same very similar
mapping and then on the server side
right we just did use the same pattern
right we have a JSON web socket
application we use the JSON processing
API all these are provided as part of
the latest java ee 7 standards and that
gets us to a very sort of regular
pattern
that so I had a head of a WebSocket
application for java JMS had a WebSocket
application that we use for grizzly and
i have a website socket application for
JSON over WebSocket so for me is the
server-side developer makes it a lot
easier for us to extend support as we as
if we were to add other clients grizzly
allows us to create new WebSocket
applications and map those to my own my
server i can map that protocol through
the through the web socket I'm sorry
through the web socket grizzly engine so
WebSocket benefits probably most of you
know this already right so certainly
greater throughput right at least 2x
performance and this is just us trying
it out on our stupid laptops you know we
didn't do an extensive performance of
evaluation but based on our prior
implementations there's no polling so
it's a much more a much much higher
throughput application if you noticed in
the earlier in that where we started we
have this some tunneling servlet
intermediary application it's another
thread its managing its managing
conversations between the kelowna HTTP
clients and the JMS broker well that's a
bunch of that's a bunch of extra code
that we don't have to have anyone we
don't have to deploy it you don't have
to worry about did it crash it's still
running or is it getting backed up so
now the now all of the JMS clients can
coordinate directly with JMS broker
where we've got i'd like to think that
we have have better Multi multi we have
better scalability support at the server
side there yes sir
the question is there a limit to the
number of clients that a server can
support it's really just limited by the
scalability of the server right we've
tested glassfish mq to thousands of
clients I think if you talk to whatever
your JMS provider you know is that
you're interested in I'm sure they'll
tell it they'll give you some mechanism
for some way to tell how well none of
the specs are none of the sort of design
prevents you know has any kind of
limitations it's really just a question
of how much horsepower does your server
have and how efficient are the can you
move the data around the tub sure
how easy
so the question I think is how can how
easy would it be to apply this to
another product right so you mentioned
activemq I'll tell you right now
activemq already has a pretty extensive
WebSocket support so you could you could
you could definitely go direct you can
do it they definitely support stomp I
don't think they're going to have the
JMS sorry the JSON binding that we have
just because it's we we were trying to
figure out a way to get directly to JSON
so you're writing JSON script in your at
your in your browser clients and we
couldn't really find a suitable starting
point for that so we just said well it's
just map stop there so that's kind of an
experimental thing we're kind of
interested if you guys try it out and
you like it you know let's see where we
could take it that's really that's
really where we're at with that right
now um if you have your own client
application I guess I'd say try to
follow the pattern here use tyrus then
your apt and your client is you can
write to the deal java standard you can
write to you to the java standard to get
it to to be able to access web sockets
and then you can just use that to map
directly to your to whatever your server
side is if your server already has
WebSocket support then Tyra's should be
a quick cup a way to extend it ok all
right um so now we're going to talk a
little bit about code samples and I
actually got here faster than i thought
it was so amy has extracted out I think
what you're going to see is a lot of
regularity and the way the code works
but I don't want to steal her thunder so
go ahead Amy this that consent
okay can you make yeah okay okay so I'm
going to talking about some more code
examples which will show you know how
you could read her you know clients to
communicate with Oklahoma Cuban Clara
over WebSocket so first we look I to
java gmail / WebSocket so this is a code
which is basically the same as you
except one man and the same when you
would've rather ordinary DMSO to that
old Java client so I one lamb colder
that's different is the where you said
mq address list which give the URL that
she is specifically to open em queues
syntax that specifies you're going to
one is a climb the connector with a
schema and qws and that means the I'm
kills a web socket or scheme protocol
scheme and then you specify the broker
hostname and the report the WebSocket a
service a decent hour in the broker then
the last one is the ws the GMs that's
the default website header service name
in the broker that's the only difference
so you can take an existing dms the
application and changes are addressed is
that to a size website aid so the rest
of the code hopefully you all familiar
is GMS to that all created on contacts
and then create a per diem as a producer
then send a message to mac you and then
the second apart registro on the
receiving side to receive the message
from ohmic you and
and you know your tractor the payload of
the message and then when you don't use
that anymore do you you're going to
close this or DMSO contacts so this one
the next one is a JavaScript example for
stump over WebSocket so this example
shows you how to the simple code you
know to create or using Java Script a
web socket API that's a standard in
html5 to create a website header in a
javascript then you're going to set up
or handlers for that a WebSocket you see
an open and close our message robotic
what the function will be to take care
data so the next slide so here is the
mall a specific to do with the stumble
protocol for those of you familiar
stumble protocol unit you can see is a
straightforward right and so I give you
some simple description and a stumble
protocol is the composer of all commands
and headers and the body and the
commander others assemble ones or
connect send subscribe you can also
support the transaction like a commuter
and the border right and then I to end a
you disconnect so here we see first we
once the website here is created
connected then you say WebSocket does
send then you put a stump frame so you
just stumble message is called a stumble
frame so we can see them was the sender
in the parasites that istanbul frame it
started with istanbul commando connect
then the hydros login pass code and then
the acceptor version then every stamp
right Freeman end up with a number
so that's your season now at the end so
that's a father that's when you connect
once you connector to the broker that
will create her or DMSO connection map
to TMS a connection on the broker aside
and so then you can send the message so
now you send a message reusing the stamp
of center frame cinder you in the sender
frame you can specify a header
destination and which is my cue and
destination then there is a message
about a the Hydra and the body's
separator two new lines and you and then
you enter the frame you send aid so for
consumer if you you call this a
subscriber that of you create or less in
corners the subscriber for you and you
send a subscriber command and in
specific which destination you want a
decent message on and you specify your
subscription ID so this is the
subscriber that's the Creator less
synchronous a message it is much like in
DMSO to message a designer so when the
messages come interview a call invoker
your website header on message or handle
next read yet here is the source of a
WebSocket our message function so this
is a part of a Java Script WebSocket
standard API and so in the a message
then you're going to even that data
that's where the pack leader comes in
then you're going to pass the data to
photo stampa frame to process to cut the
Hydra the commander and the body and
then you can unsubscribe rate to close
the consumer you use sender unsubscribe
or frame and then to disconnect and then
you send out this connector frame so
this is shows that you know you know
JavaScript or how you could use a stump
to send a message through senior message
or web apps out there so this one is a
JavaScript 4G song / WebSocket so this
is this the example is basically uses
the gsl 24 mattalast ample frame and
because the gsi is the statement
actually the same as the JavaScript
statement all right it's part of a
JavaScript so you can just directly
using dsl in the side JavaScript that's
very convenient that's why we combine
these two together so the first
accessorize e is a similar as the stamp
one so you create a website carrying you
set up behind alerts using the
JavaScript WebSocket a standard API next
select then so now so so when you want
to send a stumble connector frame to the
broker essentially is you create or JSON
objects so just year some objects we
will have a three part is a command and
that's the law student tab and which has
a value that's corresponding to a sample
command then there is the headers sub
JSON object so that data compost
unordered key value pairs of hiders so
you can do put the stump hydras again
tease the headers which is an object's
then there is a certain powder in the
gsl in this JSON object uses up all day
for the connector frame when there is
nobody needed so then we once we put a
login passcode version then we just
recall the GS and other screen of I for
these the GSR objects and then we can
reduce the text data and then we just a
WebSocket a sin so that have you senator
so you do not need a tool you know right
okay so we will come to this little
slider this one is shows for the center
frame so you set up you create a larger
gsm objects and and then you set up the
command and combine the stream and then
the headers or objects and then this one
has a body so the body and here says is
the text what's the body is and you set
a is a similar seeing you then you sent
the two gs on data over the web socket
and then the message is sent over the
web is allocated through the broker
that's right here shows to the to JSON
objects for the subscribers frame and
it's a similar on you set it as three
parts the disa only requires a two
person there is nobody for subscribe
similarly when you send a to the
synchronous the consumer will be created
when the message comes here the web
stockade a message of you get a card
next select so here just show this this
JavaScript web socket API our message
when the data comes in and you can just
call GS and other parts past is a given
the data in the interview and the data
as a package comes in will automatically
fill in these two gs on objects you do
not need to pass the data yourself or
passes a sample frame where's the header
what is the command so then you're going
to access to this which is an object
that account monitor the header that
body to process as you needed so here's
our similar it for unsubscribe of frame
and for this connector frame using JSON
objects to
to format it and send over the website
ADA we use another needed at the website
header then you'll call website a door
closed so yeah that's the okay so I we
gave three examples they all pretty much
did the same thing and I think I hope
you saw the regularity of how it's used
so now that Molly leaves you with well
which one should i use i guess i would
say the Java API will provide you with
the richest level of control if you need
all the all the different kinds of
service quality I would definitely
suggest to use the Java API if you if
you have scalability problems at your
client side where you you know you can't
really afford to distribute this client
side runtime then probably choose either
stop or JSON nice thing about stomp is
if you're writing to the stomp standard
you can probably communicate with lots
of different GMS brokers json again
that's experimental at this point and we
were looking for a natural mechanism for
for coordinate for writing directly in
in in html5 based applications that
definitely JSON has has the greatest
amount of application support so yes I i
guess i would say we were going to give
you a demo but I I don't know I've SAT
through a lot of demos and I thought
well people that are interested go try
it out so you can download the latest
copy of open mq and that has we posted
instructions for setting up the code
examples that we just showed you the
examples are available for download
right now and you can try it out and
then you can test out you know which one
gives you the support you need I will
give a I'll give it on a bash plug for
open message queue we've just released
five dot 0 which provides support for
JMS 2 point 0 we also provided some
additional
support for different threading models
to improve performance we've improved
the reliability of the JDBC database
support and we've also extend the see
clients so that it provides a few extra
a few extra features including shared
subscriptions and delivery delay those
are part of JMS 2 point 0 so in summary
right JMS provides a very rich mechanism
for for coordinating between systems GMS
to extend that at that api by providing
some much needed simplifications
hopefully that will reduce some of the
but the deep water that that programmers
can get into so they don't have to go
into all the levels of detail until they
really need it HTTP sorry is extended by
web socket and it provides a very
extensive way to bring very rich client
ax client support in via html5
definitely if you're working on server
side or even client side take a look at
using grizzly as part of your system
components tyrus these are all packages
that you can just download right now you
can use the api's they're all available
as part of them under multiple different
licensing from from Java net and website
allows you to provide direct integration
to your your JMS server and and it is
about provides a lot of additional
support so I've got a bunch of links
here at the end of the presentation
these tell you where these things are
and I think we have time for some
questions sure
he did
I don't think we looked at it in part
because we were already using grizzly
but yeah are you talking about crazily
in my old client library I'm sorry the
server library the idea not DNA library
Brizuela committee looking at a
comparison with other implementations
well to us is because we are part of a
glassfish and crazily is a part of
glassfish or so we just you know in the
booming integrator to classf a sure
there is Grizzlies already there yes
yeah okay yes
how so it's actually already integrated
into the current versions of him of
glassfish 40 401 the nightly builds that
we're pushing out so if you I don't know
if the very latest build which we just
did this week is in there but it will be
in there shortly is it yeah you step ok
so if use if if you can use glassfish
401 night least then that will then you
can you already get this question is
what kind of transactional support is
available in stock on the stock advice
yes tompa has the transaction support
yeah yeah yes so the question is can you
use this in an MDB for context and
inside a glass inside the GlassFish
open-source application server using
stomp in routine as a java ee you know
java ee application component i guess
you could but you w not participate or
global transaction so i think the Sudan
protocol is mainly to the simple
protocol for scripting clients that I
think is that most suitable for client
aside like a browser carranza and so it
doesn't support a transaction itself
it's built into the protocol you so you
can send and receive messages or you
know transaction okay oh yeah
javis cologne
regular gym a sport

so the question is how do you how do we
compare the Java JMS the standard Java
JMS client with the client that i'm
showing here well so that's i'll let Amy
answer but also yes so why was something
so what is a started oh we are looking
at a website that use alternative of all
HTTP servlet a tunneling so if you have
a client that runs you know over in
tonight and in the past that you can
only use a HTTP and so under GMS you
have an implementation with the and
wizard HTTP you will need to deploy your
RAR file to a web server that you know
the waffle we have is the Soviet
returning and so in with a website
header then you have with this
alternative you should just use the web
socket the good thing about the web
socket is that I usually uses the
default reporter you can use these to 74
the polarizer as the HTTP and and the
website header started as a handshake
started as the HTTP upgraded request so
we do can you know go through most of
the proxy servers so that's that's a
situation you'll probably look at it or
using website later than other than you
know TCP connection that where the TCP
connection is not a suitable any
especially in the browser right you can
also create a TCP connection through the
back on and the server but you can
create a web socket or connection today
with a HTML file will website ada
JavaScript or standard so another way to
answer you we were trying some samples
and we I all we did was we rebuild a
sample and add the classpath so that we
could get the tyra stars and those
samples worked unchanged all we had to
do was change the
should change the connection factory
entry so so if you're using java JMS and
you use our client now it not every java
client has that support so each vendor
has has its own you know we'll manage
that independently I think you had a
question back there by the door
so the question is is open mq support
clustering yes sorry so we provide a
range of different availability options
you can you can have you can have sort
of what call conventional clusters where
if you have shared data then the
clusters can resume after bye-bye after
there's a failure they can resume or we
have high availability support via jdbc
back end store where this all of that
take over it is managed transparently to
your application so we if you're
interested in that thing I definitely
encourage you to check out the high
availability options of open mq yeah
for instance
I'm sorry I can't quite hear you oh
security so Jamie yeah I'm the secure
are specifically the webos ok Dorrian
journal yeah so you you so much but the
questions about security and web sockets
and are you asking specifically about
what we have an open and cue or just a
WebSocket security in general exposing
accuse exposing the JMS server to the
outside world so you will need to use a
secure web socket and so how will
encrypted are you know transport so you
can use secure web socket we also have
whitelist support so you can only you
could say okay you have to be this you
have to have this server server IP or we
don't talk to you those are the two
things that we have right now yes sorry
so I think the question is can we
clarify what is the secure web socket
support that we offer is that yeah so
are the new so useful using a tiara as I
thought yeah TLS SSL yeah
yet both are supported you mean the
server authentication and climb of
syndication run yeah clan all security
of syndication uses supported yeah yes
um did you have a question next time I
think earlier one of you did but I'll go
go ahead so actually I could you also
leverage the authentication
so that if you use if using WebSocket
inside a servlet container probably your
best bet is to use is to to actually use
the built-in web socket support that's
part of Java EE right and then it can
talk directly to your MBBS from with
engines from from within Java EE so what
we're describing here is really support
for your standard yet you know a java SE
based client or WebSocket that just
wants to talk directly doesn't want you
know it is working outside of a java ee
context yeah
anybody you
so the question is if you're using
glassfish do you need a separate if
you're not using glassfish you need a
separate WebSocket server right so no
baby do you want i'll start with no and
then i'll ask about telling so WebSocket
server i'm not sure what you mean so the
broker has to the website ada engine
build again so all you need to do is
specify the URL to get connected to the
broker's website 80 service and so if
all y'all application you you wouldn't
need a server running application right
so
so if using a different product right
then the knee will heck if it has web
socket support and you'll have to read
you'll have to use all of their
instructions if you want to use web
socket and open mq you don't need
anything else right you don't need
anything in in for the new JMS client
runtime and you don't need anything else
in the server we provide package all
that up for you yeah our connections so
we can already scare the question is is
this scalable is this architecture
scalable we can already scale up and mq
to thousands of connections each for
each each member of the open mq cluster
and then if you need more than that you
can create clusters and then underneath
the JMS api we provide all the data
routing all the message routing so that
if you're producing messages at a remote
broker they can be consumed by any of
the consumers that are participative
connected into this JMS cluster so easy
it's scaled the question is it's
scalable we've tested thousands tens of
thousands of clients you tell me how
many needed having I can't
a single planet
that's the way JMS works right so if you
want now you could take that same
scalability and apply it to an https set
of HTTP connections those are sorry web
socket connections and I can't tell you
that we've done any skinny overall
scalability testing with grizzly but I
know that they use grizzly and the same
niños engine that grout glassfish uses
so if you think ja ve application
servers aren't scalable then perhaps
this isn't but I think it has a lot of
scalability potential any other
questions seem like he has some question
where they do but you were asked there
are they ate something oh no ok ok so i
encourage you to try it out you know
questions about scalability there's a
really best answered by you know you
giving it a whirl and it's pretty easy
to set up and run so anyway thank you
very much enjoy the rest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
