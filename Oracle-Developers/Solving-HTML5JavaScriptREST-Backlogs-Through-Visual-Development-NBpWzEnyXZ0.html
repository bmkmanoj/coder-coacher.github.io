and we're going to talk about how to
solve HTML Javascript rest backlog using
visual tools we're both from the
development team inside Oracle that
deals with building development tools
for the cloud that are used by both
local internally to build our own
applications as well as our customers to
build their own applications what I
wanted to find out first though now that
you know who we are is who you are so
how many of you are currently doing
html5 JavaScript development okay how
many of you are enjoying this experience
how many of you would like to do
JavaScript html5 okay and some of you
just went into the wrong room and the
guy looks nice it's okay we'll continue
alright so I am I don't know if I need
to show this slide but I put it here
just in case for those of you who don't
know and this is the trend now so this
is based on a survey that Stack Overflow
does every those of you don't know Stack
Overflow probably I'm not actually doing
development Stack Overflow is if you
have a question on something doesn't
work you go and you google it you get
the first lengthy disrespect overflow
you go over there you copy the code
paste it into your environment and this
is how it starts working and now says it
stack overflow is a very popular
platform for developers to answer and
get to ask questions and get answers
everywhere they do a global survey among
their members asking them a bunch of
questions about what are they using what
are they planning to use stuff like that
and this year this is the results from
earlier this year the most popular
language is JavaScript okay the most
popular thing that people do with
JavaScript is build web development ok
web applications not just with
JavaScript in general most people build
web application and the third thing is
actually mobile development and the nice
thing about javascript is that it does
both and then in Java in the world of
like development there's the concept of
wanton and break and development but
most people define themselves as full
stack development so in the case in
basically in the scenario of working
with JavaScript html5 and those are
usually used for building the UI and
then the backend is usually something
that you write some people write it in
JavaScript in node.js stuff like that
some people at it in other languages and
then you connect with rest and this
would be the back-end developer most
developers are actually required to do
both so build both the front-end part
and the backend code ok so javascript is
very popular the question is why okay
and there are several reasons for it one
like the key reason is that with the
combination of javascript and html5 you
get a better UI experience okay your UI
is more responsive oh it feels more
responsive for the users when they do
operations because it's actually a
client-side technology turns on the
client III it removes a lot of the
necessary network traffic to the server
that all the technology is like JSF or
servlets or PHP or stuff like that that
lands on the server and generates the
you I used to have you got much more
functionality happening on the client
side making your UI experience much
faster and it's also more responsive in
the sense that it makes it easy to build
a single application that renders well
on a big screen and on a smaller screen
okay basically doing responsive UI
adaptive UI and it gives you easier
adaptability to mobile and many of you
are probably already developing getting
requirements to build your application
so it's mobile accessible as well okay
so this is one aspect the other aspect
about mobile is that you can actually
use JavaScript to build not just a
responsive UI but you can actually build
a UI that is targeted and is executed on
the mobile device okay so you take your
JavaScript html5 you are you package it
with something called Cordova and then
you get an installable application that
can
on your iOS Android Windows device and
that's an again a nice thing about
JavaScript is that it gives you the
portability between those platform still
enables you to run on the machine okay
you can even achieve native look and
feel if you have the right skins for
your components and it's all with the
same stack so you learn one language and
you can build all sorts of you eyes and
it's not just you as a developer it's
also very appealing again for companies
because they can say ok I'll hire a
JavaScript guy and the JavaScript guy
would be able to build all sorts of
applications for me so this is one
reason that companies are moving this
way and some people also as I said I was
starting to build though many of them
not just starting actually doing it
building the backend in JavaScript using
node.js concepts like that the solutions
that you build in this architecture are
quite scalable ok it's stateless
applications it allows you to grow to
support a lot of users very easily
because you don't maintain a lot of
information about each one of them on
the back end you're actually leveraging
the fact that you have a powerful client
machine and to store stuff in there as
well
and it's a decoupled application the
coupled architecture ok so what you're
actually doing is you're building an
application where your UI is
disconnected from the implementation of
your back-end which allows you in a lot
of cases to reuse back-end that you
already have ok
it allows you to use multiple
technologies on the backend because you
just took through standard rest services
so if you already built a bunch of Java
code that up until now powered the
business logic for you let's say JSF you
can leverage the same business logic
expose it as list and build a completely
new UI on top of it ok and then at some
point you say ok maybe Java is not what
I want to do on the backend maybe I want
to switch to no js' you can actually
switch the backend as long as you keep
the rest protocol and the interfaces
that you define the same you can do this
so it gives you this cool decoupling
between the two and then the last reason
that people are doing this is because
this is the cool thing to do
okay and some of you might say that
that's not an important consideration
when I'm choosing a technology right I
should consider all the things about it
but again if I like I usually tell the
people when I graduated like learning
how to do software development I didn't
actually knew which language I wanted to
walk in okay what I knew is which
language I didn't want to walk in okay I
didn't want to walk in COBOL okay now
it's not because there's anything wrong
with cobble I in fact I don't know
anything about cobble the only thing I
knew about cobble is that the old guys
were doing cobble those were the guys
where I quit the sleepers own and stuff
like that I didn't want to do the same
thing alright so before two three years
ago but the realization now is that
again people are coming out of the
colleges okay they look around what are
the old guys doing they're doing Java
okay now it doesn't matter that Java is
an excellent language and it does
exactly what people want it to do and
it's a cue and a bunch of other stuff
some people don't want to do it because
it's not cool okay so this is one reason
that a lot of people are going over to
this technology stack even if it doesn't
match what they need okay but it's still
one of the reasons that it's so popular
as we saw in the first line okay so you
made a decision I want to go and develop
in JavaScript html5 with technology then
you have a problem because there's so
many ways to do it okay
you go over there and you type in
JavaScript framework and depending on
which day you type it in the top
framework would be different okay that's
one of the nice things that's a lot of
cartoons about it every other day does a
new JavaScript framework out there that
people are trembling about and going ok
this is the next big thing ok which
again if you're looking for the latest
cool thing that's a nice thing but for a
lot of enterprises this is a tricky
thing to handle ok because you run after
the latest thing and in six months from
now it's no longer the best thing around
okay and there's a bit another library
that does something a little better and
everyone is running the other way so so
that's your first challenge okay choose
one of those and some of the other ones
and go and start developing with this
okay and let's say you solve this
problem and you decided on one of those
and you said okay this is how I'm going
to develop it you go in and this is what
you're going to do next okay this is a
screenshot of JavaScript inside an HTML
page and this is what most developers
are doing today when they are doing
JavaScript development they open their
favorite code editor and they code okay
and JavaScript is not a friendly
language for coders okay and you can
very easily get mixed with the amount of
ponies as you put in and stuff like that
it doesn't check a lot of things for you
it's not like as as coding goes
javascript is not exactly the most
productive language okay there's no
compiler step which would have surfaced
a lot of issues so it's nice not to have
to do compile you can just click run and
the application runs but when you have
problems it's becoming very hard to
actually figure out where the problem is
so in my mind this is actually the
biggest challenge for JavaScript now
it's nice for us as developers because
we get paid by DRL so the more hours we
code the more we get paid but it's not
nice for the business needs
okay the business needs actually needs
application that work and they need the
applications fast all right and so how
do you make development productive again
I've been in the business for a little
bit maybe too long and I remember what
like I remember the trends over various
technologies you start with the language
in place but the thing that actually
makes the language productive is those
type of tools okay
the visual tools so what you have stuff
like Visual Basic and power builder and
something called Oracle forms okay and
those are all like tools of the 90s okay
when I grew up
and the nice thing about those tools is
that you are able to create applications
very quickly okay you would drag and
drop your way into creating an
application connecting it to the
database getting the data in set a few
properties in a property palette and by
the way if you look at all those tools
they all have common concepts right
they have like UI components that you
can drag over there's properties that
you can set and then there's a visual
editing of the user interface so if I'm
building user interface it's very easy
for me to see what I'm actually building
okay so at least in my mind it's about
time that JavaScript html5 westwood also
have this type of productive visual
editing environment so again in the
client-server days those were known as
for GL tools or rad tools okay and again
because this is all the terminology
nobody wants to work on those tools
anymore they want to work on low code
tools local tools is the cool
terminology for the same thing that was
there before and one of the nice things
about local tools is that they actually
enable more developers to use the
technology the latest technology so the
learning curve for JavaScript is pretty
steep if you want to learn everything
and it's not again not just how to build
a if-then-else it's how do I connect to
the backend and do effective rest
communication and effective Ajax
rendering of my screen and stuff like
that
there's a lot to learn in there if I
start with a tool with a visual tool
like this like what we're going to show
you and by the way most of this session
is going to be a demo okay we want to
just set the stage this is what I'm
doing and so you can start with a visual
tool and then dive into the level of
code slowly okay so you start with
things visually and then slowly so you
say okay does a button that I need to
put in some logic in this button then
this is where I go in and I start to do
a little bit of coding
and it allows a lot more spectrum of
developers to adopt javascript and html5
and less and this is one of the
challenges for a lot of the companies
out there is that there's a shortage of
developers ok one of the things that you
can actually achieve with the right
tools is you can bring in
non-professional developers what some
people call business analysts or people
like that to actually create the base
application okay and then bring in the
professional developer to do the final
touches the more complex stuff on top of
the base application now these type of
tools are not meant for every type of
application
these tools are usually the best when
you're looking at what we call business
applications applications the deal with
manipulating data doing rad operation
create read update delete showing
relationship between objects tracking
data stuff like that visualizing those
type of data so you might not build the
next Facebook with a tool like this but
you're probably going to be able to
build your next
internal system that runs your business
with a tool like this so some of you I
already see are going towards the door
because they are saying this is not
relevant to me because I actually like
to code ok and maybe some of you like to
code them that's fine my point here is
that these tools are also relevant to
you even if you want to just code you
don't want anything visual to do your
the serious developer I actually know
how to code one thing those tools can do
they can help you build a quick mock-up
okay so when you're discussing with your
customer what are you actually building
for them what are they what do they
actually need it's much better if you
can actually show them this working even
if it's not the final application if you
can very quickly build for them this is
what I'm planning on doing this is the
flow of the screen this is the basic
layout of the screen those are the
objects it's going to make your
application more aligned
with what they actually think they need
Oh what you think they need so it
enables you to have a better feedback
loop with your customer another thing
you can do with these tools is let those
tools take the the glint of the work
fold your basic application so you need
a bunch of rest services and business
subject and you need some basic UI and
flow between pages you can build it with
this tool and then go in and do a
refinement of the UI actually coding or
modifying the UI oh maybe even scrapping
the UI and just using the business
object because you have them with the
rest services and another thing you can
do with this is you can say I'm not
going to use it but I'm going to give it
to my customer ok because you built an
application using pure html5 JavaScript
West ok so you have a layer of business
services exposed as list now once you
gave the application that you built to
the customer I guarantee you that two
days after you gave it to them they
would knock on your door and say can you
light this field oh I need one more form
that has those fields in a different
order and a little child up there so
instead of them battling you you give
them a visual tool and you give them the
access to all your West Services and
then they can visually build whatever
else they need beyond your system on top
of the rest services you already built
and you can go and have some vacation
time so this session is only about
getting you to do less work so there are
a lot of firm I don't know flood but
they have multiple visual development
tools out there we're going to show you
the Oracle one because they are in an
Oracle conference and this tool is
called the aural visual Builder cloud
service and one thing to know about slow
code platform one other thing beyond
development they're aiming to solve is
the whole actual publishing deploying
part of the application so most of those
tools are not just a development
platform but also a runtime platform one
of the goals here is to eliminate a lot
of the DevOps that is involved in taking
a
big application with multiple layers and
publishing it in creating a database in
creating the rest layer and stuff like
that and configuring all of those so
you're going to see a development
environment that is also the runtime
environment that is focused on faster
and simpler development by adopting a
visual approach to building an
application ok one moment I wanted to
talk because your technical I wanted to
also show you the underlying technology
underneath it okay you can build web and
mobile applications we have a set of UI
components that render properly on web
and mobile if you're doing the mobile it
renders like native controls on Android
and iOS they look different and they
adapt to it you're also able to build
business objects that are actually
stored in a database okay and expose
this list so those business object
exposed as less consumed by those UI
components all built from a single
builder now our UI that we're creating
is based on something called overkill
jet which is the oracle javascript
extension toolkit and that's an open
source toolkit for JavaScript developers
that you can go to github and download
and one of the things it provides is a
set of a lot of UI components with
accessibility internalization
localization mobile capabilities that
you can basically adopt in any
application that you're building we're
just using the same components here to
quickly build an application our
database is of course you know what
close database at the backend so when
you create an object we store it in an
oracle table and then we expose it as
rest service ok or trijet I just said it
it's a modular enterprise ready open
source toolkit that we use it's actually
based on a set of open source framework
with additional things that we do so we
actually again provide a set of UI
components we use jQuery to implement
those we use Hamel to give it touch
gestures and stuff like that we use sass
for skinning we now support a composite
components which is basically the
ability to build web components and use
web components inside the jet
application we do a view viewmodel model
architecture so the binding layer is
implemented using knockout which is a
popular two-way binding javascript
implementation we have a common model
that allows us to hook up not just to us
but also to WebSocket we have an
advanced routing system in place that
allows us to do things like navigate
between pages not between pages actually
between areas in the page using your
browser button based on the actions that
you did so we do single page application
but when you click back we know where
you were in this page and we can get you
back there and then there's a recoil
chest that manages all the resource
loading to do smart resource loading to
optimize the performance okay so enough
of me talking we switch over to John so
he will show you the basic development
process ok ok great
ok so I will start first by taking a
look at an app that I built this is a
this app is a mash-up between some
custom data some custom data that I have
inside the VCS internal database and
some data that I'm pulling in from sales
cloud from Oracle's CRM so this is an
app to track for our pre-sales team to
track any pre-sales engagements so a
sales sales rep wants to have hot
opportunity needs to build out a POC
comes in here files a request and then
the pre-sales engineering manager
evaluates the requests based on win
probability revenue so forth and then
assigns them alright so you can see I
can come in and I can create my
engagements and so forth I can I can
manage my engagements I can manage you
know what the estimated work is gonna be
on those engagements and so forth now
we're not going to we're not going to
build this entire app we're gonna just
kind of zoom through parts of it because
I've got about 20 minutes but let's
think about if I was going to hand code
this what would I have to do right so
first of all I'd have to I'd have to go
get provision a D bath service
and have to bust out SQL developer and
go in and create all my tables then I'd
have to provision some sort of middle
tier either note or Java and I'd have to
configure it to go JDBC against those
tables and then expose those as rest I'd
have to configure all my my i'd have to
configure all of my security I would
have to then you know build these pages
hand code these pages inside the pages
in JavaScript I would build some up some
sort of model I would populate that
model by making rest calls right and
populate and populate the model based on
on the response and then I would code a
bunch of HTML and I would bind that HTML
to the Java JavaScript
I'd have to set up routing between the
pages I'd have to set up all of the rest
transactions on my crud operations and
so forth right a lot of work and so
let's take a look at how you do this in
env BCS so first I'm going to show you
the declarative capabilities how you can
build out things that you would normally
have to do by hand and then we're gonna
dive into okay what if I want to go
beyond that and do some custom code so
here's my application I've started a new
application it's an empty application
right now and like we said this is going
to be based around the engagement table
or the game engagement object right so
how do I create that well I can just
come in and say okay I know I need a
table all right so I'm gonna go in drop
a table I'm gonna call it engagement all
right now I'm gonna add some fields to
it probably like a summary and maybe a
start date make that a date and I'm
gonna need let's make a little drop-down
that's called status all right so I can
come in and do a lookup which is gonna
be engagement status all right and I can
define some values for this let's say
it's been requested it's been assigned
it's been delivered or sorry Charlie
it's been it's been rejected okay
so we could add up more fields let's go
ahead and stick with those right now now
I'll click Next and we'll say what
actions do you want on this on this
table right so we're gonna leave them
all on create edit details delete okay
and now let's say okay now let's say we
want to have a filter right doing
filtering and querying is is difficult
with rest api is some rest api is right
you know you have to figure out what the
what the whole URL patterns gonna be for
you know for which attributes are
queryable which attributes aren't you
know some and so forth same thing with
sorting right you know you have to
figure out like what the URL pattern is
gonna be for sorting right we can just
turn that on all with a click of a
button and here we go okay so let me
hide this so it may look like all we did
was create a table but actually put a
table on an HTML page right and a lot of
RAD tools now you would go and you'd
build out your model and then you'd have
some mapping editor where you'd map
between the two and so forth but
actually what BBC US has done here is
it's created everything it's created the
tables it's exposed them as dressed it's
consumed them inside the the UI here the
JavaScript it's created all my pages my
create page my edit page my details page
and it's set up all the actions to
perform all the crud actions on there
another interesting thing about this is
that my design surface is a live running
app so I can switch into live mode here
and I can start clicking around and I
can create I'm gonna say I need to do an
HTM extension and that's gonna start on
the 16th and the status is I've
requested it and I can save and close
that and there we go we're going against
the live database all my actions are
alive I can test out all the
functionality right in the editor if I
need more space or want to see it in the
right view I can switch out to a little
preview here okay okay so there's a at
that so there's a how you create new
business objects or new new data
structures now what if I want to go hook
into a REST API pull some rest some in
front
from a REST API build up a mash-up
between these two these two data sources
so I'm gonna go to my data designer and
take a look at Business Objects and we
can see that engagement and my
engagement status have already been
created and I'm gonna say I want to
bring in something from an external
service now if you have this VBS
environment provisioned inside of the
same identity domain as some sass
services then you will have single
sign-on all set up for you and you can
just go in into the catalog here and
browse the list of available services
that are there so if I had CRM in HCM in
that environment I would see all my HDMI
P eyes all my CRM ap eyes with one click
I could bring those in and work with
them but instead because this is a
standalone instance I'm gonna go into
service specification right and here and
there are certain types of ap eyes that
have describes write that have a have
documentation that we can parse and we
don't and we can create these Business
Objects for you and one of those types
is ADF breasts right so the so the CRM
API is our ADF so I can come in and say
opportunity and I just paste the URL of
my describe I give it some credentials
all right and clicks next this is gonna
go out fetch that describe bring it in
okay so I found it and it's gonna say
okay under that describe it you gave me
I found opportunity I also found all of
these these child objects we just need
the top-level opportunity resource so
we're going to click Next so this is
another thing that the tool can help you
out with as partial gets all right if
anybody's worked with with these REST
API s and a lot of REST API there's a
lot of fields and you don't often need
all those fields right and so what we
can do is you know you just select the
fields that you need right the only
thing I need is I'm going to remove all
okay and then I'm gonna leave my name to
number I need my revenue and I need my
win probability all right these are the
only things I need from this again
authentications already all set up it's
calling it with an app ID right and so
now I can finish
okay so now let's go back to our data
design our page designer and let's
spruce this guy up a little bit so exit
live mode bring my palette back one of
the things I'm going to do is I'm gonna
say this call them I want you to go to
edit engagement instead of view
engagement I'll make this a little bit
smaller so we can see the whole thing
another thing I'm gonna do is I can also
switch into live mode just by holding
down the command key for just a single
click
alright now in here you know I want to I
want a two column view here so let's do
drag that in we're gonna drag these guys
down to one column right and then now
I'm gonna bring in my opportunity rest
API alright
opportunity let me say which opportunity
is this gonna be bound to and I'm gonna
bind it to opportunity and I want to see
the name alright so there we go now I
can come in here and I can select my my
opportunity and I can come into the data
pallet and take a look at what are all
the fields that I brought in and I can
just drag and drop some fields in here
alright and so as I as I changed this
you know those are gonna those are gonna
update okay
so there we go
um ya know in a second in a second I'm
gonna do that one last okay so okay what
if I want it now let's get into some
custom code so what if I wanted to bring
in a REST API that I that the the system
doesn't understand right so for example
let's say for each of my engagements I
have a list of JIRA not your yeah I've
got a list of JIRA repositories that I
want to see what what issues I filed
against JIRA alright I can come in here
and go into the extensions and this is
where we bring in a lot of our custom
code so I can bring on UI extensions I
can bring in any shared libraries that I
want to use between that I want to share
between things I can and this is what
we're going to take a look at here which
is a business object provider and what a
business object provider is is it's just
a piece of
the script code that basically teaches
vbc s how do I call this REST API how do
i parse the output from that REST API
and turn it into Business Objects how do
I set up things like filtering and
querying and all that good stuff that we
saw in that wizard so I could just come
in and create a new one it's gonna be
called JIRA not jorah JIRA and I need to
give it an IDs I'm just call it my JIRA
all right and we actually have an
example for JIRA and I'm gonna just
bring it in here again since we're short
on time I'm not going to go too far into
it but this is a J s in it and for
example under executor you can see
things like here it is how it you know
invokes the the get write and how it
processes how it processes the query
parameters and so forth right so so
there's plenty of documentation and
examples on this and you can use this
this these business object providers to
integrate any REST API into the service
alright so another thing I can do is I
can have UI components writes custom UI
components so I'm going to go ahead and
import a UI component from from my zip
which is gonna be this little slider
component
and there we go and I'm gonna make this
active right and now if I came back and
I had something like some numeric value
right like like my revenue right I could
just come in and here's my custom
component I can drop it in here right so
it's a slider and actually let me add a
let me add a numeric component worked
days all right I'm gonna set this to 5
and mm-hmm there we go be projected
workdays now if I do this 10 this should
update up it's not updating but I mean
maximum minimum is zero maximum is 10
okay and now if I do five I'm having
having some errors but let's keep going
since I've only got about another 5
minutes okay now let's say that take a
look at some custom or custom codes so
let's say that I had a combo box that
was product type right
product-type and I would say one's gonna
be custom and one is going to be is
going to be cloud right and then I had
another combo box that had list of my
cloud products
product and I'm going to just add a
couple years it's yes you're a mobile
okay so now I want to put some dynamic
UI in here so I want to say if the if
custom is created is selected then hide
this cloud product this cloud product
combo box but if cloud is created then
then showing all right so I can come in
and I can drag just an individual block
of custom a custom code in here right
and in here I can see this is the full
this is the full model for my for my
application right I can see like what
the archetypes are the archetypes are a
helper that we have that kind of pre
baked in a lot of the actions that you
would need for crud pages and so forth
right and so it's called the engagement
and any detail archetype and so I've got
some custom code here alright and the
main thing I need to do for this custom
code is I need to get the I need to get
the component ID of the component that I
want to be hiding all right I'm gonna
bring that and paste it in there alright
and this is actually called product type
and not project type so let's should
change that right so what's this doing
this is saying get me the record right
it's and then it's defining a new
function that's going to get the it's
going to get the value of the product
type combo box which is this this guy
right here not the combo box but
actually the the property that's in the
model that's underneath it right and
then it's going to say it's going to set
it to one by default and then it's going
to say you know if I if I change it then
I'm gonna hide my cloud product kama box
otherwise I'm going to show it alright
so let's take all that copy it and let's
paste it in here I'm gonna replace this
alright say a quick player to the demo
gods and here we go if I hit custom and
the demo gods are not with me all right
I think I model is a little bit
different underneath there but okay yep
yep and there we go there's other stuff
I could show you but I'm out of time all
right all right so you saw basically two
things here so visual development and
then you saw that there are places where
developers can actually come in and help
by writing their own custom script okay
and the nice thing about this specific
tool is that the development and the
extensions are done with the standard
tools so they are done with html5
they're done with JavaScript basically
the same stack that the developers
already know so they can use their own
skills and extend and improve the
environment just to wake up they can use
for example CSS to change the look and
feel of the application and do themes
they can use HTML 5 to define their own
UI component we saw the slider and bring
it into the environment they can use
JavaScript to write business logic and
to access other rest services all using
the same language they already know so
we actually already did it though so
this is what the tool does today as you
saw today we're very much focused on
giving you a visual environment with
places where you can go in and extend it
using your skills as a JavaScript html5
developer what we're doing next with the
tool is were actually making the UI even
more flexible by allowing it to have
direct access to the code that the pay
is generating so when you're you're
still going to have this visual
drag-and-drop environment to create a
jet application but at any point of time
at the top you'll see a button called
code view right and if you go over to
this code view and you click on it
you'll just see the source directly and
you can go into the source and modify it
so we're basically and then if you click
back on the quiz wig interface you would
see the visual aspect so we are making
it even easier for the professional
developer and the business developer all
the guys who are not that professional
to collaborate together and build
applications together each one having
his preferred way of development so at
the beginning I said ok some developers
actually like to code they can use this
interface some people like the visual
aspect and the nice thing with a tool
like this is that they can actually all
use the same environment same experience
to build the application and we're also
making it easier to access other rest
services including services described
word by swagger for example and metadata
created like this and again you would
have basically inside the tool a
declarative environment where you can
define access to those services so just
a few things to summarize and one of our
goals is to make this whole stack of
html5 JavaScript rest services easier
for people to adopt okay and the way to
make it easier is to make it more visual
in terms of development while still
letting people use those skills one day
once they have those skills in place
this would help increase the adoption of
those technologies by a wider set of
developers and hopefully it will help
you reduce the backlog you might have
internally of applications that need to
be built with this technology and make
it that you can actually turn out
applications faster and it will simplify
getting started if you're not already
using those technologies this would make
it easier for you to use it you can
actually get a trial of visual builder
cloud service you don't actually
download anything you just go to the
website click get a trial and you can
cry out and build something you can tile
the hook points for
your own JavaScript if you want to and
get a little bit more experience with
this that's basically what we wanted to
show you today if you want to learn more
about visual builder there's actually a
demo pod down here in the first flow in
the Oracle area if you go in on the Left
there's a demo pod where we can give you
more demos of visuals I'll show you more
capabilities there's also a section
there that demo pod for jet if you want
to learn just about our javascript
extension toolkit all the capabilities
it provides we have a demo for that and
now it's time for any questions you
might have yes so the binding layer that
we're using there is knockout here okay
no not right now no this is basically
it's not there's no code import
functionality right now in here for
other applications yeah yeah then then
you'll then you start from here yeah any
other questions all right so yeah so the
one takeaway that we would like you to
have going back home you public the
people who would send you over here
would ask you what did you learn you can
tell them one thing that I learned is
that there are tools that can make
JavaScript html5 development easier
something better to do is actually get a
trial build something and show them look
what I was able to do after attending
this conference and I can promise you
you can basically skip the next two days
invest one hour in developing in
learning this thing and you'll be able
to build a full application to show the
results to your managers okay and will
basically be kicked out of the room in a
few minutes so if you have any further
question just come over and ask them and
if you want more information you can
catch us within the demographic on today
thanks
