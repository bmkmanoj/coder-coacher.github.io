technology Network and welcome to our
afternoon session here at Oracle code
it's great to see so many of our
developers here at the event and Michael
hitch wha how are you doing I'm doing
well and it's wonderful to be at a
developer centric event because I'm a
developer yes I feel at home I know
you're just having such a great time but
hard work around here isn't it yes well
it's always good to be out and about
yeah yeah well um so we've got quite a
few things to catch up on yes we do
yeah so I have looped Michael in to give
us a demonstration of a couple of things
that are my favorites live people and
then you've got some new things to show
me as well so we're going to get started
I'm going to take one moment to split
this the screen so that you can follow
along with Mike show hold on here let's
get that switched over all right
all right
okay that should do it
and there we are okay welcome back and
take it away so for a number of years
for the last 10 or 15 years our group
has been producing products from Oracle
to make it easier for developers to
build applications to build them more
rapidly more productivity with more
productively you know with greater
quality and and quicker time to market
and so what we're trying to take it to
the next level here with application
Express and so we've created a new
website for that so it's a texted oracle
comm /lo code and you can sign up and
it's a free forever you can use it for
as long as you would like we've got
customers who've been using this
particular service for over 13 years for
free now we have ten of those and so
it's a great way to get your feet wet to
share with colleagues and to try things
out all from your browser and so the low
code space it means different things to
different people but basically it's a
spectrum of no code where you don't have
to code anything there's no programming
whatsoever to low code we might type in
some snippets maybe a little bit of
sequel maybe a little bit of
if-then-else and then there's full
control where you're just going to dive
off the deep end in code JavaScript or
Java or hardcore PL sequel something
that that's that's that requires a
professional developer to do and what we
try to do is we try to make it so that
when I'm developing an application that
we we try to anything that we can
automate we do automate so there's sort
of no extra credit to reinvent the wheel
every time you want to create a report
and build some functionality outside
just be built-in as capabilities and
good programmers do that so some people
think that low code is for people that
are managers or people that can't code
but in fact a lot of people that are
exceptionally good programmers want to
focus their coding efforts just in those
pieces that they can add value on and
allow that the this the mundane parts of
an application to be done with a low
code or
or no code tool and a8x is one of them
application builder cloud service from
oracle is another and and where this
whole space is getting more important in
Gartner starting to cover it with a
Magic Quadrant so it's an interesting
space that is taking off so what I want
to do is I want to basically show that
the process of creating a loco
duplication from soup to nuts we only
have a few minutes but it won't I won't
too much code because the low code and
so it won't take too long
so I'm going to design a data model and
then going to develop an application so
to design my data model I'm going to hop
over here to quick sequel it's a free
feature of application accelerate a
minute this is new this is very new we
have not talked about this before you
try to talk about something old which
was will live sequel which you like and
still great you can type that in this
quick sequel it's a little different so
live sequel allows you to run sequel
statements and it's kind of
complementary to what we have with quick
sequel and so with quick sequel what it
lets me do is it lets me create
relational databases and sequels much
faster than I could otherwise so I'm
going to create like an employee's table
and give it a name and email maybe a
city country and and so what I can see
is as I type on the left with this
indented syntax on the right of my
screen it generates the sequel
statements that make that happen and so
if I want to - if I don't like the
sequel that's generated I could I could
start changing things around and saying
I would like my emails and lower case
because uppercase email sent like
someone shouting or sometimes it's kind
of rude then we have so let's say we
wanted to have in relational database
typically you'll have multiple tables
and you'll relate them together and so
so we'll have a relationship between
each employee can have some number of
skills so if I so as to say we they have
a proficiency
so I've got this this data model now
where I have two tables the relation
from the tables is is expressed in
sequel over here and I can see that I've
got a trigger to set the lower case and
that's interesting but I want to build
an application on this and it would be
boring unless I had some data so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use this
slash insert syntax and I'm going to
insert let's say 20 of these and say a
hundred of these and if I click generate
then I get some randomly generated data
looks interesting sort of but this is
this Latin text over here is not exactly
what I want and so I'm going to use
slash values and that's going to tell my
random generator data generator to just
use the values I select so we're a
developer conference at Oracle code so
we'll put like a JavaScript Java Perl
Apex sequel PHP like that one any other
skills yeah tennis I don't know sure
okay
so we got these skills we've got we've
got this data that's been generated it's
looking good so I'm just going to copy
the hoops
I'm going to copy that sequel I'm coming
over to application Express I can just
going to start from scratch here just
going to log in just so I log into I
have an Oracle code account I signed up
you can sign it up on apex Oracle calm
get one for free okay and I'm going to
create an application so I'm going to
use the application builder sorry before
I create an application I'm going to
create money like my tables so I can go
to sequel scripts I'm going to create a
script call it Mike paste that in so
thousand lines of sequel Wow didn't have
time to type that so I use the low code
environment to hook me up so now I'm
going to run that script
and view my results and they all failed
hold on
try this one more time got to drop my
tables so I'm going to come here
and okay hopefully can cut that out in
post-production but it is live so now
I'm hoping that this is going to work so
copy this come back over to this guy
create a new sequel script paste this in
and let's see if this did work well so
this worked well only one table did drop
that was expected and we're all good so
okay so now what we can do is we created
these tables called employees and skills
we can we can look to see if they got
created over here and the data that's in
them and we've got employees and in the
data randomly generated and we've got
skills
tennis PHP this is the data that we
asked for play tennis yeah not sure it
matches so okay so now we've got our
database but we don't have an
application so we're going to create
that now so use the application builder
and I'll click create and create a new
one and I have this new application
wizard that's cloud first so it's only
available on the Oracle cloud and it
will be later available for all of our
customers but first on the cloud so I
can give an application a name I'll
create like a home page and I'd like to
have another page let's call it a chart
and I want to know who knows what skill
so let's come up with our skills and a
label is a skill and we'll count how
many people have each skill pie chart or
how you have a check Joyce bar chart and
what would be like pie chart or bar
feels like a pie chart okay
you don't have a Venn diagram do you
that would be really quite efficient how
marketers love a harm no dot but we can
add one and so I'll go with report as
well and so I will find employees and a
lot a report call that employees okay so
I'm going to have a simple application
generated with these and I can always
customize it so let's new and different
with application Express here is that it
has these additional features I might
want to say for example have access
control to be able to control who can
run this particular application and one
have a global search or I might want to
have help in it in fact I might want it
all so and then I might have a specific
look and feel we have red we have dark
gray medium grade of a preference blue
light gray I like yeah I like the slate
the slate okay okay we'll go with that
then with the icon colored what do you
think will sleet a great goes with every
color so you could have a choice of
color oh that feels great
this one yeah and which icon do you like
the because I like the bubbles bubbles
are good yeah I like the smiley face you
know marketing all that okay there we go
so now we were going to create our
application and it takes to pick a
couple seconds but it will generate the
application for me this metadata an
application Express then I'll be able to
run that so now it's been created it's
got a number of pages I can see the
pages here let me just run that and I
got my smiley face it's in green we've
got a gray scheme I'm going to log in
and sure enough here it is I got a pie
chart and employees like I asked for and
so let's just take a look so we click on
the pie chart and sure enough it's got a
bunch of skills out there they kind of
randomly guys signed I'm not sure tennis
really makes sense doesn't really fit
with the other ones but I'm going to I'm
going to cut that one out so it just
kind of moves out
you know so that way there you can see
that this is the percentage we see that
pearl is is pretty well represented over
here okay and we can look at our
employees report and say oh this looks
great you could say you know I don't
want to see this column I'd like to have
people from a particular city etc so I
have a full report but what's
interesting is all the additional things
that come with it so for example what we
could that you can have comments so you
so we the requested have a feedback
feature built-in saying I wish the UI
was red
so someone someone requests that you
come into administration and you could
look at user feedback and someone says
they wish the UI was red and this comes
with the ability to configure various
options like a theme style so if you
wanted to have a red theme you can just
change it up and it's red ah and if it
so I took the defaults I took the name
as Mike but maybe I want to call it
skills and I want to say live from
Oracle code San Francisco so now back to
my home page got live from or coherent
Cisco we got our employees we got a
number of feature functions so what
we're trying to do here is take the
mundane tasks of coding these these
various feature functions and that you
see in the applications like access
control who can have contributor
administrator reader access monitoring
my application see who's using it which
who is using which pages are more
popular being able to send email alerts
to people and soliciting feedback and
configuring how that looks and feels so
that capability gets burnt in and so we
think it makes it so that we can go from
nothing get an environment and get it
get a solution if I want to share this
with somebody I can just share this URL
with with anyone on the internet and
they can run this application if they
have credentials to login
and that was like in seven minutes seven
minutes and he said we had to tuck her
15 minutes yeah okay but you know oh I
know what you can show us
okay so catch this up on live people
it's running on 12.2 but it says yes and
we have oracle live sequel it's out here
and and we have a number of community
members that are contributing to it so
you can see the code library is getting
more robust all the time so we have 846
that we hit let them know when you first
launch then every launch is like 12
scripts out there but now there's
there's there's a wealth of scripts out
there great and so if I go back here and
I do this this here just this system
here so we have 20,000 scripts 825
they've been shared to the public and
978 were created in the last week so
people are using this and so what are
they using might be at might be the
obvious question so what this allows you
to do is just try sequel it's like a
fiddle in any industry it's called and
so you could just just play with stuff
so if I wanted to try out a sequel
statement I could try out you know
create table foo next and make that a
number and run that and I can create a
table that's kind of interesting but
what I might be interesting is something
like for example finding scripts that
might teach me something I didn't know
so maybe there's some analytic functions
that I might be just a little confused
about how it works and so I can see it
here it can be annotated it can have
comments and I'm just going to just run
that and so let's so as opposed to just
looking at static examples like on a
blog or in documentation it's kinda it's
kind of stale but this lets me actually
run it and I can I can view my session I
can look at the Stickle statements I can
edit my sequel statement and I can rerun
those sequel statements and change them
up if I didn't if I thought that an
experiment if I really understand how
all this works
so so I can I can get rid of the hire
date column for example and run this and
now it's really mine so what we're doing
is we're integrating it with Oracle
documentation 12 2 was just released
today on Linux so we're very proud about
that that effort it's a big advance and
over time you'll see more and more
examples from our developers database
developers guides to link to live sequel
in context so you can link from wipe
sequel to doc or from Doc to live sequel
and play with it you know in real time
isn't it terrific that's terrific and
you know one people you you started this
project type about two years ago now I
think about two years ago yes and that
long it seems like decision but you know
you look at how many of your scripts in
and the code library it's really
impressive a lot of activity there and
we're very pleased to have you know a
robust community that contributes to it
and we think it's great and and people
should if they have something
interesting to share they should they
should share it and learn how to use our
latest technology it's database 12 - you
want to try out the new syntax database
12 - don't have time to install it
whatever just just go login this takes a
couple of seconds you can do it from
your iPhone your iPad just go to live
sequel or Oracle calm and just log in
with your OTN credentials and you're
good to go so it's not just Oracle
employees that are participating here I
mean you've got people from outside of
the in this in the community right
that's correct so there's a number of
Oracle ploys that contribute but more of
contributions comes from non Oracle
employees oh that's really great that's
really great so what what's on the
horizon what are the trends you know I
love talking with you because we get to
talk like twice three times a year yes
and I always ask the same question what
did you do on vacation so that's what
this first twelve minutes was all about
the key codes on vacation but what are
the trends that you would like our
developers to keep an eye on so one of
the trends I see is this ability to do
things through a web browser and
increasingly on a cloud so when you're
adil over and you're wanting to develop
something whatever it happens to be
whatever your problem you're trying to
solve
well it's nice and so to focus on that
problem and not focus on things that are
not that problem so for example standing
up a database 12-2 server what if
someone else did that for me I think I'd
like that why not you know installing
application Express well that's that's
nice I know how to do that but I don't
want to do that that's prefer to spend
my time building out some solution so we
think that creating data models we're
trying to simplify that process so so in
terms of a trend is what your question
was as I see is simplification
automation trying to make things just go
faster and easier and take the mundane
things that can cause delay in projects
out of the out of the picture it's hard
to set up infrastructure worklist got a
cloud to do that it's hard to create
database tables we got quick sequel to
make that just a little bit easier it's
hard to create an application which has
a robust access control and many other
features well apex kind of solves that a
little bit it's hard to understand how
to use analytic functions or complicated
new features in database 12 - you can
see real world examples in live sequel
so we're just trying to make everything
a little simpler a little more automated
a little more all on your browser and
and of course easier and automated on
our cloud No
well that's a good trend to keep an eye
out for now let's talk a little bit
about your session here first so
interesting it was UI versus right so we
talked about two different approaches to
low code application developments of
both products from from Oracle
application builder cloud service and
application Express we're trying to
basically trying to solve the same
problem we take it from different
perspectives so with application Express
we took from what's called a data first
approach where and you can see that kind
of in this this example of the first
thing we kind of did was we designed a
data model and with ADCs what they did
is they kind of just dragged and dropped
field names on to screening and and
design their user interface first and so
so it's just different ways to do this
the different things Oracle application
Express is a feature of the Oracle
database and it's really good for those
people that know sequel and and like to
use sequel
to extract and build their charts and
reports and whatever else they want to
do through a web browser and a BCS is
really mostly oriented towards extending
our fusion apps and other types of
things and filling in those gaps by
being able to using a very simple UI
first drag and drop a visual approach to
think so but what we're seeing is Oracle
kind of leaning this sort of low code
space of having very highly productive
tools that let lets customers get get
more with less effort good so you so
what is the thought or the philosophy
between the UI first versus data first I
mean is there really is there division
in the philosophies are they really very
similar they're similar and they're
different so for example in the data
first there's no perfect term that
defines the you know sort of the
difference or what that means but but
when I hear data first what it means to
me is its equal so when you're needing
to get data being able to just write a
sequel statement to get it and then what
what a BCS is more focused on is a
broader saying saying hey my data is not
sitting in one place not just just in
that database it might be anywhere it
could be from any different things it
might not even be in a relational
database it might be someplace else and
so they're really focusing on a rest of
API concept and so it's a Tech's can do
rest you can publish sequel and consume
it in a BCS so there's a lot of blurring
of the lines but I think that customers
will easily self-selection inside what
tool we know works for them all right
good well what do we have here you're
going to show us kind of how this works
well this was this what this site here
apex / comm low code you ask kind of
what what the session was today here at
the Oracle code event and we're all
about this little code thing and this
page just kind of lays out that that
that demo which we gave earlier it just
kind of lays out and tells you how to do
it and gives you instructions and shows
a video for each of the different steps
and and of course you can just go and
sign up live and
do it for free if you don't know how he
can watch the video and my son he
doesn't read anything everything's just
a video and he knows how to do
everything exactly well I'll make sure
to include this link as part of the
replay of our interview today thank you
so much my clip is so fun getting
together with yesterday's girl you're
going to be busy for the rest of the day
I'm sure you're going to be going to a
couple more sessions and I noticed that
the ice cream cart is out so we're going
to want to get over there and get some
ice cream so thank you so much for
joining us today
Thanks all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
