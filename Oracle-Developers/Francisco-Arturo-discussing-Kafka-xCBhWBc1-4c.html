code Bogota in here we've got the first
step live session I'm Yours Javed
Mohammed that have as my guest today
Francisco Arturo Francisco thank you
thank you so much for coming all the way
I think you have a very interesting
background you're a you know Mexican
origin live in Oslo and you've arrived
in Bogota yeah I like one fight it's
okay it's it's a pleasure to be here in
Latin America to be able to present
about this in in Spanish my native
language I presented a similar talk like
a couple of weeks ago in India in
Bangalore but yeah that was in English
in Bangalore
so I'm looking forward to sharing this
with developers so your presentation is
the power of Kafka in the article cloud
tell us a little bit about what is Kafka
and also like an open source go ahead
you're the expert yeah I mean I think
mostly everybody in technology has cards
like the Bosworth but not everybody
understands what it is you know and
basically it's a distributed streaming
platform that's what it does it let you
handle huge data streams in different
ways stored data process it consume
produce to it with several interesting
tools and Kafka and the theme of my talk
is that Kafka is particularly useful if
you want to set up even driven
architectures which are very fashionable
nowadays and many companies are trying
to do that and the Oracle has now the
even hop table service which is Manish
Kafka so I've been trying out this the
service in by myself and even with my
company in Norway we've been doing some
interesting work with it towards our
customers so so I think I have some good
experiences to share about even hopewell
service yeah just stepping back a little
bit you know you talked about Kafka
being able to you know
processed or compute streaming data what
what did people use what was what did
people do prior to Kafka how did they go
about doing this normally there were two
ways or two accepted ways of doing this
one is a traditional database just
storing stuff in the database and
pulling it yeah the problem is that I
mean it's it can be efficient but when
you're talking about real time you don't
get the data in real time you know you
have to go and search and pull and then
you have you have latency even the
smallest delay it's not real time
anymore no and the other way that we've
been using for the last years it has
been traditional messaging like JMS for
example queueing with huge topics and
that's sufficient in a smaller scale or
medium scale but recently when you talk
about big data no huge amount of
information coming from everywhere like
for example social media IOT you know
then then this kind of messaging
platforms they just cannot scale up to
to what we need so that that's what
Kefka comes in so what are some of the
features here observe some of the
developers out they want to check out
Kafka what should they be exploring I
mean what can you have the API is like
what is it kind of that defines the kind
of some of the parameters around Kafka
for me one of the most interesting for
developers is as you say the api's know
because everybody talks out Kafka's and
even log and imitability and yeah that's
that's true but but the nice thing about
Kafka is that there are so many powerful
API is built on top of Kafka which allow
you to interact with the data to query
these data streams to produce to consume
to manage the the speed of consumption
to manage your services micro services
whatever so so this is really
interesting there and these are robust
frameworks API is like confluent or
means that's very interesting for
developers it's a different way of
building your applications of having
like this data streaming backbone and
it's quite easy to do now that that's
one thing I think the other very
interesting thing about caskets what we
call that Kafka gives you the power to
unbundle your database when you need it
you know you don't always need to know
but in a real time even driven scenario
or API driven scenario or mobile driven
scenario or IOT scenario then you need
to bundle this this stuff you cannot
have everything locked locked up in the
in the database mm-hm
you need to open up a little bit your
the time and not not security wise but
just make it available you know and make
it the easy to consume and and fast you
know what we call fast data so that's
something that calf can can do for us so
you mentioned like in terms of the sweet
spot
it's obviously for real-time
event-driven yes the MU test about
mobile other thing areas that Kafka does
not work well for I think it's not that
it doesn't work well it does work well
but there are scenarios in which it
could be like overkill you know like too
much so what is that threshold how do
you decide when to invoke something like
Kafka versus not for me is when you are
thinking about events okay
events because events and events like
for example events that resemble our
reality you know events ripe like end
user focused applications you know and
in your daily life a lot of events are
happening and you need to have the
information as soon as possible you want
your your apps your systems to react as
you would like them to you know to not
slowed you down so when you when you
think about events or you think about
building applications that allow users
to manage these events then Kafka is
immediately a good fit okay it's not
about size or it's more about the kind
of application the kind of application
okay and last thing you touched up on it
a little bit before but if you can just
expand so if somebody wants to try out
Kafka in an Oracle environment then you
talked about some of the services you
just
when upon that a little bit yeah there
is even culture I think even hop event
have cloud service I think it's one of
the newest services available it's
perfect for trying out Kafka because you
don't need to install anything in your
laptop you don't provide infrastructure
do I need to provide configuration or
learn how to install it or how to tune
it it's already managed you just go into
the cloud select couple of options and
and your calf hot is created you can
start right away creating topics and
sending information to them or
connecting them to several other
services or writing down some code to
interact which is which is very easy and
actually that's something that has been
very valuable for us at that my company
Cisco because if we want to do like
proof-of-concept with with Kafka or
little experiment or start with a
customer from a small scale which is
which is nice
then these kind of services is perfect
because it's already managed and and we
don't have to do to carry that burden
you know we just need to develop so for
those of you didn't catch it again check
out the if event have cloud service for
morocco yeah yeah it's not easy and i'm
gonna show how to use it how to get
started in my presentation so thank you
so much for coming really appreciate it
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
