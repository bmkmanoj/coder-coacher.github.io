at gel 1 2013 about openjdk title it
takes a community to build a jdk to make
the future java SE to say I work for
oracle like my colleagues here my name
is Alberto pitch I have a long title and
I work for Donald Smith who has named
along a title titles and we are
accompanied by our colleague Alice Clark
and what I do in OpenJDK is basically I
like to say I'm the OpenJDK janitor so
how people get the code out there and do
useful things community and you want to
save yours what self I'm well yeah I
mean generally and I mean the java i see
product management group and a number of
responsibilities but one of them is open
openjdk community period and i'm in jdk
engineering and my primary
responsibility is you know once people
kind of become engaged in jdk there are
always questions what do you need to do
how to do it who to speak to and I'm
usually the person who eventually gets
questions like that if you didn't happen
to get push to the right place to begin
with and I facilitate other things
related to some of the opportunity k
resources that we have excellent I know
who we are and with that I'll leave you
with a brief message from our sponsors
are we talking about open source do we
really need a safe harbor statement here
yeah everybody everybody foster you're
here so we're talking about a bunch of
things today right yeah sorry basically
there's there's two main points to our
talk today one is just to give you an
update on the status of what's going on
and open
okay so Justin you know an update on
things that have happened interesting
things that have happened over the last
year so and give you some metrics that
we use to track the health and progress
but also to give you some suggestions
and ideas of where you can jump in so if
you were thinking of participating or
participating more in OpenJDK you know
how you could go about doing that and so
I guess most of you here probably know
what OpenJDK is in case you don't you'll
probably use a search engine of your
choice we tell one works for you you'll
type of OpenJDK and then you'll find it
instantly unless you use a competition
knowledge engine then you'll find it
says it's opened and that's actually
true openjdk has been open since 2007 so
but in regular search engine you get to
this place get to OpenJDK dot java.net
which is the website where our community
resides it's the place as we say the
site to collaborate on an open source
implementation of the Java platform
standard edition and related projects
and pretty much all the words in the
sentence have a very specific meaning
sol-gel platform center vision means se
na te that will be for example glassfish
related projects so it means the
reference limitations but all the
projects around this for example
projects diplomat specific features
earlier this morning we had Brian gets
talk here about lambdas for example that
was a project in OpenJDK that was
executed to implement this specific
feature for specific platform release
and of course the other big impact area
is collaboration so it's not just
employees from Sun earlier and now it
makes more achill working here at
OpenJDK it's a broader community of
individuals from various organizations
and backgrounds and one of the the
interesting things is when you start
beginning to openjdk is that of course
you would assume that it's it's all Java
right because it's the Java reference
implementation
of sorts but it's not all java in fact
there is a lot of non java coding there
there is a fair chunk of em there's miss
elastic of music class of Java code in
there course a lot of Java comments as
well so Java developers really good
commenting stuff and these are
statistics from the south hola dotnet
which collects them across the wide
range of source projects for OpenJDK
seven updates latest forests and so lots
of Java lots of comments really great
comment ratio Java developers are good
at coming their stuff but there's a fair
chunk of C++ for example so in the JDK
we have the the hotspot virtual machine
which a large chunks of command in C++
there's a fair chunk of see for example
in the native libraries bindings so
typically operations that interact with
operating system will at some point
refer through Jane I to the underlying
core libraries and of course on Mac OS
10 you'll have objective-c doing this
performance in which knowledge II and
there is a good deal of XML of course as
you expecting any jellification right we
even have an scripts in some parts of
the areas to do parts of the builds but
a lot of our builds are done using make
and transcripts and seven with eight
this changes a bit and the point here is
that to some degree regardless of what
your background is you'll actually be
able to find interesting areas to work
on in openjdk where every record is C or
C++ or Java or something else there's a
lot of code there's I think something
like five million six min lots of
coatings days and ate them without white
space and comments so there's a lot of
stuff there too to get into and we
consciously go and do things that help
us reduce the technical depth in our
code base so for example we try to move
things steadily towards more Java usage
one of the things and for example we
have are open to the case because it's
the representation it opitz often ends
up implementing things that just aren't
there so we need to do our special tools
they understand for example the next
version of the java class file format is
being prepared for release and that
means we have our own regression testing
tool for example JT wreck
and that tool is kind of interesting its
way because it can develop the test JDK
it lets you write tests in Java but it
also like to write tests for example
uses shell scripts and back in a day
that was the way of writing tests I
think so there was a time for for a
while when a lot of the golden file
tests for the compiler were written a
shell test so he would say so basically
bourne shell so compile this run it
compare the output to this magical
golden file and if it isn't identical
then the test is failed and you know
that's kind of all I had in order to do
that sort of testing it was an important
type of testing but over time that has
changed the compilers develop new
features which allow us to do identical
testing but with you know within purely
with in Java code and so over time there
have been a number of pushes to remove
shell tests because they may be are too
stable on all platforms they maybe have
to be tweaked when you when you bring up
another port and Java code write once
run anywhere it's a lot more stable it's
a lot more maintainable so over time we
have converted those tests into Java
tests I think that's a hint that's a
pretty good hint yeah so I don't know
what people did or did not hear but
basically the short one was at one point
many of our golden file test for the
compiler looking for error messages were
written as shell tests and over time the
compilers gotten new features that allow
us to convert those from shell tests
which are not particularly maintainable
to Java code which is a lot better
especially when we were talking about
porting so you want to run all of your
tests on your new ports and if you have
a shell test it may be has to be tweaked
to work on the new port so converting
our tests or compiler tests from shell
to Java has really helped with the
maintenance and with porting efforts
and there's been a bunch of side
benefits as well it's actually much
faster to run a test in Java than to
spawn a new shell for example windows in
cygwin and then of course if you look at
the previous slide if you go back to
this you'll see that actually the bulk
of the jdk code is in java written by
java developers effectively and java
developers don't necessarily make the
best shell code writers I don't think
anybody makes the best shell code
writers write portable shell code
writing not everybody's cup of tea so
this is again a nice example a of the
work that's happening on the hood of the
jdk with the community that's what you
interesting because it's a kind of
cavity that's orthogonal to develop on
top of jdk itself so it's something
anybody can actually help with help with
use to the birth of remaining shell test
because it's not a new feature it
doesn't have to go through a separate
processes like that and it's something
can pick up easier than java developer
and help with yes so at the end of the
day you don't have to be a brian gets to
to jump in and your first foray into
helping OpenJDK doesn't have to be
changing the language and libraries and
compiler episode time yeah it can be
that you were doing your own builds and
found some better way to do the build
script or you were running some tests
and found a better way to run that the
test scripts that that is incredibly
important stuff and we get lots of
contributions in that way yep
and of course we get lots of
contributions to a mechanism it open
dedicate to have different projects for
different domains so I mentioned before
lambda is one of the projects there are
JDK release project like JDK 8 that was
talked about dignity note apologÃ©tica
seven updates but there are also many
different projects in some areas
implement features or explore simply
problem areas to see if there are
solutions that are interesting maybe for
inclusion future JDK maybe just
understand the problem domain one of the
interesting project for example that is
more experimental majoring in OpenJDK is
the growl project and ground is a
project that is all about bringing as it
says the J to the JVM so about using
Java to write parts of the vm itself as
i mentioned before a good chunk of
hospital in c++ but what growl does is
growl basically takes pics hot spot and
implements parts of it a particular
around the chest and compilation in java
itself and this ends up actually being
reasonably fast and very interesting to
work on in and execute so um the nice
thing about a work of the grog rope is
that this underlying work on making the
JVM itself more hackable by writing
parts of it in java and some angling
other interesting things to happen and
one of the interesting help things that
happened last year before java one was
the announcement from oracle AMD to
collaborate in the OpenJDK community to
as the press release your family says
explore heterogeneous computing for java
to basically find ways to offload work
from the vm on two GPUs something its
bills I mentioned in technical keynotes
yesterday this has been an interesting
project since inception it's generating
a whole bunch of press of course about
GP acceleration for apps it's been since
then created in Oakland JDK as its
proper project it's all meaningless as a
source code repository can participate
in and it's built on top of the growl
framework so if you go to sumatra if you
look at the code base you'll find that
the users grow under the hood to explore
this display
problem area this was plumb the main and
see which approaches make sense but if
you're interested in learning about
growl at this conference there's a talk
from engineers from AMD an Oracle on
Tuesday here in hilton 3pm holy ground
accelerating GPU offload for java and
that's an example for innovation that
takes place within the context of the
openjdk community in the open which is I
think very important to make the future
Java yeah and so I mean if you look at
the last that the last point we made on
you know there's no contribution to
small and all use air quotes there in
terms of like hacking scripts and build
scripts and test scripts and test
harnesses and cases and all that this is
an example of theirs there's also no
contribution that it's too big right
like this this is a big thing to propose
to bring into openjdk and you know you
have AMD but there is also a number of
individuals who are lined up with AMD
who had been working you know this is a
research project and thought offloading
GPU computation offloading computation
to a GPU in Java is a good idea I mean
this is a big big thing and hopefully
we'll see the fruit of this in Java 9 or
job 10 but you know it's an example of
what big things can be accomplished as
well and in the open and in the
community one of the other good ways for
us to to drive no participation openjdk
has been ports so Oracle supports a
bunch of platforms over in systems and
CPUs in its own JDK product and of
course other people have other
operational interested in or even other
cpus and a little while ago I think this
was in so in 2010 of course IBM joined
openjdk so there was press release back
then I think right about John and I
without being joining him and one of the
interesting things
IBM brought on the JDK 8 may Inglis was
desire to bringing their changes from
from their ports into the JDK itself and
then oil while later than ASAP joining
the OpenJDK as here Klaus von Luger
block and focusing on is proceeding to
take Elizabeth and one thing that
emerged was that I bnsf p then so they
had mutual interest so as if he was
interested in improving the hot spot
engine importing that I was interesting
being over their own ports modifications
in the core libraries so they got
together and created a new OpenJDK power
pc port for ax linux and this port has
been endorsed and funded back last year
and has been steadily making progress
sense so from IBM and sav will have
focus amonos and stephen pool i think
talking tomorrow um again in the hilton
at four-thirty about their OpenJDK
porting experiences in this poppy
supporting project the good the bad and
the downright ugly stuff and the
interesting part here is of course that
integrating a port isn't a trivial
effort so integrating a new port of the
jdk that touches upon core class
libraries touches upon the vm itself
it's actually a huge effort to ensure
that what you get works well for the
community and everybody else and it's
part of that effort I think you've been
involved RSC yes yeah it's it's in quite
quite the challenge because well there
have been other ports that we brought on
board in the past this one is you know
it's in Oracle's role is a little
different you know we're there you know
as as one of several people several
companies and you know Oracle is you
know we're not you know we're hosting
their code we're not necessarily running
AIX and everything so our view for how
things are supposed to work is a little
different of course IBM and SCP have
different ideas of how they want things
to work and you know it's kind of been a
big collaboration so it's been a lot of
fantastic work in that area and
you know because it's out in the open
there's a lot of documentation you can
go and read about you know what our
plans are what are what you know what
has happened already you know you can go
to the wiki site you can go to the
mailing lists you can look at the actual
code to see and what the current status
is of that and it's it's really been
it's been a challenge for everybody but
I think it's been a really fantastic
learning experience and I hope there
isn't too much ugly in tomorrow's buff
but yes I mean it's it's it's really a
big deal because you're porting not just
doing new operating system that causes
new cpu architecture so really touching
a lot of code right and this is I think
the first time we're doing this in the
JDK so we're sort of learning by doing
the previous time we do this in the GDK
was holding OpenJDK which was a port to
a new operating system but not a new CP
architecture that was when Apple
announced that they will join up in jdk
back in 2010 to create an open jdk
project for a Mac os10 port and that led
the creation of a mac OS and porting
project at first which was used to bring
code over from Apple entity open from
the implementation and to collaborate on
a working port 44 jdk 7 and then once we
had that um we work together to bring
this port into the jdk 7 updates release
history which helped us a-- bits
developed mechanisms how to do this well
so for example one of our goals was to
ensure that the changes coming in would
be wouldn't be too too too destructive
on the schedule other side so we try to
separate things of it so we try to
ensure that so we have separate force
for example for a while for the port
until things stabilized a bit and so on
and it allows us to this process
innovation actually allow us to deliver
this port on time and ship it as part of
the java SE 7 update for release and
it's been in OpenJDK since and it's not
maintained as part of the jdk a tree so
it's not a success story that came
through there openjdk
but of course we're not done porting yet
so we have over the past couple years
really acquired a huge community and I
mentioned AMD before I mentioned the IBM
ASAP Apple let me mention Red Hat so
redhead is also busy porting the openjdk
two platforms they are interesting and
one path on the interest in stem a tart
64 or the 64-bit ARM platform
architecture and Andrew Haley who is on
the OpenJDK governing board announced
late last year that's redhead is
interested in the port they have since
created a porting project for this so
there is code you can check out if
interest in AR 64 implementations on the
OpenJDK or if i'ma code repository
server and they've actually made a good
deal of progress so as enter Haley
blocked on his word postbox I'd they
actually got to a point where it
implemented the interpreter for AR 64 so
it's not a secure texture in hotspot and
got that working they've been working on
the c1 just-in-time compiler so hospice
to just attack apollo c1 and c2 and now
they're working on on c2 so they they've
covered a good amount of ground in a
rather short time and this again is
something that's taking place in the
open that you can participate and take
part of in OpenJDK and in fact those
distributions like fedora um and a boon
to our actually or is starting to to
include this port in there openjdk
builds for their own distribution builds
for this AR 64 linux distribution effort
so that again shows that it's it's a
really broad effort that extends much
farther than just say jdk 8 jdk nine now
beside regular more focus on a specific
task pouring projects there are also
interesting meta projects or just say so
one of these metal product is ice-t
originally started by developers from a
red hat back in two thousand seven when
sun made the first
release of volcan jdk is open-source
completing the initial release of the
hospital um in the jealousy compiler
from november two thousand six with the
remainder of the class libraries and
back then iced tea was was created to to
replace any left over encumbrances in
San sir initial release so there were
bits of code but son couldn't release
there were bits of code but basically
dependent on unknown open-source things
so I steve was created to clean that up
to provide a release it could be
packaged in the distributions then over
time um with the release of OpenJDK six
and thanks to the work from from iris
and Joe Darcy and my other colleagues
OpenJDK six became a solid stable
openjdk early suitable for inclusion and
distribution in place like debian ubuntu
so OpenJDK six replace initialize d
builds and as that happened the ice tea
project morphed and found him other
interesting things to do just rather
than just trying to provide a shell
around the open to decay sources so they
looked at other missing things they they
set their eyes on implementing a plug-in
and web start implementation based on
open source code from the net x project
for example so they did that they worked
on monitoring tools so for example
writing their own plugins for visual vm
like thermostat they worked on basically
filling out other areas where they felt
that I steep logic would make quite an
impact and one of the interesting things
about the IC project is that over time
as OpenJDK six progress so they
initially had a quite large pad set and
that's that then when we started doing
seven updates they worked very hard with
us to reduce the patch set and to come
closer to the upstream and as you're
looking towards a they're also looking
towards so what does it mean for variety
for example for eight updates is I see
as such still necessary what is their
all and I think it shows very well that
our community itself is also very
evolving
it's following what we do what to put
you as an impact it has a positive
impact in reducing the workload on such
matter projects like I see that are
necessary to package for distributions
and also means that they're trying to
work closely with us to to be closer to
the upstream and get the badges II so
it's another interesting project in the
openjdk ecosystem but as ice tea cares
about Linux what most of it not
everybody lungs runs linux there's a
whole bunch of people running other
systems like VSD there's also quite
active open do decayed vs deporting
project and these guys have been there
pretty much from from from the start so
in fact one of my first task when i
joined sound like them was to work with
the opening PSD a OpenJDK p is deporting
team so to say there was forming and to
help them set up i get set up in OpenJDK
with a project everything and this
project has been very active one of its
first major contributions as you said
also was to actually get a new port so
they initially covered freebsd openbsd
netbsd but the first new big
contributions was a port to Mac os10
back in two thousand eight so those were
the days and the interesting thing here
is of course that a project like that
the BS deport all of a sudden became
very interesting for you for developers
working other things because a time
developers like say John Rosel working
on evoke dynamic and these things
started to like their max very much all
of a sudden this bsd port became a good
way to actually develop invoke dynamic
on your Mac without having to go back to
winners of the Linux and this this
aspect of cross-pollination is not an
interesting thing you'll find huge
community like this one where you have
many different projects that may seem to
do many different things but ultimately
end up helping each other and positively
influencing where they go and these days
the openbsd porting project is alive and
well and serves as
limitation on the freebsd system on net
bsd openbsd mayor bsd basically pretty
much any BAC system will have its
OpenJDK 6 or openjdk 7 updates a package
source on or other systems binary sport
and one of the important aspects about
having lens debut shins package open j
decades of course compatibility so what
we want is of course the people who run
ubuntu who run redhead or oracle linux
or souza for example to do not just get
open tunic a bond rates but to be able
to to know that these miners have gone
through an excess amount of testing and
to do that we have something called Okla
what is off club uh yeah actually I
don't even know if I ever really
remember what the acronym stands for
visits an acronym of acronyms they think
I'm a klutz the open G K T seek a
licensing agreement now community
bluemont JDK community TCK like
licensing agree we call it the odd clock
work part of the oct LA but but this is
this is important a lot of people a lot
of people don't realize this but
basically what this license gives you is
gratis so zero dollars access to the tck
that's effectively the same TCK you
would get as a commercial licensee and
any company or individual can sign for
this and get access to to the tck the
there's a couple of requirements one of
which is that you are building a port of
openjdk so that your your jvm our
libraries and so on our derivatives of
the OpenJDK project and then there's
there are some other requirements that
confidentiality and so on and so forth
to be consistent with with the tck
from from a commercial sense and so what
this does is it creates a a level
playing field for anybody that wants to
build and compete with their own OpenJDK
ports to basically have access to that
and there's been you know sometimes it's
just I'm not sure how current your your
list there is adult more but like for
example a university might want to get
it just as part of their research
project just to be able to have the test
kit available to test their test their
changes so so this is a nice program and
you know it's it's something I don't
think a lot of people are aware of eight
sir so oh yeah and you can already get
the oct late to get you the tck for Java
8 and so that's made available and in
fact that was made available just a few
weeks ago we improved the term on it
because you'll notice on the list there
there's a lot of companies and one of
the one of the feedback one of the
pieces of feedback that came in through
the JCP which you know sets the standard
that the tck is tests against one of the
bits of feedback was that the term
should be more generous such that if you
as a company you're going to spend a lot
of time building a port that may be
competitive to other people's ports or
products that they should have a
reasonable term length so that you can
be guaranteed some certain amount of
time and runway in the market and so
yeah the term for that is has been
greatly improved so it starts off with
three year initial term and then its
subsequent one-year terms afterwards for
a total of eight years which I think
plenty enough time for any particular
version of Java so that's the paparazzo
so yeah so if you're distributing
openjdk builds yourself this will be
something i think that's poopy range
isn't look into you can find information
about it the openjdk conformance groups
page so openjdk joe at night and then
you see on the left side conformance in
there among the group's click on that
have fun information about the j ck
itself ought to run it and how to get
access to it and as it says somewhere on
the bottom not read is one of the
requirements hear them is your project
can be inside or outside open jetty a
community that's fine but you have to
sign the the OCA so that we can actually
take the page patches you make if any
into openjdk and that means so what is
this OCA yeah so the uca is the vertical
contributor agreement previously known
as the SCA son contributor agreement
it's effectively the same agreement that
son had but it had now has work i'll let
that just sink in for a minute cuz it's
complicated but the point the point I'm
trying to make there is that the
disagreement has been around for a very
long time so this is not an oracle ism
this is a long-standing way of how
sunday to open source projects that that
we continue and basically you know that
the idea here is that in the job and
ecosystem you know they're there is a
number of ways that products get
distributed and one of those is that we
have a licensee business so there are
companies that commercially not through
open source but they commercially
license code from us that they then used
to commercially build commercial
products and commercially distribute but
at the same time we also want to support
and have a thriving open source
ecosystem and this agreement basically
scratches both of those itches if i can
use that metaphor
in as much as when you make a
contribution to an open jdk project
under the OC ASEA you you are basically
saying that this code will be available
on her open source for always it will
always be available under open source
under no SI r FSF improved open source
license but we also will allow you
Oracle to commercially licensed this
code as well in your products but also
to the I figure out how many of there
are others like 30 or 50 or were higher
than that but your commercial license
ease who are also building commercial
products downstream and there are I
can't remember the last count I don't
know if you have there but there are
like well over a thousand and there's
several thousand people and companies
that have signed the SCA and the OCA
it's a very simple agreement it's a
one-page agreement that basically says
you know when I make a contribution to
an open to have to tow a jeddak a
project you will you Oracle will make
this available under an FS ever OSI
approve license and I hereby give you
the right to to redistribute this
commercially as well and this is this
agreement not only serves OpenJDK but we
also use this for glass fishermen that
beans for my sequel and dozens of other
smaller projects and you can fly it all
on the OpenJDK legal page so that's
again linked off on the left side on how
many OpenJDK job that side you'll find
the blank form that you can fill in and
then scan them and send in to an address
specified in the contributor page there
is an FAQ that explains pretty much for
Donald said in many more words and the
list of signatories as an on-set public
that's linked off there so you can see
you assign the OCA itself and there can
also illegal page find for example the
bull new general public license version
2 that's the class possession that
parts of LPG to gear under you'll find
the TCP agreements I'll close with this
class before and so on so and one of the
interesting things about OCA is that of
course in OpenJDK of different roles so
you have you typically start as a
participant as somebody who's just
signing up to Maine lives to participate
in discussions but as soon as you you
know have desire to actually start
hacking code and the Caribbean code and
all that that's where the OCA comes in
and and it's a condition you need to
come out a contributor which then leads
the path to becoming let's say a project
committer or author or an open jetty key
member or even OpenJDK leave but I think
that's Mark Burnett and of course it
also means that once you become a commit
on a project or an author you become
part of this openjdk list of different
people with access their project so one
openjdk sends us page again laid off on
the left here you'll find people like
myself like iris and so on and all their
roles in different projects where
they're committers reviewers project
leads what have you and so you can
basically become part of that core
dedicate community and as I mentioned
earlier there is a lot of code image IDK
but there is actually a lot of code in
the jdk in many different levels so the
way we develop adjudication in some way
if you're familiar with save the way the
linux kernel works rather distributed
there is for JDK 8 for example there is
a jdk 8 my code repository take a jdk 8
but it doesn't tell the whole story so
it only holds effectively some metadata
so to say some build information the
rest of it is hidden in a sense in
separate repositories organically
repositories tied together as a material
forest so you have JT canes korba for
Bora you have Jenny Cade hot spot for
well hot spot jdk 8 JDK jdk 8 jdk purge
it hit the Cobras itself lang tools for
the compiler
and all the tools are on the language
nas horn for the JavaScript interpreter
engine you'll have exp jax-ws and so on
and so on so in effect the JDK 8
development itself the source code is
complementary lies in different
components horizontally service say in
different repositories kept apart in a
sense to reduce the risk of innocent
changes basically creating damage to say
so that's one part of this and the other
part is vertical components a shin so
you have different teams like for
example the Java to dt will work in
their own set of repositories and once
the changes are integrate who are ready
to integrate about once or twice a week
they will then push them up into the
next level so that means the JDK 8
development surface is like a layered
cakes there is the JDK hjk master on top
and there are various sub repositories
purty below for different areas for
tools and libraries for 2d and then of
course the hotspot team has its own ages
x 4's that's our team has its own forest
so depending on when you're starting out
and you have a change you want to make
when you've gone there in fixed a bug
you may be overcome with the desire to
just committed to jdk jdk jdk or
something like that and then somebody
like arias almost i will tell you know
please go somewhere else first and we'll
get it will get automatically pulled up
into the master forest over time as it
passed our regression testing for
example for the builds so this may be a
bit confusing at first but if the
similar to model to help projects like
the Linux kernel developed where there
is a mainline tree and there are many
different feature trees by different
trees for ports of the kernel for for
specific feature groups but get pulled
by Lynn us into the main colonel in this
case we don't have one Dennis we have
many different integrators that do this
job of integration of fixes but it's a
similar very distributed model of
development so it's something to take
use to and there is something that may
be confusing at first is that
there is something called gates in the
JDK so that's where you push a changes
till they show up in the other part what
are the gates do actually oh well so so
sadly our mercurial servers right now
run a very old version of mercurial and
there's a problem with synchronization
for reads and writes so what the gate
does is that's where you push two and
then it'll it'll automatically push up
into the non gate repository and then
when you do pull you always pull from
the non gate repository so it's just to
deal with some blocking problems we had
with the old version the plans are to to
move to a more recent version I'm hoping
that happens soon because it will make
it'll it'll reduce of course the whole
gate non gate thing it'll it'll make
things so much nicer on so many levels
so I eagerly await that the point is
basically if you're starting out we
attribute don't hesitate to ask right
don't hands it to come to main list now
so I've got something I'd like to get
into the JDK 8 3 for example where
should I go and then depending on on on
your area of interest you'll be directed
sort of say to the right list the direct
repositories to the right set of
reviewers to start working with on your
jeans and while this makes them
intimidating at the start it's actually
a fairly straightforward process once
you get used it as our rising number of
304 degrees well it's a lot it's it's
it's own concert of 400 individuals
actually all having committer and author
introduces shows and since we Vegas our
big project a lot of our communication
movie is done through email and
meaningless we have many many memories
with the choose from on mail openjdk
java.net less or mail server is i think
around 70 not 70 but 17 last count and
there as you can see ordered by by
project or the group or by interest area
the ones if you're starting out to
tapping the open G community I recommend
to look at is the announcement list
because that's where you hear about new
things
he projects that may be interesting or
new infrastructure that may be
interesting to look at the discuss list
were basically all kinds of community
discussions happen and only painting our
interests may pick a project or to your
interesting following likes a jdk 7
updates or project lambda if you're like
me and it's part of your job to look at
OpenJDK and subscribe to all these
things don't be surprised if you get a
lot of mail so these days openjdk lists
all together generate about 300 messages
per day that's not quite as much as
linux kernel per day that's fine but
it's still a lot of stuff to go through
many patches many discussions a lot of
great feedback and it's all available of
course in mavis archives if you look at
all discussions but also a number of
sites have sprung up that's too general
male our archives like gmail where many
but not all this are married and mark
mail that collect the messages sent to
various no open least open to the
chemicals and make them easily
searchable so if you interesting seeing
say all the different emails brian guts
has sent to the project lambda list you
can find quite easily and the other nice
thing about mark mail is that they
provide these nice graphs about mailing
list traffic so you can see that in the
past well six years the openjdk
participants of sends around three
hundred two hundred thirty five thousand
messages and yeah more than 300 per days
and it's been growing very very steadily
since the oracle position that's not
interesting point that i think a lot of
people didn't necessarily realize that
once oracle came in actually developing
OpenJDK really took off so to say
now if you're if you're somebody who
doesn't know what email is because
you've been born after nineteen eighty
don't worry we always have twitter right
so there is an open judicata to defeat
you can subscribe to I try to keep it
technical to pointers to mainly spose to
discussions of patches and so on as you
can see it has less than 10,000
followers so less than the Java fee but
then look again this is a very very
technical one you can use this if you
have general questions to ask basically
your questions about patches and so on
and you've appointed by Donald or myself
or others to the right place the right
list to ask them so for example just a
little while ago we had somebody talking
about the patch they wanted to make to
to fix the bug and I oh they found on on
Twitter and we saw that and putting that
into and I owed their Manning lists the
patch she went in a couple of weeks ago
fixing a bug and has now just landed
back back in the seven updates for us
this way and I think that helps really
engage community out there that may not
necessarily have the desire just to to
subscribe to a list and spend time there
and the other thing about 30 feet is it
and when we started doing this we didn't
even think about it I think that's
because most of us come from email
background so email is fine infiltrate
the way but thanks to jog leaders and
jugglers calls we did when Oracle
started out the community work back in
2010 a a jug leader basically occupy the
OpenJDK Twitter account for us and then
told us you should be doing this if you
totally be doing this and we did
networks and then we're also doing of
course is blogs so we have most of us
have blocks done has the Donald oj oj
decade log and we aggregate them on the
planet JDK but org blog aggregator
breaking five blocks from steam Colburn
and
and Mark assert as we directly past
weeks talking about things they're doing
with the JDK talking about their changes
and then features implementing and last
but not least four people for whom
twitter is to new school there's also
twitter one point i also say an IRC
channel on LTC the IRC channel is
reasonably active there is always around
50 people in there but it may not be the
best place to start asking technical
questions it's a good place to get
initial bearings and to basically asked
where to go to but you will typically
get directed for to a mailing list for
deeper technical discussions ago because
the mail is forward is much better
suited for that then check all right and
as always mentioned infrastructure has
been something that we've been working
on and we're still working on improving
over the past couple of years and this
year we had a bunch of successes to
report first Oh vidi vici yes fantastic
and this past spring we we did open
source a wiki and we part of that we
removed all of our old our current wiki
content on Oracle's wiki site to
anything that was applicable to OpenJDK
was part of the OpenJDK we initialize
the wiki with that content and it's been
active and they're been you know we've
added more wiki spaces for different new
projects that have come on board or
projects have decided to use the wiki
and that's been really exciting and the
other thing that we've had was just last
week was the JDK bug system is now
publicly available yay so really happy
and the first question people usually
ask about these things is okay this is
fantastic it's wonderful can I write to
it and the answer is if you happen
openjdk username yes you can so
everybody can look at it everybody can
look at the content about the wiki and
the bug system but if you happen to have
an opportunity a user account or an
author committer etc you can write to it
you can update bugs there you can file
them there and they'll be immediately
active it's fantastic it's a major jump
forward from
only being able to access DB bucks on
comm system so because it's instantly
updated as opposed the bug son comm
system is got a delay built in this is
it's it's really i mean it's it's
fantastic so if you haven't checked it
out make sure you do i think you'll find
that it gives you and I'm % level of
insight into JDK development it wasn't
there before and it sits against
something like infrastructure on
mercurial if you're good thing to work
on and then of course it's not all week
ease in box of course bucks a great if
you find bucks and our stuff let us know
right so that um but there is also a
method to all this as we as we develop
the JDK from in the open initially what
we did was to just to have a development
in the open source a so you could see
the patches you can see discussions
around patches and then as more and more
team started to do this work in the open
more and more of their discussions
before the pet so to say I started to
happen on the list so the discussions
around design of features the
discussions around ideas for features
started to happen earlier earlier
allowing more of the community
participate and one of the things that
we've done over the past years was to
try and formalize this process to come
up with jdk and has proposal and Ropin
process the JP to allow the community to
have early insight into ideas for future
jdk features and provide feedback on
them did it submit a ball yes yes so
basically a JEP the in a particular
release like JDK 8 is a collection of
Jeb's those are the major features that
are going in there some of the jepson
are associated with jsr some of them or
not and so you can kind of go and see
kind of what the the general features
are what their design goals are you can
go cross-reference those jets into the
mailing lists because they'll be mailing
list discussion about features that are
in fact jeff's other jets that are there
are in a more forward thinking they're
not necessarily JDK there we're thinking
about doing this there are some
like JEP 175 which is Lutz 175 which is
a PowerPC AIX port jeff so that's you
know kind of the starting point for I'm
thinking about a feature and this is
what I think it should do this is a
problem it should be addressing or
solving and you know here's some more
formal thought on that and we encourage
people to continue to update those jets
as they you know work on their features
so that it becomes you know the central
place to go and look for things you
don't have to go off and kind of search
some mailing lists for all the different
parts of a feature you can go look in
one place and you can follow jobs and
you contributor any committer any
commitment yep any community adjudicate
project and follow jet so that means
that it's not you know just Oracle guys
filing for features it's all the people
from pretty much organizations we had
more than 80 Jeff's coming over the past
two years beware of the gems that come
in on April the first that's all I say
about that and it's been actually quite
useful and getting community feedback on
features early so for example just
recently we've as part of the work on on
seven updates we've discussed some
changes to some Sun internal method
right and the exam was also a Jap and
that allowed us to involve the community
early and get the feedback from them
here it was well maybe you shouldn't be
doing that that way so which is not too
and being able to have this discussion
early on because design was in the open
has been crucial to enable that and then
of course Japs are one part of the
equation the other part of the equation
are the JS us some of the Japs and
that's become possible because we
actually update our website Terms of Use
right and yes I mean there's a couple of
things here one is just a point out that
so sometimes people confuse or complete
OpenJDK with the work going on at the
JCP
right so that the java community process
is about defining the the spectrum
standards but OpenJDK is really about
the implementation and so you know it
may seem like a small thing but it's
it's an important thing and it's I think
it's a it's a good towel and as much as
we were very careful that made sure that
the OpenJDK web properties have their
own terms of use they're not just the
Oracle corporate standard terms of use
which are pretty broad but instead the
OpenJDK web pages but also more
importantly the wiki which which was
migrated over last spring and all the
related properties are under
specifically the OpenJDK website Terms
of Use and it has some specific bits in
there that make any obligations you may
have under your JSP a or whatever the
related legal documents you may have
related to your JCP participation are
all fairly coven so it may you know for
a lot of people it's just like you
probably won't even think about this or
care about this you just as a developer
you just go on and do your daily your
daily job but we've thought about these
things in there they're carefully
constructed and I think it's a good it's
a good sign or signal not you know we're
very serious about the OpenJDK community
and how it works and how people interact
and how it fits with the JCP and and
that means if you want to follow the
work of the job I see eight left home
umbrella JSON you can so on the open to
the case side they have their own
presence with mailing lists but bug
trackers and everything and we had some
really good participation in Jace our
efforts from various Java user groups
thanks to the adopter jsr initiative I'm
going to do an effort to help community
members from jogs participating Jace
ours for example in lambdas and date and
time
we'll also had some really good effort
from the community through adopt OpenJDK
and not going to effort focus on each
OpenJDK on the jdk set of a commendation
and one of the interesting projects with
it there has been to bring the community
members together to to help us test
openjdk to help us write better test for
it to learn how to test JK itself and we
had a number of events around this at
various conferences and in Europe in
Russia and as a result of that if you go
to the Oracle Java youtube channel
you'll find the recordings of
presentations by engineers let's do it
marks Ellen Bateman and so on explaining
how to do this how to write your own
test how to help us improve the JDK
itself how to help us reduce technical
debt for example and you can find for
example podcasts with Rory O'Donnell
explaining the background behind this
and the reason I'm saying all this is of
course that I want you as your homework
to go home and then for them test right
please help us make Jay decayed great by
getting and Alex actually the JDK do a
live preview on JDK each other at that
and test your cognitive test your open
source project with it let us know tiny
box you find let us about any good
things you find as well of course but in
particular your box so we can go ahead
and fix them in time for release this
sooner the better and again here is an
effort that's comes with the opportunity
to help various open source projects
test their their code early be JDK using
community CI infrastructure in this case
provided by cloud peace you will find
more information about this on the adopt
openjdk side and communities is really
not just about code it's somethings
about coming together for beers good
place to do that if you're into vm
languages is the JVM lon bislama which
takes place every year in santa clara
rave feedback from people like Charles
nutter so I like Charlie like what he
says but if you can't be there don't
worry all this stuff is getting recorded
from JM summit it's available online on
the Oracle media network where you can
find videos and audio
all sessions from last year's and this
year's and previously stdm summit so
that's if you are interested in the
hardcover low-level kind of stuff there
where you have ruby and java and c and
JVM bytecode in assembly and it's all
normal and if you want to see it here I
think Charlie's talking about that kind
of stuff on Wednesday as well and on
that note in terms of community in
OpenJDK and so what I could regale you
with statistics about committers and
Jeff submitted the sophistic that's dear
to my heart is basically conversations
because a lot of the contributions we
get are not just lines because the
people telling us their experiences
using our code for example during lambda
letting us know which aspects of the new
feature work well for them which don't
and looking at the participation from
individuals who don't have an Oracle or
sun e-mail address over the past years
you can notice a really huge huge bump
over the past couple years as more and
more developers in the community come
into open j decades are participating
not just the IC and there's people in
distro packaging list but also for
example use accessory of the past year
as pointed out in in the technically
node has been the open GFX community
where Richard and Jasper and team have
been working very hard to establish to
bring all this code into the open and
they're almost there pretty much all of
it is out there and they'll be working
really well with community to enable
them to go where you know no no javafx
of tongue has gone before so great stuff
and I hope to see you participate in one
of these projects in closing of course
because I did mention commits want to
point out that it's it's really great
time to be jeddak a developer um it's um
these are sophisticated k-8 and we've
never had this many people contributed
to jdk in in the past couple of years we
haven't had that make them as per month
it's it's going really really well the
statistics for the past 12 months are
you know through the roof so please help
us give us
give you this way and participate in
openjdk and of course to push code you
have to recommit er it's a hallowee--
calculator well you have like in most
other communities in open source um you
have to find somebody else will find
your work interesting and then proposing
and for the details so to become a
committer it's actually fairly
straightforward you need to commit
contribute about eight or excuse me you
need to contribute aight significant
change sets and they need to find
another committer in that project to do
a call for votes for you and that's
pretty much it you have a load two weeks
and then you have your committee ID
historic pushing code of course getting
to the eight-page just may take a bit of
time they have to be significant so you
know eight spelling fixes probably not
but at the same time it's actually
working really well so for example open
GFX has just had its first couple of
mountain Oracle committers voted in a
few weeks ago um and it's been a really
good mechanism to to reward people
who've been doing some significant work
on the only jdk and giving the ability
to work this in this closer and of
course now we have the open therapy the
jdk back system means there can be even
more productive writing you can open
your own box you can do all these things
you couldn't have before and so since
we're almost out of time i like to point
out before i go to the questions i guess
my time for one or two but we'll be
doing a buff tonight about a frequently
asked openjdk questions so if you don't
get a chance to ask a question right now
don't worry come tonight and ask them
but if there's anything somebody wants
to know right now going once yes
yes you can sign is a module yes
okay did you notice any question
searchable answers simple searchable
source Oh specialist or skoda okay yeah
I don't think we have anything out there
yet so there's stuff like open grog for
example which is an open source project
that provides technicality but we don't
have an open rogue server at least yet
but it's certainly good idea to actually
think about right well we have many
infrastructure wise good ideas that we
have to take a first and for now I mean
up until now our major focus has really
been on getting the bug system out there
that has been a huge as you've taken a
huge amount of our resources to to get
and since we're lovely being kicked out
okay thank you all for coming and I hope
to see some of you tonight and help us
make who's your jello better thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
