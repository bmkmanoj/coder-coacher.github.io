Ashish Meltzer I'm director of product
management in the hotel mobile and
development tools and frameworks
organization and I'm going to talk about
our solution for building applications
for mobile devices that uses Java and
how you can basically use it and the
plan if everything goes according to
plan is basically to do half a session
in slides and then the second half would
actually be a development demo so if
you're like me and you can't actually
see when there's the small font on the
screen you might want to move forward at
that stage so usually we start those
presentation by having a bunch of slides
that show you market trends and the
importance of mobile I don't think I
need to do that anymore just Google any
any graph that you want and you'll find
a lot of things on why you should be
doing mobile probably the fact that
you're in this long says that you
already did this and you understand that
Mobile is basically where the next wave
of development is happening and I should
probably preface this whole talk by
saying that when I'm talking about
mobile development I'm not talking
necessarily about mostly I'm not talking
about being developing obviously
developing applications or games like
Angry Birds or those type of things I'm
looking moving today I need to build an
application for my organizations for my
customers to access data information
things like that ok yeah you can add
gamification aspects to the application
that's fine
but my interest what your interest is
usually less about gaming and more about
real enterprise application so that's
kind of what we'll be talking about and
when you're talking about ok I need to
go and build a mobile application the
next question is ok how am I going to
build it so the mobile developer
basically has the first choice that they
need to make is what architecture are
you going to use for your mobile
application and there are three basic
applique textures out there the first
one is called native native basically
means you pick up the SDK of the
platform
and you write with this SDK and produce
an application for that platform and so
iOS has its own SDK and oh it has
another SDK Windows has a third SDK each
one of them come with their own tools
usually so the specific tools specific
KPIs and the nice thing about it is that
you can create an application that
leverages every little nook and cranny
inside the platform ok
the downside of it is that you're
creating an application that is tied to
a specific platform and there's no
portability between them
so again if you're building something
like a gaming application you probably
want to go with a native API because you
need access to the accelerometer in
milliseconds and whatever you if you're
building an enterprise application so
your enterprise this is probably a bad
thing because it means they need to
build two applications at least if they
want to cover Android and iOS if they
want Windows 3 applications they need
two sets of developers probably to
training to development environments
through two of everything which is not
cost effective so the other option is to
go with web application or basically
what people refer to as mobile web
mobile web basically means I build a web
application website of dynamic pages and
access them from their browser on my
mobile device so I open my Safari on the
iOS type in the URL I get to the web
page all my data is there and I can work
with it and and for a lot of cases this
would work okay now one common mistake
is that people think that they can take
the same web page that they have and
just provide access to it on the smaller
phones that usually doesn't work in
terms of user experience but beyond
redesigning the UI aspect everything
else would basically work they advantage
is that it's a web application therefore
it's accessible from every device you
wrote it once works nicely downside is
that the user experience on a mobile
devices far from being great okay
everything from the first aspect where
you actually need to type a URL okay
instead of clicking an icon to the fact
that in most cases it's not that trivial
to interact with the device feature okay
your phone is not just a browser it's a
full-blown computer right now it has
capabilities it has GPS and it has
camera and it has offline capabilities
for stowing things and local files and
stuff like that and web while it's good
for some scenarios in other scenarios D
overall experience is not ideal for
mobile and this caused the rise of the
third option which is hybrid ok hybrid
applications are running on the device
but they are running inside a little
container on the device okay in the
container basically is able to access
the device feature offline storage
camera GPS contacts whatever you it also
allows you to write application once and
run it on multiple platform because
those native containers for which one of
the platforms ok and if you talk to
analysts like Gartner and the rest of
those guys they would tell you that for
enterprise application hybrid is
probably the winning combination because
you do get all the advantages of own
device capabilities for an application
plus the advantages of a I only build it
once and it runs on multiple platform so
those are the basic three architectures
that we are talking about in the market
today
M there are like little variation on
those but those are kind of the main
things now if you're the Java developers
which again I'm guessing you are because
you're at JavaOne there's a little spin
on this ok if you want to do dative
development and you have some sort of
Java on Android we won't get into the
whole legal discussion between Oracle
and Google about that aspect but a on
iOS it's completely new language new
tools new everything
okay and it's not Java you can do web
because you can build web application
whichever that's nice and but hybrid
most of the market today if you go for a
hybrid solution what they offer for you
is development in JavaScript and html5
and even though javascript has the name
Java in it it's not Java and this is
where we come into the picture because
we figured out hey there should be a
market there of people who are
interested in doing hybrid development
using Java and that's basically what we
offer okay so our thinking was what if
you can basically use the same language
that you already know use the same tools
that you already know use the same type
of alka texture and concept that you
know from your current development and
build an application the trance on the
device have features access have offline
capabilities and it would be nice and it
would be nice for us as well because
it's one thing you need to know about
orchid is I'm here from the part of
Oracle that basically creates products
and tells you you should be using it
okay
there's a second part of Oracle which
actually builds application and how
using our tools okay so we had a bunch
of like 5,000 developers out there
building enterprise application web
based application using the Java that's
the language they knew they actually are
using JSF you feel interested um
and suddenly we told them hey we need
mobile application so initially they was
coming in to okay we need to start
training people on specific Xcode and
stuff like that until we gave them a
framework to basically allow them to do
this and that's basically what we call
the Oracle mobile application framework
so at the author mobile application
frameworks allows you to do is build a
single application that runs on multiple
devices modifier multiple devices being
iOS and Android okay and with Windows
planned for the next year
and the coding in this application is
done in Java with the ability if you
want to to also leverage html5
JavaScript and CSS 3 if you want to okay
you don't have to by the way you can do
all your coding basically with Java
coding and components for UI so this is
called the Oracle mobile application
framework or math for short and the one
slight pitch for it before we go into
the details is you build once you land
on multiple platforms it's the same
application framework that you use for
both operating system and also the same
thing for phones and tablets we don't
care we put a lot of focus on making UI
development simpler and we allow you to
have a choice between how you actually
code if you are coding in Java that's
nice if you have people who prefer to
code in JavaScript and HTML 5 we can
accommodate them too in fact you both
can work on the same project on the same
application and cooperate we allow you
to call the old Java code form
JavaScript for example we give you a
choice of development tools we give you
offline capabilities so built into the
framework is a sequel I'd database with
encryption in there so you want turn
into those cases where you think
Starbucks for example ran into this they
built a mobile application that had
offline storage but they never thought
about all we actually need to encrypt
everything that is often we give you it
out of the box we give you full access
to device features and we work a lot on
creating a development experience that
is modular reusable basically allowing
you to work in small groups and then
create bigger applications if you want
to use components all right so at the
end of the day when you come to math you
have two approaches that we support I'll
be covering mostly the declarative
aspect because that's the more
interesting the other one is your
generic html5 JavaScript hybrid solution
that you will find from
multiple windows out there in the
JavaScript html5 approach you basically
code all your logic in JavaScript you
use html5 coding to construct kill you I
possibly some html5 component sets if
you want to and you have a JavaScript
API to access the device features and a
lot of you might be familiar with things
like Cordova and PhoneGap this is this
type of solution we do all of those in
our framework as well so if you have
developers already doing this they can
still use our framework and continue
developing that way the palette is now
interesting to us is the left part where
we say okay we want something that is a
little bit more declarative more
productive in terms of development we
want to Java to be the main development
language we don't want to have people
have to help code low-level html5 and
coded rather we would like to give them
UI components we give them very easy
access to their back-end services and
all the other aspects are there like
security and notification etc all right
so first question is how did you get
Java running on iOS and you can't have
like a standalone JVM on the iOS it
doesn't work this way apple doesn't
allow it but what we found out is that
apple does allow you to have native
libraries as part of your application
and what we did is we basically created
a lightweight JVM that is compiled as a
native library on the device and in your
application when you're packaging the
application and deploying it there's a
built-in JVM in there it's not the full
JVM so it's not like 60 70 Meg's it's
about 10 to 15 Meg's in terms of size
which given the fact that your average
device now probably has 16 to 32 gigs on
it is nothing ok thank you Beth is
probably bigger right and what we use
Java for is to allow you to code you
logic and logic comes in various layers
in our application we basically follow
an MVC approach and you can write your
model ale
beans with Java okay and we have a
controller layer
okay page flow things like that reaction
to events in the user interface you
write everything the bell in Java and
all the life cycle of the application
can also be coded in Java so for example
if at the start of your application you
want to initialize the local database
you like a bunch of JDBC code that
access and initialize the local sequel
I'd database and you already know JDBC
because you went to the basic Java
course in terms of UI interfaces we
basically provide you with three options
of how to build the UI one option is to
use components so it should be a
familiar concept for you if you're using
things like JSF or swing or Java effects
or Visual Basic for that instance they
all come from this group of I have UI
components that I drag on a page and
we'll talk about them in a second we
also allow you to write your own
programmatic html5 so if you feel
comfortable coding html5 bringing in
things like jQuery Mobile or central
whatever you are in terms of components
you can do that and we also support
displaying remote URLs so several
generated HTML pages ok so if you
already have a web mobile application ok
a mobile application that is mostly a
web page you can bring it into our
container and show it in though and what
we'll give you is will give you
capabilities from those pages to access
the device feature ok using JavaScript
that you embed into your web pages so at
the end of the day you have kind of an
openness there about how to implement
the user interface all three of those
options can be in a single application
ok so you can have one application well
some of the pages were created by people
using components in other pages were
created by guys I think html5 based you
eyes and some other things maybe your
online help system comes from a web
based server the just serves HTML right
again the thing that makes us
blink value to the table is basically
our components so we have a set of other
eighty components right now that allow
you to create your user interface and
those are components that change from
your normal button and check box and
radio button and input text to more
complex things like charts and maps in
gauges and in boxes and time lines and a
bunch of other stuff and we do a lot of
in order to allow you to do visual
developmental more declarative type of
development when you're building the UI
okay the components at runtime rental
using html5 and JavaScript on the device
okay so instead of you having to eye
those basically generate it and we
worked a lot to optimize the performance
of those components on mobile devices
and they also support skinning so if you
want to use the SS you can skin them to
have your own look and feel although
most people prefer their components to
look like native components when you
want on mobile application and in fact
some of those components actually use
the native components like the date
component actually picks up the native
UI component and uses that in the user
interface put a lot of focus on things
like animation and gestural support and
things like that because this is what
you expect in a mobile application so
the UI is constructed from components
you basically create a page arrange
components on it
that's your UI level then we have the
MVC approach where we then separate and
create a controller layer okay best
practices again something that in a lot
of cases when you're doing like html5
JavaScript you kind of oh I forgot that
there's MVC on everything is in the same
page all my JavaScript and HTML
spaghetti code it's kind of like
throwback to the java world of servlet
or JSP and we kind of matured above it
at the java world we might as well take
it to the mobile world
so we basically allow you to define page
flows okay and transition between them
and events in your pages that will
trigger methods that are in simple POJO
classes that I defined as min if you're
familiar with JSF this would be pretty
much what you're already doing but it
doesn't use JSF so the concepts are
similar
can you define management with coke you
define binding between the manage beans
and your UI interface using expression
language and you have a central page or
central file where you define all the
page flows all the manage means all of
those things but it's not jazz if
there's no JSF running on the device
it's just the concepts are the same and
again why we did it we did it because we
have developers that already know just F
in and out we wanted them to have a
smooth transition into becoming a mobile
developer all right then
there's the aspect of how do you access
device features camera GPS contacts all
of it so we're using something in a
market called córdoba córdoba is an
open source solution that they provides
interfaces to device features
cross-platform okay so we actually embed
the code over into our container and we
use it to access the device features
what we did above it is we provided an
API that simplifies things in two ways
one way is that you now have a bunch of
Java methods that you can call to do
things like get me a picture okay create
a contact okay I'll send an SMS in
addition the other thing that and the
API is available both in Java and
JavaScript beyond that we are also
providing you with ability to just drag
and drop those into the page to add them
so do it in a declarative way rather
than coding you can tank to accelerate
your development speed and as with every
framework we can do that much out of the
box and give you sometimes you need this
little extra and this is where the
extensibility comes into the play so we
give you out of the book support for GPS
and SMS and contacts and local files and
a bunch of other stuff but if there's
something
you can actually use the code of a
plugin approach to create interactions
with other device features maybe you
need like barcode scanning or I don't
know some heat sensing device or things
like that you can basically create your
code of a plugin bring it into the
framework and use it we create a tee UI
components maybe there's one missing
that you specifically need you can just
create this component with html5 coding
JavaScript and then package it for other
developers in your organization to use
okay
and we also allow you to create reusable
components that are constructed from
other components so if you have like a
complex component that needs two check
boxes and a button and an input text and
a calendar you create this and then you
can just drag it in one go the whole
component one nice aspect that we do is
something called declarative
customization and it's a little hard to
explain but think about this way am I'm
creating an application that I'm selling
now to Target and Walmart okay
each one of them needs the same Co
application but each one of them has a
little changes that they need beyond
just the logo at the top it's things
like maybe one of them has the weekly
bonus and the other one doesn't have
things like that so we can do those type
of customization as a layer on top of
the base application so think about it
is I provide a base application and then
a layer on top of it that define
customization that are applied at
runtime
okay this allows me to create a single
application that serves multiple
customers and it's very valuable if your
independent software vendors that sells
the solution it's sometimes also helpful
in your own organization well some
departments in your organization want
extra behavior of different behavior and
instead of creating multiple
applications you create one and with
little declarative customization on top
of it we support push notification so
again that's one of the key differences
between
web-based mobile web and on device
application on device allows you to do
push and push for us the end-user it's
the annoying thing in some cases for a
lot of the companies that's the way for
them to tie a more tightly connection
with a customer it's being able to tell
the customer oh we have this promotion
you got this message from something if
your manager and suddenly you get all
those emails oh there's a new expense
report waiting for you because someone
is at JavaOne and he's at the bar next
door and you need to like to be a little
bit so those type of things again this
is something that leverages the device
functionality and we allow you to
basically do this using either the Apple
or Google push servers and guess what
when the event comes into your device
you just write a little bit of Java to
say okay this is what you're going to do
when the event comes and decide what you
want to toast us at that point of time
security is again very important for us
what we did there is we provide you with
support for authentication so you can
basically turn on authentication on your
application and when someone comes in he
would need to login login is usually
done by connecting to a remote server
that has the LDAP information and we
support various protocols of security
one aspect that is that we can also do
offline security so think about this way
let's same application needs to be
secured people need to log in in order
to get access to it and but sometimes
they are on an airplane and there's no
Wi-Fi and they can't connect does it
mean that they can't use my application
because they can't log in no it doesn't
what we allow you to do is the first
time that you log in will again against
your remote server okay but then we
store locally your credentials and then
when you're offline and you want to log
in we validate against the local
credentials and of course everything is
encrypted locally and of course there's
a timeout so you can say ok after two
days of not being connected you you
can't connect
until you reconnect right so this is
authentication then we do things like
access control so you can define in your
application various oils that get access
to various features so maybe again
managers have access to one set of
features in the mobile application and
employees have another set of features
and then there's encryption so called a
local that in data in transit is
encrypted okay so your sequel ID data
all the communication between the mobile
device and the server can be encrypted
and if you want additional capabilities
we actually integrate with the Oracle
Mobile Security Suite to do things like
containerization of the application on
your mobile device or device access
control so you can basically form a
silver tell someone this application on
their device can't access the camera
okay Oh things like single sign-on
between multiple mobile application and
a bunch of other capabilities over there
and beyond having a framework it's very
important for us again to have a good
development experience with the
framework so we right now supports both
JDeveloper which is the Oracle
development environment for everything
that is overkill based as well as the
clips so if you're currently using
Eclipse you can basically go in and we
have a plugin that allows you to build
those applications and the idea
integration beyond working with the
framework also makes sure that the idea
actually works with the SDKs for the
platform so from inside the clip so
JDeveloper you can actually create a
package about application that goes into
your Android emulator go into your iOS
simulator you can educate the APK in a
IPA files directly form your ID you can
do debugging so you can set breakpoints
and debug your application while it's
running on the device things like that
this is how it looks in JDeveloper so in
general we even have more visual
visualization so you can see that when I
design a page on the right side I can
actually see how the page looks like and
but we also have
supporting Eclipse and because this is
Java 1 and I figure there's no people in
the room that use Eclipse then
JDeveloper I'm going to do the demo with
eclipse I'm sure but at the end of the
day the experience is very much the same
alright so this is the overall
architecture diagram this is what we're
doing hopefully by this time you should
be able to understand it on your own but
I'll just reiterate some points on the
left you basically have the device on on
the right side you have the remote cell
nose 1 the device we have our container
ok
it's native container for each platform
so today we have Android and iOS in the
future we'll have Windows inside the
container we are running a layer the
takes care of the UI we're using the
webview technology and yo UI can be
based on remote eol features local HTML
features or components that you use the
triple value if you're using our
component cou I can also have a
controller layer to do MVC architecture
when the UI layer needs to invoke logic
it can go over and invoke it in a Java
VM ok the java vm basically has your
client logic it can run JDBC and access
your sequel Lite for example and it can
also access the Apache Cordova plugins
and api's to access device features if
you need data for remote servers you can
use either resto soap services and just
get the data into your application ok
that's the way that you communicate with
remote servers you can't do direct JDBC
from inside here into a remote database
that's just not secured and we support
push servers that can send event back to
the Java VM and you can reply to them
writing some Java we have a layer called
application configuration layer that
allows you to configure the application
at runtime so for example you built the
application and you distribute it around
the world but each country has a
different server that you want them to
connect to connect to so the first time
they invoke the application they can
basically choose ok this is the my
location and then you set a bunch of
configuration about
which servers they are accessing it's
built into the frame of this type of
things and we have the security layer in
front of everything making sure that
only authenticated and authorized people
can invoke anything any questions so
Phil okay let's go to do it yeah we'll
talk about license it costs money at
this yeah at this stage everyone cleans
the room usually at the JavaOne
conference right the licensing basically
works per application okay so you build
an application development is free so
you can try this out for free play with
it as much as you want all of the
software is available for download on
our website once you actually produce an
application that goes production we
license per application and we have two
modes of licensing one is a user based
license so if you for example billion
application for your department and you
know there's 20 people who are going to
use this application you pay per user
the other a user schema the other
licensing way is basically unlimited
number of users for example if you put
something on the public app store and
you know that you I don't know like all
the world is your customers you have the
another type of license and beyond that
the other thing to explain here is if
you're an ISV
if you're basically a software vendor
who creates a solution and then resell
the solution you can get discounts on
both aspect deep discounts if this is
embedded into your product this is an
Oracle thing that works there alright so
and if you want to know exactly the
price for it it all depends on how good
are you at haggling with the Oracle
account manager it's catching them at
the end of the quarter that would be my
recommendation all right
EMM all right let's do a demo so how do
you actually build an application and so
this is Eclipse and I'm now walking in
an Oracle math perspective and therefore
when I click here I have the ability to
create a new math application must
forget mobile application framework give
it a name so we call it
Java one
okay you can choose which version of
math we tempt will thank to release new
math versions
every two to three months so pretty
quick with updates and stuff like that
and next okay which platform are you
targeting I'm targeting both iOS and
Android at this point of time and click
finish
in in reality like Ethernet those
platforms later on it doesn't matter
when you're building the application
there is no concept of I'm building an
application for Android okay
so just building a generic application
and then we basically create several
projects for you one of them for example
is the java application this is the
overall lifecycle for your application
so it's everything that has to do with
the lifecycle for example or overall
application definitions security aspects
like that and then there's the view
controller layer which is where you
define specific features so the co file
in here is something called the map
feature editor and a single application
can have multiple features each feature
is the section of the application again
this is the modularity that we talked
about so let's create a feature and
we'll call this feature my HL system and
then inside this feature I can create
multiple types of features in terms of
content as I mentioned before it can be
remote URL local html5 HTML file that I
wrote oh it can be a single page or a
complete task flow basically a
controller layer so let's create a task
flow in our case and we'll call it and
then we'll create the actual file will
call this file the amp flow and then M
Eclipse goes over and creates the file
hopefully reason it took a little bit is
because we moved into a visual editor
for the file okay so this is where you
can actually start designing your page
flow you take components like one page
another page
third page and you go to each one of
them and you can give them name so this
would be my list page and this would be
my it's a child page and this would be
my picture page and then it can pick up
the control flow and define flows
between those pages so this would be my
shout flow and then another flow would
go from here to here that would be my
pick flow again if you did Joseph strats
whatever you you're familiar with the
concept and when interesting aspect is
when you look at the properties of one
of those flows one of the things that
you can define is which type of
transition you want to do when you're
switching between those pages okay so in
them you know mobile about those things
like flick so you see the thing changing
like this so swipe whatever okay so
let's do flip left for example for this
transition and this transition we can do
something else and again you're looking
at me doing it right now in a visual
view right but you need to remember that
there's always a source behind it so
here's the source basically XML pretty
much like your JSF configuration file
alright at this stage we ready with our
page flow let's actually create a page
you double click a page and you can
define initial look and feel for your
page which parts of the page you want
one enough do you need a footer or not
stuff like that and create the page
without a footer and we click OK and
this takes us into the page editor and I
have already a header here okay so I can
inside the header right now I have just
a text output so let's name it empty for
example I'm not even give it a value of
M and then there's two buttons at the
top ok and again for which button you
can basically go over here and say okay
the text on this on this button is going
to say it child okay and then the text
on this button is going to say
piqué now I'm doing it through
properties because I'm a lazy developer
if you're moving to actual coding you
can actually go and do it directly in
the code editor so you can actually go
in here for example and do the control
space and get the code inside so the
action equal and whatever you so this is
going to be the shop navigation and this
is going to be the navigation okay so
this is my navigation in the page so
this is how you again its component
properties you have the structure pane
on the right here where you see the
structure of the page and now comes the
interesting part of how do I get data
into this page and there are multiple
ways I'm going to do a simple Java class
okay so new Java class and we'll create
a POJO that represents an employee and
I'm not going to bore you with actually
coding this whole thing so I have a code
template for this and all it does is
basically just do a setter skaters on a
bunch of properties so this is my map
object and then I can say okay I also
need another Java class which would be
my service kind of class so this would
be where I create for example a list of
employees and I can do operation on
lists and stuff like that
so we'll do amps here and this is
basically right now all I'm doing here
is I'm populating the list with a set of
fixed values in here and I can show you
that this demo is life by changing one
of those right um but the idea here is
that this Java code can do anything you
want it can go over for example to a
rest service get a bunch of results and
populate the list it can go to a soap
service in fact for soap services we
actually have a declarative way of doing
it so you don't actually need to write
all of this but it can go to a local
database and get the data it can push
the data into a local database whatever
you want all right once you have this
you either define this as the managed
bean in your application in the
configuration file or another thing that
we allow you to do is actually right
click and say create for me something we
call it data control and in the data
control we actually go and analyze the
structure of your file and then when
you're creating a page beyond dragging
over components you can also drag over
your bin lists and field okay so now
we're creating a page back so what we
want to do here okay this is the list of
components that I can use some of them
are layout components like the splitter
for example surprisingly enough splits
my page into two areas like something on
the left and something on the right and
what I'm going to do is now once I have
this split I'm going to take the
employees list and drag it into the left
side and then I can drop it and I can
bind it to various UI components so
let's bind it to a ListView this feels
something you should be familiar with if
you are doing any like contact list on
your phone or list of songs and stuff
like that that's basically the list
component and I'm going to say show me
on this list specific fields so let's
show a name and salary and maybe we'll
break by the first letter of the
employee name so this is my list
component and again if you look at the
structure of the list right it's
basically a list item with a late layout
inside it each cell has a bunch of
output text for example right now it can
be anything you want to put it in there
let's collapse that part let's also show
the employees here on the right side is
a form so form I can do a read-only or a
NAPA dateable form this will allow me to
update the data of the employee actually
in the form to be inside the right side
like this okay so this is the structure
pane I can also manipulate the structure
of my page from here let's go back to
the flow let's create the child page
pretty much the same process and create
a button inhale tell the button to say
back so I can actually navigate back to
the previous page so I have a built-in
navigation called back okay and then
let's take the same employee that and
this time drop it on the page
to show one type of child so we have
multiple types of chests that you can
choose from so well child because that's
the easiest thing to do so we'll show
salary on one axis and then the name of
the employee on the other one okay and
just like in your JSF components each
one of those components have a bunch of
properties that you can set for example
the child has all sorts of animation
properties that you can do on it so for
example when it displays you can say I
want to do an alpha fade type of
animation and again you can code all of
this if you prefer to code and just for
me dragon dope is a little bit faster
especially when I'm doing a demo and
limited in time all right let's do the
last page in our flow which was the
picture page right so in the picture
page what I want to do is that I want to
allow the user to actually pick a
picture from his library and edit so
from the local repository of pictures so
the same approach I did with data
control in access a employees there's
also the device features in here okay
you can see things like find contact and
send SMS and start location Monaco for
GPS I'm going to use the get picture
method and I'm going to drag it into my
page and let's say the button that will
get the picture there's a bunch of
properties that I need to set for
example the quality of the picture on a
range from 0 to 90 and where is it
getting full what's the destination so
the destination is a file and do I get
it from the camera from the library will
do library and each one of those by the
way can be tied to an expression
language so it doesn't need to be a
fixed value you can have an expression
language that goes to a managed bean and
picks up the value and let's actually
also show like this is the size of the
picture right oh and because I'm now
adding picture access so camera access
into my application I want to also
mark my application yet I need camera
access and I don't know maybe I need
some file access as well and then on the
same page I also want to show the
results so I can actually drag the
result of the taking a picture over here
and drop it as an image all right so
this is my pic page let's just add one
more black button here so we can always
navigate back to the initial page and
that's it so so far in my development I
didn't actually have to worry about how
am I going to deploy it in terms of is
it an iOS or an Android application this
is the first time that you're going to
see it it's when I'm going to say okay
let's run this and I can go and create a
gun configuration yeah remove some of
the ones that they have oh let's get a
new one
in Neuville here I can basically choose
do I want to do an iOS configuration or
an Android configuration and again the
same application can have multiple of
those I'm gonna make so I can actually
do an iOS configuration and at this
stage I can click apply and run and what
Eclipse does now is basically starts up
an ant script that does everything for
me including compiling saving packaging
it into an IPA oh I always get confused
between IP an apk file but what I need
and then basically goes and deploys it
to the simulator okay so I want you to
think so far is the development
experience and what we were trying to do
here in terms of ID
it's eclipse you already know that one
hopefully and in terms of coding
whenever I needed to do some coding it
was either I write some Java or I do
some components that I need to drag and
drop into the page and arranged in a
simple XML configuration again either
visual or I can go and access the code
directly the concept seal should all be
familiar for you as a Java guy you
should be able to basically go out of
this room
pick up this product play with us for
2-3 hours and be able to write an iOS
application for your organization that's
what we wanted our developers to do and
this is what we hope that you will be
able to do okay so it finished
deployment started up the iOS emulator
in free school okay here's our Java one
application and if I click on it I have
on the left side I told you that the
page is divided into two right the left
side and right side or the left side I
have the list of employees in the lists
and I can choose an employee and
remember the change I did for Steve it's
all here and I can see it here and I can
then go and change the day that he was
hired on and I get the native controller
for this one okay oops this is how you
know it's a little demo right okay I
want to show you one more thing let's
saute the device and then the list is
always on the left it doesn't collapse
right so this is awareness to
orientation okay if I click the child I
get the salaries of the employees and if
I click back I go back if I click pick
it ask me do you want to allow access to
the phone yeah and then I can pick up
the picture and say okay choose this one
and it becomes part of my is good right
and that's my application it's about
what ten minutes of development and it's
not a HelloWorld application this is the
full-blown employee list and updates and
stuff like that
if you gave me a little bit more time I
would have been able to build a more
impressive application but because those
sessions are only limited to one hour
I'm actually going to show you the
amount sto to a pre-prepared application
just to show you what's possible no I
need to connect this yeah that's the fun
of playing with multiple devices that's
the thing you think in a mobile wall
you'll have to carry less suddenly you
actually have to kill in many more
devices to every place that you go
can we get a picture hey all right so
this is my device and if I turn it like
this it like this and if it turns like
that it's like that all the audience
should go like this issue when you do
this and and this is just some of the
visualization components we have so
there's the thematic map okay on the
left side there's the visualization of
the salary scale Department on the right
side the bigger the Box the most
salaries you're paying there you have
the performance of each one on a what we
call an inbox component it's very common
in what you call it in HR departments
and then you can basically say okay I'm
actually interested in this department
and you click on it I and I clicked on
the map and then you can see all the
employees in this department and how
they are divided okay and you can look
at the schedule so the schedule is using
a component called time line now maybe
those guys don't have a timeline they
just had too much things on their
timeline
M so the time line is basically gives
you a way to visualize things across a
timer what the name kind of suggested in
a visual graph way I shouldn't pick the
the department that has 41 employees
that's usually not a good thing to do
anyway what I wanted you to get is an
impression of the type of visualization
that you can do here and the type of DUI
that you can create with a little bit
more effort and that's the way by the
way that if you look if you actually go
to the outlet open-world Emma ground and
you go around the apps guys there you'll
see those type of application because
they are building those applications
with our technology so that's the
timeline okay with all the events that
they have and I can also go back and
look at employees okay in another
department it's okay the marketing
department maybe it's a little bit more
handable and I can turn on some type of
event and turn them on and I can
actually click on a specific employee
and see the employee data so this is how
he has been performing okay I can see
who's his manager so Steven is his
manager so I can click on Steven and go
to see Stephens details and things like
that all sorts of graphs and
visualization with animation right and
that's the type of application that
we'll building right now and hopefully
you get an understanding of what we do
let me try and give you one more reason
to do this beyond the fact that it's
cool and it will allow you to basically
pick up and start becoming a mobile
developer in your organization and we
try to make getting up to speed with
this framework as easy as possible you
can go to our website this is the
shortcut get a free download of either
the Eclipse environment or the J
developer environment whatever you
prefer we have step by step tutorial to
get you through your basic application
so creating an application that access
the local java class or when application
faxes in the database or an application
taxes a web service we have an online
crash course if you just have two or
three hours you watch this and it's
basically online free you get training
on all the layers of the application if
you have a little bit
more time we have over 40 videos on
YouTube that you can watch on the ride
home on you like that with training on
every aspect of this framework we have
documentation there's a new book that
was just published about it we have a
booth at the Java one demo ground if you
want to ask more questions or get more
answers and one more thing that we're
announcing today is that we have
developed a challenge okay go and play
with this develop a simple application
and you can win money okay and that's
the URL
bitly math challenge all we want is
basically we want you to try this out
because we think you would like what you
see so that's basically how we can get
you to do Java on iOS and Android with
the same tool and concepts you already
know any questions yes we basically do
you can set a break point and then we do
remote debugging so we just like you do
remote debugging of any java thing
because the JVM is running on the device
we can actually remote debug it this way
yeah over there at the end yeah yeah
Bluetooth what if you have a Cordova
plug-in then yes again we don't have it
out of the box but with the code of a
plug-in architecture you can pick
someone that built a code of a plug-in
for the Bluetooth and work with that yes
no so we already have about the hamlet
applications on the app store including
one iTunes then on Google built with
those type of things
this is fully okay with the Orca
licensing GUI the the way that you might
get your application actually decline
with this is if you build a UI that
sucks cuz that will actually check Co UI
but um in terms of architecture the
whole native library and things like
that they're perfectly fine with it and
again what I want you to understand is
author is basing our business on dole on
this architecture it's not something
that we just shoot out there and okay
maybe it would live and maybe not we are
basing our revenue on this type of thing
in terms of the enterprise application
we'll selling this is what Larry is
going to show it's this type of
applications and so yeah it works with
pepper we have tight communication with
Apple we make sure that things work
perfectly fine yeah trying it out free
take it over and pay with it for free
only pay us when you have a production
thing that you want to actually deploy
and have users using it okay trying out
free completely free yeah yeah yeah it's
not cloud you deploy it on the device so
you can connect your device connect it
and oh right I see people leaving so
we'll do this and let you go if you have
any questions just come over and ask me
any question thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
