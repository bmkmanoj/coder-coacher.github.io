office hours event this meeting is being
recorded can someone give me a shout out
if you can if the audio is working okay
can you hear can you hear me all right
Nils are you there am i coming through
according to zoom we're looking good so
I am going to go right ahead
so this is something new that Oracle
Corporation is doing where we're
providing direct access to the pms in a
more informal kind of setting something
akin to office hours as you may recall
from university years hence the name so
direct access to p ends and more
informal setting opportunities to ask
questions so my name is todd bakr and i
i bring you greetings from sunny
california Redwood Shores headquarters
of Oracle I did have a little bit of
agenda today I don't want to keep it too
formal you know I don't want to get
super formal but I would like some input
actually on the format timing where
you'll be doing this every month the
plan is to do this once a month so I
want to get the day and time right you
know so it works best for the most
people I want to get the format right
I'm eager to get your feedback and a
couple of those things and I do have a
short presentation to share with you as
well but first let's do a quick kind of
personal introduction so here's our
here's our page for these p.m. office
hours events around the first one
February 14th the quick bio a little bit
more about me
I have been with Oracle between 11 and
15 years depending how you count it I
worked for
all companies that were acquired by
Oracle so that I had experience working
elsewhere
and worked for a couple companies even
before that as well but I've been with
Oracle for for some time off and on for
a total of over a decade and I love
working here it's been a great
experience my my focus at present is on
schema service aka Oracle database cloud
service multi-tenant Edition so it's
sometimes you call it schema service for
short it has a longer formal name and
also on exadata Express cloud service
which is the long term successor to
schema service I'm also involved in a
couple other related things principally
our always free database cloud service
that is focused on app dev you can find
that at Apex Oracle comm and some
related related technologies so that's a
little bit about me focused on express
schema free running Oracle database in
the cloud I worked for Oracle for a
while and a couple other places before
that all focused on enterprise tech and
I'm just I'm delighted to be with you
today this is I think this is kind of a
cool idea I'm a big fan of the idea so
we're gonna we'll see how it goes
alright so quick agenda nothing too
formal this is the first time we've done
this so a couple housekeeping items I
wanted to cover off second I would like
to get your input on some things related
to this series third a short
presentation just a couple minutes
I'm not going to regale you with tons of
slides I have a couple slides that just
provides an overview of X data Express
in particular and also ample time for
question answers so that's perhaps the
most important aspect of this is your
opportunity to ask questions
some housekeeping things first this
these sorts of discussions probably
we'll get into roadmap and whenever we
talk about roadmap you've probably seen
this at you know many other large
companies we have to show this safe
harbor right it essentially says if Todd
gets real specific about specific dates
and deliverables in the future that
don't take that as gospel and and I'm
trained I'm not supposed to go off the
rails and make specific commitments to
specific things on specific dates I
probably won't do that but we're
required to show the safe harbor
statement in any case if we're going to
get into roadmap kind of information
obviously I can't show proprietary
information this is a public forum it
will include Oracle employees partners
live customers perhaps some luminaries
some other people have been thinking
about and perhaps will invite to join
and then that sort of forum I can't you
know I can't share proprietary
information perhaps this goes without
saying but you know if you ask me what's
the revenue projection for XYZ for next
quarter you know I'll probably take a
pass on that sort of thing there's
certain things I can't share but other
than that you know I'll try and be as
open and honest as possible and you know
give you the straight information
straight from the pm the tech PM you
know working in the dev team employees
who are joining obviously will have
customers on the line you know be
sensitive that common courtesies apply
you probably will stump me at some point
during this series of office hours and
that's good
I hope you do please stop me there there
may be things that I just don't know the
answer to you know I have to go look up
and circle back on that I've got a
little microsoft word document open I'm
going to take notes and anytime I'm
stumped I'll make note of it and I will
make an effort to get back with you the
parking lot there may be questions that
are just better suited for other office
hours or other PM's and I'm going to put
them in a parking lot but I'll note you
know who
I think is the best person for that and
what is the right forum for that if
there is another office hours scheduled
so there probably will be a couple
things that go on the parking lot anyway
I don't know about you I have no
compunction whatsoever about ending
really I personally love that I love it
when the presenter says exactly what
they need to say nothing more nothing
less and then gives me ten minutes back
or 15 minutes back so we may do that
happy to do that
live polls in addition to asking your
questions this also was an opportunity
for me to ask you questions and get
feedback directly from from customers
from Oracle folks out in the field from
others so I probably will do some live
polls and I've done a couple today and
now this is really important for helping
us as PMS prioritize there's this whole
world of things we could do and things
we would like to do but as you might
expect there is not infinite or
unlimited resources or infinite time you
know we have to prioritize things this
is a great opportunity for you to help
us prioritize so anything along those
lines where you're seeing something
that's particularly important recurring
themes and they're just coming up over
and over again or escalating very open
to feedback on those kinds of topics all
right so now let's start off with a live
poll and let's see how many people we've
got three or four there was four now
it's three we're back to four we have
three or four folks so not a huge sample
size here but let's let's do a couple
polls let's see how it goes it's
apparently zoom has the ability to do
polls
it had me pre create a couple so I am
gonna try that out so pulling launched
pulling okay first question how long
should these sessions be thirty minutes
thirty to sixty minutes more than an
hour any feedback on that topic
okay perfect thank you all right next
question what is the best day during the
week Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
finds it better to do something like
this earlier in the week everyone's
fresh everyone's back online or later in
the week people have maybe have a little
more free time on a Friday that's cool
okay looks like kind of midweek is best
thank you very much and let's go to
question number three what's the best
week of the month do we want to kind of
do this toward the beginning of the
month mid months later in the month any
feelings on that here we go big month
okay click mid month is the answer there
okay and last one on timing what time of
day is best or that's that's code for
where in the world are you joining from
Oracle is a very global company we have
customers all over the world so where
are you joining from and hence what time
of day would be best we're doing this
kind of midday North America which means
early morning in Japan in the evening in
Europe that generally tends to be the
best but open to other alternatives so
it looks like North America and amia
okay based on that we'll probably stick
with the current schedule and I'm
getting a comment in the chat more
detailed nails from Germany and other
nails okay now a question about session
format what in your opinion what would
be the best kind of structure for this
sort of office hour session structured
p.m. freeze oh and demo guest speakers
and discussion I could bring in other
PMS VP's partners customers
unstructured Q&amp;amp;A time interaction with
other others on the call discussion
amongst yourselves
hello you want to chime in on that yeah
yeah I guess if it's of interest we
could get partners who are running on
top of you know exited Express and they
can share you know how they're running
as an ISV app or in a what have done in
terms of migrating customers over
excellent that would be very welcome a
locust and Oracle employee and interacts
with many partners and he has the
benefit of actually someone on his team
has already done one of these office
hours just recently so some experience
with this alright I'm going to end that
question next question possible topics
what are some topics of interest this is
me brainstorming totally off-the-cuff
off the top of my head I was blasting
he's into the poll pretty quickly but
are there specific topics that you think
would be more or less interesting to
drill down on I'll let you pick your
favorite topic let's see if that
surprising number of questions just
about pricing in packaging you know
based on gamers or credits and some of
the new things Oracle is doing that lots
of other questions about customer use
cases examples roadmap what exactly are
we running under the hood if we get
questions really all over the map so it
looks like what's new pricing impact
Jing was useful okay good let's close
that one off and possible comparisons
this is another thing that I get a lot
well tell me about what you do and how
it stacks up with other database cloud
service available from Oracle other
service
is available from from you know
competitors how did how did the to
services in my domain compared you know
the more detailed drill down on the
differences between just schema service
next day to express happy to do any and
all of the above okay looks like we're
about evenly split on that one some
competitor some comparing to other
Oracle and some and the internal
comparisons alright and that one and
then last question this is our my last
cooling question for the day
both of these services are great hosts
for doing application development not
only as dev and test environments but
you know hosting and running production
apps in particular apex apps but other
things too we've certainly had some
interest around nodejs
and rust recently this is Oracle
database and you know sequel PL sequel
questions for sure any of these things
sound interesting it's like breast
sequel PL sequel Python okay good to
know
alright so I'm going to close that one
off that'll be our last polling question
for the day oh the way I can take a look
at that that was helpful I may do some
of these questions again in a future
session just given that this is our very
first session ever
we've only got three or four people so
but that's that's useful I appreciate it
thank you and that one and see how close
this polling is closed okay we're back
so now I'm going to transition into the
short p.m. presentation part of this
where again a couple slides I'm not
going to I'm not going to do death by
PowerPoint I'm happy to do that if if we
want to do that you know there's
something you really want to drill down
on in great detail in a future session
I'm happy to do that but I was thinking
for this one I just do a quick over
view of Exadata express so this was
launched in late 2016
so it's been around for going here going
on a year and a half I guess alright
yeah 2017 2018 it's been around you know
long enough to get some summer mindshare
but it's not exactly one of our oldest
surfaces as I mentioned it is positioned
and this was launched by Larry Ellison
on the big stage at open world some
slides about it this is recorded and
visible on YouTube and so forth it is
its position as the long-term successor
to schema service so schema service aka
database cloud service 2010 Edition that
has been around for a while that was
Oracle's original database cloud service
that was what we started with years ago
now and it became evident that schema
service was in native or refresh so
exiting express schema service is still
there it still works
we do not have plans to deprecated it
any time soon but we have provided
something that we think will make a
great long-term successor and that's
perhaps the first point about Exadata
Express a couple other important
characteristics it's really positioned
for the entry level and you that's
reflected in the pricing and the shapes
it's you can get starting with one core
up to four cores you can start with 20
gigs of storage and go up to a terabyte
of storage but it caps out you know at
those at those levels if you're you want
you know many many cores own I should
say the the top shape has 40 gigs of RAM
as well so if you want many many colors
you know tens or teens or twenties of of
course you want a lot more storage you
want you know a lot more RAM there are
alternatives from Oracle that are
able to deliver that but this particular
ones more position for the entry-level
and caps out or here now there are some
tips and tricks I can share along these
lines like for example exit Express
includes advanced compression option at
no additional cost and with advanced
compression option we typically get you
know three to five X compression ratio
for all TP workloads it also includes
exadata hybrid color compression we run
on X today and that gets you know 10 X
or greater compression ratios Allah
knows your now so yes it caps out a one
terabyte of storage but there are ways
to fit vastly more amounts of data into
an exadata Express shape all that said
are higher level shapes exadata cloud
service for instance vm or database
cloud service we have some great
offerings there as well so there
certainly are places to go from here if
you want to go up this it Rams on over
beta base 12c release to its Enterprise
Edition plus a whole bunch of options
thrown in it includes pre-configured
application Express
we're running 5:1 right now it's
actually apex 5 1-3 at the moment and we
try to keep it very current Swords 3 we
have a nice service console UI tying it
all together this is another very
important aspect at this this is a fully
managed service so this really was you
could say our initial autonomous service
we have much more coming along those
lines but this was where we were kind of
testing the waters you know we put
something out that's completely managed
for you we take care of the patching the
upgrade the AJ configuration the arm and
backups the security lockdown the
firewall rules it's very a very packaged
offering that allows you to just focus
on the database and the active
functionality on top of the database so
stand up your data management and start
making your apps right away that was the
objective anyways to to take some of the
more routine kind of DBA tasks out of
the picture deliver something that's
very easy to uptake fully managed very
attractive to a developer kind of
audience
so it's packed with features we really
piled it in there there's a partial list
here it does
unlike schema service which is rest
access and effects asset access Exadata
Express supports sequel net so the whole
broad ecosystem Oracle database client
sorting on sequel net from from Oracle
from partners bi partners you know tools
utilities language drivers the
traditional things that connect to
Oracle database you know those are
supported with exadata Express whereas
in schema service is basically rest in
Apex only the highest shape gives you
IMC a lot of interest in in-memory
columnstore lately it's a great for
large-scale analytics lightning fast and
we do have a shape on the upper end that
includes that it's available in North
America and Europe datacenters and
shapes start as low as US 175 per month
so very affordable pricing on the high
end on the low and the high end and then
we pack on even more on the high end
where things like IMC so that's like a
one slide quick overview of Exadata
Express this shows you where it fits
into the overarching Oracle database
cloud portfolio we're a full instance
running on VM in the middle there this
gives you the local database it gives
you a VM you have host access you could
SSH into it you can you know it's
essentially an on-prem database except
running in the cloud you know and it has
some packaging around it some tools
around it that make then make patching
and upgrading and it makes some things a
little easier but it essentially gives
you the holy Oracle database the same
way you would run it on an on-premise
type of machine it's suitable for all
kinds of use cases and it is available
in our cloud machine too we have cloud a
customer cloud machine where you can you
can essentially take our cloud and run
it as a machine behind your firewall so
it's available there and then on the
highest our highest end
category of database cloud services exit
data cloud service not to be confused
with Exadata Express cloud service which
you can do anything on you know it's
suitable for any kind of workload it's
an engineered system it's highly
optimized for for database work and you
can also get this you can get the cloud
version of this as a packaged machine
that you can run behind your firewall -
or you can buy it running in our data
center in our cloud so different options
there and then on the left you see where
exadata express which we're talking
about today kind of where that fits in
great for database development
departmental LLB type of applications
SMB customers it's a great kind of entry
level service to start with a great
on-ramp to Oracle database cloud and the
you know I guess the subtext there is
the caps that we have on it on the upper
end you know they're deliberate right
you know it's positioned for certain
kind of use cases and as you go up to
enterprise apps highest availability
scalability performance you would you
would move to one of the higher order
services which do more but are also a
little more expensive so that's a quick
look at the the whole portfolio and kind
of where express fits in we have been
hard at work since it was launched with
enhancements extensions there's a couple
things we've done recently we support
Oracle cloud credits so you can buy this
with credits we support free trials you
sign up for $300 worth of promotional
credits and then you can use those on
exodus press we added the larger shapes
up to the four cores 40 gigs around one
terabyte of storage we have a nice
capability to take your own backups and
integrated this into the UI in the
service console UI so it's literally
button clicks click click click and you
can take your own backup and send it out
to Oracle storage cloud service so your
backup resides in the cloud in the
storage cloud and
used a pump but I'm kind of behind the
scenes reason data pump export and
import but it's a great way to kind of
take your own backups do your own
restores we improved the data loading
with support for sequel loader direct
plan path it was originally just
conventional path but we've had direct
path so you know decent data loading
times I was talking to a customer just
recently who was loading I think said
about 20 gigs of data over the Internet
into exadata Express just from his home
office which had a cable internet
connection he didn't say who he said it
was kind of ironic you know
run-of-the-mill internet connection and
he loaded 20 gigs over the public
Internet into Oracle cloud and it took
between three and four hours he let it
go overnight and then he checked
afterwards it's like it took you know 20
gigs over the Internet and three or four
hours using sequel loader direct path
load so pretty good you know that's
pretty good performance characteristics
not not a bad solution now if you're
talking about loading multiple terabytes
or multiple petabytes then there are
other things we can talk to you about
there certainly our products and
offerings optimized for those kind of
scenarios you're talking about the types
of data that XD Express is designed for
sequel or direct pass pretty good
solution so we added some additional PL
sequel packages so you can do a DBMS
crypto so you can do your own crypto
it includes TDE by default by the way
everything is encrypted at rest is in TV
but we had customers who wanted to do
that roll their own crypto on top of
that so we had a DBMS crypto support for
not one but multiple apex workspaces
we've integrated it with developer cloud
service it makes for a very nice
lifecycle management solution where if
you've got multiple instances of x8
Express you can automatically uptake
changes from dev push them to test push
them to QA push them to staging push
them to prod all in one automated flow
we're running out of developer cloud
service so you
a free developer cloud service along
with exit Express that allows you to do
that sort of thing so very cool that
would be something fun to demo too if
that's of interest we've done a number
of upgrades to Apex we try and keep it
current very current assisted migration
from schema service so a nice way if
you're a schema service customer a nice
way to bring your data out and then move
it into a exadata Express and we've
added a number of other videos to our
welcome tour most recently a nice video
about connecting to x8 Express from
nodejs
so I don't see another comment here Nils
does it mean that you have full
configuration access to Apex
and boards No so it comes prepackaged
with our own web logic cluster running
Ords and then we take care of the Ords
patching and upgrades to that cluster
the trade-off for that is you know
they're there if you want to
fundamentally change the installation or
you know the configuration of that Ords
instance you're not able to do that we
do have the ability to do that in the
next category up you know in some of the
other other services available from
Oracle similar story for apex we patch
we upgrade we do the configuration you
get apex works but actually multiple X
workspaces it's very similar to what
you're familiar with but if you wanted
to fundamentally change the architecture
the way apex is install and configure
like change from running on OHS to
running in PL sequel gateway or some
such thing no that's the sort of thing
that we take on ourselves in a fully
managed service like X Day Express so
Neil's does that answer your question
speak up
feel free to talk I see your chat
messages coming in ok we've also added a
bunch more
welcome tour video
I'm going to show you that in a second
so we've got a nice little youtube
playlist video series that walks you
through common things you want to do
next to express the goal is to really
make it as easy as humanly possible to
use this to get up to speed with it
quickly and get productive as an app
developer immediately and this welcome
tourist series really helps with
anything so we added one from about
nodejs another question coming through
okay Neil Neil says he has no microphone
here okay alright so there's some things
we've been doing recently that's pretty
much it as far as slides are concerned
if you remember nothing else from that
short rolling to her these are the two
things to remember then welcome to our
videos you can literally click Play and
you get you know full end-to-end demo
you know live recorded demo oxa to
express and get it you know you get a
broad exposure to different
characteristics of the service all in
like 25 minutes or less and each one is
divided up into a short five-minute
segment so let me just show that really
quickly welcome to local database XD
Express cloud service pause that okay so
this is a quick look at the Welcome tour
in overview setting the password
enabling client access setting up a
client creating a schema loading data
from by hurting from schema service
exporting and importing or aka backup
and restoring to Oracle storage cloud
believing about building apex apps quick
example demo connecting from a Java
environment and building a Java app this
particular one it's using the Java thin
driver and we're connecting from
NetBeans I recall correctly but you know
similar concept with some of the
concepts for any sort of Java connection
connecting from nodejs this uses the
brain
new node Oracle db2 Iver so we just
released quite recently
version 2.0 a major upgrade of the node
driver for Oracle and this is a video
hot-off-the-press that shows you how to
connect using the new driver and then
this shows you little bit about how to
get multiple instances how you can push
things from dev to test to QA to stage
to prod all using this free bundled
developer cloud service that comes with
your ex today Express so some cool video
is there we continue to add to this
playlist if you remember nothing else
I'd go take a look at a playlist run
through it and like 25 minutes you're an
expert or close to it also free credits
whether you're a customer a prospective
customer and Oracle employee you know
someone in the Oracle field this is
something you should know about Oracle
has this free trial program you get 300
bucks for free and you can spend it how
you will exit Express participates in
that so it's a great way to do a no-cost
trial of this service and with that
that's pretty much it for my structured
presentation so let's how many people do
we still online so we got three people
we had 22 people registered just as of
this morning so except we lost a few to
figure that out for those of you who are
online I would love to take some
questions feel free to to jump in when I
dropped open the zoom here so get niels
samara smart and it looks like a little
kiss dropped off okay so what do you
think how is that
anything leap to mind alright looks like
we goin
Neil's visitors between non metered and
universal credit services and in the
latter the difference between
pay-as-you-go and monthly flex okay
great question so you know when a local
jumped into the cloud a couple years
back it was for the most part it was
with these non metered services where
you just pay for a month of service and
you know everything's billed monthly
regardless of how much you use hour by
hour it's like a more like a monthly
subscription we call it non metered and
you may have bought that monthly
subscription for a year or two years or
three years or four years and may or may
have got may or may not have gotten a
discount on depending on how long it was
from here for your Oracle rep that's you
know essentially how it was back in the
old days after that we launched metered
services where you can buy things by the
hour and just kind of pay as you go and
most recently and this was just last
fall we've launched this universal
credit program where what you mean the
way I think about it this is my
personally it's kind of like gift cards
you're buying Oracle gift cards and then
you can spend those credits on you know
whatever pass I ask service you want to
spend it on whether it's Exadata Express
or Exadata cloud service or you know DB
CS or some storage cloud service some
other thing it gives you it empowers you
the customer you know you're getting a
lot more flexibility customers don't
always know exactly how much Express
accident Express they want to consume
you know once in advance or storage
cloud service they want to consume
months in advance or this is that I mean
it's in it's unfair to expect customers
to to have planned at that level of
detail long in advance every single time
of course you're just you're essentially
just buying credits that are durable and
flexible and that lasts and that you can
spend on whatever you want and excellent
Express participates in that program now
when you actually use the credits to
consume a service the credits are burned
down at a rate prescribed by the service
right so much some services are less
expensive than others other services are
more expensive than others some services
you know scale and discount in a certain
way other services you know other ways
and this is not unique to Oracle you
know pretty much every cloud works that
way you know that everything is priced
exactly the same across every service so
once you have the credits you go look at
the rate card for that service and you
can kind of see how you will be billed
for each hour that you've spent on that
certain by the way this is hourly if you
want to do the monthly computation you
take that hourly price that is published
and multiply it by 744 number of hours a
month in a 31-day month I recall
correctly so we published these hourly
rates we published the rate cards you
burn down the credits based on the hours
you use and page ago versus month
effects so there's actually on the rate
cards there's actually two columns
there's something called page you go
which is the base price it's you know
arm's length transactions I just I want
a couple hours hero on a couple hours
there no commitment you know you don't
have to have any kind of relationship
with the work all you know just by a few
hours pay pay as you go and that's the
base price and then there's another
column published which is monthly flex
where if you you do have some kind of
relationship with Oracle and you're
spending some amount of money on Oracle
cloud generally as is often the case
then you get a discount and I believe if
I recall correctly I believe the
threshold is a thousand bucks a month if
you spend a thousand bucks a month on
anything
Oracle pass I asked then you immediately
are in the second
of the rape card you're in the monthly
flex which is typically a lower price
and then the way that works is as you as
you spend the credits and consumer hours
know at the end of the month Oracle does
our accounting and you know we figure
out what was spent what wasn't spent you
know what on the different services how
much you know how much revenue Oracle is
making and you know how much we allocate
to each particular service so it does I
guess there's some benefits to Oracle in
a sense that it simplifies our
accounting a little bit but I think you
know I think probably the big benefits
are just durability and flexibility for
customers who we don't necessarily know
exactly what services they're going to
even for what duration in advance
Knossos answer your question hopefully
that was enough level of detail I should
mention too on top of the monthly flex
if you are interacting with an Oracle
salesperson I believe there are
additional discounts that the Oracle
salesperson is at liberty to provide
depending on monthly spend and duration
of contract and you know you can get on
top of that flex discount or if you're
spending anything you know you get some
modest discount I think on top of that
you can get additional discounts and
that's the sort of thing you know you go
talk to your Oracle rep about that okay
next question what will happen if data
transfer maximum is reached
eg 120 gig per month for Exadata Express
X 20 okay that's a great question so in
our rate card alone with the prices you
also you also publish some specs you
know what do you get for each of the
shapes so you see the rate and then you
see the different shapes and you know
the rate for each shape and what you get
for each shape the next date express X
20 you get 20 gigs you can consume up to
one core of Exadata you get a certain
amount of RAM you get a certain amount
of bandwidth that's another thing that's
unique about actually expresses the
inclusive pricing with express we in in
the interest of making as simple as
possible we just threw it all together
like we don't charge you separately for
bandwidth and separately for storage and
separately for the CPU and RAM it's all
in and also includes support by the way
it includes you know Oracle support
account number and mas access and you
24/7 access to Oracle support all in one
price so on that rate card you will see
a column about bandwidth and 4x20 it's
120 gigs per month that's ingress and
egress and this is kind of our target
now all that said I will tell you our
enforcement of that cap is not super
duper strict like if you you're getting
to a hundred twenty gigs in a month and
you're just about done and you cross the
threshold to one hundred twenty point
one gigs are we immediately going to cut
you off of course not you know that
would absolutely make no sense early so
our enforcement of that is it's not
strictly automatic and it's not super
strict we do monitor that by informal
means and as you might expect we have to
have some caps you know some things that
are published to to insulate customers
from potential you know abusers we have
to have some kind of caps but we monitor
we monitor it using some informal means
that I can't go into too much detail on
hot and we're not going to cut you off
if you go from 120 to one 20 point oh
one or some such thing you know that's
that's about what you get if you go way
way over that then you might get
contacted and there might be some
jeopardy of something happening whether
if you're within that range in general
you'll be fine
a little bit about the bandwidth
component of the shape and it includes
ingress and egress that I mentioned that
it's okay nil his answer your question
that's a great question actually we do
it we do get quite a few questions just
about pricing and shapes and specs and I
can understand that it's the cloud can
be a little bit of a bewildering place
you know especially if you're you're
looking at the AWS world and you know
you're trying to rationalize what you've
seen in AWS with Oracle's simpler model
or you're trying to rationalize with you
know other other vendors out there it
can be a little bit a little bit
daunting but you know we try and make it
as simple and easy as possible many of
our customers are in direct contact with
reps who can can give you all the
details typically at a moment's notice
they're quite eager to do that but we
try and make it as as plain as possible
just with information we publish on the
site too you have any questions about
this we go to another link chat
cloud.oracle.com slash database and this
is everything Oracle database in Oracle
cloud the different services that are
available the features the pricing the
different categories if you have
questions about the pricing click on
this tab and you can see exadata Express
and schema service these are the two
that are in my patch will click on the
next data Express and this is your we
close this window this is your
definitive look at the different shapes
the specs and the two columns with the
prices
you know the the pay-as-you-go for
anyone who wants a couple hours here and
there this is the discounted monthly
flex if you're spending even though you
know a modest amount in Oracle cloud
I believe the threshold is currently
$1,000 $1,000 if you're an enterprise
you're spending $1,000 a month on
anything or uncle you'll get this price
on the rate card this column right here
the part number useful for actually
placing orders processor storage memory
data transfer this is the original non
meter that we we talked about flat
monthly subscription Christ for next 20
but I know we tried to lay it out as
simply as possible in a little tabular
format maybe there's opportunities to
refine that a little bit make a little
better known input in that regard let me
know okay
other questions if not we can end early
let me just go back to the chat all
right I'm not seeing any other questions
over chat the audio line is quiet oh I
see a question over chat I did that
night okay
so that price seems even cheap for
private persons to use with universal
credits 36 euros yeah I mean it's
absolutely exadata Express I think is
it's not just an enterprise product you
know it's absolutely suitable even for
Soho in a small office/home office
individuals nonprofits NGOs local
governments you know I think a whole
range given that price point it really
does open it up to a whole range of
customers even some some shall we say
non today
Oracle customers UK as a private person
grab one of these a very reasonable
price and you know stand up your own
Amex apps very quickly running in the
cloud no machinery no capital investment
run it in the cloud on Exadata Express
and and very quickly stand up some apex
apps so yeah good question it's I think
you're right to point out the price
point is even reasonable for private
private persons okay so I'm going to
wrap up this edition of p.m. office
hours if there are no other questions
none of a head start for our very first
one ever we'll do this again feel free
to come back and join next time invite
others who you think may be interested
and we'll we'll see you again in a month
