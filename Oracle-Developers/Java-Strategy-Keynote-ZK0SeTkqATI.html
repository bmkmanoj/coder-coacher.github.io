Sheriff Chandler
good afternoon we're back in moscone is
that a good thing that's a great thing
thank you so welcome to Java one if this
is your first time here welcome back if
this your multiple time here and I know
all of you are here to immerse yourself
in technology to learn to make
connections to collaborate but we're
also here to have some fun too so we
thought we'd do a little bit of some
highlights for you to take advantage of
while you're here going through the
multiple technical sessions you'll be
slogging through between tomorrow and
Thursday so what you see here on the
screen is something contributed from the
community called my matrix it's a
collection of images that all of you
have sent in many of you thousands and
thousands of images that are being
represented in a three-dimensional
fashion in our Java one exhibition hall
so we encourage you to come by take a
look see if you can find your photo of
yourself or your friends or some old
faces it should be an interesting
experience and how do you start java one
besides a keynote well i think the fun
really starts tonight and that's at the
party so if you don't have plans you do
now come to the Oracle reception there's
a Java lounge they're all of you can
connect have a beer have a beer have a
beer there you go and if you find me
I'll buy the first round also new this
year as many have been to many
conferences everyone likes to know the
feedback how was the session was it
interesting to me did I like the speaker
did I like the content and sometimes
it's hard to translate that feedback
back into the hive as they say well this
year thanks to our friends partners and
the ecosystem at canoe where the canoe
guys where's the canoe family I see you
here somewhere
they are they've implemented a new
voting system for us so when you're
exiting your session that you've
attended use this mechanism press the
button interact with it was built using
Java what better technology score your
vote how you liked it that way we know
which sessions you liked which topics
you liked which speakers you loved so
please don't forget to do that as you
exit the session now Tuesday night is
pretty exciting some of you might have
seen this last year and because it was
so popular our partners in the Oracle
technology Network program has brought
back the ignite talk program now she's
never been through this it's a sight to
see who's been there someone's seen that
it's 20 the entire program is a
fast-paced slides driven you'll have 20
partly 20 speakers that will be coming
up this slides auto advance and so every
20 seconds you'll see a slide come up
and a slight go down and it can be on
topics that are technical it can be
telling topics that are personal the
whole point here is to have some fun
trust me you're gonna have a lot of
technical information thrown at you this
week and you need to give yourself a
mental break and I highly encourage you
check out the Ignite program so if
Stephen chin is here Stephen thank you
thank you from the otn team for bringing
this back this is a great element that
we have returning here at javaone now
Tuesday night Duke's cafe you have to
stop by right here on Taylor Street the
null pointers are playing where's the
null pointers where's my band they're
not here yet the band did not show up
okay so some of you may not may not know
the null pointers it's a community-based
band of Java programmers that are going
to come out in Jam we're also going to
do the Dukes choice awards ceremony and
announce this year's winners so many of
you submitted your proposals in terms of
your innovation in terms of some
creative ways and approaches you've
utilized Java and will be expressing our
thanks to those winners this year and
