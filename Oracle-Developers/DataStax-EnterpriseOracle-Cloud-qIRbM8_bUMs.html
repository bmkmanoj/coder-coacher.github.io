stationed in Silicon Valley California
I'm a partner architect at data stacks
today I will talk about how to run your
apps cloud apps at any scale with data
stacks Enterprise on Oracle cloud so my
role is about an architect so I develop
and manage technical partnerships and
Oracle is one of my very important
partners in the cloud space so what I
want to talk about today is whose data
facts
can I ask can you show me your hands of
how many of you have heard about data
stacks great ok how many of you have
heard about Apache Cassandra project
alright great so we are the company
behind the Apache Cassandra project and
just to give you an overview today on
who's Bay effects and I will talk about
the data management evolution and how
the Apps has been changing the data a
management landscape right and also talk
about data facts you know in general and
we dive into some of our very basic
architecture and we also will show you a
demo I put together a demo using
telephone to provision of data stacks on
Oracle parameter cloud and I will wrap
up with some you know takeaway means if
you want to learn more about data facts
you want to learn more about Apache
Cassandra and we have some free online
training so let's talk about who's data
facts so we have been rendered by Gunnar
in multiple quarters that we are number
one in multiple category and categories
for operational database right we I know
sequel Cassandra database right and we
also ranked by for the top 100 100 cloud
companies by that we mean we are very
very thin in the cloud so we built the
data management
I picked a data platform to support
cloud application at any scale and today
we have about 400 employees and we are
you see with the funding we still be a
start-up and also we have a huge leap of
customer today we have about 500
customer you can see some of the big
names there like you know
Netflix and also summing and Target and
Safeway a lot of big companies using our
product in production and we have some
customer using data specs
Cassandra write our version of Cassandra
for three years 100% uptime and let's
talk about the evolution of database
data management so fact you know three
or four decades ago right um the main
computer environment most mainframe way
so then we started to move to a
client-server model and at that time you
know Oracle and today's to the king of
the out DBMS right Oracle provide the
best L DBMS database and and people
starting to run a database on a
standalone server in a networked
computer or server then environment
change right um application and data
management requirement change and they
need a new type of database right and so
the Apache Cassandra project was started
like in 2008 by two engineer in Facebook
and later on become a top level right
Apache Apache Cassandra project in 2010
and you know our company actually this
behind it which provides for the version
of Cassandra then customer are trying to
deploy a database right in a Hydra cloud
environment right meaning they want to
run the database like part of it in the
private or the old private cloud
datacenter right and part of the cluster
they want to run in the public cloud and
we call hybrid cloud and Apache is
designed in the book from the ground up
that is very scalable and very low
latency but if you have a single cluster
right you have many looks like
note is in your own data center
somebody's far away in the public cloud
and we can still provide very low
latency by design and later on as
requirements keep changing and customer
want to support many different type of
use cases right they want to have a more
customer centric application we need to
provide a customer 360 capabilities from
the data management right and also we
need to provide personalization and
other entity for anti-fraud capability
and for more general use case by IO T
and other identity management and supply
chain and they need to have a big very
big database to handle by the billions
of Records right in the data systems in
data management systems and we our
company is positioned right to provide
all its support these use cases two days
to look at data facts we're not only
providing the Apache Cassandra we also
have the analytics from this back
project we also have search from solar
project and we also have added a
database a graph daily base a graph
database and some companies since we I
detect Data Platform space and people
are trying to compare the other big data
platform like Hadoop ecosystem right and
for the Hadoop ecosystem right so they
can only give you the insight the data
insight right up to maybe hours or maybe
dates right because you have to load the
data into the Hadoop file system right
in the first place but the uniqueness of
data stack is you can run analytics on
the real time Cassandra database so you
can actually generate the most valuable
data up to this moment
and we talk about data management s talk
about apps so how apps also evolve to
the past couple decades back in 1990s
right the time server was the dominant
architecture right people with the Sun
medical system pushing like the
client-server model meaning you know we
can sell at multi t application
architecture right web server
applications here using probably
WebLogic tomcat whatever right and then
we have a L DBMS back-end right and then
by the turn of the century in early 2000
internet and whack were getting
mainstream right meaning a lot of
company trying to go online right some
company want to try and set business
with the customer I'll give you a couple
examples like airline companies like in
early 2000 they starting to be selling
right ticket ethic online right with the
customer you don't have to go through a
travel agency you can go to the American
airline example right to purchase a
ticket and then fast forward to today
like I think many of you have a sample
and your cell phone probably connected
right to the internet meaning we have a
lot of connected device and also the
home appliances some already IOT enable
right so your device and you applying
the same data back to the centralized
servers right so that company can
provide you with more and better
services and more recently like Google
over a lot of these companies trying to
build self-driving car and this car
right this vehicle it to be connected by
so that they can provide a better
response right in the event of any
situation will come up so database is
behind like the application need to
provide the data management right and
database same thing where they're based
change so we talked about deleted algae
biomass are in the client-server model
right in 90s and then in around early
2000 because company trying to put
application online right so they could
easily have a hundred or maybe thousands
of customers like trying to
connect to their web you know portal
right real-time meaning you need to have
a bigger database right at that time you
meet 2,000 like some I'll DBMS vendor
started to provide some technological
shouting right Charlene is trying to
beat your fiddle to me it's kind of beat
repeating the existing I'll be there as
database right to be able to manage
larger table large larger data sets
right but they can only scale so much
like then today let me talk about cloud
right transfer to today right we have
billion of devices right meaning we
generate many buildings of data records
right is every single second so we need
to have a new type of database and
cassandra is the next you know
generation no sequel database can manage
billions of records database data
Cassandra can scale hundred or thousands
of nodes in a single cluster so let's
define what is cloud application because
we a position to provide the best in a
data platform to power cloud scale
applications so next time I mean the
common conversation when people say hey
are you building a cloud scanner
application this is how are we define
right you need to be contextual means
you need to provide the most relevant
data right and also always be on time I
mean sorry are always on and real-time
and your system need to be extremely
distributed instance of different
geographies right yesterday our still
California with myself and today depend
right so meaning you need to be half a
district architecture to support your
data meaning I still with my device I
try to access my data I have the same
latency I should have a same as one time
and need to be able because cloud apps
is put on in the in the cloud meaning
you can have to be able to scalp to
manage millions of you online users and
also be able to scale back
so data facts and the price right
provide the most comprehensive and
single and unified right data platform
to power cloud applications at least
call right we provide in the center of
step diagram we provide the support and
certified version of Apache Cassandra
and then we also support different data
models if you have a simple data model
you can use a key value pairs right and
or you have a document type data schemer
right and you want take and you can
define your data as JSON document and
also if you are more traditional more
tabular like data structure we can use
create because secure table right in
Cassandra terminology and we also have
added a data and graph database is 100%
thinker pop compliant means use the same
Greenland right cool language and to
accrue and create a graph and we wrap
among all these good features like with
enterprise capability enterprise means
we need to provide enterprise-grade
security right off the box
we provide LDAP Active Directory
Integration meaning someone authenticate
access the database the application need
to access database where you can get you
go through the LDAP tour company ap our
identity management server and they also
provide other advanced feature like NFI
search with the solar project and also
the enterprise analytics community and
run image Spock streaming right chops
and spark jobs and anytime and we also
provide other type of enterprise
you know features so let's talk about
how it works inside in the Cassandra I
mean Cassandra cluster so let's define
some of the technical terms here so a
note a note is a single data set
Enterprise installation right meaning we
have the software right either to
package install or title
put on a Linux machine or virtual
machines or in Oracle cloud and install
it right that installation will be
single PS e note any consist of again
Cassandra database right and also have
all the bits of the search product
analytic part and also the graph so it's
up to you to turn on the flag even turn
on the flag for graph and it is an
ethics means it's a spark ready and also
graph ready for that note and that's how
I was rack so since when people use
Cassandra write a product they normally
create a large ring of cluster meaning
at least three right and then can scale
to hundreds right easily so then you
don't want to put all you know on a
single rack right meaning if that
whackos goes down right and all the
whole the whole cluster is down right
you can access of data anymore
right so meaning you have a way to
create logical grouping of rack meaning
hate these three notes and no physically
on this rack and labeled it so meaning
our algorithm is smart enough if I
create we call that occasion factors so
let me define ones verification factor
here to replication factor means how
many copies of that piece of paper I
want to replicate I want let's say our F
equal three replication factor equal
three that means I want three copies
right so since if you define the rec a
label means we will store the data on
different physical racks that's free
copy will be evenly distributed but if
one server goes down you still get
access to there from our cluster a very
smart design and what is data center
based on a concept is another logical
grouping you can define meaning ways to
create that usage of their center is for
geographical distribution meaning you
can define in a single cluster way this
is all in this nice vision of the cloud
and this is on the west region of the
cloud right that means when you wire
your applications right I'll use our
drivers right after it's connect to the
database so say you can define data
center aware a group strategy so we
always talk to detail center right if
they stay so it goes down like our
drivers find enough
talk to the other available data center
to give you a higher moral decision
write to your applications so your
application can stay on always on write
the application can stay always on a
cluster is a final the logic now the
largest units meaning it can contain
multiple data centers right when I call
we have the East and West Bay Center but
these Tuesday is going to belong to the
same cluster you can manage a single
unit and particularly every note in the
inter cluster performed exact same
function right meaning they would do
with and right right all we can write at
the same time right meaning they all
function at the same time you give you
the high performance and next how to be
providing the scalability our
architecture is masterless architecture
that means there's no master to fail
right so every node perform exact same
function is one node goes down the other
we take our enemies will react to serve
the data but more importantly the
leanest capability is about as your
application grows right meaning you need
to support more transactions per second
and all you have to do just add more
node well add more no means we would
evenly distribute the data meaning every
node we actually pretty much manage the
same data size meaning we can really
scale unlimited there are no single
point of theta I talked about earlier
meanings if one note in this diagram
right let's say that note has a copy the
black note and 70 and 60 has repeat at
the same piece of data like multiple
copies if so happen that note goes down
meaning which there are two copies right
so available so application your
application I'm aware of that the other
note is done right
so as a developer you need concern about
you know because I'll trust already take
care of high availability and finally
I'll talk about is the the white house
right right path means how we prevent
data lost at the way when you're trying
to application trying to write your data
right you want to save some data so
first of all we save the data on to we
call commit lock is the persistent disk
meaning you save persistently on
business right and then we also store
the same piece of information on the
main table main table is in memory and
after three of the men table will flush
the men table to the admissible table
and mam tables on disk but that's how we
can provide persistent data store let's
say in the event of hardware failure
your bf will crash right and your mem
table is not full yet right you haven't
flushed but we keep everything in to the
commit log next time when we when we
start up the server right we play the
commit log so we rebuild a mem table so
as that lamb table get to next time
we'll flush try to the immutable as a
table and so they're different data
model pair Center a topology model to
deploy you know we support earlier set
multiple days I think I talked about
this in the earlier meaning if you have
the client right connecting to one data
center is that a phaser died went oxygen
the other data center is all building as
a developer doing is concern about the
topology so we should have your arm
status tax administrators right and the
data architect by all you know configure
studies or upright for their Center so
when you write apps
you just have to say hey I want to talk
to you this Costanza cluster they will
take care of the rest
and you provide very flexible deployment
model meanings we have customer
deploying they affect a single dataset
cluster right partially in a in-house
private cloud and also into the external
public cloud and they designed to do
and what is hot and spoke people may ask
me on this diagram on this slide how
pens book is one other enterprise
features called advanced fabrication let
me give an example I think that would be
easier to understand if the if you have
a supermarket right chain and you have a
data center and collect all the ladies
central transaction record right and
each supermarket issue function like
independence to have the own base of
record right so meaning for awareness
replication means you can schedule at
that data to be a propagating right to
the master you know data center right in
lady basis meaning advanced fabrication
is B hop is the main data center the
spot means going out to the most cluster
so in this setup you'll be running
multiple clusters as pasta so let's talk
about how our customers normally use our
product so depending on data
requirements right they do not have to
use all the you know data schema
features we don't have always to use
grass but if you have highly connected
data you just go up like I will
encourage you to use graph it's more
efficient way to store the data and then
you know customer would actually build
different data schema right using
different technologies here and then
they may also have turned on search
because they want to search right they
want to provide the search on on the
data right - based on ranking and then
they can also turn on hey I'm on channel
analytics so I can run ad hoc queries
and also can run some spot jobs your
batch job so I can get some insights
from the customer data right on
Cassandra database or like aside the
database in for some customer before the
use data stacks they have Ayutthaya
effects as a no sequel database right
and they set up a separate solar cluster
at the end of the day they have to
manage two clusters right like one is
solar and also the use case laws they
want to use the solar to actually in
there
slide the data from because I'm the
database if they have set up a two
separate cluster and I'm talking about a
data stack search cluster it's a generic
solar cluster search cluster so they
have do the data load they have to do
the ETL right from the croissant data
set Cassandra cluster and move the data
then then they have to run the index
right on those nearly up use of the data
so that we have to do a lot of work
right but with data stack we have the
light indexing features meaning if you
define that table to be indexed right
then once you update a table with fresh
you know the index automatically that
means you have one single cluster to
manage with search and Cassandra
together and also you don't have to do
with the ETL itself analytics is about
the spark I talked about can run spark
jobs right and or any airhawk URIs or
even be support spark streaming and
graph is mainly for highly connected
data meaning in the case you're building
a clarification my facebook my facebook
to see you have friends or friends and
lot of connect relationships right
meaning they can be readily and also
edges right to represent the
relationship between each data objects
and it's great for customer 360 appetite
application and providing recommendation
meaning if your friend trying to buy
something and he has some good review
and your other friend is probably want
to know about that product and that kind
of recommendation but you can easily
implement through a graph database and I
thought about our security right so
meaning if you want to put your cloud
application right meaning you want to
have enterprise-grade security means of
the buff to support I said LDAP ad
already there and also it's about curve
rules especially including the public
cloud environment and then we provide
transparent data encryption what does it
mean so as a developer right so you
basically write the ctrio statement
right here and try to update
your data on we today I mean updated
data inside your data so when you insert
the data eventually the data stolen this
right you want to encrypt the data right
so to this part developer doesn't need
to know is when you create our tables
you'll be fine
I want to encrypt the data at rest
meaning when it eventually gets stored
on disk so we already encrypt so to
developer and totally transparent that's
why we call transparent data encryption
we also provide a lot of data auditing
perform importing applications and we do
it through lost lots of Jake interface
and we also provide bunch of tools right
tools means for developer and also for
people need to manage a hundred look
under customer you need something they
help you to manage a session that big
size of cluster and we provide a driver
like our code library everyone every
database vendor need to provide the
driver for the application developer
right to access the data management
systems and we provide a large variety
of findings if you happen to be a note
of Jas developer right we have binding
for you if interest in building Python
or Java type application yes we we also
support it is the which has which set of
bindings we support and we also be love
intelligence intelligence into the
driver I said earlier right meaning if
you define data center where it means
your driver we always try to talk to
debt players and removing the cluster
right but you're also smart enough means
if that player seller goes down right
the application and talk to other data
center so they ensure you always gather
data and studio is ID right developer
this IDE right to be productive right
and this ID is the notebook
base type right meaning we also if you
want to build DAC graph you want to
traverse the graph and we also provide
all the completions because if
you try to run graph the first time you
experience at least my experience was
that it's so complicated is so difficult
to memorize all these extend dot
extension with all the complete I find
it extremely effective efficient then I
do my graph cruelly and for the same
studio we also support we just merge the
product I've used to cut that Center but
now everything under call studio you can
define your secure tables and also why
your CPM scheme secure payment is just
suitable do not know here secure
statement is just like SQL statement but
this is for our Cassandra table and
finally we also provided up management
tools called off centers off center or
give you a dashboard to monitor the
health of the data sets cluster more
than one can manage any number of
cluster as long as you add that cluster
to the dashboard then you can start
managing it and we provide you can
create create backup and these can be
started back up and we can actually the
destination can be s3 bucket or could be
a local server or NFS server starting
latest version 5.1 so let me show you a
quick demo of my latest work with second
okay you can see cool that's good okay
so this my latest effort to integrate
Deus Ex to Oracle telephone I mean the
bare metal cloud services I use
terraform terraform is supported by
Oracle I use the Oracle to telephone
provider so this is my github project so
I define a ribbon file which easily can
follow my instructions if you want to
really try and taste the flavor of data
stacks I would highly encourage you to
come to my project and just do like geek
low and only a single command line you
can speed up a twenty dollar 50 node
cluster and after that we can write some
simple program and shut access so let me
do a quick I mean a watchful of the
structure this file basically is to
setup your Oracle very meta environment
right every if you have access to Oracle
banner the cloud service you will have
these information you only have to set
those values in that file and variables
top CF file is one type of telephone
file you can define the variable use for
your project meaning there's certain VM
shaped ran or cocoa shape meaning the
size of their meaning is for CPU 16
gigabyte other shame a big CPU that kind
of stuff scales define all here and I
also leverage this file to problem user
for the input when I install can create
your data stacks cluster I want you to
provide your own password or you can
name your own random password here and
next we'll look at the it compute the
compute th top tier file is to define
the VM or bad metal in because bare
metal cloud service for point also VM as
well so the top one and defining the off
center of Center instruments and these I
need to provide the information you
could use my project a blueprint you
don't have to always the default data
cycle you have some other because some
apps you want to do you can follow my my
pencils and the further down I
actually define the instance to be
deployed in each availability d'Alene
Oracle provide 380 in each mission right
so basically I would have this line of
code right to deploy instant in each ad
the next one is the network file network
top TF is to define the network because
I want to make the deployment more
secure right because data facts is a
huge product right it's a huge data
platform product we need a lot of ports
leave these port your open so I defined
the port here and finally I set up this
subnet for in each availability domain
and this each domain will actually share
the same security leaks meaning to share
the same set of port open ports and this
is kind of if you after you geek on like
a clone my data project where you get
all this file next you need to run this
probably you have to put your value into
this fire and then mu-1 the source file
lets you have one telephone plant
platform friend is not from knees from
is a very generic terraform of command
so plan basically the build execution
plans so you can preview before you
actually deploy and you know i just want
to walk you through the execution time
they just produce basically it's about
12 elements while you need to create in
the oracle bare metal cloud and it
includes the creation of the subnets
right and security lists and also
becomes the compute right we need to
have like some virtual machine or babel
machine to be spun up and see the second
last line 12 means for this particular
privilege provision planned execution
plans you would create all resources
and now we're ready but that's why you
have to change from plan to apply apply
is really we asked a password again
right this is my database password and
next is I want one in each ad since we
have three ad so I'm creating a three no
clusters so now it's actually talking to
- the Oracle Bama - cloud service and
then we're spinning up and for the
interest of time I actually fast for it
normally take about 12 to 15 minutes to
spin up aid in cluster like 3 to 6 new
cluster about a same time because I do
in parallel
so after it's done and I make the file
let's call output PF file I defined in
my telephone project so to spit out the
IP address of the off center so I'm
showing you the off center dashboard
later but here I want to show you the
Oracle dashboard the Oracle clouds and
management console so you see there four
things created right to top the top
three are the DSC note the bottom one
here is the off center write the data
base data stack off center and let's
look at the network right so we in our
script we also create virtual computer
network where you give barcode call vcn
and you see the three subnet where I
create one for each a B and they all
actually share the same security Lisa
sure you mix I think you can see them
here
so he see that the port right I defined
in my telephone file is all initialized
in this environment so masculine so
ready to go if you have other type of
workload you want to you know need to
deploy or positions and you know borrow
my scrip and do the same thing I cover
like network storage and compute pretty
much is very usable and finally I want
to show you the off-center interface
it's going to these 8080 means as
benefitted domains not Active Directory
but I just call a V is ope se means
off-center so we grab the IP address and
open the browser and our standard port
is eight eight eight eight but it's
changeable you can easily change the
port this is a stainless - part of our
off-center interface and you see the
dream of cluster here right and if you
click on one of the node there you show
you the node level statistics right how
much memory we have 11 terabyte on the
disk and here you can perform any
Costanzo node level operation I want to
start the node stop the note or one
compassion or clean that will flush the
data right to the SS table from the mem
table that kind of operation actually
can be done on the command line of the
DfE node but then you have the SS X
right and then run the command but with
the OP Center it's the single pane of
glass you actually do all everything
here you only have to select a little
click on the node and you can actually
you want to flush all the men table to
the SS table you can all this can be all
done inside the UI
and I also talked about at least up or
other type of data management services
it's like you can create backup and you
start backup and not only you can run it
now but you can also schedule schedule
your backup you don't want to run the
backup during the day time you want to
do it like maybe right and left topic
because they would take some network
bandwidth all right so let me back to
so thousand people asked why my 10
effects on Oracle so then we see a bunch
of benefits when I work with my aqua
conduit to figure out hey why would I
care more customer to run their stats on
an Oracle cloud right in particular on
the cloud bambi the cloud or we find
that you know they provide the ad right
we call a variability so it's perfect
for Cassandra
because when people one concern I mean
our data stacks Cassandra they normally
run more than three notes like we want
to physically distribute them over
different ad because different ad may
have their own maintenance window and
it's easier to make sure we have always
a more predictable performance ready for
the customer application and they also
can adapt to their you know maintenance
window as well and for network BAM at
the top of available latency and a high
bandwidth which means we our database
right meanings if you provide better
network bandwidth meanings we provide
better food right at the end of the day
and same for the firm what a point
storage the local nbme is very unique
from Oracle cloud services for bare
metal services meaning the like very
fast fast drive right from CPU to the
disk to your program and means it's one
to one
you know proportioned relationship
meaning if you give me a best faster
this means I can support more you know
the database beaten by I all right so
meaning faster the better and also very
cost effective to deploy us on Oracle we
are expecting 11 times faster and 20%
cheaper when we compare to a private
customer data center and also to other
public long and finally next steps so we
have seen all I give you a kind of
high-level overview of who data factors
both our product does meaning we are not

Curie but all you want to run some
search job right then go to my github
project I mean - so we have this master
people called ESPN ESPN inside there you
can search for my two project one is for
telephone-based provisioning of BMC by
meta cloud the other is is that auto
compute cloud I use the CLI base

tradition and we also have a Oracle
marketplace listing meaning you can find
more information about data stacks
product finally if you want to just so
you got to learn about our product we
have llama free training you can go to
Academy data specs comm go to their and

and do the exact same thing and if you
want to challenge yourself even more we
have certification program after you
study you're good and you want to try
