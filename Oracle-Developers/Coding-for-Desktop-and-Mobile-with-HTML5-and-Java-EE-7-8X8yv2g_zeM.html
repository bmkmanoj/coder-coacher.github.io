about Java EE 7 html5 development and
how to do this for both desktop desktop
environment as well as mobile
applications so and Patrika I am a
member of the NetBeans IDE team at
Oracle so this is the standard safe
harbor statement so first let's look at
the kind of architecture of applications
that are targeting Java EE 7 HTML 5
you'll be talking about what it means to
be working for the desktop and for
mobile devices and finally we'll see a
bit of hybrid applications development
with Cordova so first let's look at a
sample app so this is say let me just
run this application using the debug
action and B so by the way how many of
you have attended the keynote on Sunday
okay come on e it looks like the
majority so you are already familiar
with this app it's the the chair's demo
application that was shown the the
keynote for those of you who didn't
attend and didn't know let me just
quickly walk you through through the
basic workflow so this is a kind of
multiplayer game or actually two-player
game where I I just put in my name and
password connect to a chess server and
now I see the list of games there are no
games so far and I can create a new game
and now I am Dwight and I'm playing and
I'm waiting for someone to join my game
and we can play together so I can make a
move
and we can see if someone trace but that
doesn't come later so but this is
basically the chess game that was
introduced at the keynote so let's look
at what what the code is like as they do
a deeper look at what the code is like
and what's actually behind that and how
it works so this is basically a maven
web application project which I have
basically opens through the open project
action unit means basically in means
whenever you have an open project when
you have a maven based project you can
just do open find the pom.xml and it
will open so it doesn't need to be
created by NetBeans initially any maven
project can be opened without any import
or metadata or nothing like that so here
in the webpages there is the html5 part
so this is the html5 client and here
you're the the Java EE 7 server and the
the code on the backend so one nice
thing about this setup is that when you
look at the source packages this is the
server-side code and the backend and
that's it you know if you if you are
used to some traditional server-side
frameworks and server-side templating
then this would contain both server-side
code as well as client-side controls and
things like that so that's not the case
here this is just pure server-side code
on the other hand the web pages is just
client site called well maybe with the
exception of this metadata in Babel but
basically that's one time I think about
setting the project structures this way
is that you have cleanly separated
the client-side from the server side so
you know in the properties we can see
that we can actually see some things
from from this property so if you look
at javascript files say it contains some
some JavaScript files on the back end so
on the front end so here is the knock
out framework which is used in this demo
how many people have actually no heard
of knock out okay quite a few here you
know I don't have any scss nothing like
that and deploying to GlassFish this is
a Java EE 7 app here is an interesting
setting that we will see in the see
later
so I am deploying women to the chrome
with NetBeans connector and I think
those are the important things in the
dependencies here we see that there
there is that there are the Java API and
some more APRs which are basically part
of the Joey 7 framework so let's go
again to the to this up and see see see
what it's you know now we would like to
another player to join but the other
player may not be using the desktop he
may be using a mobile device like you
saw in the keynote so this actually this
app is actually done the way that it
supports mobile devices is using
responsive design so are people very
very with responsive design looks like
mostly yes but basically what it means
that as I shrink the size of the window
it also shrinks the the keyboard and
this way it actually fits on the the
screen size for small devices there is
even even other way to do this here so
there is you see this not beans
icon here that's actually provided by
the NetBeans connector that we have
built specifically for Chrome and this
this corrector allows me to set various
screen sizes so I may want to when I'm
developing this application I want to
check using this this feature what it's
like so you may have have seen this
particular demo actually previously
because this is something that we have
introduced introduced in the previous
NetBeans release in 7-3 and so it's a it
has been there for some time
what's new in this case is actually the
fact that previously these features were
available only in the in the client side
project so previously you would have to
set up what we call the html5
application which contains just the
client-side sources no server-side this
what's new in NetBeans summer 4 is that
you actually have this project which
which is maven that we are all we all
like and our familiar with and we can
just develop both the client side and
the server at the same time and have the
same features for client side
development as before so let me actually
position this side-by-side with the with
the IDE now we can basically make sure
that everything looks correctly on the
on the screen so I can inspect your
enable inspect mode and what will still
do is that now I can select various
elements and when I when I select for
example this piece then
this will this will show me the CSS
Styles associated with with this with
this piece and you also see if you look
at that's for example set the font size
but here in in this gray area you see
that there is the it tells you what what
is right now the the media query that's
that's currently in a in effect you know
so as I as I change the size of the the
board this would show a different a
different media query so right now we
are basically this this editor is aware
of media queries so it knows what what
media query you are currently in and
what media query you need to change so
when I change the font size to something
else
it changes the the size of the pieces on
the board and I can play with it until I
like the size okay so let's go back to
because it is quite quite fine size so
and let's see now what whether this
actually works and whether this actually
looks good on on a mobile device so here
okay let me actually point out one more
thing before before we go there so you
see that this is all this is made
possible by the NetBeans connector we
have heard people telling us just kind
of anecdotal information that they are
bothered by this little bar and that
they don't like it and they want this to
be hidden and so you can actually do
that
if you go to Chrome
chrome flags and there is something like
silent debugging so if you enable this
silent debugging and restart chrome then
the the yellow yellow bar will go away
and everything will go for the same and
so that's just a small tip so let's now
see whatever it is actually works on a
mobile device and how it works so here I
can actually select various mobile
mobile devices and browsers so here is
the I can do an iOS simulator and these
all these devices in the all these
options in the top part have the deep
and Happiness integration so just as I
was doing the the live styling on the in
the in the Chrome browser I can do the
same thing in on the mobile device so I
think the simulator should be starting
soon okay there it is and you know you I
would show this with a real device but I
would need a Wi-Fi connection and that's
very flaky here so I am NOT going there
so again I see the same same page and
again I can
I can log-in connect create the game and
actually make changes make changes on
the in the layout in the layout through
the through the CRO collector that's
attached to my to my device so how I do
that in here is that I select this this
little button inspect Modi browser and
again I can select elements on the on
the page and change the properties
okay and I can now increase the font
size or decrease it and if your change
on the fly
so let's disable this again and so let's
now say that this other player will join
our game so the game is not there what's
wrong
okay I can make a move I just actually
joinder the wrong game I don't know what
why is that not so let's do it another
way let's just go back here
you're not sure but you can imagine that
you know what would happen is actually
that as I as one player player mode
makes moves on the on the board they
would show automatically on the other
players board so and so let's see how
this actually is is done and how this
works so what we can do is set a few
breakpoints or two in the code to just
walk through of what what's happening
and what's there so
okay
let me run this again from in Chrome
so let's connect to the server okay and
now we can see that the debugger stopped
stopped in in this method or in in this
JavaScript code so that's basically the
code that sends WebSocket messages to
the server sent back you know so this is
actually a message that the the that the
client has received from the server
using using that WebSocket so WebSocket
is standard API in JavaScript in motor
browsers so if you if you look at what's
okay basically this is this is something
that exists in in all modern browsers
and there is a standard API for for
doing WebSocket calls so let's continue
and now stopped again maybe make some
moves create game one more
okay and now it now it stopped in the
server side code so this is the server
side code in in Java EE 7 that basically
does WebSocket communication on the
server so you can see that this this
cloud is a chess server endpoint it's
there are some standard annotations for
that in Java
except socket package and there are some
standard annotations such as on message
on Clause which handle the WebSocket
communication with the with the client
okay so and this is just all the code
that handles the data and transferring
the data so one other thing that's
that's new in the in Java EE 7 is if we
look at the this class then this this
uses the Java is JSON API so this is
basically API that allows you to
construct j-jason messages and create
objects based on received generation
messages so again there is a API where
this you know basically this receives a
JSON object and construct a Java object
based on based on this object and
similarly you would encode in code Java
objects in in Jason
so basically WebSocket and json api are
the two two main api switch helped us
accomplish this application and this
workflow on on the server side so let's
again continue the program let me to
disable the breakpoints we are not going
to need them and one other thing that
you may see here below below is the
network monitor so this is actually a
component in the netbeans seven for that
records all the conversations that are
going on between between your browser
application and the server this this
actually may be any server not just the
server that you are a lot of running or
the Java EE server that you are running
on your local machine so you see that
there is a there are some headers here
basically which initiate the WebSocket
communication and then the the WebSocket
communication itself is captured this is
what are called frames and which are
basically sent impressive pieces of code
pieces of that data that go across the
wire know that there are no no headers
in this sentence receipt pieces so it's
very efficient communication very little
data transmitted and there is just data
going back and forth over the develop
socket communication so here is the
login process then there is a list of
games the board and so on and then there
are moves which each players made ok so
this this tool is very helpful in
debugging the communication between the
client and the server in the WebSocket
area ok let's look at some more parts of
the code there is this package called
called batch and this is using the new
batch API in Java EE 7 and what it is
used for in this game is I don't know
I'm not sure if you notice but in the
game you can join any game as an
observer for example so here are the
games and you can either join as a
participant or an observer if you join
the game in the middle while it sits
beyond being already played then the
server will initiate a bad job which
will basically send you all the moves
that have played being played so far so
this is implemented using the the batch
API so you see that there is a replay
game listener which basically uses the
Move reader and move rider again
basically these are the things that do
the communication and replay the moves
to the to the client and the whole the
whole thing is configured in in this XML
file which is basically the you see
there is a batch job
top-level element and then it lists
listeners you know steps chunks and
these are all kind of concepts that are
introduced by the new batch API so this
is another piece of functionality that's
useful in this console in this context
from Java EE 7 so let's take a short
look at the client side as you would
expect there is index.html 2 then there
is a there is this JavaScript file which
which basically does all the all the
logic so if you go to the navigator you
will see that the the navigator
basically displays the structure of this
of this javascript file which is kind of
hard to do from the kind of two
point of view javascript is a language
that's much more harder to understand by
tools then for example Java as it's a
time untyped language and it's kind of
unpredictable but I think I think that
means ID does a good job and basically
this is these are the objects used in
the the client-side part of the
application and when you look at the
HTML files of their attributes called
data bind which are basically part of
the knockout framework so you see that
there is document occult documentation
displayed here if you are interested you
can study this through the the NetBeans
IDE so all the all the documentation is
here through the new supporter for
knockout in 1974 okay so I think we can
close this now any questions so far
yes
so the question is whether the CSS
changes only were applied to the mobile
mobile section is that correct okay so
let me let me explain that so in the CSS
directory here there are several files
which are basically defined based on the
based on the media query so I think the
the media query are much already media
queries are defined but in any case
basically this is a CSS file that only
applies to the for not large size and
tablet large whatever and there are
several sizes you know so yes basically
when I was doing these changes it was
only modifying the particle file that
was currently in effect okay so let's
look at another application which is
kind of more which my colleague
colleague built and this is basically a
an alternate bens tutorial adapted to
html5 so it was originally written using
JSP and now this is the version that
uses let's run it again to see what it
does okay
so this this version is using the the
angularjs framework so how many people
have heard of angularjs okay
quite many how many have actually used
angular in in real project okay also
quite a few thanks so basically this is
a shopping cart application whatever the
standard you know very standard thing so
I can just go to to my categories and
you know here are some products you know
I can add them to the cart you know you
the cart checkout and so on so you know
let me clear the cart now and so let's
see what what this application
application source code looks like
and actually for that let's first look
at the this network monitor that we
showed before so you'll see that the
first a couple of requests from the
client to the server where actually
request to HTML files this is because
the angularjs framework let me just
explain this so the angularjs framework
has this index.html file but it called
it it works with the concept of
so-called partials and partials are
basically sections of the page that you
may want to load at some point so what
this means that basically when I when I
am browsing through this application you
know it looks like it looks like this is
a kind of new page that was posted and
when I go to one category this is
another page but that's not really the
case you know so in a traditional pay
application this would probably be two
separate pages two separate kind of
top-level URLs in this case this is
actually this still the same index.html
page it just loads different sections
kind of a sub modules so this is kind of
one sub section and the top page is
another sub section and the card is yet
another one so
that's why we see and so this this
concept is called single page
applications so basically it's a single
page
that's that contains pieces and that's
why it's single page applications let's
go back to the network monitor the next
thing that you see here is these rest
calls so basically this is a traditional
rest call that again includes headers
you know response so this is the data
that was received from the server and
the communication between the client and
the server is just through JSON over
HTTP there is no there is no kind of
content being being served this is just
pure data in in JSON format this the
third tab is interesting that this place
which shows the JavaScript call stack
that initiated this disk all of the web
service so you see that this came from
the angularjs framework and then
eventually I think we will see no not
here but even in some cases we would
also do of course our our code as well
if if this was an if the call was made
from our our our code and this is
clickable of course so so you can kind
of go to the source and see what's there
so how about the server on the on the
server side there is basically the the
traditional rest application using the
JAXA jax-rs API
starting with Java e6 this is the the
right way to do application
configuration so basically instead of
defining
rest services in web.xml there is a
various application config or this you
know subclass off of this application
which provides the configuration for the
forest services so you see that for
example there is this department service
which is basically a rest service that
reserves Jason and there is one one
method with a parameter and again this
is using the new JSON API in Java e7
that to construct the JSON response from
from the server to the client so nothing
too surprising here I think the one kind
of subtle thing about jax-rs
is that in the past I heard from many
people that basically did a base level
jax-rs api's are not sufficient for
real-world applications and that often
when they want to filter messages or
something like that they need to resort
to using implementation specific API so
you would have part of the code written
using jax-rs parts of the code
implemented using proprietary Czech
Jersey API or whatever your
implementation was the good news is that
in the latest version of just ours
namely to dot o which is available in
Joey 7 this set of standard API is is
much more enhanced and covered covers
basically the Danone the known parts
which which previously were only doable
through proprietary pis so basically now
many things and most things can be done
using standard code and you don't need
to use combs and jersey whatever classes
okay so
let's go back today to the client side
and see how we can for example change it
to to include something new so you see
that there is there is the this is the
kind of the entry point to the angularjs
framework so there is a dot data
ng-controller attribute again you see
documentation for foreign garages built
in built into the IDE and which
container which explains what what this
is and this is the actually control so
we can do control click to navigate to
to the implementation in JavaScript and
here we see that there is a this is a
control for for something so if you look
at the the page this control actually
controls this part this this upper bar
and it's rated this functionality so if
we want to do some changes like for
example we would like to show the total
total of all items that you bought so
far in in this label somewhere or in
this role at the top so yeah and they
said this kind of fun this is too long
so maybe we can just make sure it's a is
empty when I save then notice that I
didn't need to reload the browser the
the ID just took care of me of this and
reloaded the browser without me needing
to refresh refresh the browser so what
else
next we can define for example something
like a scope car total
and to key equals card total okay so we
we just defined another kind of variable
in in what is called scope which is
basically the thing that drive the kind
of model that drives our overview and
that that's kind of the data that we can
let you use in the interview part of the
application by the way show and that
means shows me some hint here so that I
should actually have triple triple Q
sign here so that means is aware of many
kind of fun JavaScript JavaScript good
practices and gives you hints to fix
some common common mistakes in your code
so if we go back to HD the index.html no
this is the wrong one this is the right
index.html then this is basically were
what what defines the the top bar so we
can do something like total and do an
expression and see car total okay and
now it says totally zero add some items
to the cart and it it updates itself
okay we can if we are not sure where
this is defined again we can do control
click and the ID brings us to to where
it's defined in the in the JavaScript
model so again this is kind of hard to
do in JavaScript from the tooling point
of view but in this works were quite
fine
okay so we have a few more minutes left
so let's let's go back actually to our
original application and see and talk a
bit about the Cordova Cordova hybrid
applications so where is her of Cordoba
before okay so not not many people so
let me just explain Cordova is a
framework that allows you to package
your application of your HTML
applications or html5 applications as a
standalone application that can be
published on the mobile mobile app store
and then downloaded or installed on the
device as a as a usual typical phone
application the there are several
advantages basically first you are
coding html5 so this is called cross
bound form everything will work the same
in Android and iOS and Windows Mobile
and all these all these things so just
101 code to to maintain one thing to two
code and you are you are you you have a
cross-platform application the other
advantage is that this the Cordova
framework provides some useful features
that are that are available on the on
the device so if you for example let's
actually look at a slide for use so
okay so you install it in app store and
tell here on the right you see some of
the features that that you can use with
from your HTML packaged applications
which are not accessible in the browser
like you can interact with the
accelerometer camera on the device
contacts list
you know geolocation you can see where
the device is there is internet
connection or not and many other things
that basically make your application
richer so when thinking about this this
chess application I would think like
what would be a nice enhancement that
would really take advantage of the phone
features so I was thinking it would be
nice if I you know say I am paying a you
know game on my phone with the chair
with the chess client I make a move and
the other player player doesn't respond
immediately you know so he may respond
in 10 seconds or 10 minutes or 10 hours
or whatever so meanwhile I put my phone
back in to back to the pocket and now I
would like to get some message or
notification like beep or vibration if
if the other play if the other player
makes a move so I can I can see and make
my move as well so this of course would
be very hard to do in plate playing
html5 running in the browser but it
turns out that the Cordova framework
allows this this particular case so
we'll look at that a bit later
so for now let's just look at first
let's look at this this application so
this is basically the chess client which
is just a copy of my application from
webpages here so I just took this
client-side part of the of the
sorry that's the wrong one of the chess
server application so from the chess
server I just took the client-side and
packaged this as a separate project I
even forgot to delete the Burbank and
but the the difference is that now if
you go to the properties of this this
application you can see that there is
this Cordova Cordova panel which allows
us to to control and configure our
application there are all the plugins
that we are using currently so you can
see that these are all the kind of
device capabilities that you may want to
use and here at the top again this is
the standard browser switcher but this
time basically there is a new column
called Cordova and we can just package
this application as a as a Cordova
application and deploy it to to either
iOS device or Android device or
emulators so again let's run this
application on the iOS simulator and
let's try that out to be here but
basically this is calling some
command-line tools that are provided by
by the Cordova Cordova project to
package your application as iOS
application we can look for example at
the if you look at the files you see
that there is something like platforms
iOS and there is the build output and
here is basically what it what it
produced for me and now I see that it
launched our simulator and and I'm
running this application as
as the as a Cordova Cordova project I
can do the same thing as I was doing in
the mobile mobile vest okay so for
example if I select the inspect mode
then I can start selecting elements here
and
and changing the font size so shrinking
down on empathy so so it fits on my
device and so on so basically all these
features that I was showing for Chrome
and for mobile web applications are
available also for for Cordova
applications here is basically the
browser dome which displays the real
real dome of the that's that's actually
rendered on the device and as I click
through various sections it kind of
highlights what what is the
corresponding element on the page okay
so turn off inspect old and just to
prove that this is very an application
not not just a web page running in the
browser you know so you see that there
is no address bar at the top and when I
press the home button then there is my
application installed on the device okay
so
yes so it that's actually in both cases
yeah so if you look at the these
browsers in this in this feature then
you see that basically the browser's at
the top which are have the the tight
integration that NetBeans are all WebKit
based you know sis so this is this is
the embedded browser WebKit browser
provided by the by the Java FX project
so I didn't talk about this yet but
basically if you have small screen if
you cannot afford to you know when you
work with Chrome then basically would
typically put the the browser on another
screen and have the application on you
know idea on one screen and did the
running application on another screen
but if you are if you have only little
screen si then you would find this
embedded browser and useful you know so
this will actually basically when you
set this I didn't actually prepare this
part so not sure it actually had maybe
there is actually some some things that
are not supported in the Rose browser
but but I think it supports most of the
html5 standard and yeah so it sounds
like that but you know the writing is
basically that if I don't want to test
this on the device if I and most of the
things most of the time I will I do
because for example let me go back to to
what I was talking about the the push
push plug-in you know so or push
notifications
so basically Cordova has several plugins
and one of this
Wow so it looks like I am not connected
to to Wi-Fi one of these plugins is is
called a push plug-in which basically
facilitates this this communication with
okay so here is the page of the push
plug-in which facilitates communication
with the push messages that you know can
can vibrate or beep in my pocket but as
I said you don't always need to need to
deploy on device so one one reason what
you know while you may need to just to
just to test out the device integration
capabilities when you just are testing
the the design or the functionality
that's not device dependent you can just
go back to Chrome and even though this
is a Cordova project you can run in
Chrome and they're actually web-based
simulators for for phones so there is a
there is one called ripple that's a
plugin for Chrome I can enable it for
this page and basically now I have this
the same page running in in this
emulator and I can I can set various
things and so on basically this kind of
is a step towards the real device it's
not just plain browser it's it's kind of
emulator that's once inside Chrome okay
so maybe you can now open open these two
questions
her
so you're asking about error handling
and I how I would who are handling in
the in the application okay so let me we
can maybe you can show this on this in
this affable beam application which
actually has some I think it has some
error handling built in but basically
the the up the frameworks such as
angularjs allow you to do error handling
as part of the base framework so for
example when I go to when I buy
something go to checkout and I'll try to
submit then it is telling me that name
is required and so and this is all
handled by angularjs you can can look at
the code but basically that's that's
part of this this checkout page yeah I
think there is a you can see that this
is it's some code for error handling
okay
okay so you are talking more about
questions like how to how to check for
connection reliability and check whether
this there is some yeah so I mean you
can you can of course continue to do
server-side ever happening and you
should also never trust any message that
that's submitted to you from the
Internet and basically when the server
receives a JSON message then it should
of course check its validity and check
the sender and things like that so
that's that's all doable within the the
Jersey framework and the jax-rs api I
think question there I'm not sure I
understand the question so you're you're
saying about SDK what kind of a decay so
the if you're asking about reusability
of the source code
okay
I think well you can you can package
this application as as a zip and then
use use some build server to to produce
the build for for various platforms is
that is that the answer or yes so you
can you can basically set up a bill job
that that creates the Android version
and the iOS version you know there are
some limitations like for example that
the iOS build can only be done on Mac
now so Apple basically will not allow
you to develop iOS applications on
Windows and tear vice versa you know if
you want Windows Phone I think you need
to you need to build those on on Windows
nothing else so there are some
limitations but basically this should
work and you should be able to do
countries built and your basically build
process for for multiple platforms at
the same time and I think there are even
some cloud services which handle this
for you and which which can pay pay for
and tear they basically do the build
across all platforms
okay yeah I think we have time for one
more question yes
the question is about security and how
to handle security I think that's very
no different from ordinary breasts calls
that you would do you know in in
traditional applications so I think you
you basically need to secure your rest
services that are that you are exposing
to the to the clients and there is no
difference if it's a breast call coming
from you know jsf client or html5 client
or you know native android client or
whatever they still need to handle
security on the server side on the on
the rest endpoint side okay thanks
everyone and we are done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
