welcome to our session remediating the
most common micro-services bottlenecks
and vulnerabilities I I am from the
Oracle cloud security and systems team
we were I work in the development
organization and one of the roles that I
have is to is to reach out to folks in
other kinds of communities that would
benefit from management capabilities
that Oracle provides and and so and so
I'm a management person I'm from the
management realm I'm not a developer but
we have on our side we have we have
investigated and that the things that we
believe are very compelling for people
who are trying to develop and deploy
modern applications and so the simple
message from someone in my world to
someone in your world is that modern
applications need a modern management
system and it's just that simple
but there's a lot of things that that
kind of get in the way of that
traditionally it's thought that
developers are really interested in
really want to do features functions
capability there that's what they focus
on and we know that but we believe that
now more and more that's changing a
developer before would would rely upon
folks in their operations side to make
sure that the application is performing
properly and also that it does not have
vulnerabilities that bad guys can use
against
the company when that application is out
there they can come in through the
application because of those
vulnerabilities but as a developer a lot
of people in the development world feel
that that's another person's
responsibility that's traditional but
that kind of goes against a couple of
things the first thing is is that
developers are very good corporate
citizens and nobody wants to put out
code that is not going to perform very
well when it gets in the hands of the
users or or is going to cause their
organization harm because it opens it up
for attack nobody wants to do that but
but the tools that are out there to do
that are need to be need to be better
and appropriate for this and a new new
set of management capabilities are
necessary in order to do that job
effectively so so I'm a developer side
the reason they can't do that so much is
that they don't have that ability at
their disposal there are capabilities
out there but they're really not there
then appropriate we believe for for the
development community we think there's
something a lot better the other thing
that's happening out there is is the is
the need because of a continuous
development and in continuous
integration or C DCI that is becoming
more and more the norm so that that
capability out there requires that
developers get into the operation side
of the business they are intimately
involved with the development and the
deployment because as soon as they
develop it it's out there so you have to
be on it you're going to be in the
development community more and more
involved in that and so it makes sense
to know what the really good good
capabilities are out there that can help
you manage and that kind of
ever-changing environment so
ever-changing in the sense that the apps
are constantly changing now so so
with the microservices capability though
it kind of brings out a little bit more
of a of a management issue and so we're
going to talk about those kinds of
things today and we're but we're also
going to talk about management in
general for for for code because in the
last session said hearta at the at the
very end if you were there he talked
about the need for that all of the
capabilities that Oracle is able to
provide and/or others are able to
provide to help you build code there's
still a management issue and usually for
the very end of that discussion so now
we're up a little bit more closer to the
beginning so though Oracle legal asks me
to put this little slide up there to
protect us and protect you in a way the
things that I'm going to be saying today
if they are associated to a product and
if you buy based upon that and they're
not in the product we don't want you to
do that so this is a warning this is a
kind of a statement saying that please
don't make purchasing decisions based
upon everything that I'm about ready to
say make them on examination of of the
product and the capability that that I'm
going to be talking about and we'll be
able to be touched by you in a lab to
our lab this afternoon I'll talk a
little bit more about that too so that's
where you really get into the into what
what we what we really mean here so when
I take what our agenda is pretty simple
I'm gonna I already said you know I'm
not I'm not a developer but I think it's
really good to frame the conversation
and to understand to understand what it
is to develop at cloud scale today and
I'm gonna talk after that I'm going to
talk a little bit about what the pros
and cons of a capability and modern
application development a framework
called micro services are more and more
being used at it's a small amount but
it's growing and we're going to talk
about some of the reasons why people are
adopting that framework and also the the
issues particularly the management
issues and then we're going to talk
about how we can address those issues
and I'm going to to talk about that in
the context of capabilities that Oracle
already has in the marketplace today I'm
gonna try not to be somebody that is
selling management cloud I'm trying what
I'm gonna try to do is talk about a
cable the capabilities that are out
there that you need to have regardless
of what management solution you decide
to select so let's go over a few terms
here so I think pretty much everybody
understands that micro-services is kind
of a style and architectural framework
becoming more and more it's loose
loosely defined and and it's actually a
very compelling in the sense that we're
taking so a capability or we're making
them more granular so it's basically
fine they refer to micro-services is
fine grained so a-- capabilities that
are totally self-contained so they'll
have database capabilities perhaps
they'll have other app server
capabilities use a whole lot of
components within that container that
they're developing and all of it is that
a self-contained all its ready to go it
that is is basically micro services so
on the on the development or on the
operations side we now have another term
that's that's coming into the vernacular
called DevOps it's been a term around
for a while
combines development and operations and
essentially it's the it's the marrying
of coding and and getting something to
the user that's highly performant and
secure and you know it and you're
managing it the whole time so that's
what DevOps does it takes care of the
before and the after all together
another arena that's
associated with DevOps it usually
involves the capabilities that are
resident within the kind of operations
capabilities that you need to manage
your infrastructure in your apps and we
call that IT operations management
another another arena within the systems
management area is security management
security and configuration that's what's
meant by IT ops management nowadays so
so those are the terms that that that
that we use to to talk about micro
services today in the in the sense that
DevOps is a real marriage of convenience
and importance we're going to talk a
little bit more about that so an
organization that's concerned with the
capabilities and the management of it
you know they're developing applications
that valo
some very important I guess you say
aspects of the lifecycle that the way
things are done in a more traditional
approach is that release cycles are not
as frequent as they are now with things
that are developed at a cloud scale
approach there's different kinds of
capabilities to get to get it into the
hands of the using community and and and
and there's a lot of flexibility in
doing that you're able to take and
deliver continuously essentially as I've
mentioned before this is very critical
in DevOps when you can develop and
release very immediately making changes
on the fly we've all seen our iPhones
and all know the apps and the versions
they change constantly now you don't
even know they're updated but that's the
kind of thing that exists today and in
the in in the in the application code
arena it's this kind of the same story
where you on the traditional side you
have a a known platform from what you
develop on at that
or whatever whereas in the more
fragmented approach that trends toward
microservices architecture you'll see a
different kind of framework that you're
using that that that that you could
basically use at will and change anytime
you want and at all levels of an
application as it's delivered from the
server tier all the way to to the user
interface so so these these open
capabilities that are out there make
micro services a real reality and that
approach toward a more fragmented
development and granular so of these
services when it comes to the data the
data sources I certainly can come from
Oracle but they're also now coming from
other kinds of sources as you see up
there when we get more to a cloud scale
architecture so an and on the
infrastructure side when when
applications traditionally are are put
out there they're not very frequent as
we've stated already but this but
they're pretty solid
they're pretty solid from a an
infrastructure standpoint they don't
change a ton but this is the rub in
these micro services develop
capabilities or fragmented approaches
where your infrastructure is all over
the place and it's it's a lot more
components a lot more entities out there
to keep track of it's changing all the
time so that's why we call it volatile
now when we talk about monolithic and
versus versus micro services monolithic
and Wexler's those are two very popular
frameworks today that are in operation
if you if you think about the example or
an example of what a monolithic
capability is versus of micro services
and micro services is Netflix that's a
really good example it that they based
it upon that for some very compelling
reasons as it relates to
number of devices that they had to
support so they adopted a more
microservices approach toward things
whereas a more traditional app or you
know development organization for
example like a to Oracle database is
more of a of a of a monolithic approach
toward development so both are there
both are always going to be around and
micro-services is a very small part of
that it's about 5% but it's growing very
fast so so that kind of hopefully gives
you a good idea of the differences that
we're talking about today as as we
develop applications at cloud scale the
reason why why people are using the
microservices style is is because of the
freedom that that they have available to
them the the 81% want applications that
are easily scalable 71% want to make
sure that it's fast
you know it's deployed faster these are
these are the reasons why people have
gone to micro services they they could
develop this using using the tools that
that are more specific toward the
function that you're trying to trying to
do because we remember everything is
more granular now it's it's it's told to
be a more manageable code based it uses
logic that's based upon the micro
service itself and not the bus that you
go to so your dis associated with that
there's a layer of abstraction there so
so so there's a number of really good
reasons that people have have wanted to
to develop applications that are
comprised of a suite of small services
around a certain business capability
that is independently deployed and this
is the kinds of things that are required
these are the kinds of capabilities are
required to embed into a micro services
application in order to make that happen
the the the other thought that I wanted
to convey to you is this debt we're not
really talking about the the client side
or the you know where you're where you
have HTML and JavaScript we're talking
about the server side of things that's
what we refer to as being monolithic so
so there's still flexibility and
adaptability at the front end but the
monolithic capability is is the is the
server based foundation and that's what
we're really really talking about when
when we make that distinction so so mono
monolithic versus versus micro services
and micro services being able to provide
flexibility and the freedom to develop
some some really amazing code I kind of
liken this if I if I may for a second I
have a picture of a Boston cream pie we
are we are in Boston and so I thought
that that's a pretty good analogy I'm
gonna try to make a little sense of that
think about the the major components of
a Boston cream pie are three things so
you have a you have a yellow cake that
that needs to be made completely made
not just you know the mixing of all the
ingredients in the and the putting it in
the oven but a complete yellow cake that
you can use as the foundation for for
your Boston cream pie app there's a
there's vanilla pudding on the inside so
you put it in between the two pieces of
yellow cake and then you cover it with
chocolate icing so those are three
things you have the pudding
the icing and the cake if you think of
those things in microservices fashion
that's pretty that's pretty cool that's
pretty cool because you got the you got
the flexibility if I want to instead
have a Chicago cream I don't know if
there is one but let's say that has
chocolate pudding instead then I'll just
go use the chocolate microservices
capability and and and I have that so so
this is the reason why a company like
Netflix decided to go this way Netflix
had I don't know how many devices you
know hundreds of devices they have to
support they used to have a monolithic
you know server approach toward tort
toward toward getting their app out the
door but as more devices were coming out
with the smartphone and things like that
that happened in the last ten years a a
desire by Netflix to lower the cost of
putting that into the hands of their of
their customers was was a very important
initiative by them so they spent a time
to basically reaaargh attacked that
aspect of their of their environment now
have a micro services based application
the cool thing about micro services too
is that is that the stuff is shared
Netflix shares a lot of their a lot of
the things that they that that they
offer to the marketplace and and and
they're they're available you know in
the public but there's also groups that
form and they you know within
organizations and they they keep it to
keep it within that group and they
develop micro services as well so it's
it's a it's almost like micro services
houses all over the place you know
supporting this so it's actually created
a very good economy if you will or will
as as the adoption and the need of it
increases but but as I mentioned
resident within the very nature of micro
services is is is complexity a lot of
complexity whenever you increase the
number of things that you've got to
start to manage the efficiency for that
given the current tool sets that you
have available to do that goes down and
that becomes a very big concern by
people in fact almost half believe that
in this new kind of architecture that
that is a critical concern you you
always have to make sure that that your
design principles are constantly
followed through you know to assure that
you're not going to get something that
looks like that picture
that's not a Boston cream pie so these
challenges are the fact that you know
resident in the very nature is the fact
that it is inherently complex it's just
a lot of stuff it's it's also very hard
to discover these services that are out
there it not so hard as it is to is to
do it efficiently because there's
there's an order of magnitude difference
or exponential difference in the number
of things that you've got to keep track
of naturally the testing complexity goes
up there's there's overhead for
decentralization of data all of your
logs and all of your information are
distributed you have to try to figure
out how to collect them all wherever
they're coming from so these are the
challenges that our resident within the
micro services framework so lots of
complexity and something that we need to
we need to address now here more
specifically are those are those issues
these are the issues that really prevent
effective management within micro
services first of all the we talked a
little bit about the distributed
architecture that's that's really hard
to get you're a real big challenge to
get your hand hands around effectively
it can be done there are tools out there
but when you consider that and the other
things that you have to do those
interdependencies mean that this problem
that you see distributed architecture
being difficult to debug will still be
an issue so even with utilizing other
other kinds of management traditional
management approaches it's hard to
define Layton sees within that because
you're going through a pretty complex
and to end transaction transactions it
it's the other the other thing is is
that I you know regarding logs is that
is that more things out there producing
more logs all those logs need to be
looked at
in their context in their proper context
if you're gonna manage the issue
properly but they're all over the place
you got to have a good way to manage all
that stuff that's critical security
that's another thing we were talking
about the vulnerabilities if your
application utilization of a new
capability opens you up for attack you
need to be ready for that that's hard to
that's really a difficult challenge to
do to instantiate security in the
development process is make makes it
even more of an oven issue
so so there's a number of different
things I can go through the rest of them
and and and talk and talk to you more
you have a copy of this presentation but
the kinds of things that we feel are
going to be needed on the right hand
side are the very kinds of things that
actually exist today they're all in one
kind of capability so we have a way to
discover the topology of an application
we have a way to make sense around all
those logs and group them together in
business transactions and look at them
see it the logs in their right context
as opposed to just all over the place
something that employs machine learning
machine learning algorithms to try to
find the issue or the concern of the
problem quicker then than it would be if
you had a bunch of spreadsheets to look
through a bunch of logs to look through
a security capability that that that
exists is is very important in
fundamental to not necessarily just to
see everything that's out there but to
be able to catch the bad guys before
they're able to do something bad so so
that's something that has to be
considered and and and so so the good
news is is that there is something that
exists out there as I mentioned and this
is the approach this is the kind of this
is the architecture that we that we that
we adhere to for for management nowadays
this is what Oracle has been working on
for
for a few years now and essentially it's
it involves a collection of information
if you look on the left-hand side of
everything that's going on in the estate
everything that's going on with your
application everything that is going on
with the infrastructure components
underneath it everything is is is
brought in to a cloud so we're taking
feeds from threats we're taking
synthetic user activity and real user
activity that clicks the transaction the
logs that are that occur from there
we're taking metrics from the
application layer and and bringing that
them up on on a cloud we are not only
are we doing it at the app level but
we're doing it all the way down into the
infrastructure level the combination of
metrics and logs makes it gives a
compelling thing when you tie it all
together so when you when you the rate
the way you tie it all together is you
use machine learning so machine learning
if we look at the right hand side allows
you to make that data intelligent and
it's all unified it's all up on a lake
if you will with with all of the
information about the estate and so that
enriched information is tied together
with machine learning the apps
correlated automatically you know that
that click that that user is making over
here on this screen is related to that
database operation that's what you're
able to figure out with a modern
management application so another
important thing is is that you have to
turn over every stone within the
infrastructure in the app you really
have to look at everything that that is
that is that is coming off of your
system all of that exhaust of the logs
and the metrics has meaning but it's a
lot and so you have to be able to have
that all up and up in a framework that's
up and up in a cloud that that you can
you can work from there on this the the
information that you're providing to the
management system is not resident
locally it's taken up to the cloud where
you do where you as a developer or or
whatever your role in the organization
don't have to worry about implementation
of a piece of software to help you
manage something where you're gonna put
all of that data from your your apps and
an infrastructure you don't have to
worry about that all of that's done up
on a cloud so that information is up
there and then what you do with that
information is is is very important
through the services that are provided
and Oracle has done a number of a lot of
work on these services and you look at
that center part on that unified
platform there are services that work on
that for application performance
monitoring for log analytics for
infrastructure monitoring for
orchestration for analytics of IT for
performance and capacity planning
service there's a capability to allow
you to do that there's security
monitoring and analytics and there's
also configuration and compliance so all
of these services operate on that
intelligent data that you've ingested up
into a cloud that that data now has a
relationship all with each other because
of machine learning and we use we that
there's a number of capabilities of
machine learning if you're interested
about it we have we have a lot of
information about that in white papers
and things like that that you can take a
look
because essentially what you're doing is
you're relying upon algorithms to help
you out and you want to make sure that
they're done that that behind those
algorithms that we offer there there's
there's it's it's it's a solid thing so
you can you can find a lot of good
information about how Oracle is using
machine learning today at Oracle calm
but the capabilities that we use for
management cloud that we've gotten from
our artificial intelligence lab include
things like like clustering show you a
little bit of an example they're like
correlation well let me go back to
cluster and clustering allows you to
cluster logs together and make sense out
of it automatically fast correlation
allows you to to to correlate and
connect your all the topology the entire
map and the application of the
infrastructure and there's there's other
capabilities to that that help in the
machine learning area but those are two
very important ones for developers so I
have to put this up here because just
kind of a kind of like a little slap in
the face but a little you know hey wake
up kind of thing that that if you're not
concerned about security in your
application you need to be and we all
know why we see breaches all the time
we're we're bad guys are coming in and
using new code or old code even to come
in exploit the vulnerabilities that are
created and go in and create some some
issues and problems and these are just
some of them the threat concerns are
universal everywhere that you see on the
left hand side but they're made even
more so when you open your your system
up you're open your your organization up
when you put out applications that are
kind of a micro services base that that
those kinds of things increase the
security threats and you have to be on
top of that self and protect
yourself from these kinds of a these
attacks these attacks include things
that start from the doesn't seem like
much at all that they made it they may
come in and they will get in and they'll
adopt a user profile and they'll they'll
take over that account and they'll start
doing things with that that could be
very bad like extract account
information from a database do a select
star on that database and exfiltrated or
or deposit or ransomware and they're
like like was done actually to Netflix
but not because of micro-services but
that happened if you remember that a
while ago but all of these things they
need to be you need to consider that so
when you go back make sure that when
you're when you're developing code that
you're including security in the regime
I only have a little bit more time left
I think but what what we want to do
today is go over a few examples of of
this and in how to understand your
Applications folder abilities and make
sure that you can handle you know the
performance as well there's a there's
we've identified a four step process
that I'm going to start going through
where the step one is where you can get
a 360 view degree view of your entire
infrastructure and your applications in
your topology I'm going to show you that
a little bit the other very important
thing is in as you as you adopt this
management is to go and start
understanding the locks figuring out
what those logs that were that are being
collected out there for all of your
applications can give you the visibility
that you need and another a third area
very important I hope to get to this I
may not but that's how you can how you
can chase transactions through the
system and find out where where problems
occur
where problems have occurred and then
also can do it real time too and see
what the user experience is like see how
they're using it if they're happy with
it so I have a saving grace here because
even though I may not get through all of
this stuff you can and we're gonna be
doing a lab that has a lot of the things
that I'm kind of kind of highlight for
you now
from 145 to 345 and Commonwealth C which
is down there in corridor to left's
so we're down at the very end and we
have a number of seats there ready for
you ready to go so so let's so so so
please please come to that I'm just
going to go through a few things right
now in the time that we have which is
another ten minutes so let's see the
first step that you really want to do in
order to get a handle on things is to
monitor all of your infrastructure and
make sure that you really understand the
topology of that infrastructure and and
so what the reader the the the reason
why is because you want to you want to
be able to get a good handle on all the
all the things on the right hand side so
so these kinds of things are are simply
by getting a handle on the topology
you'll be able to you'll be able to to
get better assurance in there there's
there's certain there's there's a
certain number of attributes associated
with monitoring the first thing you got
to do is go out and discover stuff you
got to understand everything about that
infrastructure and bring it in and and
see it in its context see how it all
relates to each other through that
correlation capability the other thing
monitoring is be able to to to identify
things quickly and be alerted of things
of substance not just you know alerts
but alerts in combination that that give
you an idea of what actually are dealing
with you know an issue that's really
there as opposed to just giving you an
alert it will give you the ability to do
something about it the ability to take
correction corrective action
and and so that's the monitoring and
alerting capability the other thing is
is the analytics it's the that we that
is provided that that that helps you
analyze it and so what we do is we
basically have a dashboard OMC has
Oracle management cloud has a dashboard
capability that allows you to get
everything that's really critical about
your application from a development
perspective in front of you so that you
could see it you can see how many
entities you're looking at how many
micro services you're looking at what
the status of it all is how it relates
to other things very important
infrastructure and business metrics that
are that are available for you to help
monitor that can take continuous
integrated continuous delivery
environment that you could provide the
information back to the developers it's
really going to help them as as they see
how certain things are operating for the
micro services that they've decided to
deploy you could get a really you need
to get a really good understanding of it
from from what we call we call this a
global context where you could actually
expand out in all of the the layers
where where where your application is is
is tiered all the way down from the
storage and load balancing things all
the way up to the users and knowing the
browsers that they're using and the
devices that they're they're logging in
from so so these are the kinds of things
that help help you in this global
context really does help you to see how
all this is related to it you can even
go into into one of them and on there
you see a little red thing that's a
storage device that might be having a
problem you can just click that and go
in and try to figure out problems from
there isolating it down to the area that
that is identified here as the problem
so so monitoring 360-degree view of your
application and the infrastructure upon
which it's running a second very
important capability that I brought out
before is the ability to take those logs
voluminous amounts of logs that are
being generated from all those
microservices and all those other kinds
of things and bringing them into into
OMC so that you can manage them
managing alongs is very important a
repository essentially of logs that's
the the most recent logs and these
things change these logs will change
depending upon where you are I mean
you're gonna have a different set of
logs for for the system that you use in
development and one it's different in
tests and one that goes into production
you can maintain all of those in that
context and do things like failure
analysis and searching and regression
testing and employ machine learning to
figure out clustering to figure out
exactly what the problem is where it is
and potentially how to resolve it so
here are some of the things that you can
use log analytics for this is what you
need it for is a developer you need to
use it to debug you can use it to find
performance bottlenecks number two and
number three you could basically get a
really good complete picture of how the
system performs whether it's in dab or
test so or I'm sorry Deb or production
test or production so so essentially
what we're trying to do is through log
analytics we're trying to to
troubleshoot
complex transactions but you see we have
a lot of logs if you take a look at this
screen and look up on the right-hand
side you see that this this particular
micro services based application is
almost 1.3 million logs and that's a lot
to get through obviously and you need a
way to do that we have visualization
capabilities that allow you to do that
to kind of see how that all is but we
also have another capability called
linking and what linking does is it
brings all of the logs from all those
transactions together and in I guess you
could say because there because it that
we all know the relationship these logs
have for the transaction we can actually
link all of that together that's all can
be done by by this
system automatically for you with you
know with some assistance where you
where you now have all the logs that are
associated with a transaction available
to see because of this linking
capability so if you take a look here
you can see that that that order ID that
those are the transactions and and and
you can see the things that are on each
transaction and and the and the number
of logs that are associated in this case
we we had 1.3 million log records that
were that that are made into not really
still manageable but 72,000 events or
transactions that actually occur in this
case transactions so so that that's a
that's really really kind of important
that we see all this and have that but
still that's it and you can get a lot
out of here you can see where the
problem lies for you know events that
are you know take too long but because
but because there still is a lot we kind
of are trying to get those into the
right relationship with each other we
can actually do something that we call
machine learning and we call it
clustering where we basically get a
common message signature if you will for
each one of those logs we find that and
those patterns that develop we then use
to determine what the anomalous behavior
is and usually in an anomalous behavior
is something that happens one time so
there's one log out there after doing
all of this machine learning that the
clustering command can find and bring
that to you and help you understand so
in this case we took all those
transactions transactions and we found
five different anomalies and each one of
those anomalies can now be can now be
examined so and you know in in this case
the duration time for that particular
step knowing that information and then
knowing would actually happen in that
log at this point you can do that and
then you can find the problem at hand so
that's that's logs log management
a real quick before we go I'm going to
step through this really quick and I
this is how you you're able to get Java
flight recorder information from things
that that that through through a GFI are
dumped and that that gives you some
insight about what's happening in the in
the transaction you can also get user
experience and be able to see things
from their view measure page loads and
clicks and things like that in real time
what I just showed you before you can
also use for historic so you could
actually go and and see where those
transactions were happening if in the
past to see where the where the
potential problems are arising even if
the application from a user experience
and seems to be okay but from an
end-user experience and if it isn't okay
you now have the ability to do it like
that too so you could check out you know
and drill down into into things that are
associated with the Ajax calls and and
and and and and go go down from there
and drill down from there so I I have to
stop right now because we are getting
close to our noon stop time but I want
to again offer you the the option to go
and actually try some of these things
that I'm actually clicking through so
you could you could see specifically how
it can help you in the in the
development world I'm trying to get to a
to a slide here that that states the
where the hands-on lab is and
Commonwealth see again around the corner
I also wanted to bring your attention to
to a to the trial you have received in
your your kit you've received that it's
been talked about a free $500 credit for
a trial
Oracle management cloud already offers a
$300
for for the trial of the services for a
one-month period and that gives you you
could try out most of the services using
using a good amount of logs not
everything in your state but contain set
of logs that you want to look at as well
as some business metrics can you do that
all with within within within a one
month time period with with the way that
we're charging for it so please do this
it's a it's a it's a real easy way to
start it's a step by step instruction on
how to do it
and and you can do that starting when
you go home and and all you need to do
is click on that link again we're
confident we'll cover this again in the
lab itself so so I wanted to leave you
with that I don't think there's a
there's a lot of time for questions
right now but I think I might have a one
or two that I could that I can take even
though it is top of the hour any
questions
well I thank you for your time and and
your willingness to stay with this I
hope that you can you could see the need
for a modern management regime to be in
place for the applications that you're
developing and and and the need is even
more strong now than it ever has been
Oracle has developed the capability that
is able to do that today and and to
investigate it you would be wise to do
that because that's the kind of
capability that you will need in the
modern development environment so thank
you very much for your time and
hopefully we'll see some of you at the
lab at 1:45 thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
