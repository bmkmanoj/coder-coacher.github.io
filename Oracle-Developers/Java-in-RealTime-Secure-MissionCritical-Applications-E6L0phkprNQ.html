coming out so early and potentially with
the same kind of hangover that I've got
normally at a conference like this all
you're about is what's new and cool this
session is about what secure and
reliable and has existed for many years
in secure environments military-type
organization and we're asking ourselves
what are the concerns that people have
in those organizations and in fact from
our abstract the questions that we're
asking ourselves are how do we
facilitate quicker adoption so what you
often find is that you come to a
conference and you hear about Java 8 but
back in the real world you're in Java 5
or something how can we help security
managers during migration what are the
related security issues and government
accreditation processes and also
interesting question what are the common
java libraries frameworks and geospatial
packages in these environments now
various people from these kinds of
organizations are going to share their
experiences so don't reduce themselves
go through some basic background on what
the organization does and respond to
these to these points that we open to
leave a lot of time so that we can
engage in some discussion and
potentially see and learn something new
and from each other's experiences so
if we get started with sell on the end
from Northrop rbailey uh north of Brahma
and I work and I've worked on the ride
variety with classification of systems
known as be closer to the mic either say
something go make me come up here oh
it's okay
I'll sit down ah I work on a pretty
widely used type of application which is
commonly known as a c4isr application
which is a long word for command and
control communications it's kind of a
wide variety that kind of somewhat boils
down to what's known as situational
awareness and that's basically
understanding all the factors so that
important people can make the right
decisions at the right time and that's
involves many layers of integration and
I'll get more into that later but that's
generally the scope of work I've dealt
with for the last 13 years worked I've
seen the evolution between you know
technical technology in the 2000s and
the kind of constraints and the the
pathways that it takes to adopt newer
technologies and some of the mistakes
that have made been made along the line
I'm just going to first talk about my
organization if you go the next slide
there Jim Northrup Grumman is a is I
believe the third largest defense
contractor so we cover software and
building ships and building airplanes so
we kind of cover the gamut I work for a
specific sector called Information
Systems so we do a lot of software which
is is becoming more and more northrup
space we do a lot of integration we work
with very large scale integrations and
largely specialize in kind of handling
the governance of how do you how do you
deal with you know all these
subcontractors contracted by our
customer and make it work into a single
cohesive product so we kind of have a
hand-to-hand relationship to our
government counterparts to ensure that
everything everything is the works at
the end of the day which is
which is which is a pretty daunting task
we also do we also deal in the
commercial sector as well and by
commercial that means working with
either homeland defense or working with
the different public safety sectors I've
done a little of that work myself
it's kind of a different change of pace
my particular project that I'm working
now is getting a lot of traction within
the DoD I can't really talk about the
specific customers but it is a
visualization tool what you can see
there there's there's a commercial
flight feed on top of other data that's
being overlaid on the map and of course
we have we work with NASA world windage
which is a 3d visualization tool and
that's kind of our specified tool use
and that's that mapping in the
background we are kind of the arc our
original company which was bought out by
Northrop Grumman kind of almost founded
the idea of what's called a common
operating picture where instead of
everybody kind of receiving different
messages from different people we were
the first to kinda have the idea that
everybody shares what's a common
operational picture so that can mean a
lot of different things but what it
really means is that somebody's what
somebody sees across the world is the
same thing that I'm seeing here does it
it may be a little bit wrong but it's
actually more important that everybody
be you know you might be a little bit
out of sync what's actually more
important is that everybody has a shared
common operational picture and
understanding of what's going on and
that that concept is pretty key in the
situational awareness realm and so we've
worked with an emergency responders city
officials energy managers even for
monitoring those type of environments
but we bet basically building a
situational awareness platform to adapt
to many different kind of communication
standards now because you can't be all
things to all people we create a
platform where people can bring
there were specific capabilities into
pretty easily next slide
build and so he part of this is dynamic
configuration if even within a room like
this where you have my product laid out
everywhere people will have different
roles so you have to adapt to those
different roles if you have a lot of
software or if you have different
hardware you may want to dynamically
compose your your system you want to
predefined these things and so these are
all things that we kind of think about
as the developers of of this c2 platform
we do a lot with of course map data you
can see on the bottom editors different
map feeds these are pretty generic
that's kind of a generic Llumar will be
on the left and on the right but the
issue if you've ever dealt with mapping
software is now that map to get really
good-looking map data you're doing with
petabytes of you know map data and of
course they can't hold a petabyte on
your laptop but you can dynamically
stream it down and offline it so you
don't have to deal with those things and
of course we have offline data sources
as well but but WMS technology is pretty
key throughout the DoD and kind of
managing complicated wide varieties of
map products and of course we integrate
with weather data that's a key part of
situational awareness FAA data we also
deal with RSS and georss so one thing
that talking about keeping up a standard
is very important for us to be able to
ingest about industry standards for
visualization RSS isn't really a
visualization tool but georss is kind of
extension of RSS allows people do it
buddy the important thing is that we try
and keep up with these trends so we can
keep up with the data sources and also
allows users to easily connect to the
data sources they need without creating
complicated software tools
and of course we we rest and soap and
web web services are a key part of
software integration so we kind of
expedite connecting to those types of
sources again single secure environments
so it's really I mean a large part of
this is that you want to be able to
adapt and understand that identify the
standards that are important so so that
situational awareness picture can be
always up-to-date so you don't have to
have you know five different types of
software running all the same time we've
also we also do some chat work you can
see you down there we we're always
looking for the standard XMPP is be chat
skynyrd within the DoD we were able to
kind of easily configure have voice over
IP without even providing a server
because it prefers arted there I'm
physically using an open standard we
could actually use it extend it and we
actually have what's called geo
collaboration than we it's been around
for five years now it's getting wider
and wider attraction because basically
don't even with back-end server you just
leverage your existing server and you
can collaborate in real time to see
what's going on over here and over here
so not only if you have the same map but
you actually can move the map at the
same time so it's like a real-time
visualization of real-time data as it's
coming in which without these
technologies wouldn't really be possible
if you tried to kind of communicate all
those ideas and try and share that over
xmin TV it wouldn't it wouldn't
um so going back to the main point
submit what is missing critical as as a
technical lead it means that you really
have to think about schedule schedule
becomes paramount because it's a tiered
evaluation of your system you have your
internal system testing you have your
integration testing and you have you
layers outside of our testing to do it
what that really means is cost because
when you release something it's going to
be very expensive
if you don't get right so you have to
get it right on schedule
and that's you know as a developer you
just want to kind of geek in just that
little bit of extra functionality but I
mean really it's it's not specific to
DoD but in our particular realm where if
something isn't right
you're not going to ripple yourself here
for those three other groups you're
going to reflect scheduling into ripple
the whole integration schedule so having
it work and work the first time is is
very critical now is over the last two
years and there's been a dramatic shift
in security I mean insecurity has always
been there but now there's there's
there's no forgiveness I'll just put it
there and and that's become a critical
part of of everything we do now or once
upon a time it was kind of assumed that
the the hardware we kind of just take
care of that for you and now we have
security at every level within the
system Thanks thank you
integration challenges I'll try and
speed through I think I'm right over
over what stuff from there there's
there's a big discrepancy some of the
challenges we have is that your
development environment is not at all
the environment that it's going to be
deployed in and we're a platform
application so we don't even have this
working software that it's actually
going to be deployed with so there's you
know many levels of obfuscation between
is it really going to work for sure
isn't work so even test-driven
development is going to solve all the
problems you're never going to really
know what's what's working what's not
changing standards every year there's
there's always new standards
I mean it's somewhat true in the
commercial industry but in the DoD
there's always a new standard to unify
them all but that really just becomes
its own standard than that so on and so
forth and of course the real key and the
real integration challenges is dynamic
data discovery and that's you know try
to there's been various you know why the
communication you know wide Stander's I
don't want to say that what it is but I
mean you all know there the web web
service data repositories and those
things and but when you have data
sources that don't always line to use
web service it is then that becomes a
little bit more complicated
I mean basically I'll kind of quickly go
through this ting them speaking too much
hmm so a large strategy when you have a
very very large-scale product when you
want to have situational awareness
across a wide spectrum something that
really comes into play is decentralizing
you're not gonna have one organization
it actually becomes a political so we
get one organization doing all the work
in every domain so a really key part of
this is decentral enough case there's a
different mindset from building a
Microsoft product where you have a large
product in Microsoft Word where we're
really thinking about building systems
that are going to get built upon and
work all together and kind of magically
come together and so it's a it's a
different mindset but this actually
facilitates innovation in a sense
because this whole accreditation process
you can basically you can down scope and
going back to kind of a the solution for
this is modularity having modular
platforms at least within live product
has really solved a lot of problems so
instead of trying to accredit huge
amount of software you use trink and
shrink the size of the components that
you need to approve it and that's been
kind of an ongoing strategy it's it's a
little bit difficult but it really has
enabled accelerated deployment and it
really has where it's still slow you can
still get new ideas and new technologies
into integrated much quickly um
and the real key is also the frequency
it's a it's it's slightly more cost but
when you're frequently kind of
frequently accredited software there's
no surprises and you increase the
transparency of everything you're doing
so from a security standpoint there's no
surprises there as well and of course
these are really all the tenants
agile development so where once upon a
time the accreditation process was
really kind of built like weapons so if
you're building a gun you're going to
design the gun building on put it in the
factor appointment and that doesn't
really work in software development so
there's a bit of real shift of course in
the commercial industry but in the VOD
as well to kind of change the mindset
and use a lot of the agile philosophies
to kind of to kind of achieve or a
quickly reformed there's it still in my
opinion it's still kind of they're still
trying to get an understanding I mean if
everybody has kind of trouble
understanding out the process if you
don't really you know if you're not a
developer or you don't understand the
process to begin with it's going to
difficult first and so what's really
come to happen is something called you
know where you have traditional
processes you actually have what kind of
makes more sense in the old view world
it's just kind of more of a water scrub
fall so if you feel that the waterfall
process what we have is kind of mixed
between having high level objectives but
kind of using agile within the process
to get through that escritt
accreditation to get through and also to
vet the software continuously and I
think I'm over time so I'll just leave
it there I'll move it over to show you
which one oh yeah
you can do it on my slide Oh
no not doing so well with the switching
entities this thing is to secure and
this one yeah they said this is this
here a secret invisible button on the on
the system so it's really secure work
off your sites yeah yeah yeah so we're
switching now to show I'm working on
nÃ©cessaire in the mission-critical
secure real-time application development
sector right so what can Java technology
do to mitigate risk is actually what I
want to talk about in and I have to in
order to do that I have to kind of
describe the scope and complexity really
quickly the software that I work on is
deployed into a mission control room it
is part as a component yeah it's a
component that exists and automated by
other tools but also most work as a
manual process both from an operator
operator standpoint and also on the desk
of the analyst outside the Mission
Control and this is deployed right now
in the Goddard Space Flight Center for
the MMS mission which is short for
magnetospheric multiscale it measures
the magnetosphere at high altitudes next
slide uh there's a graphic yeah a
magnetosphere you got some orbits and
you've got four satellites flying in a
tetrahedron pyramid formation that's
critical to the science so if you go the
next slide very complex mission most
raise its Apogee many times throughout
the lifecycle of the mission to be
successful next and the really hard part
is that in the areas that it has to do
with science which is a very high
altitude half way to the moon way past
GPS we can't communicate with it but
there's nothing we can do we have to
position it with maneuver commands which
is what my software generates well
before it gets to that point and we just
have to do it right the first time every
time so next slide so we all and before
I talk about this so a mission critical
here and this situation is loss total
loss of science capabilities now the
netbeans play
form resonated with this because of some
of the things that Sal touched on which
was the modularity
anytime somebody came up with a
requirement or a new manual process or a
new automated process I could
encapsulate that almost wholly into a
plug-in and if it either works or it
doesn't and I can deploy it to in a dev
environment that can have my manual
testers I can have my analyst work
through it and they can vet it a hundred
percent so that when we deploy it into
the mock a Mission Operations control
room that the same testing works a
hundred percent of time if it's it's
it's really made my life easier next
slide
uh this this talks about job effects we
can skip this slide oh I think we got
the wrong slide show already
great yeah yeah and it's this which to
us sure I thought there was only one I
cheated
look
forget
it's a it's the same one into number two
yeah yep great awesome good okay so what
I was trying to get to this point right
here okay great okay so back on track uh
famous man great man love this guy my
boss has said we spend billions of
dollars send me building these machines
then there's no other machine like it
and then we just literally rocket them
to a place we'll never see it again why
are we doing this well it's to do things
that we can't do otherwise so in other
words like I said before mission
critical here is the high risk
associated with science failure versus
loss of life now non-commercial space
missions are always custom and unique
like this that the commercial ones you
know your XM satellite deployments that
sort of thing
they're in my opinion pretty
cookie-cutter but uh in my situation
it's always going to do for every single
time and of course given that then the
people that are involved your talk about
your NASA and in terms that your DoD
technical monitors they want to use the
same things that have always worked
because they're definitely afraid that
they're going to be the ones that
introduce something new and something
doesn't work and now they're forever
known as the person that created some
debris field at some altitude so in
other words since new technologies new
risk mission designs try to exclusively
use older proven technologies
ergo Fortran parole and for some reason
MATLAB they're obsessed with that net
and that domain so uh how can you
reconcile that well you know you got to
break the cycle somehow but you can't
just shove it in their face and say your
process is bad use this new process
because that's a fallacy their process
works so it's not bad it's proven it's
not bad so one way to do that is to take
a quantified risk identify a quantified
risk in terms of either cost or science
loss in offer technology that you can
quantify all to prove reduces that risk
or cost it's just like any business
model so if you can reduce the
development or operate
cost of the lifetime of admission then
do it that's how you get in there and
you can't they can't argue with the
bottom line if they project it's going
to cost a million dollars a year just to
track the satellite and you offer
technology that it cuts that in half
well their bosses are going to come down
on them if they don't go with that
technology and of course how do you find
those locations are those options in
those scenarios you do it mostly on new
new missions unfortunately missions that
are still in the design phase if you're
if you're a year from launch forget it
there is no way the code typically
there's a free six months before launch
unless you can identify an existing
mission that's got a highly risky or
highly complex with a short mean time
before failure of process then you have
an option
okay nothing on board that we're going
to happen but on the ground the
processing model you can that is one way
you can get in and I I can demo some
some of the software I brought this
software if you'd like to see it later
afterwards come see me and you can find
out this technology and us these this is
the mission some of the software
involved the location and my company
thanks it's switch not to Chris to
introduce and to share some perspectives
from your experience hello everybody as
you can see I don't have any slides so
this should be quick and painless Chris
height from kinetic North America I
primarily work with the Air Force at
technical applications center in
Melbourne Florida aiding them in their
nuclear treaty monitoring mission so you
can imagine all sorts of fun stuff
associated with that and I'd love to
show it to you but you didn't give me
your security clearance information so I
can't it's kind of a problem with the
having a session about mission-critical
applications because you typically can't
show those
so we do real-time right so uh I
primarily work with big data lots of big
data coming from different sensor
systems a bunch of different formats has
to flow into the system you have to do a
bunch of processing on it real-time
storing in those big data bins so that
later on you can pull up that same data
and do longer processing on it and this
is all it's time-consuming and it has to
be secure because we can't have our
enemies coming in there and infiltrating
the data and going mad on it so you have
to secure it down but you can't destroy
the real-time mission either so how do
you do that well here's how you do it
I don't know this there's no one answer
on how you do any one of these things
but the thing I do know is that it's
difficult because of these the things
that these gentlemen have mentioned uh
use of old technologies the government
is afraid of new things you have to use
older technologies for instance I've
seen a lot of really cool stuff here
with JavaFX and stuff that's in Java 7
and up coming in Java 8 I can't use any
of it I'm stuck in Java 6 at best and
some places 5 and before so I have to
look into the future see things that are
coming up for me and figure out how I
can use those when they come around but
for now I'm still stuck in Java 6 so how
do I bring Java 6 up to where I need it
to be well sometimes I can build on
capability just by using language itself
I can implement some of these features
but really I'm stuck with that old
technology and that's just the reality
of where we're at so software securing
software versioning is a huge thing in
the government I can't install snapshots
I can't just go out to Apache download
the latest daily build and say hey I'm
going to use this in government software
they won't allow that to happen
things are accredited you have to use
released versions of things so they can
go through the crediting system and you
can get it approved so that being said
it plus your own software as well this
is one thing I came across recently is
if I have a versioning system standard
versioning system major minor bug fix
kind of numbers if I implement that
third if I change that third number all
they have to do is scan it passes credit
Asian goes right through immediately if
I change that second number
oh no that's a big deal then then it has
to go through the full accreditation
process and you have to check all the
boxes but really we know that that's
arbitrary really I mean we're trying to
keep to keep to a numbering scheme to US
territory I can just always change that
last one 10.1 2.3 for all eternity and
it would pass through but government and
their logic they see that as something
different so there's all these little
rules and things you have to keep in
mind when you're designing your software
if you want to get it up and running
quickly I uh
I build mostly web services I do some
client work too with NASA whirlwind that
was brought up earlier I have an
application called tera Mendte which is
a modular GIS application completely
open-source you by NAMM bitbucket and I
build plug-ins for it and the great
thing about this is if you have a piece
of software that it is extensible and
modular you pass it through
accreditation once it is now available
obviously if you update it in a
substantial amount you've got to wreak
reddit it but it's available the plugins
are built on top of that so they don't
have to accredit the entire system
anymore you can just install those
plugins and get the accreditation move
that into government environments and
that gets you up and running faster so
modularity and government systems is
very important if I'm not using
client-side and Tara meant to platform
kind of modules I'm using things like
OSGi that I haven't seen a whole lot of
OSGi sessions here there were a few and
I know a lot of people frown at OSGi it
so it's too hard oh she has not hard
modularity is hard true modularity in
isolating pieces of code
that you can swap them at hot swap them
out and do the linkages that's difficult
but it pays off in the long run so if
you can design your system in a modular
fashion for using Java I recommend OSGi
if you can do that that will get you up
and running faster it'll keep keeping
more secure by building on top of
platforms that are already being
developed and it allow you to hot swap
certain pieces out of the architecture
when problems arise without bringing
down the real time mission so I no
longer have to shut the mission down
just to change that piece of software I
can just swap out that one module and a
backup to the races so that's really all
I had to say so I'm gonna sit back down
and pass it on over thank you and Tim
you drove and really a lot being sort of
mr. NetBeans cuz I was on the NetBeans
team at Sun for 11 years but actually
for the last couple of years I've been
doing other things and one of the more
recent ones was working for a company
called Gilead that does a federated
search engine that's used by various US
government three-letter agencies which
shall not be named and so basically you
have problems like a search engine which
can federated data stores with different
levels of classification and do weird
things like be able to tell you yes
there is a search hit on this term and
you need to get a warrant to find out
what it is so a lot of interesting
problems there and basically you're
talking about sub about server-side
software which is deployed in the
customers data center and has to pass
through a fairly interesting process to
to get there
so that's I've got a bunch of detail
here but basically you get someone looks
through the documentation and you
eventually get a 32 tests that you can
test it in a testing integration
environment and it gets poked and
prodded in various ways scanned for
undocumented open ports you user
accounts all of the software that you're
using will be tested for known
vulnerabilities and basically banged on
pretty hard um and if so then you get
authority to operate you may have to do
another round of testing and basically
it's just not a very fun process so
another thing about this is that no two
environments are necessarily alike in
this in this area and your job is to
prove that your software is not
vulnerable so your job is to prove a
negative and you have someone who has
discretion over you know whether you're
able to use this technology or that
technology and depending on who that is
they either may be very conservative or
they may be less conservative and
there's also interesting problems like
getting up getting log files out of a
secure environment where something they
need to be randomly manually redacted
and that might be a very large file so a
lot of um fun things about dealing with
sources sort of thing so there is an
approved software list I think about
other people have mentioned that but
very often only older versions of things
you want to use are approved and also
sometimes the rules make no sense like
we had one situation where a secure copy
could not use that not permitted
absolutely no but Usenet cat and just
cat a file to a random port sure go
ahead so it's a weird it's a weird place
to deploy software so the things that
tend to cause issues are stuff like
anything that includes in a compiler is
very hard to get approved because if you
can compile something then you could
write software after the fact that
circumvent security and deploy it in
place another thing is if you're dealing
with web applications modern browsers
are rarely available you're usually
dealing with Internet Explorer or
several versions back and also very
often shell accounts on production
machines are verboten so um I looked at
the abstract for this talk from here
chata what can we do to encourage
Aker adoption of insecure
mission-critical admit environments and
and my first reaction was nothing so we
actually had a one of these information
security officers whose definition of a
secure system was completely
disconnected and buried in concrete in
the ground so so that person is not an
early adopter slightly better answer to
the question really is to modularize
more and to do less so by modular eyes I
mean componentized software in a way
that you can take pieces out that you
can turn things off that they are so
that they are really not there and the
other piece is to basically do less in
other words do you focus more on small
things that do one thing well that can
be combined into something larger so
that you can use so that the the
behavior of the system is well scoped
and well-known so in other words
anything you can take out or turn off
doesn't have to you don't have to prove
that it does what it works as advertised
and the other pieces do less in other
words every piece of software on a
server and typically you know you may be
sharing a server with other systems or
you may have your own box but every
piece of software and this is something
that drives me nuts with cloud providers
as well because someone will set up a
server machine and be like oh yeah I
installed X Windows and blah blah blah
and on it's like every piece of software
on a server is a potential security risk
so you know you want nothing there that
will not be used in production and that
does not absolutely need to be there um
and for this for this sort of thing
becomes an issue is like things like
java application servers i mean do you
even know how many ports say JBoss or
GlassFish or one of these is going to
open you know including like ah
clustering serviceability management JMX
if you have to sit down and actually say
to somebody these are the set
these are the ports that I'm going to
use and that includes you know picking
random numbered hyper random height
ports to do things is actually not okay
you have to give a list so if you've got
this giant thing that you know it's an
email server it's a you know it's a bird
it's a plane then that makes the job of
someone who's trying to just get their
work deployed very hard so doing less or
having the ability to take out the
things that you don't actually plan to
use in production is really important
and that's the end of my talk
yep thank you in your comments on
anything from anyone in the panel it
seems clear that modularity the big
thing here right glad to see that
mentioned it's much easier to secure
module system breakdown functionality
into individual components they're
easier to secure and if something's not
working it's easier to swap things out
alright so modularity yay no more
monolithic large applications I I have
something to add uh I really like that
the bit at the end that Tim covered
about not just about the ports but just
the whole the concept of having some
sort of putting in some service so that
you can actually make an application
work I mean it's like I get these I get
some guys on where I'm work who are
trying to convince me that we should be
deploying web servers into on to mission
operations room computers so that they
can make html5 apps being Mission
Control apps in I mean I get it you have
some pretty looking stuff running out of
Firefox but I mean come on that's that's
I mean you're building an extra tunnel
to drive the truck through that it's
it's crazy and I'm not I'm not trying to
shoot down that model it's just it's
kind of dumb if you're going to be in
the secure or a highly controlled
environment any comments from anyone any
shared experiences other people
deflected video we must be in all in
this kind of environment
maybe it could use the mic I worked at
NASA when Columbia the Columbia accident
happened and one of the things you guys
mentioned was about things that have
been tried and true tested that whole
incident was shown to that that culture
of saying what's worked for 30 years is
what led to that disaster um I like to
use that when anybody makes that
argument because it is a fallacy just
because it's work doesn't mean it's
right
the past does not predict the future are
you able to talk about what went wrong I
mean not in the weeds but just was it up
was it I mean in I'm there were multiple
problems right but are you able to
comment in any detail about what
particular technology input you saw that
was that that contributed to the overall
problem problem it was more of a culture
problem bringing people out there have
been doing things for so unbelievably
long um any time anybody questions
anything
the answer was don't mess with his it
works so the the process of people
actually questioning is what led to
ignoring of certain technical issues
that's a good point and coupled with
that a couple of with it happens in the
nasa domain but any any scientific or
highly specialized domain there comes a
certain level of arrogance on the people
that have been there for years and
lawyers and years because i mean these
people know everything about that domain
yet this is not their domain that the
software development field typically and
and so couple that culture coupled with
that behave that attitude it just
compounds the problem and so you know
one of the problems you're going to face
is trying to reach out to these people
in a way that doesn't um tweak that
arrogance okay well i and i mean it in
the best way because these people are
really great people and they want what's
best but they just dirt they don't know
they don't know what they don't know
actually and so there's a there's a
there's a slight ignorant yes
I can try
so the software I right processes
downlink telemetry from the spacecraft
spent plural there's four and so we have
to handle four spacecraft and we have 90
minutes to do that we have we have a 25
minute blurb at the start of that right
before that 90 minute up process and
that's where we get all that time 'try
we have to run it through a whole bunch
of simulations and Monte Carlo zuv
simulations determine that yeah
everything's okay or I'll crud you know
that these spacecraft are going to crash
into each other let's let's do all these
maneuvers right and and so uh there it
isn't deterministic quite like are you
thinking but ironically the UM that the
software I write actually services
deterministic real-time onboard
navigation software which isn't see so
it's not a java thing although I use
NetBeans to maintain that software um
but uh so in other words what we produce
from maneuver positioning configuration
commands that sort of thing must be
uploaded in a certain time real-time
deterministic order and it must be
processed and it must be done uh it in
before ninety minutes is up otherwise we
again lose a connectivity with these
things as they swing around perigee and
they're moving at I believe fourteen
kilometers per second and they're moving
at an angle in an altitude where no
ground tracking station can communicate
with it they can't pan across their eyes
in fast enough so I mean that's it what
we do is it's got to get in there it's
got to go right we get we can talk to it
again we get another 20 25 minute um a
downlink and then uplink opportunity
might be closer to an hour of total time
it after that ninety minutes is up but
then after that it's on its way back up
above the GPS cloud way above a GPS
cloud and again it's it's on its own the
only thing that can talk to it are a
couple deep space network communication
satellites which honestly are reserved
for
or enterprise critical communications
versus mission-critical
so we it would have to be a big time
emergency for us to request access to
those
well the good news is that the processes
that I create don't um well hell I just
allocate a lot of memory and then I
desire oh well oh you do it to everybody
here does that I mean we've got I mean
we've got machines with 16 gigs of RAM
and I'm and I only use at any one moment
500 megabytes which is up unreal you
know 10 years ago but but uh in each
individual process I make sure only uses
a little bit and each one has to it has
to be completed in less than five
minutes I mean it's kind of arbitrary at
that point because we know we only have
so much time and so are the operating
procedure most from end to end take less
than 10 minutes a key part in our domain
is actually there's there's a lot of
data coming in and having real time
there's there's always there's always a
question of what is the validity of data
versus what is the accuracy of the data
and it really depends on on on how much
analysis has to go into it so if your
data is is raw data meaning there's
there's nothing behind that there are a
lot of decisions that have to be made
and I discussed before about the common
operational picture there's a lot of
decisions that go to that so I so
there's different systems have different
approaches
obviously I can get to deeper tech to
the level but there's always you have to
be there's always decision on how much
data do you want to see if you were if
you had you know weather balloons you
had every weather balloon the sky how
valuable is it to get the wall weather
balloon data not that you know and
translating that to other things it's
it's the same kind of thing there's
always a balance between how much data
you see and how meaningful that data is
and how up to time it is and that those
are really the three key parameters and
that's something from the outset when
you're architecting your system you have
to really think about and
I'll just even there
very similar to what you do process
telemetry and my system all pieces that
process job also pushed to the outside
I'm trying to make a push the job of
creeping closer
have you looked at all real-time Java so
that has some things like memory memory
pools which are not not garbage
collected in real time threads and
basically isolating the pieces of code
and the regions of memory which simply
should not be affected by garbage
collection and measuring that they
aren't and that might be that might be
an approach for if you're doing hard
real-time stuff it's really late for
this for the therapist yeah yeah we we
transition from a C system to a Java
swing application to an F beens
application and I mean now I actually
think that Java technologies are are
definitely there where you can get
real-time performance you know and
actually not have the overhead of having
to worry about you know and managing it
yourself so yeah I think it's sometimes
you know sort of slips by that the the
definition of real-time is that if you
do the same thing twice it will take the
same amount of time it will use the same
resources
it's not about wow it goes real fast
it's in fact if you wanted to make Java
Java real time you could set compile
threshold to run one and run garbage
collection after every virtual machine
instruction and it would meet the
definition it would be very slow but it
you know uh it's about predictability so
it's you know really a question of
measuring if the software will always be
able to respond in the time that's
required to do what it needs to do there
was a question yeah
so the question is have we ever used a
closed source system like he said for
Gmail that sort of thing but in
consuming to try to get the reuse that
that software in our own designs well I
guess I'm not going to answer for
everybody but I've been exposed to that
in a different life when I was doing DoD
work myself and I the the problem is you
it's it's rare that there it resonates
so harmoniously that it's just an easy
drop-in type thing for me and in of
course you've got hate say like this but
you've got this large pool of funding
that you you've been awarded to do this
blunt block of work and so you you you
might as well use that funding to do set
block of work and and there's there's an
intern there is an interest in creating
not just on the contractor side but also
on the civilian side of creating sets of
tools and processes that are tailored in
a way very specifically to what you're
doing but in a it but it almost becomes
a tool that they want themselves to put
up there on that and in those type of
closed systems or and I know at the at
the Goddard Space Flight Center we have
a shared technology site which which
many things are attitude um but then the
cycle just repeats people want to build
their own thing yeah I would say it's
actually I think the idea is is sound
and actually I don't think it can it
can't come from the contractor it has to
because there's inherently a conflict of
interest in scoping the work and etc but
I think the movement it I mean I've
worked I've worked in that domain and
I've seen other products work in that
domain and it can work um and I think
that is definitely the way it's going
when you talk about cost reduction that
is potentially a path to it but it's
really the cultural not even within your
own company I mean I I've worked in
several come I've seen different
patterns that even within a single
company where you know as a company
profit margin
it makes sense to you know kind of have
shared models but there's there's always
sandbox Wars there's always you know at
every level so if you can work those
things out then I I just went through a
graduate program at UCSD and for the
last three years there's actually been
very similar things all talking about
code reuse open source and how because
open source obviously has a lot of
positive aspects to it I mean now we're
using it in DoD but it's really becomes
that cultural question just like in any
organization what what happens when you
just merge organizations well that's
really what you're doing when you start
using some of these all software they
have to be accountable for that just in
the same way if you're working with them
outside of software but if you can sort
those things out then I think they're I
think there is a lot of possibility
there it's been a big push for a Gauss
government open source software recently
I've used forged up mail a lot both
polling projects and pushing to it and I
think it's a it's a good community it's
growing more and more projects are
becoming aware of open source in the
government community and government open
source software is the first step okay I
may not be able to use or provide boss
you know fully open whatever the F is
open source software but I can use stuff
within the government because I am part
of the government it but it is a policy
thing so different contracts different
groups are more willing to push and when
they do that the projects grow they get
better you can interact with these
groups the the projects that are there
that I've interacted with are there are
more open-minded groups and that's good
because you can push bug request you
it's like working in the outside world
but it's still government so I do see
that taking off for chap mill and
getting bigger and being used more but
it is a policy shift and people have to
become more
because it it's actually a big question
of an aside for him even allocating war
for what happened it's actually to me it
comes to a question of ownership right
when somebody owns a piece of software
in you know you're gonna be want to take
pride in that but it's always about you
know who's gonna sustain it who's going
to maintain that who's going to evolve
the product and you know become if
that's not clear-cut then it all falls
apart but that could be true about any
open-source software even outside the
government where somebody's gotta be
managing it which groups managing if
someone's not managing it it's gonna
fall apart unless someone steps up and
takes it so those exist throughout the
community that's why I really asked me
on the customer side because they're
providing the backbone of the you know
of the lifeline for these different
problems now at some level I think the
value of modularity
is ah that you get it helps you to scale
a team in other words like you get you
have natural corners for people to work
in as opposed to sort of trying to you
know hurt a bunch of people to all you
know all bang sheetrock up on this wall
at the same time um so that but in in in
this kind of environment you you end up
with a lot of folks who are sort of you
know I've lived in the world of open
source for a very long time but a lot of
people this is you know still oh that
must be that's dirty hippies or
something you know you still run into
that okay which is true yes yes we all I
have a ball so that's a happy note we
should maybe wrap up and just to point
out that on the topic of modularity
that's coming up a number of times
there's a session this afternoon at 4:30
in the Hilton continental ballroom six
from 4:30 to 5:30 on the top of
modularity and specifically on the
framework that all these gentlemen are
using as the basis of their software
which is the matrix platform so if
you're interested in finding out more
about that please come along at 4:32
to that session thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
