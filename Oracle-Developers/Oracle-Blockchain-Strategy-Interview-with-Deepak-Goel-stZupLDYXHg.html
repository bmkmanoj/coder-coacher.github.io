live here at Oracle OpenWorld 2017 I'm
your host job at Mohammed and I have as
my guest today deepak goal deepak
welcome thank you and your title is
senior director product development
senior director of product development
so we're gonna be talking about
blockchain today let's just start off
just for the benefit of some of the
folks who may not have heard about
blockchain
I guess what it's a distributed way of
doing creative things from I don't know
finances to a whole bunch of things
probably I'm stumbling all around can
you give us perhaps a better
articulation or what blockchain is
blocking can solve all the problem of
the world of the world okay for
president for you I got we have to look
at like how transactions are done today
actually in the enterprise world if two
organizations are talking to each other
what they are doing is they are going
into the central system central database
of a organization and making
transactions over there and each
organization has their own source of the
Prout
over a period of time these databases
can go out of sync so the problem is
that these organization would have to go
to get together offline and reconcile
and make sure that they have the same
information in their databases so that's
one problem second problem is most of
the time these organization because they
don't trust each other they go through
an intermediary so they are trusting the
intermediary and this other organization
is also testing that and they are saying
that okay you do the transaction and all
this handshake on behalf of us that
takes a lot of time because all the
transaction first have to go to
intermediaries from both directions and
reconciliation and settlement for
example they stock trading right so it
takes three days for us to settle they
stock probably even a more simpler
example is probably just a regular bank
transaction and that's why I can a bit
Bitcoin kind of comes in right so yeah
so every
like you talk about God blockchain the
first thing that comes to mind is
Bitcoin Bitcoin but let me actually
clarify that bitcoin is just one
application of blockchain the blockchain
a huge potential actually to change all
the transaction that goes on between
organizations
so what blockchain does is is basically
also known as a distributed ledger
technology a distributed ledger a
distributed ledger technology so like
everyone has their own ledger but they
have the same information exactly the
same information in their ledger
ok so what's happening here is like when
I do a transaction I create the
transaction this other organization
which I am transacting with they also
execute the same transaction and they
update is made to the ledger at the same
time okay and in order to an update to
be made to the ledger a consensus among
these transacting parties have to be
achieved so they reject the concept of
consensus among these parties that come
into the picture ok but at the very
basic level is safe way of storing the
distributed ledger distributed
information and doing the distributed
transaction across many cross
departmental cross organizations
business process so you're doing some
other example you can say these supply
chains for example you want to
understand like from where your food is
coming so there are so many components
so many places the food might have been
and how it was transported and all that
so using the block ledger blockchain
Ledger's this all this information can
be tracked and one other benefit of
block ledger is once the information
gets into the ledger
it cannot be repudiated it cannot be it
cannot be repudiated ok it's immutable
so no one can change it so if even if
like by mistake an organization makes a
bad entry into the ledger it cannot you
can't cover it around cover it anyone
watching out there all right ok so
that's I mean obviously the the number
of uses of its just based upon your
explanation is very multifaceted and as
you said it can solve maybe not world
peace but probably a lot of other issues
so tell us how Oracle kind of plays into
blockchain what's what this plan how
does they fit in
what's what's the roadmap look like sure
so let's look at like what Oracle is
Oracle serves the enterprise customers
we have four hundred and thirty thousand
customers and most of these are
enterprise customers who are running the
mission critical business application on
Oracle stack so these enterprise
customers have unique requirements I
said from any technology that they want
review the requirements are like a
scalability reliability they want the
performance security security of most
blockchain if you saw some of them so
what we are doing is we are creating a
blockchain cloud service on Oracle cloud
and we are making it enterprise grade if
you go actually in the open source and
all that you will find a number of
blockchain implementation but none of
them really cater to the enterprise
needs as search okay so that's what we
are doing here so that's one thing
second thing is Oracle is a very unique
position with respect to application
Oracle has a very comprehensive suite of
apps like HCM and fusion ERP and supply
chain and healthcare and whatnot
although suite what's happening is today
all these applications are running in
silos within an organization
I may have any RP you may have an ERP
but they are not talking to each other
so the consummation and all those things
have to take place what Oracle can do
what we can do actually is we can have
the DS ERP application connect through
the blockchain with each other so I have
a blockchain network on which my ERP is
connected to your ERP is connected to
one third party app is connected to now
if I make a transaction all of them have
the visibility of what they need to see
okay so that actually can reduce all
these business processes transaction
time considerably okay so like from page
two seconds to minutes and so on so
basically we help through the blockchain
application we see what I heard you say
was that we remove a lot of the silos so
that all of these different whether
they're ber peas or other applications
can can communicate with each other
right and we call it like extending the
boundaries of the enterprise uh-huh so
like Enterprise now doesn't have to be
enterprise application does not have to
be cyllid actually within one
organization it can be the cross
business
distributed and this blockchain can help
to increase the velocity of the Business
Network and so how does Oracle's
blockchain offering differ than what's
out there from I know you compared a
little bit with the open source which
obviously isn't enterprise grade and it
doesn't have some of the the features
that customers were on but how does it
can you come position it with respect to
what's out there in the market right so
first of all we are providing this cloud
service as a cloud service on Oracle
cloud so this would be a platform as a
service okay so once customer comes they
have actually a blockchain network
provision to them so they don't need to
worry about assembling all the
components together like a peers and
ordering service and consensus algorithm
and Ledger's and so on everything comes
preassembled to them cool they just
click a button and they have the
blockchain Network running so that way
the customers can focus just on the
business logic of their transaction that
is creating the smart contract ok and
not worry about any infrastructure
details the configuration details and
whatsoever so that's one thing it allows
developers and I as fees partners
everyone to start developing the
blockchain application and
experimentation very quickly so they can
within minutes they can start running a
blockchain use case the second thing is
for developers again we provide the REST
API driven development ok if you go to
the open source implementation all of
them have these native API is there but
REST API is well known concept everyone
can do that
we are they PA management and catalog
and all that you just pick up the API
from there and you call the smart
contract business logic and so on yes
again like very fast to do that the
third thing is the availability and
scalability and enterprise so that's
enterprise grade of the blockchain so we
are really focusing on that our
blockchain service offering that's going
to be highly available
zero downtime patching and all those
things as well as highly scalable so you
can have like hundreds of members in a
blockchain network as search and the
correspondingly increase in the business
transaction through port ok and
you can add actually all these members
dynamically to the block okay well
that's some pretty comprehensive
exciting so if folks out there want to
learn more about blockchain and what
article offers Kenda is it available now
is it what's where are things at and how
can they get more information about it
so we are in the early adopter program
at this point we are working with select
partners and customers have a very
specific use case they want to
experiment with date and they want to
implement it on our service so we
already have our ten or twelve customers
in the program so if someone is
interested they can approach us Oracle
through their account rep or through any
means okay and we can work with them in
getting them the early access version is
a controlled program is a private
program it's only invitation by
invitation only but there is a lot more
information available on all right so
off-camera so leaving blockchain aside
you mentioned you from New Jersey yes I
don't think I've been there but should I
any of the folks want to visit there
what's like one place you would
recommend to go and eat or to visit over
there eat outside but if I go to New
Jersey what would you recommend or go
and visit the Statue of Liberty the
stuff in New Jersey it's not in New York
guys people say it's a new year it's in
New Jersey you are you making a claim
here officially it's I have never heard
well folks you had this first an open
world 2017 I've never heard that before
dafuq thank you so much for coming and
sharing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
