really think that jackpots are going to
become one of the standard ways in which
employees and customers engage with you
and we all have mobile apps today and we
have a lot of mobile apps for example I
fly a lot
I have mobile apps from every airline
and I'm tired of having so many apps
messaging is becoming the most used app
on your phone whether it is iMessage
whether it is facebook Messenger
whatsapp or WeChat that's what we're
using the most and so now the next
generation of engagement with customers
and employees is through messaging where
I can friend for example the KLM chat
part and now when I say check-in it
checks me in and adds the my boarding
pass to my wallet when I land it tells
me this is the gate that you're going to
be landing at here's your departure gate
so it makes it very easy for us to
engage and built-in is behind it the
natural language processing to be able
to connect with Alexa Google home etc it
has in it the art shell intelligence to
understand the intent of what is the
customer trying to do it has the
integration to the various chart
platforms like Facebook Messenger and it
has the integration to the backend
systems that's what developers have to
do and leverage cloud services to make
it easy for them to build chat BOTS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
