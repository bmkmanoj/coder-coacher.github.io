right now I did a sort of google Summer
of Code projects and also interned at
Apple last summer so and I mainly
working with compiler static analysis
and code compass is one of the tools
that my team is working on okay and
we're good to go okay so as a
developer's we spend most of our time
reading code not writing it so it would
be great to have dueling to assist us
actually understand but legacy code does
so this tool is aimed to do just that so
let's do a quick demo this this is a so
llvm is parsed with this tool and I will
search for definition so code search is
one of the most basic most basic feature
that we actually need and with these two
we can visualize several properties of
the codes for example we might be
curious what are the weather inheritance
thatís looks like and right now I'm
interested in this instance school class
so so if I go to this instance core
class then I can I can Clary additional
information for example I might be
curious that how this class is used so
for example I could query but global
variables have this type or
functions have this as a parameter or
what functions return this type as a
parameter or I might be interested in
the methods that this class have for
example the public methods let's look at
this radical method and let's try to
actually understand what it does so
sorry oh but I will try to but it
doesn't really matter what is there i
would like to show mainly graphical
stuff so you can you will get the idea
even if you cannot see the text so first
i might be curious how this how this
method is used so one of the diagrams i
could query is a function call diagram
and in this case i can i can see what
functions call this function and also
but what functions are called by this
function and this also tracks virtual
cause so if this function might be
called because of virtual dispatch then
it is also marked on this diagram so i
can i can check where where this
function is used and from which source
file so i can i only already understand
how this function is used so let's let's
see how this function works so one of
the pain points when we try to
understand such functions is that it
cause on other functions which might be
in other source files and it would be
great to see all of the important pieces
of code next to each other so for
example if I click to a coil the code to
get origin xfer it is a it is just
another cool so basically that I might
be curious what this variable is and I
can see its type but I can also go to
other color chains and I can click the
cause until I get something that
actually has some interesting piece of
code and these code snippets are from
multiple files so basically it is very
easy to display only the relevant
information together close to each other
and we do not need to keep track of what
is the what is the code chain which
which function is in which file so it's
a very concise way to present this
information to the developer and once we
found for example the source of the bag
that we were working to solve then we
can check who introduced it using the
blame view so we also have the version
control information parsed in all along
side with the source code and this can
also be a great help for us thank you
