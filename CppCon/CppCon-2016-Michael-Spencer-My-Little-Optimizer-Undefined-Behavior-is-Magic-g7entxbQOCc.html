coming right Huck
I am Michael Spencer I'm a compiler
engineer at Sony Playstation working on
clang and LLVM as a single closed
front-end for our game teams and so I
was talk
my little optimizer undefined behavior
is magic an alternative title would be
vile awesome Iser
any sufficiently advanced optimization
is indistinguishable from magic it's not
really magic going on here but sometimes
it does feel like it so getting into
this first we gotta go some definitions
in C++ because the compiler doesn't just
like implement the hard or just isn't
just hardening the hardware it's
targeting the abstract machine or trying
to lower the abstract machine into down
to the hardware so well afford program
it's basically a program that compiles
successfully and doesn't violate the one
definition rule then there's
implementation to find behavior and so
that's basically there's lots of things
that just says our implementation to
find and that doesn't always necessarily
mean that it's gonna do something nice
it can like launch nethack if it feels
like that is generally a valid
implication fire behavior but standards
not designed to protect against
malicious implementations so so we're
generally ok with that
we've got unspecified behavior this is
like it's not always numerated wind is
like there's a note here generally it is
but not always and these are four things
that I mean it like a reasonable
implementation may not be able to
guarantee any specific behavior and so
it's not required to be documented and
then we have our favorite undefined
behavior so no requirements at all now
what are your flippin tations allowed to
do with undefined behavior no
requirements for the entire execution of
the program so if you find behavior
anywhere your whole program is is like
can do whatever it wants so what do
implementations actually do a lot now
the most common thing
that's gonna happen you're seeing
examples here is that the compilers
going to say undefined behavior can't
happen and since it can't happen then
I'm going to optimize assuming that it
can't so here's a really simple example
this might be there this is quite
similar to the Linux kernel bug which
was recently in the past few years we've
got this variable okay it's a bool we're
gonna we're going to check and see if we
actually have a value and then call blah
but first we'd be referenced it you had
a refactoring whatever it got moved up
there the compiler is gonna look at this
and say if okay we're null we would have
undefined behavior okay can't be not
this must be false remove it just call
blah and at runtime whatever could
happen you might get a seg fault but it
might just go go into blah and okay is
not it might be like some positive or
like it might have a one in the low bit
and it thinks everything's okay so how
does the compiler actually raise the
bottom to find behavior that's what I'm
really here to talk about so yeah a
couple ways to represent it and let's
backtrack for a second I'm gonna be
mainly explaining how LVM does things
cuz that's what I work on
but GCC and other compilers use very
similar reasoning so we have a way to
express unreachable meaning that this
this part of the code can never be
reached and we also have undef to
represent things that we don't know what
this value is and then there's also
implicit things which is things that the
optimizer knows can't have so we're
gonna take a brief detour into I'll be
my R so for those of you that know LVM
some of this I have omitted some parts
of the IR just to clarify or that it's a
simplified explanation so we've got
matching between you got your definition
of your function got definition over
there we have a load that be reference
to the load so it turns into a load in
the IR grammar conditional turns into an
Enter
compared not equal against no our branch
the return and the call so generally it
should be pretty obvious what it maps to
if at any point like it I don't clearly
explain what the IRF is unser it's
confusing you can interrupt and ask
let's explain unreasonable here so it's
an instruction can't be reached right
here we've had we have this this awesome
program we want to write out this value
and then we want to like let's say I
want to break up the debugger here so
I'm just gonna dereference 0 then I'll
give me a seg fault right well yeah so
this is what the the the optimizer sees
we've got a store and then a load from
Nome now the the it comes through here
looked at the store that's okay it looks
at the load sees load from null well
that that can't happen it's undefined
behavior that can't be reached replacing
with unreachable we also have an GCC and
all VM are claying support this built-in
unreachable that you can use generally
used for some optimization stuff but
let's her whenever up sit here and so
that means is that everything after it
can't be reached and everything before
it can't be reached either so we just
deleted that that store we don't know
what that was storing too but we clearly
can't get here so we'll remove it then
we have undef so here we have all right
we have a and initialized you know let's
use that to like get some extra random
seed for our random number generator
well a lot sizes not go like that
so a few cents for presented I did pull
too tough away so essentially it's gonna
be a equals on def because it's not
initialized we don't have a definition
for it we're gonna load from key and
then we're gonna return we're gonna add
pide and return it so the first thing
that the optimizer does is it looks at
that ad and it just turns it to undef
because undeath is is basically
represented as it can be any sequence of
bits we want at any point in the program
so here any fixed value plus an
unspecified value is going to be an
unspecified value so we can just fold
that away then star P is no longer used
a is no longer used in the return to
calculate the return value so we just we
all that that code and turn it on to
some subtleties about undef is it's not
always gonna fold unto us so here we
have a equals or X and undef and an and
so you could get this value if for or
you chose all one bits and for and you
chose all zero bits for undef that's a
perfectly reasonable thing to fold it to
you can also pull it to this if you
chose all zero bits for or and all one
bits for and what about this I can't do
that because now you've gotten rid of
the information about X is not possible
for for that to happen as long as an
interesting one is you know you want to
like clear register your X or the X 1
register with itself doesn't matter
what's there you'll get 0 all in all of
you our representation of it when you
XOR could be any value at any every time
it's looked at so that folds on death
not to 0 and then you divide by n def
things n so implicit undefined behavior
signed math can't overflow or underflow
so a minus B is greater than negative 1
so this looks like this and I are now
we've got a new little thing here NSW no
sign wrap if I under Florida would what
happened this would have a boy's value
and so the compiler looks at this and
says that since a minus B cannot
underflow a minus B will be greater than
negative 1 if a is greater than equal to
B so we removed the subtracting just
folded it into the cop so the kind of
undefined behavior is technically single
so here we've got an 8 and alone we're
gonna store two x5 started sorry so 5h
36 DK and
value of age and but we were sneaky and
main and cast our value to two different
things so and this is what's this
optimization is going to be known as
like s strict aliasing graph no strict
aliasing is what's going to hit this so
this was it looks like an IR this is a
simplified representation of how we do
tech based alias analysis what we're
gonna say for this that that string
after the TPA a is loads and stores only
a only alias if that string is the same
so the store to H in the loop and the
store decay by asserting that like int
long at the same thing then they can't
possibly be storing to the same value
because we just said that so we can
actually store to do sort of load
forwarding and just put five right there
directly don't need to load I got
another example here
termination so this is actually a fun
one from John Rhaegar's blog he actually
has an awesome blog embedded academia
and he's super serious not undefined
behavior so you wanted more read read
his blog
I guess example so we're gonna calculate
their wants serum well we're gonna
evaluate it and if we ever had a case
where it's true then we're gonna return
1 otherwise we're just gonna keep moving
over yeah what does this print prints
disproved how'd they optimize you do
that so it's actually pretty simple but
this is the what the IR looks like
ignoring so this is just the control
flow wasn't enough real on the slide for
the whole thing but the point thing that
note app note here is so this is raw
from clang without authorization is that
this is the only return it like didn't
even code didn't return 0 because it's
trivially trivially dead because it was
a wild one loop can't can't ever read
can't ever break out of that well it was
a break so since we know that and yeah
this little pass their procedural sparse
constant additional constant propagation
anyway basically just looked in the
Fermont saw the only thing you can
return is one so we can just clearly
forward that through and do control flow
graph simplification and just print out
disproved now this still hasn't actually
changed the behavior of the program yeah
we're still gonna run for month if it
ever returns we're gonna put true we're
gonna fit disproved like that's already
what we're doing what happens next is
that the optimizer also looks at Vermont
and it says you know what you did not
read or write mystique machine State
visible to the caller so we're gonna
stick read none on there then we take a
step over to the standard and
implementations may assume that this
thread will eventually do one of these
things
terminate io volatile access or tom cops
this does none of those and all it
doesn't do any of the bottom three and
it must terminate so we can just delete
it they just proved it now and see
explicitly
while one is one of these protected
classes so we actually have to add an
additional attribute and saying oh wait
you can't remove this in this case but
not for C++ is is infinite looping a
useful thing when you're not when you're
like when the Kyle compiler can prove
that you you have no externally visible
state if it is well then we need to
provide a way to express that not
necessarily always doing it because it
yes do that do there's lots of things
you can do the wild one though may be
reasonable mmm not sure but I think
people can decide that so I got an
example an octave lifetime some more
awesome code you'll notice all the code
in these examples there on these slides
is just beautiful
great things you want to write so about
this pointer let's open up a new block
making it let's sort the address and
then dereference up a perfectly
reasonable thing to do this is what I'll
be MCS we've got our so this Alaka is
basically just a laka and see it just
allocates it on the stack and we get
these lifetime markers so lifetime start
loads and stores to a before this are
dead because it wasn't alive before then
so clearly why'd you touch it and buy
time in flows the stories of this after
the search and so we look at these loads
and stores and that load loaded from a
well that was dead let's remove it and
now that store well nothing is loading
from it and we're about to end its
lifetime so we can move the store and
clean up everything else yeah you didn't
actually want to do anything in that
budget so references does this look good
yeah references can't be it
you can't find it all and so here's the
iris ease we've got a new little thing
here deep referenceable this means that
you can if you read from a you you are
it's valid to read up to four bytes so
the optimizer looks at this integer
compare against null says a can never be
known that would violate this let's fold
that to pulse then let's do some
inlining holdout to false
now this example was was actually a jf
told me about this example this is from
a recent bug from v8 they decided that
instead of taking up an extra field to
represent the these different types of
things they were just gonna use special
pointer values and they chose that 0 was
a great pointer value for none then do
you want it like so I want to check if
this thing is none well it's just this
equals equals done now this always has
to point to a valid object can't me know
so if it looks like an IR we add the
none non null tack now we actually had
to back this out because it broke a ton
of code but yeah but hopefully you can
eventually go back in once we get
everyone to use undefined behavior
sanitizer it'll like it we'll get rid of
em but yeah so in later I'm sorry
optimizer well yeah so we'll in line
first in line the none it's just no now
we have an icon gets null oh look can't
be no hold that you know oh look it's
false and hold it again
pulse oh look we could never be none
yeah took quite a while for the the
nodejs guys to get through that bug now
this was actually like just in the past
month so now signed under overflow this
is actually like a really hotly debated
thing is how it does this actually help
I'm not gonna be able to answer that
question today but here are some of the
optimizations it actually does so we've
got we're gonna multiply by 20 and then
divide by 2
well since if if that overflow if that
could overflow then we can't just change
that to 10 but since all right just
changed it to multiply by 10 but since
we know can't multiply by 10 got rid of
that expensive disk multiply by a
constant and then compare like it's zero
specifically
well we don't even need the multiply
because the scale doesn't matter all we
care paying it's a zero now this is may
look weird we don't have into gate Mel
VM because it's really simple to just do
subtract from zero to the gate so you're
dating two things and then comparing
them sign greater than and then we're
four is x + 5 is therefore is negative x
+ 5 is 8 y you can just do that and just
swap them no need to actually fully do
that and none of these optimizations
could be done on on on unsigned or if
you you have your mat if we made sine
overflow be defined behavior now what
this actually can hit is promotion so
here's our element access function we're
just gonna add x + y + access into a so
here's what the code looks like for
signs types and so we've got the no sign
wrap and the sign extent the get element
pointer is basically just the index
operation into a let me load so let's
make that you int and look at the code
here that's basically the same only
difference is that we now no longer have
the no side wrap and now it's a 0 sent
so when you lower this to x86 lovely may
be the difference the difference here is
that we do a we do that ad but it could
have overflowed and so in the unsigned
case we have to make sure that we only
take the low part in the sign case we
must use the 64-bit value directly and
you have to use 64-bit values for this
addressing mode which was better the
shorter one short is always been
not necessarily true but and so in this
example it's like I was just a single
exit instruction well like that can add
up like with all of your all of your
accessing functions you got to do that
and on each step you could have two and
then when you actually out into a loop
so here's our a pretty simple loop
we're in template it we're gonna do it
on signed and unsigned and yr so this is
actually what the messy IRA looks like
this is actually not completely raw I
ran today it has one pass or something
add a little bit right over it but if
you actually want to see the raw I are
out of playing run all that use of uo3
and disabled passes because if you don't
do oh three we actually omit some
information because later passes we'll
all like unconditionally use that for
optimization but after a little bit of
cleanup we've got a printable loop on
the right on the left side is the signed
and right side is on time so explaining
this so this is the first time we
actually could deal with this where
since we're the loop I can change each
each iteration and LV Mir is a single
static assignment form and that means
that you can only assign to something
once so a way to represent that is just
basic block arguments where when we come
into body when we come from the entry
block we just say that's 0 and that's
right there and then when we're coming
from the loop package we say that it's
the new value of I which we added to to
it this is new value and first we do a
little bit of clean up we got a clean up
the loop so that this we can do some
magic to it up here remove the add up it
the add didn't actually change anything
it didn't change the value of I if we if
we have to exit and then we simplify the
induction variable
and we just add a bunch in you code it
there why do we have a list Nico
well you'll note that we return ret gret
seer takes four four is up there this
whole loop body is dead now we're able
to completely fold away that way and why
were able to do that well because if we
go back to our original sequence what's
good all we're doing here is getting in
and getting the the even value less than
or equal to it so if if n is odd then it
gets n minus one and if it's even it
just returns it and so if we look over
here that's exactly what this is doing
we compare getting at zero because if it
is negative
something weird happens I think you get
untie behavior here or yeah witches
can't have na interpreting loop so under
I mater and then we so we just do a max
operation then we add one and then
actually remove that one that that just
folds to an and of the removes a little
bit while our unsigned case actually
still has the full code of a full loop
because when induction variable
simplification came in and it does like
that's actually part of the optimizer I
don't fully understand but basically
what it does is it looks over so I as
the inductive variable it looks at that
and it actually forms some crazy
mathematical expression about how it's
changing every every time and then looks
at what the beginning and end conditions
are and uses that to try and either
simplify it or completely remove the
loop and it failed on unsigned because
with plus 2 if n is unsigned
max this actually becomes an infinitely
now infinite loops where all I'd have
those technically they could have hold
folded this thing - I don't know if -
lab the folds - undef I think it might
have been but it cuz I got rid of it it
doesn't actually do that but that's
basically one of the but the sign course
unsigned is it doesn't heavily limit the
reasoning that these optimizations can
do no well it could it could have
reduced the same code that's perfectly
valid because I believe that this can
just be it becomes undefined behavior
and then it can become whatever it was
but it didn't all of iam doesn't was not
able to reason that far for for indexing
and for your loop bounce anything that
has bounced or influences of loop bounds
yes and you sanitizers so that you don't
and and good fuzzing so that you can
actually figure out if you do have ever
accidentally overflow what in some loops
it like it doesn't matter but there
there there are loops where's the
difference between signed and unsigned
is like 25% because it's able to get a
get rid of a lot of weird sign extending
stuff it has to do or it's just able to
much better calculate loop bounds
so our next example here realloc this
was actually another one from John
records blog which was actually us soon
yet he held a contest for like what's
the craziest time to find behavior you
can find there are the most surprising
and Nick knew lucky who used to work on
all of you submitted this one so what do
we think this Prince can you want to
guess - - yes - - is a reasonable guess
like you would think so if being Q are
equal there they have the same address
how can they put different inks yeah one
- how does how does all of you do this
so like I thought this was gonna be
actually a little bit complicated but it
turned out to be pretty simple
seriously I are I did omit the branch so
the only thing missing here is this if T
equals equals Q because it actually has
nothing to do with the analysis stuff
the optimizer does you know another new
keyword here no alias so malloc and all
the allocation functions have this
property that the return value aliases
nothing else in the program and it's
included Rioch relock may choose not to
move anything but it still invalidates
the old pointer and we model this so we
put no way on this so we've got the
store to P start of Q load P load Q use
the values start a load forwarding what
comes in here it goes look at P are the
load of P it goes backwards finds the
store the P of 1 then it looks to see if
anything could have invalidated that and
it's used to sort of cute it goes and
does some alias analysis and says well
beam Q can't be the same value because
we've got this new alias attribute so
you know what we're just gonna afford
that so well 1 2 or print 1 2 and that
if doesn't even matter at runtime they
happen to be equal so prints 1 2
um it could have done that
does that sorry all right so the
question was why didn't it proved that
they were false and Richard over here
they pointer quality and and memory
quality is orthogonal I don't I don't
actually know I don't remember what I'll
gain guarantees there because there's
like there when you're at this level
there's the LLVM like lane graph
what are we guarantee about rir and
there's actually c++ and it's clangs job
to map c++ semantics to LLVM semantics
but so I don't actually know I don't
even know if do you Richard you actually
know if by language rules if you'd be
able to assume that that was false
maybe it's an interesting one this one I
actually I really like this example how
much do people think that we can
optimize this we've got sequentially
consistent stars and loads so what's the
consistent means that there's a total
ordering across all threads this is the
only thread we're looking at the only
function we're looking at out at then
that the optimizer now Fraser might not
know about anything else in the program
you can just see this and it knows that
we've got x and y so any any guesses
about what we can optimize this to
which do I still have to store zero oh
they have been in it may have been
written to something else it does that
part doesn't matter here so this is what
we've got NIR our store and then OPM
explicitly models Atomics as it turns
out there out are optimizations you can
do on them so we've got our sequentially
consistent store and a sequentially
consistent load comparison and then some
branches and store if it was here so the
first thing we do is what you said which
is you can forward that and why can we
do that well because while there is a
total order we can assume that but not
just assume we can just say that o our
total order was this and nothing can
observe could have observed can observe
the difference so we foldable that away
yeah we've got this now can we remove
that x equals zero well let's take a
look at what the standard says bunch of
words but basically what this is saying
is sequentially we have a total of a
total order of all loads of sorts the
program if data race-free and we look
here can another pro like if another
thing reads X so so another thing is
waiting on zere
on on why to be set to zero and then and
then it reads X right after that is that
a data race yep so that's a day race and
so we can't have beta races so remove
that a store to the store so this was
this is surprising to a lot of people as
a bit surprising to me but after we
think about it for a while it's like
yeah you can do that elohim doesn't do
those GCC doesn't do this yes and i will
plug a talk about this later but we do
it we do LVM does do a few things it's
just not aggressive we did at one point
we were a little bit aggressive but it
was either wrong or we weren't sure with
a model or something and that got backed
out and so we're pretty conservative
right now but but we can be more and i'm
not i DC doesn't do this i don't know if
it does other things but they're
definitely allowed to so we've got all
this undefined behavior what can you do
about it because you're like things go
wrong your program doesn't work in an
optimized build works fine and debug and
you have no idea why and because the
compilers are now so aggressive about in
fly behavior like the result this makes
no sense there's like paradoxes this
value was both true and false at the
same time like everything's everything's
going crazy well first thing warnings
have you all to be actually w this like
these warnings will actually catch
almost all of the examples here but no
one writes like code like this generally
these under five behaviors will come in
through inlining or through more
complicated things so
sanitize and fuzz you've got dressing
tiser undefined behavior sanitizing
thread memory and now efficiency and
data flow and a few others but but like
so for my testing I like I always run
undefined the dress because you can run
them together and that catches so much
and it points you exactly to where it is
I'm I've been talking with lots of talks
about it about these sanitizers so if
you haven't used them yet you definitely
should and but if you're doing this it's
run time so you have to have good
fuzzing and good coverage and that ik
analysis we've got clang primary to keep
us to view among the others that will
all help you find these bugs so what
does the committee doing about this
problem well about is it is it a problem
but what's happening in the committee
about this so su 12 undefined behavior
I got a steady group for it what have
they done well in sea level 17 we have
strengthened the order of argument
evaluation it is not not totally ordered
but does not have a guaranteed order but
you are no longer allowed to slice like
it's no longer like you can't have like
inner leave all the operations at the
same time it's like it happens in some
order we also got rid of undefined
behavior oh no we are getting rid of
undefined behavior the free processor
that one's like like not actually going
to hit you at runtime but it's like
there's no reason to have it in a
preprocessor
like I I don't know the examples there's
some weird like if you paste tokens in
the wrong way and form something it's
like I know my behavior or there's weird
things like compilers are good they
don't they don't like erase your hard
drive when they hit that case but again
malicious compilers making them Thompson
copy saver there's something so you
currently can't deal with them copy that
program was expected to be able to do
and so we're trying to make those things
well define behavior and they're all
getting rid of unneeded undefined
behavior and that can be really
controversial like oh do you need this
do we need this but there are some that
are pretty honest rippers
uncontroversial where it's things that
like this is something that every
programmer does and like compilers don't
want like they don't even really want
optimize it it's not useful to optimize
but it currently undefined and those
kind of things are good to get defined
our light are pretty unconventional
so if you're interested in more oncoming
behavior there are some more talks here
Chandler will be giving a talk which is
much less about the like why is the
compiler giving this and more ways of
thinking about undefined behavior and
Jeff as is no same compiler with
optimize talks not not entirely about on
to my behavior but much more in detail
about atomic optimization so any
questions
so so I actually had a friend who's an
artist and I'm sorry what's up with the
pony I I had a friend or sorry I have a
friend who's noticed that I was like she
was like oh I might be the opening
Commission's up I was like do I actually
want anything drawn I was like you know
what I want an LVM Tony so made that
then I show that some people in the
Elven community and Jay s on he's like
you know what we should do an April 1st
post so we actually planned that and jf
wrote up a a blog post about where it
was like changing the motto to say yeah
LLVM on defined behaviors magic we're
gonna like there's been all this
discussion about on the fire behavior
now we're gonna we're gonna be all nice
about it or or something like that but
that was pretty fun
so why is unsigned sry his sign to
overflow into find behavior but unsigned
not so the reason I originally heard for
this was that back in the day there was
one of the implementation or one of the
processors would trap on signed overflow
and so it's just like at sunup my
behavior yes yes ask IBM and yeah so why
I like they could have chosen
implementation defined behavior or like
delineate the set of behaviors but so I
don't know exactly why it was originally
now though it has remained so because
compilers make heavy use of this
information while optimizing I did try
an example with that I don't I wasn't
able to get sorry you get a repeating
question so comparison of pointers to
different objects is undefined behavior
and but stood less can compare any
pointer and it's well defined are any
two pointers in its well-defined
I forgot actually the last part of it
is that something that the optimizers
can use or should it be cut
Elvia doesn't currently use it I heard
that I'm aware of
I think GCC does there was a that might
have been pointer overflow I'm actually
not sure if DC's he does so I'm not sure
I could actually answer that if nobody's
using it it could be considered but it
also doesn't really make sense to
compare pointers to different objects
yeah it does so and the reason why so
you can convert to entirety and do the
comparison which is an implementation to
find mapping but it like isn't going to
map to pointers that are different to
the same value it's not a lot to do that
so either way I'm not not really sure so
currently the accessing the yeah
accessing the is right so the question
was I was explaining the question
without first saying that yeah so the
question was accessing the non active
member of a union is currently undefined
behavior and and one of my thoughts on
that or opinion of that well there are
things that the that employees can do
that trying to give a good example here
so it's not just that like that
compilers can take advantage of this
like LVN explicitly does it take
advantage of this and I think GCC
doesn't either
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and so olivine does the same thing
probably because of GCC now the problem
is like making it well defined behavior
is like you an example here might be
like a float in an INT like you might
try to access it as a float but it was
actually a trap value and now you got a
trap on you and well whatever can happen
and that sense you don't know what the
active memory is you might not actually
be able to like guarantee a certain
behaviour that we could say I'm
specified behavior but I don't know how
hard it would be to make that
well-defined
so if I can if I'm able to summarize
that there's a problem with with you
with actually was a union of an int and
float and if you even only accessing the
integer part it would I actually missed
like it would write a different value or
while using it as an integer it would it
would use the FPU to do loads and stores
and if that became a bad value then you
got this weird yeah so if we were to
give like full well specified to that we
would also have to like specify unsigned
the sign conversion and an alignment all
these things but in more generally yeah
you'd have to say like when you take
this bit value and putting this bit
value or in this other tight like what
does that mean for basically every
conversion any other questions
okay we're good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
