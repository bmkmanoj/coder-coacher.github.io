Thanks for coming, it's
really great to be here.
So, coroutines, what can't they do?
What can they do?
What are they, how do they work?
Hopefully we'll make a
little bit of progress
answering or at least maybe
asking these questions.
So, start with a little
intro to set the context.
So what am I gonna be talking about?
So, there's lots of different things that
get called coroutines,
there's lots of things
called coroutines in
languages that aren't C++.
There's lots of things
called coroutines in C++ but
I'm specifically talking about
the technical specification
called C++ extensions
for coroutines, also known as N4680,
to it's friends currently,
so I'll just refer to
that as the TS from now on
with a little link there.
It's just a little, there's
a little screenshot of
the front page, just to give you a flavor
for how exciting it is inside.
It's actually quite an easy
read, it's quite short,
it's quite nice.
So, but what's the TS talking about?
Well, apart from coroutines,
it is an extension to C++.
It includes three new keywords
and some new customization points,
so that's largely what I'll
be talking about in this talk,
how those keywords work,
what the customization points are
and what it does is enables some new kinds
of control flow or new to C++.
So, experts, I'm gonna sort of run through
how the transformation
inside the compiler works,
not in complete low
level detail but sort of
at a source transformation level.
So first of all, what's a coroutine?
So, it is a generalization of a function,
so coroutines are functions
but they're functions that
have extra capabilities.
So on the left there
is a diagram that shows
a caller calling a normal function,
so when you call a function,
control flow is transferred
to the function,
the function runs to
completion until it returns
and then control flow
transfers back to the caller
at the point where it calls the function,
so that should be pretty familiar
to people who have
called functions before.
The interesting thing about that,
well, I guess the boring
thing about that is that
the function that's
called runs to completion
and the caller waits for
it and doesn't continue
until the function's finished.
So, on the right, we have a coroutine,
so in this particular case,
the caller calls the coroutine,
so that's the same as
calling a function but
this shows off a couple
of the extra capabilities
of coroutines, so one is
the coroutine can suspend,
which transfers control
flow back to it's caller
and then the caller carries on and then,
at some point later,
the caller can initiate a
resume of the coroutine,
which transfers control
flow back to the coroutine
and it resumes at the point
where it was suspended
and then when the coroutine returns it's
just like a function returning,
control flow goes back
to the call and function.
So there's a couple of
other interesting things
that make coroutines
different to functions
or at least more capable than functions
than non-coroutine
functions, I should say.
So, on the left there,
we see pretty much the
same thing as we had
on the previous slide but the first caller
can actually return back to it's caller
without resuming the
coroutine and the coroutine
stays alive, so the
lifetime of a coroutine
is not intimately tied to
the lifetime of it's caller,
like a regular function is.
So then we can have some other function
resume the coroutine sometime later and
that other function can be
running on some other thread,
for example, so there's an
interesting control flow
from the point of view of the coroutine
that's possible there
where the coroutine can
suspend the one thread
and potentially resume
on a different thread
and the other interesting control flow
that coroutines have is
they can be destroyed,
so on the right there,
we see one caller calls the coroutine,
the coroutine suspends
and the control flow
transfers back to the caller
and then later on,
the coroutine can be destroyed,
which transfers the flow of control
right to the very end of the coroutine,
where the destructors and everything run,
everything gets cleaned up and the bit
in the middle of the coroutine
is completely skipped
and that's quite useful
as we'll see later on.
Here's a really simple example
of a coroutine, it's on
the right hand side there,
the coroutine, it's called calculate.
It's a coroutine that's
so nice I wrote it twice.
All it does is it performs
some expensive calculation
and then returns the result so,
you can see here, the first
of the three new keywords,
co_return and the other interesting thing
is the return type is coroutine,
so this lazy type is something
that I've just invented
out of whole cloth for this presentation,
that is where a lot of the
customization points sit.
So, this slide shows two
different ways that this
coroutine can be used,
so the first one, along the top,
is where the caller calls the coroutine
but never uses the result,
so in that case, you can
see when this lazy result
goes out of scope, the
destructor of the coroutine's
called, destroys the coroutine,
oh sorry, the destructor
of that lazy class
destroys the coroutine
and the expensive work
is not done, in that case,
'cause no one wanted to do it.
The second case, you
can see the caller calls
this dog gate, which
resumes the coroutine,
performs the expensive
work, returns a result and
all is well.
So this shows sort of a
artist's impression, I guess, of
what the compiler does
to the coroutine body,
so this is not exact,
it's not specified like this in the TS
but this is kind of what, yeah,
the TS has an example like
this, I didn't just make it up.
So, on the left there
is the coroutine body,
just the same as on the
previous slide except
slightly more colorful and on the right
is what the compiler kind of
generates under the covers.
So, the first thing it
does is it needs to find
out the promise type,
so that is the primary
customization point for a coroutine,
so it looks that up
using this class template
or coroutine traits, so it feeds into that
as gen plate parameters the
return type of the coroutine
and the types of any parameters,
so there are no parameters in this case,
which makes it easy.
So, that coroutine trait
specialization needs to define
a promise type,
so then an object of that type is created,
it looks like a local variable here,
but it's actually stored in something
called the coroutine state,
which is a separate block of memory,
so I'll describe that soon.
So then the promise object, p here,
that gets asked for the return object,
which is what the caller of the coroutine
will receive as the return value
and then the promise
is given an opportunity
to provide an initial suspend,
so that allows the coroutine to suspend
before executing any of the body.
In the case of lazy,
that's quite important
'cause that's what allows
it to not go and do
the expensive work in
the body of the coroutine
until asked for.
So I'll explain what
co_await does shortly,
so co_await is the second
of the three new keywords,
so then the original body of
the coroutine is executed,
co_return turns into
a call to return_value
on the promise object,
so the promise object
can decide what happens with that value
that's being returned
and then because we are
returning from the coroutine,
we skip over the rest of the body,
we can't go to 'cause
there's no rest of the body
in this case.
If an exception is thrown
by the coroutine body,
the promise object gets
a chance to handle that
in it's unhandled exception member
and then, at the end of the
body is the final suspend point,
so the promise again, gets a chance to
suspend the coroutine
at the end of the body,
which is not useful for
lazy but can be useful
for other things and then
after that is the point where
a destroyer of the coroutine will jump to.
So the coroutine state is
where the promise object,
copies of any parameters to the coroutine,
any local variables
that the coroutine uses
and also any information that
is needed to identify where
to resume the coroutine
is stored, so this is some block of memory
which is dynamically allocated,
in a number of cases,
and given a sufficiently smart compiler,
that that allocation can
be elided but in general,
there has a dynamic allocation
and the exact way that allocation happens
is under the control of
the promise object again
or the promise type.
So this coroutine state gets created when
the coroutine's called and gets destroyed
at the end when control flows
off the end of the body,
so that can be either when
the coroutine is destroyed
or when it finishes it's final suspend.
So, co_await, that
again, expands into more
kind of pseudo-code.
So on the left there,
we've got a call to co_await,
so x there is the thing
that is being co_awaited,
sometimes called an awaitable but
I have used the word
awaitable to mean something
that's totally in this talk so
there's confusion over that terminology,
I apologize for that.
So why is what co_await returns,
well, it's the result of
the co_await expression,
so, on the right there is what
the compiler does for you,
so this h is a coroutine handle,
so, I'll say more about
coroutine handles soon
but that's what allows the
promise and cooperating classes
to control the coroutine.
So first off, the promise
object is given a chance
to transform the awaited object,
so, if there's an await transform member
in the promise type, then
that gets passed x there,
that's optional, so that
doesn't have to be there,
if that's not there then a just becomes x.
So then there's this new
operator called co_await,
so if there's a operator co_await
for whatever a is, then that gets called
and the result of that is used.
If there isn't one then
e just becomes a,
so then, we've got e,
which is what I'm gonna
refer to as an awaitable.
So that is another thing that
allows you to customize
the behavior of co_await,
so that has three members,
so the first is await_ready,
so that returns a bool and if that's true,
then it means the
coroutine will not suspend
and it will immediately carry on.
If it's false, then the
coroutine is considered suspended
and when the coroutine is suspended,
that means it can be resumed or destroyed.
So, if it is suspended,
then await_suspend is called and that's
past the coroutine handle,
so that gets a chance to
do something to the coroutine.
It might wanna stash that handle away.
It might want to destroy the coroutine,
it could even resume the coroutine.
So after that, if the
coroutine is still suspended,
then control goes back to the caller
and then once the caller
resumes the coroutine,
control comes back here
at that resume level
and then the coroutine
is considered resumed
so then after all that's happened,
the awaitable gets a chance to
supply the result of
the co_await expression
via await_resume.
So co_yield is the third
of the new keywords and
if you weren't looking carefully
you might not have seen anything
change on the screen there,
so, it's pretty much exactly
the same as co_await,
two differences.
One is at the first customization point
that the promise gets a crack
at is called yield_value
instead of await_transform.
The other is, it sets in
a slightly different point
in the grammar, so the
precedence rules are different
but otherwise, it works exactly the same.
So while we're going through
these transformations,
there's an extra one, extra bit of syntax
called for co_await, which is
just like arranged for loop
with a co_await stuck in it
and that gets transformed into
the same thing as a range for loop
but with co_await stuck in
it in a couple of places so
in particular, there's a
co_await on the result of begin
on the range, which means that can be,
could be an asynchronous operation or
whatever the coroutine actually is,
whatever co_await means in this context
and the other place is when
iterating the, incrementing the iterator.
So otherwise, it works
just like a range for loop,
except the thing that's being ranged over
is not a range, as per normal,
it's sort of an awaitable range,
it's a different sort of concept where the
begin on the range and the
increment on the iterator
has a slightly different type
because it can be co_awaited,
well it must be co_awaited.
So I'll show an example of why
this might be useful later.
So coroutine handle, I mentioned,
so this is kind of like
a non-owning pointer
to the coroutine state,
so it has, it's destructor
doesn't do anything,
that's the important thing to remember
and it has a default constructed state
where it doesn't point at any coroutine,
so there's a operator bool which tells you
whether it is in the
default constructed state
or whether it's not.
It provides a way of getting
at the promise object,
which is really useful.
You can also go from the promise object to
a corresponding coroutine handle,
so these things can be trivially,
not trivially but easily copied.
They're really cheap, they're
just a pointer basically
and the gut of what the
coroutine handle is for is
it allows you to resume
or destroy the coroutine.
So if you're dealing with one of these,
you need to know whether
the coroutine is currently
suspended or not.
If it is not suspended,
then you must not call, resume or destroy.
There's not really any assistance
for you in that regard,
so yeah, this is kind of for dealing with
coroutine handles, writing
the coroutine abstractions is
kind of for people who are
thinking very carefully
and it's fun to de-bug too.
Okay, so a quick word about return values.
So coroutines transfer control back
in more than one way.
So there's the first time
they transfer control
back to their caller and
that's when they return
the actual return value of the coroutine.
The other way they
transfer control back is
when they suspend,
so, when the coroutine suspends,
it will transfer control back,
either to the caller or the resumer so
there's just a minor
difference in terminology.
A caller is what's
expecting the actual return
value of the coroutine, a
resumer is something that
doesn't get any return value back,
so the first time the
coroutine returns or suspends,
it goes to it's caller
and it returns a value,
subsequent times it goes to a resumer and
doesn't return a value.
Okay, so, how do we actually
implement this lazy,
lazy kind of coroutine thing?
So, what we need to do is we need to
implement a promise type,
which I'm calling lazy promise,
which I forward to clear because
the lazy class itself needs to refer to it
and it needs to refer to the lazy class.
So, first of all, we'll define
the lazy class template itself.
So start with it's private stuff.
So the constructor is
private because it's only
either constructed by the promise object,
so that's why the promise
type has made a friend,
there's other ways of handling that but
for exposition I've done it that way.
So when it's constructed,
it gets passed a reference
to the promise object
and it just converts it
into a coroutine handle
and stores that away.
It also has an optional storing the value
that's being computed, starts
out empty to indicate that
we haven't computed the value yet.
So then the public interface of lazy is
basically just this get member,
so what we're doing there is we say
we haven't got the value yet,
we'll go and calculate the value
and then we'll return the value,
so in order to calculate the value,
we resume the coroutine so there's
a little bit of an awkward interaction,
which seems to often come
up with the stuff where we
need to tell the promise
where it should store
the value once it's
been calculated because
resume doesn't return anything,
so then we're passing off
the address of the optional
that we're storing the
value in after the promise
and then we resume the coroutine,
so that resume will return
once the coroutine has finished
executing then we null
out our coroutine handle,
which is important if you
look at the destructor there,
so in the destructor of lazy,
if we still have a coroutine handle,
if the coroutine handle
still points at a coroutine,
which means that nobody ever called get,
then we can destroy the
coroutine and skip over
the expensive calculation.
So the lazy promise, on the right there,
you can see it has a
pointer to an optional,
which gets set when the
lazy is ready to receive
the value that's calculated.
So get_return_object returns
one of these lazy objects
passing a reference to the promise,
initial_suspend uses the special type,
which is part of the coroutine's TS
called suspend_always,
so that's an awaitable type
that always returns false
from await_ready, so that
says we're going to suspend
at the initial suspend point.
So return_value, so
that's when the coroutine
called co_return, then
we populate the optional
with the value that was returned,
unhandled_exception, we
swallow and do nothing because
I didn't write that part so there's also,
yeah, you should probably
do something with
the exception in that case.
So final_suspend, we use suspend_never,
which is another provided awaitable type
which just returns true from await_ready,
so we don't suspend at
the final suspend point,
which means that the coroutine
will fall off the end and
be cleaned up after it's returned
and then the final part of the puzzle is
to specialize coroutine
traits for coroutines
that return any kind of
lazy and take any arguments
and we just say the promise_type
is our lazy_promise.
Okay, so now I'm gonna
say a few things about
the usual suspects for coroutines,
so lazy sequences and async stuff.
I'm not gonna say a lot about those.
I think there's probably
better talks about that stuff
at this very conference.
So, lazy sequences or generators,
the coroutine is on the
right here so we've got
something that returns a generator event,
which just gives you more
or less infinite list of
prime numbers and the
call is on the left there.
It just looks like a normal loop
and it is a normal loop.
The nice thing there is that
the coroutine doesn't need to care about
the termination condition,
that's taken care of in the caller,
so the caller just stops calling it
when it's had enough and
the coroutine won't
deliver any more values
if it's not asked for them.
So async stuff, this is probably
one of the big two killer
features for coroutines,
which I'm not saying
much about in this talk.
So let's say we wanted
to have some sort of,
I don't know, web
service or something that
tells us whether a
number's prime and we want
that to be asynchronous because
it could take awhile
so on the right there,
we've got a coroutine that
does a couple of asynchronous operations,
uses co_await to suspend if the value's
not available immediately,
so this return type task here is
not completely invented out of whole cloth
but it's not part of the coroutine TS,
it's something that you need to provide
or find in a library.
So then the caller gets
this task object back
and then order to get the value out of it,
it needed to use co_await,
so the caller needs to be a coroutine,
in this particular case,
you could have a return value that doesn't
require the caller to be a coroutine but
things kind of line up
more nicely if they are.
So the nice thing about this
is you can write your code,
you can write normal
loops and ifs and things
as though everything was synchronous,
just sprinkle a co_await here and there,
but it's actually
asynchronous and will suspend
the operation until the result's ready.
So you can combine the two
and have an async generator,
so that's something that works
just like a generator but
instead of using a range for loop over it,
you could use a range four co_await loop.
So, if you want to use
this stuff now, you can.
So, as far as I know, there
are two working implementations
of the TS, Visual Studio
has had an implementation
since 2015, I think, 2017 is recommended.
You just need to stash your white flag
and clang 5.0 with libc++
has an implementation,
which is pretty cool.
So, that just gets you the raw TS,
which gives you coroutine
handle and coroutine traits and
a couple of other things.
It doesn't really let you built, well,
it lets you build
everything but it doesn't
give you any high level abstractions so
there's a few libraries that I know of
that provide some of these abstractions.
So one called cppcoro,
so that provides task,
generator, async generator,
some async mutex stuff,
some other really cool
stuff for dealing with
async things, highly recommend that.
The range-v3 library has
a generator implementation
which works nicely with
the range-v3 library.
I am certain there are others,
so if you're working on any or know of any
that are awesome, please let me know,
I'm always interested to
find out about this stuff.
So, just gonna say a couple of things
about slightly
unconventional things you can
do with coroutines.
So this is my personal interest,
well, my sub-interest,
in the coroutine space.
So let's consider an
example where we have some
functions that return optional values so,
say we're wanting to parse
some values out of a stream,
so we can read a word
and it'll either return
a string, which is the word,
or an empty optional,
which would be the case
if there isn't a word in the stream.
So, similarly we can parse_int,
it either gives you an int if there is one
or there isn't, it
doesn't and parse_double
and then the interesting thing
which we're going to
implement is a combination
of parse_int and parse_double
called parse_vector so
we're gonna parse the count first,
which is an int and then that many doubles
and it either gives you a vector or
if the stream doesn't contain an int
followed by that many
doubles than it will give you
an empty optional.
So, this is kinda how I'd write that,
not using anything fancy
so we call parse_int,
that gives us an optional back,
we need to check if it's
empty and we can return empty,
if it's not than we can carry on,
use their number and
then we just loop over
that many times, call parse_double,
it gives us an optional,
you check if it's empty.
If it is empty, we return empty,
otherwise we carry on to the next one.
So, it is possible to
write this as a coroutine
and remove a lot of the boilerplate code.
So you'll notice the ifs
have gone and all the
early returns have gone.
This actually works the same
way as the previous one,
so we've put co_await in the places where
we want to unwrap an optional and
inside that, that can
cause the coroutine to
exit early and return an int optional
or it can carry on.
How can this be possible?
Well, strictly speaking, it's kind of not
if you're talking about standard optional
is my understanding is that
it's not allowed to
specialize a class template
from a standard namespace without any user
defined types in it but
it works anyway.
It works so,
we're specifying a promise type here
called optional_promise, so,
this optional_promise
and it's await_transform.
It says that you're allowed to await,
well, if you await on
any kind of optional,
then we're gonna return this
special optional_awaitable
type which is gonna control
suspension, et cetera.
So, the awaitable, so in await_ready,
if the optional that was
co_awaited on has a value
than await_ready returns true which means
the coroutine just carries
on without suspending
and then goes to await_resume,
which just takes the
value out of the optional.
If the optional doesn't have a value
then we go into await_suspend,
we get given a handle to the coroutine
and then we just destroy the coroutine
and well, we tell the
promise somehow that we're
going to return an empty optional.
That bit's a bit tricky.
I haven't mentioned that here,
there's code on GitHub if
you want the gory details
of how that works but
we destroy the coroutine,
which means that we don't
execute the rest of it.
So what if optional is not
quite enough information?
Well luckily, the exact
same approach works.
If you've got something
that's like optional,
so for example, if you had
an expected class template,
which could either be a
value or some kind of error,
you could use that.
The implementation of the
coroutine stuff for that
is pretty much the same.
So if you want to play
with optional coroutines,
I wouldn't say if you want
to use it in production
but if you want to play with it,
so there's some stuff on my git hub,
which works with standard optional
but only works on clang, unfortunately.
There's a basic expected
implementation as well there.
Just recently the folly
optional type from Facebook
has grown support for coroutines,
so that's not standard
optional but it's still
a pretty good optional.
It's a good option, you could say
and the magic there is that
works on clang and MSVC,
which is pretty clever.
So, there's also a folly expected,
which doesn't yet have
coroutine support so,
that would be quite a good little project
if someone wanted to play
around with this stuff,
I'm sure they'd appreciate a poll request.
So the other potentially interesting idea,
so this is something that I stole from Gor
is that you can get a kind of type erasure
out of the coroutine machinery,
so the interesting thing,
the thing is that the
body of the coroutine can
have more type information than
the return type of the coroutine,
so this is appropriate about
to digest this code, honestly,
but what we've got,
we've got a coroutine there,
that create function there is a coroutine
so it's a static member function
which is cool, coroutines
can be static or non-static
member functions.
So this is a template also,
so that template parameter f is
more specific type
information than is apparent
in the return value of that coroutine,
so that coroutine and the return type
just encodes the return
type in the arguments
of the function, not the
actual type of the function
and when that coroutine
yields the function,
the yield value member
in the promise type,
on the right there, gets called and that
can be a template, so that can recover
the exact type of the function.
So using this, you can
build something that's
kind of like std function
but just works completely differently.
So, one of the nice
things about that is that
if the compiler can see everything you're
putting into this coroutine func thing
and it can see the caller,
then it can potentially inline everything
and get rid of all of the allocations
and make all of the
coroutine machinery go away.
It's quite a cool thing to see.
When I say the compiler,
I mean clang currently
but hopefully other compilers
in the future as well.
Otherwise, if the compiler
can't see everything,
it's gonna have overhead,
it's gonna have dynamic allocation.
It's gonna have,
essentially, virtual dispatch
in there so, it's not
gonna be much different to
std function.
I think mostly, this is
interesting just as a sort of
a bit of a head scratcher and a,
that's interesting, what
can we build with that?
So there's some code on
my GitHub to play with,
I wouldn't say it's useful
as it is but it's intriguing.
So, in summary,
coroutines are a
generalization of functions,
so that's a message that
I think is important to
bear in mind, coroutines are functions,
they're just functions that
have extra capabilities.
So the usual suspects for
coroutines that we talked about,
generators and async things
and async generators even,
I think that's probably
going to be the vast
majority of users of coroutines
but I think there's a
lot of other interesting
applications of coroutines that
we're only just starting to explore,
so there's the optional and expected case.
I'm currently working on
trying to extend that to
other monotic operations.
There's the type-erasure example which
I'm sure has some
interesting applications.
I really want to hear what they are.
So, thank you very much for your attention
and I'll be happy to take any questions.
(audience applauds)
Yeah, go ahead.
- [Audience Member] Hi,
as someone who programs
in Haskell occasionally,
my Spidey sense tingled
throughout the talk,
it seems like coroutines are very similar
or an extension of or a
special case of Monads.
I was wondering if you could
talk about that at all?
- Yeah, sure.
That's along my line of thinking exactly.
So, coroutines themselves don't have a lot
to do with Monads, I think but
you can build something similar
to Haskell's do notation,
which is what I was thinking
with the optional example there.
So, I don't think you can
build the full generality of
Monads using coroutines.
For example, the
nondeterminism Monad requires
going back and executing
parts of the coroutine again
and that's simply not
possible with the coroutine
to TS, you can only move forward.
You can't go back in time,
so unfortunately, you
can't build everything
that Haskell has but
it's certainly possible to
build a really useful subset
and I'd love somebody
to tell what category
theoretical subset that is.
- [Audience Member] Monads are
the, monoids and the category
of endofuncters, didn't you know that?
I have no idea what that means.
- Yeah, no, I thought
they were burritos but.
(audience member laughs)
Awesome.
- [Audience Member] Thank you.
- Thanks.
Oh, we'll alternate.
- [Audience Member] So
when you spoke about
the type-erased callable,
so you said like in principle
if the compiler can see
this much of the code than
it can optimize things away.
It seems to me that that's
pretty similar to saying
if I'm line one, you assign
a lambda to a std function
and then on line two you call it,
the compiler can optimize that out because
it knows what that std function holds.
So I guess I didn't really sort of get it,
like what is,
what are coroutines letting
us do here that's unique,
I guess, because it seems like
the situation is still
pretty much the same.
Like if you type-erase,
you might be able to get
the optimization if the
compiler can see enough code
and sort of draw a line
between them and if not,
then generally, you won't, so,
what's different with coroutines?
- Not a lot.
Yeah, your observation is correct.
There's nothing stopping
the compiler doing
the same optimizations for a std function.
- [Audience Member] It's
just not as good at it?
- So, I mean, I'm not
even claiming that there's
really an advantage to
the coroutine version.
It's just interesting that
that capability exists
within the coroutine system and
mostly I want to sort of prod
people into thinking about
what cool stuff they can build with it
'cause I'm sure there's something
cool you can build there.
I haven't figured it out.
Yeah, the function
thing is just an example
to show that it can work.
I don't have a better
answer, I'm sorry, thanks.
So I think we probably
need to wrap up now?
Oh no, I can take a couple more questions.
- [Audience Member] Hi, so on the slide,
it was like two of n
for implementing lazy,
you made a comment about the,
you called it like a friction
of having the promise
and the value having,
both know where the result
is gonna be and I noticed
that you put the storage
in the return value and pass a pointer,
the address of that into the promise,
sort of after the fact.
When I was playing with coroutines,
my intuition was to do it the opposite way
and I was wondering if
you could just elaborate
why you did it that, if
there's pros and cons,
'cause I actually put the
storage for the return value
in the promise and just
gave the return value
knowledge where that was.
- So, in that particular case,
yeah, in that particular case,
it's because I wanted to be
able to destroy the coroutine,
well, I have to have
the coroutine cleaned up
while the lazy object
itself was still alive,
so if the coroutine runs off the end,
the promise gets destroyed,
so if the value is stored in promise,
it won't be available after
the execution is finished.
Now, it's possible to implement it
such that the coroutine
suspends at the end
and then the promise is available still,
so that's a completely
valid implementation
towards it as well.
- [Audience Member] Great and
I think that's actually what
I ended up doing, now that you describe it
and is there something that comes to mind
as to what the advantages
or disadvantages would be?
- Well, the only advantage I can think of,
well, I think in the lazy case,
there's not much advantage
to keeping the coroutine
state around, it's just
kind of wasted memory.
In more complicated cases, the
promise more responsibilities
and it would be a different trade-off.
- [Audience Member] Alright, thanks.
- [Audience Member] I have two concerns
in high threaded environments
using coroutines.
One, the coroutine state,
there doesn't seem to be
an allocator that can be
passed into coroutines.
- So yeah, there is a customization point
for allocation,
if there's a operator
new in the promise type
that gets used, so in terms
of passing an allocator in,
that is possible,
the parameters to the coroutine get passed
to the operator new, so it's possible to
extract the allocator, it's a bit awkward
but it's possible.
- [Audience Member] My
concern is previously,
like on Windows, using fibers
for coroutine-style coding,
had a huge issue with thread local storage
with the context switching.
Is that still an issue with
this coroutine's library?
- So, I'm not sure what
issue you were having,
what was the issue?
- [Audience Member] There
was a old log in Windows
where it would screw up the
thread local storage using
their fiber implementation.
They fixed it with a compiler flag,
there's a lot of old
libraries that you could
potentially pull in or
if they didn't compile
it with that special flag, you'd still get
screwed up thread local storage.
I was wondering if that is an issue.
- I'm not familiar with the issues,
so I couldn't say if it
an issue with coroutines.
I mean, something to be aware
of with thread local storage
in a coroutine is that
in some cases, the coroutine might change
threads in the middle,
even where it suspends,
it could resume on a different thread so,
thread local storage might
not do what you expect.
I don't know if that's
related to the issue
you're talking about or not.
- [Audience Member] Is
there any thoughts of
coroutine local storage in this proposal?
- Right.
- [Audience Member] Is
anyone thinking about
adding coroutine local storage?
- Not that I'm aware of.
- [Audience Member] Alright, thank you.
- Alright, okay, thanks everyone,
feel free to grab me
around the conference and
talk about this stuff, thank you.
