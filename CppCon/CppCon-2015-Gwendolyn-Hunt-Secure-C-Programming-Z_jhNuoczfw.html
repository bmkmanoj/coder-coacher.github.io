Gwen hunt I'm from tripwire tripwire
is a company based in Portland we do
enterprise solutions for security namely
things like voluntary monitoring
database integrity vulnerability
assessments dynamic threat analysis we
don't do any virus that kind of thing
that's not it's not our job we've been
around about 16 years and about 500
people so him Who am I well I've been
cranking software for quite a bit of
time C++ since 1994 currently the last
four years have been with tripwire as a
tech lead for new solutions for new
generation security applications
previously I was with I move a perpetual
startup have you ever been in that world
it's a lot of fun you don't get paid
that much sometimes you don't get paid
at all but you do cool things like in
one day reverse engineer a FireWire
driver and then terminate fiber in the
afternoon it's but it did that for 10
years and then IBM C++ and Java and I
will admit it I quoted COBOL a long time
ago with ETS but I saw the light
I've read my first kid in our book and
I've been in that direction sense so why
do we care about security almost every
day we hear about another data breach
and these are some of the big ones
recently in North America target Home
Depot JPMorgan Apple Google White House
and OPM now I started two of these
because I'm directly affected by these
two breaches that I know up is maybe
another one Home Depot bought some paint
supplies quite some time ago and when I
was back east
last February because skiing here was
horrible I was in Vermont someone was
using an exact replica of my card which
I had in my pocket in Brooklyn
checking parking meters and making
charges and but according to my bank
they suspect that it came from the Home
Depot
data breach the last one
if you've ever filled out a sf-86 that's
as for a security clearance with federal
government since 2000 it's all
electronic and there was over 21 million
records that were leaked we think a
nation state to be named did this and so
things like they just also released
yesterday that over five million people
had their fingerprints so somebody
somewhere has got my fingerprints and
got my whole history everything about my
brothers and sisters my mom and dad cats
dogs everything I knew so anyway some
statistics these are overlapping
categories but from the online trust
Alliance eighty-nine percent of all
these data breaches four consider
preventable they can identify a single
event or a single couple events that if
they were properly taken care of the
breach probably wouldn't have happened
thirty-one percent are due to inside
threats that doesn't mean disgruntled
employees it could be an employee it
leaves a cell phone that has the
LastPass master password in it and has
all the corporate passwords at a bar
somewhere so it's you know dumb things
like that weak or stolen credentials
social engineering just little things
like oh I forgot my elevator pass can I
ride up with you and somebody gets on
sees an open terminal gathers enough
information that's that's used for
another attack down the road and
eventually ends up become a data breach
37 percent in 2014 were analyzed to be
direct attacks that people were going
specifically for a particular bank or a
particular government facility and then
lost or stolen devices 2013 a couple
other of these organizations that eight
hundred twenty three million personal
records were exposed you can imagine
what it was in the last couple of years
okay
gotta be smarter than the clicker
okay types of threats obviously crime
organized crime there are big syndicates
especially in Eastern Europe that like
to steal money from us still money from
everybody state-sponsored insiders
script kiddies people they read about a
script on the internet and they get on
and they they run a war script trying to
break get into any particular boxing and
find breach this often starts small weak
or stolen credentials or lost or stolen
devices can start a cascade of events
small compromises eventually leading to
the data breach but sometimes they
happen really quick the target breach
according to Krebs on security in
September 2015
once in the network attackers had full
access to all store POS in the hole all
of target no partitioning whatsoever in
their network the initial breach was
compromised VPN credentials for an HVAC
firm interesting point to the black POS
malware that was found on all the car
readers in target an updated version was
found at Home Depot and it was altered a
little bit the made to look like a part
of the antivirus package I was on the
Home Depot systems so what are we gonna
talk about
well we're not gonna try to solve the
big macro problem we're gonna focus a
little bit on what developers can
directly access and specifically in our
world in the C++ world and I'm gonna go
through a little bit about talk about
some references that are out there some
books and a website talk about some
integer Bowl and abilities I'm not going
to get into strings or arrays there we
just don't have the time for that but
there are great sources for that talk a
little bit about a programmers toolbox
and some processes and then I'm going to
go into a detailed scenario of applying
some some security rules okay three
books
that I highly recommend this first one
secure coding yeah it's a little bit old
but what I really like about this it
doesn't try to be a cookbook like you
see this follow this solution what it
does it sets up kind of the total
holistic view of how to approach
security that security is not something
he just bolt on to an application throw
a couple of flags and release mode and
it passes that and send it out the door
no you need to start from the very
beginning what the application is
supposed to do and figure out what
things you could do to protect it I like
this book a lot this book it's I saw its
for sale outside highly recommend it
both in print and also in kindle form
it's actually very readable in Kindle
this is a second revised book from
Robert Secord if you want the
nitty-gritty detail about stack smashing
the Canaries and all that good stuff go
to this book there's page after page of
really good information and this last
one it's also a little bit older but I
liked it because it john vega talks a
lot about interfacing OpenSSL it is an
earlier version but talking to all the
different api so if you ever have to
deal with open ssl this is one of the
good places to start from and then
though it's website this is put on by
cert robert Secord is heavily involved
with it and we'll take a quick gander of
what that site looks like this is the
SEI cert coding standards there's a
bunch for android c c++ and java first i
want to take a look at let's take a look
at c++ and look at this introduction
first talk about priority and levels
every vulnerability or issue here is is
classified using the standard of
vulnerability likelihood in a
remediation cost so when we get a little
farther into your little taken example
C++ declarations initialization will
start right from the beginning goes in
excruciating detail basically don't use
the old C stuff there is the the C
variable very attic interface and it
talks about the rational B why this is
non-compliant and then offers compliant
solutions so every category it's here
that they listen to site follows the
same pattern some are a little stale but
most of them that I've seen are real
current a a lot of folks are spending
some really good time in this ok ok I'm
gonna start with integers I in homework
for you all take a look at the strings
and arrays and particularly the C chord
book let's take a look at integers
unsigned integer app sign integer
overflow and conversion issues ok we're
going to look at some code ok this is a
real simple program I'm taking a
unsigned 32-bit int I'm setting it to
max value for 32 bit int increment in it
and then I'm setting it to the min value
and decrement it and I take a look at
what it does
so it's as we expect no it's good to be
reminded that we're at the top end of a
32 bit int we increment it we're going
to go we're going to rap to zero okay no
surprises there
what about integer overflow sign in
overflow so this is similar but this is
with signed int and we're going to go to
the max value we're going to increment
and they've got to the min value and
decrement no surprises here right then
we got we're at the the high end of the
32 but we're going to wrap all the way
to the negative value let's take a look
at conversions issues we've got a couple
conversions here I've got a 32 bit int I
got a unsigned int I'm assigning the
value of a 32 bit at max value to a 32
that sign 32 bit int we expect some loss
of data there and I'm going from an
unsigned 32-bit into a unsigned 16 bit
int let's go see what that looks like
okay so you can imagine that if you're
not doing any kind of range checking and
you're doing converting back and forth
from signed and unsigned you can easily
get into problems and I'm going to have
a simple application I'm just going to
call bad app bad application and this
guy's purpose it's got a little worker
class and in it it's got a work thread
and this guy all this is consumed a
large buffer and sleeps but you can
equate this to a worker thread and then
based on argument input or use some
program options we set the thread count
and we're off and running
the default is 3 on this so and so ok so
I'm running at 3 threads I'm gonna
switch to a VM I guess I don't want to
crash my Mac sorry ok I'm gonna run this
with 400 threads take a look at this
screen right here this memory
utilization well I basically do s my box
it's because I've got unbounded I'm not
checking at all on the inputs and why
did I bring out this scenario this is
actually a fairly common scenario you
can imagine that you've got a package of
applications maybe you got a little
daemon that sits on a UDP socket does
some utility but nobody's really touched
it in five years but it's always
distributed with the new software
somebody gets on a new box Systems
Administrator touches the file system
all of a sudden it's world readable
somebody gets on the Box they there at
least they have an account they're
looking for a ways to compromise it and
so they're going to look for let's go to
opt and see if we can find an
application copy it over into a
temp directory play with the command
interface and see what they get and
right and they got gold here they can
shut the box down whenever they want all
unused to space without having root
access so a way to mitigate this a
little bit I've got a better app this is
pretty calm complex but I surgically
removed a bunch of code from stuff I
wrote four years ago with the equivalent
of using a weed whacker but it's it what
this is is give strong type safety to
arguments and so I have this properties
class that I add a 32 bit int property I
give it a this is what the actual
argument is online a default value and a
description and I set a range on it so
right off the bat I'm setting the
maximum it could between 1 and 3 and so
when I try to run this application and
I'll run this on a Mac every day of the
week okay
default to 3 then let's say I do a and
we get an exception right off the bat so
the behavior of this it just throws an
exception
we typically what we do is log that
there is an out of range and then we use
a default because our systems have to
come up but this is this is also a
decent behavior maybe in that you just
log it and exit and if we go the other
way
we go to 0 look at the same thing we're
out of range it didn't take a lot to add
this capability and we'll take one more
look at the code for it it's all based
on a bunch of templates but to have this
thing called the basic property basic
property has a name description default
value of I
a string value and it has some setters
and some getters and the ability to set
range and then subclass that and I have
a numeric property here as template for
that and you can imagine you could do
one for Strings they could do one for
booze file paths you could do it for
time durations there's all kinds of
different properties but you can follow
the same pattern okay
I'm going to show you one more thing
Robert Ramey if your folks have met him
he has introduced a library into the
booths incubator called
safe numerix and I like it a lot I
haven't used it much but I think it's
got some good application and here's to
just Google boost library incubator then
look for safe numerix you will find this
and the problem is that often as I
showed earlier mathematical operations
don't do what you think they're gonna do
and and he builds a case for it and then
his mechanism is a set of header only
templates that introduce this idea of a
safe integer for example and if you
tried to set this integer outside or use
a different value outside the range an
exception gets thrown immediately people
ask what does this have to do with
business and that sort of thing I would
say that almost any system you can think
of a value flight control systems ABS
brake control systems in a car anything
to do with money that ranges they're
very important and so you want range
checking and this kind of facility could
be very helpful
Robert Secord in his book goes in to
give us a couple of nice tables of all
the different conditions and operators
that can cause wrapping of an unsigned
integer and you said there are a lot of
a lot of these operators maybe you don't
think it's going to happen but there's
good chance it will and then with sign
integer overflow and he also has a
similar chart for truncation so when you
go by the book outside there you can
dump through these excuse me
conversions generally always safe to go
from small and sign into the large and
sign ends but potentially not safe and
the programmer has to step in for these
other cases particularly when truncation
is a possibility okay you don't talk a
little bit about programmers toolbox
first thing I like using as multiple
compiler it's this is the set of
compilers I use because powers even
different versions of the same compiler
give you different warnings and errors
I saw you routinely always code on GCC
for eight and clang Xcode first and then
go to the others I have a lot of code
that runs on Windows XP embedded so I'm
still stuck to Visual Studio 2010 but I
will be moving to 2015 as soon as I can
get that running because it has a tool
chain that allows cross-compile to XP
targets but a lot of value in like if
you're not quite sure and one compiler
we're going to bring it up in another
compiler intel core powers are also very
good they're not as compliant with C++
11 or 14 as the others but they get in
there quickly the thing about the into
Atul's they've got a wonderful profiler
called be tuned amplifier if you haven't
used it I think it's one of the most
user friendly out there other other
things put this in your toolbox these
are a list of flags that are that will
get you discover warnings and problems
that you won't get when you just
run it in debug maybe debug mode all of
these are GCC and clang except for the
sanitize that's clang only on Xcode it
only supports address yeah thank you
I'll make that change it's good to know
okay this is probably very stale but
Visual Studio 2010 these are the
additional flags
I'm sure 2015 has some other ones I'll
update that when I able to bring up
visual studio 2015 other flags that help
mitigate attacks these do things like
make prevent or help reduce buffer
overflows on the stack eliminate
execution capability not all these are
visible and clang or usable on clang and
identified those in blue that are GCC
only also memory real oak relocation or
ASL are in the windows world P ie in the
kind of GCC world all very useful and
before I get back to code I'm going to
just breeze through some of this secure
programming processes this first one may
seem like all this is just another
architect filling up slides but I think
it's pretty important as an organization
that wants to build up a capability a
secure capability you need to kind of
define the framework that you work
within and we we use principles of
mechanisms and one principle may be
although internet domain sockets
connections have to be encrypted and the
mechanism we use TLS one too high string
cipher Suites x.509 peak pkix compliant
with RFC 6120 five for identity
verification I'll get into more detail
but what that means principle we
authenticate the message source
and a mechanism as we use hospit
hash-based message authentication codes
across the whole message and so we could
tell if they're tampered and we know who
signed it principle all applications
must bill with no warnings now they're
gonna be cases where a new you're gonna
have to locally suppress a particular
item but generally like one of our
principles is that no warnings force
common coding standards I know it's
going to hurt someone's mellow but
people that like the code anyway they
want but when he was the best pattern
matcher on a planet is probably the
human and the ability to see common
recognized shapes and patterns
well pickup errors so quick and pickup
problems so quickly but it also makes
the code more readable when you see
somebody else some other colleague
haven't worked with them and our code is
looks the same or is formatted the same
it helps a lot in understanding there
are a lot of good examples people point
to Google's C++ coding standards we use
a lot of it we don't use the portion of
it because our code is a lot newer we
use exceptions all through our code base
so we deviate from that plus my
companies mostly historically been a
Java shop and so we came a case
everything so we don't use underscores
and our names code review system we use
reviewed board it's one example I like a
better than a pull request it has to get
a thumbs up by people on the team before
we commit version control system
probably real simple but if you don't
have if you're not using one your code
isn't that important you really need
this for a team of developers especially
distributed we we use bizarre for a long
time and it's good but no one's doing
anything with bizarre so we all went to
get and we got the github and for the
most part it works good but it can be
really frustrating at times
last thing the fact or one of the last
things to affect a defect tracking
system particularly when it's integrated
with the version control and your code
review system and makes everything seem
'less there's no you don't lose
information and everybody has contacts
to a particular problem and uh an
automated continuous integration these
are things that we we do every night
I've got 30-some odd platforms my main
code runs static analysis runs automated
fuzzing daily integration tests all
target platforms and it's a big deal of
something breaks and we've got the best
to get all Faiers and that includes
testing failures because they may mask
some other failure so it's it we treat a
testing a test problem just as important
as an application problem okay
penetration testing if you're large
enough grow some ethical hackers some
people that could break our code I wish
I could say who our third party but we
use a lot of third party and I
specifically will go in with the full
code and I'll say break this I want you
to break this point I want you to bring
that point and they've been very helpful
in helping us harden our code very very
expensive but very worthwhile ok now
we're going to get back into some more
code and I got a scenario here imagine a
company that does call consolidated
services that provides web back in a web
processing engines for a bunch of
virtual stores these stores are all
visible from the internet you've got a
bunch of customers worldwide and then he
got fulfillment houses that when a
product gets ordered one of the
processing engines sense of fulfillment
order to the appropriate fulfillment
house so we're focusing on the yellow
here and this cat this connection and as
consolidate services we we want our
partners to do it right we don't want
them to lose information about customers
we we
want any issues so we're gonna help them
by building a library and its libraries
going to do some message handling
parsing and civilization and it's going
to do encryption and decryption this
security considerations that we're going
to protect the session with TLS one -
we're gonna thinik eight the message
source and we're going to encrypt the
fulfillment order so there's this is
security and depth and then layers first
TLS one - if you're not using it you're
vulnerable if you use them 1:1 you're
wrong using 100 you're wrong SSL 3 go
dig ditches or something
you're on gap high string ciphers this
is an example the elliptical curve
ephemeral diffie-hellman and I broke
down what the the different pieces mean
for the of the algorithm but this is a
relatively efficient but very strong
cipher suite 6125 I put this here
because there's a lot of confusion and
there isn't a lot of information that's
easily digestible but 6125 basically
you're using items that you surgically
place in a subject alternate name of
your certificate chain that help you
verify that you're not communicating
with somebody that's acting as a
man-in-the-middle in an attack and part
of that mechanism is to use service IDs
that effo server that is represents a
service message represents a protocol
and then the rest of it is a domain and
then it got the same for the client-side
also additional fields that are set in
where if you're a server you never want
client offset you never want to be set
for 4 4 keys for key CR or crl signing
you don't want the
kind of things it just needs these
settings for a server and a client each
to be for a client and because someone
says the server off you should reject
reject the conversation and the reason I
put this here is because I don't know of
a fully compliant 6125 I had to write a
lot of code to do this I use boost azo
and I use exits out of open SSL
callbacks to once open SSL that's a
certificate path verification then I
iterate through all the certificates and
look at the specific fields and match
them up that they're compliant okay
almost almost a code again the second
thing we're doing is we're we're using
message that we're used in the H Mac
code in front of it and H Mac or this is
the message format it's a sterilised
protobuf message and has an H Mac field
it has a UID field identifying a unique
message a type time and then encrypted
message bytes that H Mac field is is the
across all other fields you could tell
if anybody tampered with any component
of the message so with that stuff done
in advance we've got kind of an idea of
what a structure might be and this is a
candidate structure we're building a
library the l0 at the bottom that's
third party stuff we're using open SSL
and logically we're using a bunch of
stuff from Google protobuf even though
it ends up in the bindings I just put
that down there that's saying we are
using stuff from Google then I got a
low-level layer which we'll walk through
some of these pieces that are open SSL
but they're not meant to be the public
interface we want the third party to use
and then we have l2 which is actual
public interface we want the third party
to use so they don't have to get mixed
up in the how am i doing for time half
hour good good um we don't want them to
get lost in the nitty-gritty of open SSL
okay
last thing before we get the code or
talk a little bit about the AES it's
pronounced again walk counter method
jeonhwa gee al iOS there are a
mysterious company in Portland about 50
people supposed to be really smart they
have large foreheads which they do a lot
of work for DARPA and that sort of thing
but they came up with this years ago you
have certain inputs you have a 256-bit
symmetric key derived from a
high-quality key derivation function the
key is never sent with the encrypted
message so this is a shared secret
symmetric key one is on e your
fulfillment house has it and then
consolidated has the other there could
be mechanisms to rotate these keys age
them and replace them but not going to
get into that the idea is the key is
never sent with the message the
initialization vector this is important
because the very first block that gets
encrypted needs some reference or a
random material to do that encryption
usually it's about 128 bits but this
particular algorithm it's 96 bits then
you've got your plaintext and in our
case the plaintext is a serialized
fulfillment order then the cripton
outputs ciphertext and then 128 bit tag
generated for tamper detection and then
we concatenate the tag plus the IV plus
the ciphertext and that's what gets put
in the the message block with a very
important thing we don't care if anybody
sees what the IV is we just never ever
use it more than once for that
particular key and then that outputs the
decryption inputs we've got the
symmetric same symmetric key we've got
the IV we've got the tag ciphertext and
we get the plaintext output okay so
let's look at code
so I go to stack overflow and I read and
I have a cold brew coffee and in just in
a few minutes I crank out no I don't
want to get my chest I cranked out my
very first wrapper around it I've got
this is an equipped algorithm it's still
pretty see like and it's got a decrypt
algorithm I'm hinting that a lot of
things that are wrong we'll go through
that a minute
but let's run a unit test so it's going
to compile the the unit test which is
it's a boost test here so pieces go with
it and what we've done is we've taken a
a key that I generated through an
another random sequence generator
function that it's based on open SSL I
created the IV and then I've got a
plaintext which I just generated a bunch
of sequences and concatenate it together
then encrypt it and then and then going
through the decryption I match the
original to the to the decrypted and
everything is happy so I'm done right
I've got a working algorithm Oh anybody
hazard a guess right off the bat some of
the things that are wrong here pardon me
yes yes yeah the comment was that the
the decrypt exits without clean up and
that's very important which points out
at this particular algorithm I'm
actually doing a dynamic allocation of
the context these four cipher this is a
deprecated interface but OpenSSL being
the way it is a lot of the old
interfaces are still visible though
they're fixing in that now especially
with version one one and a future
versions there they're letting this
stuff die die or they're making it make
it disappear but this is a deprecated
interface also all these functions
almost all these functions have a return
code and with this particular C
interface you need to check the return
code and like they've give a couple
examples here but where I'm returning
the value I'm thought of being slick I'm
being like an old C programmer and
returning negative numbers
I'm leaking because I'm not cleaning up
on this contacts okay so even though
I've got a good algorithm if for some
reason my tag value is wrong or
something I'm gonna i'ma lose memory so
I make another pass at it still a little
see each I'm checking in return codes
but I'm also I also got the leak problem
okay so this really didn't help much
let's go through a better code okay
I changed from the char stars and link
fields to standard vectors with unsigned
chars they work really well with with
this interface I also use the new
context I have appropriate exceptions
that are thrown in the same way with the
decrypt and so let's take a look at will
make make sure our algorithm is still
there I was still correct
okay no errors detected we I'm using a
much larger plain text field at 38 K but
basically this this test is for is very
similar to the previous one I am going
to now since I'm pretty close I think
I've got it where I want to I'm gonna
change turn on the big heavy flags
that's in my C makes setup I've got this
debug secure target and you noticed that
all my C make my main C++ flags I've now
turned on all the the ones that would
help me find issues so when I compile
this guy again which I'm going to do
just the application is the algorithm 44
errors warnings which I didn't get
before so I was like going from debug
turn on these flags and going through
these kind of it and actually the first
time I did this kind of made my heart
sink is a lot of them have to do with
boost format and boost format works
really well I don't that it's it unless
you set type sometimes I have to set
create temporaries you're going to get
these constant conversion warnings it's
more importantly for me to use the the
flags than it is the use boost format
okay so I got to fix that so let's look
at of a 4x version I'll roll back up
there in a second but D so I replaced
boost format with just a couple of
helper functions standard stream no big
surprises there but I did introduce
something here because I wasn't sure I
was going to get cleaned up correctly
and so I created an RA III wrapper
around
tax in this context I'm calling safe
contacts in the constructor I'm knitting
it and four just so we could see it that
it's actually being called context I've
got a little text messages here and then
I'm doing cleanup this is one of the
rare OpenSSL functions to wear a cleanup
routine has a return code a lot of them
don't
if this doesn't clean up that means
something really bad and that
applications got to die and so in this
my simple log program I passed out of
fatal and the application should just go
away so the way that works is I create
the safe contact see and so where I use
the reference or the address operator on
the context I just it's just a little
bit different but C dot whatever but I
don't have to worry about doing a
cleanup in the end because I know when
the safe context goes out of scope it's
going to get cleaned up for me I also
introduced something those I pushed up
into a null namespace and the actual
functions that the third-party will use
burning up in the public namespace do
some size checking because and we don't
want to know right off the bat at the
keys incorrect over the IV's incorrect
or the plain text is zero I mean there's
no reason to encrypt so I added some
additional checks for that so with the
high-level lags on compiled into the
compiles clean
well that's the end of my coming down
that's it and this that that's the end
are there any questions sorry for being
so abrupt oh yes yeah I got a lot of
boost there yeah because some of this is
harvested from a block of C + + o3 the
question was why am i using some instead
of a certs that's our pattern that's
that's our preferred usage I guess we we
there are very few exceptions we can't
handle and recover from is I guess it's
our approach any other questions yes
yeah actually there is some valgrind
mentioned so I found someone today yeah
yeah there may be certainly better
places I know that the search site is
actively supported when I could repeat
the question why was a statement that I
you that I talked about the search site
and the search site is doesn't provide
some information that other sites do in
particularly with memory
analysis I'd I think the search side is
very actively maintained or appears to
be now and you could sign up and you can
add to it if you want they've just moved
at the confluence I've signed up I
haven't added anything to it yet but you
do have that capability yeah it seems to
be getting that way any other questions
yes sir I'm sorry I don't understand
stack cannery yeah a canary
we haven't overtly
used it we've turned or just now turn it
on the flags and for the compilers to
create that for us and some of those
flags that that I showed in the
mitigation will turn those on oh we
don't do anything overtly in the in the
code for it black hat yeah what is the
question was whether what are some good
resources or tools for people that are
interested in become an ethical hat
hackers and black hat we have people
that go there and speak and and win
competitions and there's supposed to be
a lot of fun I haven't got there because
I'm I'm enslaved writing code yes it is
any other questions
yes we and our automated stuff we
actually have a lot ematic continuous
integration
is a ruby r-spec framework that that
works with our art of artifactory and
our repository and pulls out all the
different pieces and test it and there
are some fuzzing engines with Ruby that
we use to inject into our C++ code
we haven't spun up I spun up live fuzz
when I was at C++ now in May and that
looked really cool I was able to
replicate finding the heartbleed bug in
minutes
that's on our path we're just since our
other buzzer works really well we
haven't introduced it yet any other
questions you have ten minutes well I
don't have anything else to add so thank
you for coming I hope this was useful
