presenting on Orbitz they are
essentially the second part of
transformations and objects or we'll
discuss them what they are and just a
quick disclaimer I started preparing
this at 11:00 in the night when Michael
said that there are still open slots
available all right so one of the things
that I think someone mentioned yesterday
was that if you are if yeah if if you
are under 40 and you're still doing C++
maybe you should reconsider your
software cause you kind of thing and
that was slightly unsettling because I'm
27 that that implies that I have 13
years in which every day I go through
this and remember this code every time
so that so the so the idea behind is
basically you have to learn programming
but you have to learn programming from a
language oblivious point of view so this
is my second disclaimer if you have read
this book properly then your next four
minutes are going to be but so so the
the point of this lightning talk is that
we have some common programming problems
and we we should really drill down into
what what makes those problems and what
makes those problems interesting and
maybe we can have final solutions an
easier solution to towards things so
yeah what's the most common programming
interview question like ever like if you
start preparing for programming
interview what's the first thing that
you see I think to me I think it's this
thing and I'm sure that people who work
at Microsoft they know that they have
solved this all right so consider this
as a linked list for people who are in
southern hemisphere and do not know this
this is actually also minor but I
conveniently reused is that a linked
list so one of the most common ways of
solving this problem is that you have
used to start with do pointers one of
them is here one of them is total here
moves faster than the total and this
this works fine and the idea is that
whenever they move if they meet at one
point that means that the linked list
which is we just fair enough but the
idea is that this approach is like once
you've solved this problem then it
cannot be generalized further now think
about this so you you you compose your
linked list into this small into this
mathematical construct so you have this
handle size which is defined by edge and
then you have the circle thing and you
measure the length of that SC and you
define these two points one of them is
the point at where your head and total
are going to meet and one of them is a
connection point at which you actually
will wear your circle starts so once you
once you decompose your problem into
this then it essentially becomes simple
but the good thing about this is this is
all high school algebra which everyone
knows and it's completely language
oblivious you do not have to learn
anything of C++ or any other language so
this is all of these concepts are
formalized in elements of programming or
so transformation is so so when you move
from one step to another link one step
one node in the linked list to another
node you essentially transfer a pang of
transformation to that node and for the
linked list it is super easy you are
just getting the next value and so I
like a dilemma in the night then I I
coded this like I I wrote all the
equation and saw this so basically this
is like can everyone see this so the
essential idea is that you allocate a
linked list and I'll just run this
program and it will print the linked
list first so this is a same simple
linked list it does not have a loop I'll
check whether it terminates and then I
manually create the loop so basically
what I did was I took the eightieth node
and then assign that to 22nd node and
then I check the loop again and then
once I find the collision point and if I
try to find the connection point
connection point was the point where the
loop where the circle actually starts
and then once I have that then I try to
find the handle size and I've tried to
find the circle circle size so if I run
this it runs
very good actually so the it prints the
list first which is like 1 2 98 and then
it says list does not have a look
obviously and then once we create the
loop it says the loop is detected and it
actually prints loop started at 22 and
actually gives you all the decomposable
parts that we had like 20 21 21 is like
if you if your notice poignant 22 that
means 2ne1 is the from 1 to 21 is your
handle size and the loop or the circle
size is 50:58 so it works pretty well
and the the the the good thing is that I
only had to implement one collision
point and everything else is actually
based on that so checks super super
composable that is a that is because
once you create a loop then you have
essentially do not have any pointer
towards the nodes that you have lost
yeah so so that's basically the idea
that you you understand the basic
principles of doing things and do not
rely on the language so I've started
doing this in pub in practice as well
this is actually a hello world program
in a language called white space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
