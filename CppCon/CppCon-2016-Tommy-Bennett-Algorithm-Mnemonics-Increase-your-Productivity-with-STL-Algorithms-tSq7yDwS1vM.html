bought me an Atari 800 computer now
being a kid I wanted to learn how to do
was write video games right so now Torii
Hunter has a 6502 microprocessor so this
book was like my Bible for the next four
or five years I mean if you found me you
found this book hey I will be reading
this book at 3 o'clock in the morning
sometimes now I did going to publish a
video game actually in 1982 yeah I'm an
old programmer in a magazine called a
log competing and it's actually
available on YouTube believe it or not
now my world was these thrilled
three-letter mnemonics right I became so
immersed in this world that these things
came like tattoos on my brain they were
like brain tattoos you know what I
actually realized this was like
compressed information like Lda was all
this good character COC expanded all
these characters and it's like brain
tattoo vionex actually expands to 27
characters now I no longer programming
and seeming language but I wanted to you
know how could I take advantage of this
phenomenon of these brain tattoos and
that's when I came with the idea of
algorithm mnemonics what if the C and I
could expand to this or what I just
think F and I and all of a sudden this
all appears right what about RPI and it
all appears and it works for idioms too
like the erase remove idiom erm
experience y'all is and you're saying
well this feeling sounds cool time but
how would that actually work well let's
go to the video
okay now what I'm doing I'm typing the
container and then I typed in the money
I'm feeling a container of negative 5 to
5 now I just type the container in the
money now I'm counting positive agency
like container nomadic it's actually
going faster you mean no okay and I was
yes do do you see XT oh that was gone
for you and oh look and there's a random
advertisement for the control left
bracket optimization I don't know how
they got in there okay again here comes
your container mnemonic and I feel if
I'm tabbing between those thing I'm
replacing all positive numbers with 42
of course and now I'm going to output
the game with Oh IT mnemonic and here
we're going to use the eraser remove
idiom I'm getting rid of that 42 and
notice it's faster to do the mnemonic
then actually cut and paste that out put
a rear area from above right so now if
you remember I told you about the 6502
strings yet well what I did I came up
with the HDL instruction said I created
a mnemonic for every algorithm now if
you can you can do the same thing
and you'll be zipping through the
algorithms in no time you'll be like
your arsenal calling me will okay so how
do you get it you can go to my github
account and I got an XML file that has
every mnemonic and the suggested code
text that should be expanded now I did
implement it also for slick edit and
boom if you have those integers so but
anybody can take the XML and then
implement it for any editor oh wait
there's a bonus I will now tailor
ability to you the film secret well I
called the beam conspiracy now if you do
what I tell you dude you will increase
your film performance by 10x now what
still most useless key on the keyboard
what's the caps lock key you want to
turn that thing off I suggest you go get
a crowbar and just pluck that thing out
this insolence no caps lock now if you
remember back in the day Sun
Microsystems they put the control key in
the right place that's where it's
supposed to be I mean that's the hot
zone man
now unfortunately Sun goes out of
business and it doesn't catch on right
so what's it can you do today you can
remap all operating system support yes
you can remap your control key to your
caps lock is also controller cap for
Windows now once you get this then you
hit paydirt you get control left bracket
no more escape and the control that back
you're like geez already building VM no
more escaping escape it's like it's like
we're in Seattle and Escape is over
there in Timbuktu no offensive here from
Timbuktu that's just a common expression
we use in United States okay now let's
go to the keyboard and do some analysis
now the home row is like the l1 cache
okay the next row is like the l2 cache
now the keyboard doesn't have a very
large processor so it's only got l1 and
l2 it didn't have a l3 cache now then
the next row is like the main memory and
guess what all those things up there
yeah you can see their peripheral
devices right so and what's the escape
key OSD date card every time you hear
nice cake looks like you're going to the
internet right and what do you what is
everybody doing VI a fat finger that
escaped it's like you're losing package
right and you're going in there and
pinging and try to retry and you're
trying to reset the network you know and
then what happens you get data
corruption in your editor
right when our where's the control key
man it's right there in hot zones I
don't catch right I mean and this is
like an embedded system because all
these keys they stay in there that you
get a hundred percent cache hit rate
okay now where is it where's the plate
bracket oh I see the l2 cache right it's
the same thing you get a hundred Street
cache hit rate with both of those now I
know you guys are saying well Tommy's
performing danger telling us where is
your benchmark right where is the purse
data well you know optimization that we
always say heard I was a place about
measurement is useless you know you
cannot get an optimization right well
unfortunately I didn't have time to do
any kind of analysis but I did be able
to come out like a unit test with you
know using the air the test harness and
basically what I can see if you see this
is the control left bracket optimization
okay now there's gate you can clearly
see that's got to be at least a 10x
booth right we're just in X lower it's
got to be
that's all IQ really offered so now I
highly suggest you try out the control I
mean this is a game changer it really is
an Atari it's free it's all I can be I
don't know how it got in there there's
no documentation about it I guess I
actually just happened to hit it one day
I said hey man this is great
I got tell other people about this you
know so now also if you try to be are in
the past and you just couldn't you know
you got you couldn't stand that escape
stuff you should try VI again is I used
to be a vaccine user from time and other
editors and I finally switch the VI but
but when I discover just control that
bracket I mean that really I mean my
productivity went you know just through
the roof I mean I won't go back in here
again I'm like all day long and actually
I no longer noticed even I'm going a
different mode because really see you're
just going like this you know
with the control that bracket well
you're not doing you know playing whack
them all day you know
it's just like that so thank you my
name's Tommy Bennett here's my economy
uh contact information so now go forth
and be nimble with ivory than the money
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
