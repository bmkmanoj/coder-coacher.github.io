the simplest past conferences in the
recent years you must you might have
heard that statement that contiguity of
data matters so that's what I will base
my talk on if you haven't seen it before
few codes from the C++ luminaries ah
spoiler alert Scott Myers our local it
accounts predictable access pattern
count herb Sutter in his modern C++ doc
access patterns matter linear is better
and finally Bjorn in C++ 11 style had
his famous vector vs. list benchmark
when he showed that RA or a vector is
often faster than a list of course don't
take any of the statement of the face
value always verify it with your data
but assuming that the this will be true
for for your program you would want to
define the data a contiguous data how
would we do it in C++ so suppose you
want to allocate a thousand elements in
a contiguous matter you could do it all
school while in plain old CR a you could
use stewed array you could use to the
vector you could totally use to deck
which is mostly contiguous although it
has to relate chunks of contiguous data
so it were really not good for what we
will be talking about today sorry about
that
if you're more on the bleeding edge
there is this new proposal implementing
some compilers likes to deny right from
our extensions to yes of course there
are other libraries are contiguous data
is most most common I believe in blast
libraries or image processing libraries
we're processing bitmaps and of course
you will have your homegrown types each
of them of course is valuable each of
them has different properties some are
sized statically some are sized
dynamically some are resizable some have
their sized fixed so it's not really a
one-size-fits-all for for them
that's why if you want to write
algorithm that this accepting end of
them and processes the contiguous data
in some manner
you'd probably start with a template
function like that with a generic
function which actually might be too
generic if you want to overload on them
on it because what it accepts is really
a universe of types module module avoid
which is problem if you overload or if
you want to have sensible error messages
when some things go wrong concepts are a
solution to that but we are not there
yet so for now what you might use as a
crutch is some kind of spin I like that
or static assertion but given that you
went through all the pain of defining
that you want to start using this
function you're calling it with stood
vector work just fine stood RI work just
fine assuming we are using dot size for
getting the size of the thing and
bracket operators for accessing single
elements then you try to pass the
old-school array not so good anymore so
as an alternative we can try the C way
of things where we accept the role
pointer and its size where of course we
can pass a vector it sees of course we
can pass a CR a we even get to use a
macro then you can generalize your order
into more dimension so you add more
function parameters for two-dimensional
you have width and height for
three-dimensional you add depth and so
on all the alternative in C++ what we're
proposing is an interface based on our
review where you would specify the
interface are as here so basically this
will be a compute function that's taking
an array view of a given type and how
would you how do you call it
so given that you have data as I stood
vector
you can create an array view over this
vector so this is the Riv which refers
to the data in this vector and you call
the function of it if the extra line is
too much then there is a the constructor
is implicit so you can just called a
compute function with that passing the
vector as a parameter which would create
the array view behind the covers this
will work equally well for the CRA force
to DeRay or for any other of the types
I've described in the beginning so it
really generalizes the way you're
accepting contiguous data in the
algorithm so this hope you think might
sound familiar with you because there
was one other proposal that went through
standardization recently which is the
string view it is really the same
concept although string view is geared
toward string data so it accepts two
string and char star so string literals
you know it as the as the thing that you
view onto and in your turn it gives us
some function specific to strings like
finding a substring in a string and so
on well our review is more generic
approach it is really for any contiguous
data and actually this there is more in
our review there are multiple dimensions
so well I already told you how we can
transform the for the first cystal
function into something accepting a
review that two-dimensional case would
be also in a review just with additional
template our parameter specifying the
rank or the number of dimensions of the
data that we view so in this case would
be 2 it can be 3 or anything else and to
call the function with to specify the
multi-dimensional array of you starting
with giant vector as an example while
passing the vector to this first
overload the single dimensional is is
quite obvious we don't need to add any
more information because vector is
single dimensional we know how large it
is so the
we know how the review is but we want to
fill in a two-dimensional manner we need
to specify the size of the thing in the
logical view a logical multi-dimensional
view for example 20 by 50 elements so by
doing that we were lifting the linear
memory of the vector into a logical and
multi-dimensional representation
so this is how we do it how would we do
it on the interface side for the
implementation I'll go through a quick
example so we'll run a simple edge
detection Albert
or rather edge detection algorithm that
fits on a slide it's not really an edge
detection algorithm so given the input
image being a two-dimensional matrix of
assigned integers which each one
specifying the brightness of a pixel
quite obvious will convolve it by this
are 3 by 3 matrix and then apply
binarization of arbitrary threshold of
150 which gives quite acceptable results
for what I've tried it on so this would
this how would you do it like in C style
algorithm there are two problems I say
it it so first we have two nested for
loops to iterate over the image and I
know it might be not obvious that it's a
problem but really there is a single
image which just happens to be a
two-dimensional space so there's really
no implicit reason for it to view it as
two separate things we really want to
iterate over this single entity which is
a two-dimensional image so we have this
nice unnecessary nested loop and of
course we have the error-prone address
calculation so with our review this is
how it would look like so let's go
quickly detecting it so of course we
change the argument type to take an arai
view in this case there are input and
output arguments next we can
define for helper vectors which will
help us are offset in the local
neighborhood of each pixel to to change
the error-prone calculation into a
single going around that a single pixel
so uh there is one for each cardinal
direction next we will solve the first
of the two problems replacing the nested
two for loops with a single loop that's
giving us index for every element is
two-dimensional space which we used
subsequently to address the data
checking boundary conditions on on both
sides is quite similar but you can see
how the index how we can access the
single components of the index or bounds
of the of the our review and of course
we replace the the error prone address
calculation of just a simple accessing
element of day by the index either
directly or with the with the offsets
we've defined earlier so this how the
eggs and its full glory so what we
really did is we view algorithm in a
slightly different way so while the
traditional view of algorithm is we have
as we call this elemental algorithms
when we have a sequence of objects not
necessarily contiguous just a sequence
of objects and we are getting reference
to the or value of the first argument
then we move the cursor to the second
argument second element getting its
value and so on on the with the
indexable approach to algorithms what we
really have is a abstract abstract space
of the coordinates where we were getting
that we're getting the first index which
will be 0 0 and we move to the next
element index 1 for the single
dimensional case which then we can use
this index to address a concrete data
structure either directly or with local
neighborhood like we did in the example
before and the corollary of having the
index based algorithms
is a enabling index-based parallelism in
C++ so while the index based algorithm
as TL does gives us the single index for
each element in the space when we add
the C++ extensions for parallelism
technical specification or how we call
it parallel STL to the mix we get to
specify an additional argument to that
to the algorithm which will ask for
execution in parallel and with the rest
remaining unchanged what we really get
is a mapping between every index and
execution agent which might be a thread
or a vector line which we allowed to
execute in a parallel this is very
similar model to what you have might
seen in C++ up which there's a striking
similarity if you look at it but it's
also in CUDA with strictly with a
slightly more obtrusive syntax or in a
OpenCL greatly simplified for this slide
but all the elements are still there if
you want to find the other thing I want
to tell you about our review it has a
pointer semantics so to explain what
does mean I go by an example so if you
define a vector with our $9,001 months
and you create a copy of the vector are
also copying over 9,000 elements on the
other hand pointer I might refer to a
single to add to a range in the memory
that is allocated or more commonly there
are no only pointers just point to that
to the three thing so copying that
pointer is almost three operation a
review is in this manner similar to to
that pointer so creating an array view
refers to the to the vector that is
allocated somewhere so the arrived view
is really a lightweight object so we can
freely create copies of them that's why
in the functions that I've shown on
previous slide we're always passing rate
by value of course it has a
there is one caveat here that if the
vector R goes away and the our reviews
are left out dangling pointing to a void
space so some car some care must be must
be taken similar like with with pointers
but I believe this the only caveat there
the second aspect of pointer semantics
is the cost nests which like in pointers
can be applied in two places we can have
a constant view do we specify the cost
are either before or after the type
depending on the test but this is
equivalent to point you're defined like
this which means we can modify the data
that pointer points to but we cannot
modify the pointer itself the second
side is view over the constant data
where we for Rav we put the cost
specifier inside the template argument
list so it's again equivalent to
constant pointer which means we cannot
modify the data the view is over we can
only read read it so it's the other we
can also call it a read-only review but
we can modify the view itself assign it
to another view of course volatile I get
similar treatment but I won't go in
details through that and you can have
constants in both places so it can be a
constant V over constant data other
operations
I'll cover briefly for a review is our
slicing and sectioning the our review so
it will have a real small a review
that's five by five elements getting a
slice from it which we do by taking the
subscript operator we return the our
review to we return a view over the
single slice of data so shaving of the
highest dimension and returning the
arrived view with rank less by one and
then the original
section on the other hand is an
algorithm where a is an operation which
gives us another view that refers to the
same view of the same rank but possibly
smaller you might notice that this view
is no longer contiguous so it's so it
cannot be our IV which assumes
contiguity it's another type where we're
introducing called Strider
rivo which is mostly are similar to the
arrival it's just instead of granting
contiguity it guarantees a uniform
strides between the elements in
dimensions so all in all there are four
types that there are five types that we
are introducing bounds and index are the
types used for defining the
multi-dimensional bounds and indexing
within them there is a reason for them
to be a separate types there isn't there
is more explanation for that in the in
the paper I would refer to I don't want
to spend too much time on it because
these are details these are the rav when
Strider the review and finally there is
about iterator which we haven't seen
exclusively on the prior slide but it's
the thing that powers the algorithms and
letting us to get index for every every
element in the space defined by bounds
so it's mostly behind the scenes things
we're moving the our review towards the
standardization we first introduced it
in paper 3 851 which if you want is if
you want to read more I would refer you
to this paper which we which where we
gave our most of the background why and
discussion about design decisions
represented is to library evolution
working group at the Issaquah meeting
just few miles from here
in February the committee answer was a
consensus to prepare the work to take
the piper forward to prepare the wording
for
our eyes technical specification which
we did and we presented in rapper's
Ville meeting in Switzerland in June the
committee are again the library
revolution working group again requested
some fixes and improvements to the paper
and but it was with a consensus to move
it forward however that target changes
now its fundamentals version to
technical specification so right now we
were under stage where the paper with
the bug fixes is ready it's going to be
presented to library working group so
we've moved one stage further in the
process which will be presented in
November to at urbana-champaign meeting
and we're hoping it will be accepted to
fundamentals vs to fundamentals RTS we
view the paper as we proposed as a
foundational layer we don't really
explore the design space fully we only
proposed the first the smallest fully
contained set of features that we have
and we're encouraging community to add
more to it by the extensions and by
subsequent papers not necessarily from
us I want to highlight three such
proposals free ideas of how we how we
can add more to it there's as far as I
know there is no proposal on them yet
are just ideas that were floated either
on easel C++ org forums or an email
communication but I like em so there is
an idea of covenant arrivee with fixed
size so it would be a 12 you like stood
arranged two stood vector same analogy
then the request for an explicit switch
between column major and row major are
addressing or layout for the our review
it was driven mostly by people working
both in C C++ and Fortran and lastly the
travels are ordered for bounty tray so
that we parameterize able the right now
that travels our order is a row major so
we go row by row similarly
you would iterate over two-dimensional
or multi-dimensional data in C++ but
there are more things like column major
order our Morton order or even hilbert
curve our proof of concept is available
online at peril STL CodePlex comm this
is the online repository where also our
inflammation of the parallel STL so the
c++ extension for parallelism technical
specification lives the implementation
for the for the parallel STL is windows
only now we rely on some OS primitives
but the RFU part of it is self-contained
and should be portable to add different
compilers so if you want to rip pieces
out of it these are the two headers
which should be which should run just
fine in any modern C++ compiler with
that we have few minutes left for
question I can take them now or this is
my email address if you want to contact
me later
let's go ahead yes it is so one of the
reasons for changing that cardinality
order between these two as one is really
friendly for accessing so one reason is
the interrupts with Fortran which which
changes the other reason that we've
discussed is well one order is friendly
for CPU caches when you are reading or
writing the data the the other order is
friendly for a GPU coalescing of a
memory where you don't really want to be
writing to the same cache line from
multiple threads so there is there is
aspect to that yes okay thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
