it's too bad it will not happen again
there's some right now not this oh and
the challenge go ahead yeah so most Eve
may well some of you know some you know
at least like seven of you know that we
did this STM challenge and I was one of
several people so it was Phil Nash he
was just up here it did one these
puzzles I did one of these puzzles I
actually completely missed when they
gave out the iPad to a randomly selected
winner and that was a random selection
here here are the three that I consider
honorable mentions you don't get iPads
number one timing very simple just the
the problem was print out numbers that
go print out a series of numbers one two
three four five up to N and then back
down that we've five four three two one
but you have to do it without repeating
any identifiers in your entire program
text
so the first step write a tokenizer that
pulls out all the identifiers and make
sure they're all unique and then second
step operate on to that constraint so
this made it hard because you couldn't
do loops or you know you couldn't do
more than one loop you couldn't do what
loop to mention the name of a variable
twice you couldn't have a function and
call it things like that it turned out
you didn't actually need any of this and
someone figured that out yeah see how
and then just that's what the literal
string and it got spaces in between and
then on the way down it has tabs in
between t78 is a different identifier
from 78 yeah that works yeah sorry about
that alright and he especially mentions
the magic number six five two which was
in fact the biggest number you could put
in that wouldn't break the grader but
there were some other people who tried
to solve it in more interesting ways as
well to try to smuggle in a non-trivial
program right one that didn't just print
but could do for arbitrary and based on
the loop this one from Michael Kazakov
actually contacted me on slack after
what I wanted to know was there a way to
do it that wasn't so hacky and then we
have Richard Smith the Richard Smith who
takes great delight in breaking
everyone's puzzles submitted deaths
[Laughter]
so that there might be honorable
mentions and I have two minutes left so
I'm just gonna evangelize a little bit
everyone read this slide and internalize
it an alligator is a handle to a heap
see Marshall there there I still
internalize this internalize this an
alligator is not a source of memory an
alligator is a pointer to a source of
memory a container contains a pointer to
a source of memory the source of memory
is separate from the container it
suffered from the allocated the
alligator is contained within the
container you can have an allocated it's
not in a container you can have an
alligator that's not a heap it's barely
a handle to a heap allocator types
should be copyable this has always been
true still true they should be copy
we'll just like pointers this was always
true now it's more obvious they should
be chiefly copyable memory resource
types should be a mobile that's all the
slides I have oh yeah what about State
alligator yeah it works ask a
mathematician internalize this that's
not even my lighting talk my first
flight in was all this stuff
let me show this again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
