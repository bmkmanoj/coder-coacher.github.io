of safe numeric library which has been
proposed as part of the C++ standard and
also there's a different version of it
with the same name which has been
proposed for inclusion into boost the
question arises in it's very interesting
I proposed this talk four times four
times it's been rejected the only reason
that I am here today is I managed to
tailgate behind John's so I would get a
spot here the question that always
arises is what the heck do we need this
for we already have we have within the
C++ language the built-ins integers
Long's
unsigned etc what even what's the point
of this whole exercise and here it is
here this Z equals X plus y this is a
simple thing we do all the time it's
transparently obvious what it's supposed
to do and yet in this particular example
it will not return the result we expect
to return if we add two integer values
these are in tates which are out of the
c standard library your c++ standard
library it will produce a value of 199
and then when we try and store it into a
an integer again it will overflow we'll
come up with a different value a lot of
times we don't see this because the
values were using don't exceed the
capacity the energy types we're using
but it's a common problem that occurred
forever it still occurs and people just
then Stickney they'd go in and after the
car crashes then they run a debugger or
whatever that's one kind of problem that
occurs another kind of problem is if we
take an integer value and change it to
an unsigned integer here are the same
thing we've taken a value of 129
actually I see that this is a mistake
it's very easy to make a mistake here
and if I had if I if I change the sign
something it will actually can change
the value as well I have to update my
example Larry should probably say oh no
it's correct what I'm saying it's
unsigned integer I'm storing an 8-bit
integer it's of a value of 129 if I
assign that to a signed integer it
changes it to a minus 2 this is
something extremely common works it's it
happens all the time in small systems in
bigger systems it happens but people
don't notice it because it doesn't
happen very often and the truth is
there's no compile problem here there's
no execution problem it just your
program blunders on with the wrong
result and keeps going on there's no way
that you can tell your boss the
government or even yourself that this
thing has a that you know for a fact
that this has a correct answer here's
another problem it's extremely easy to
input from an external source an integer
whose whose size exceeds the capacity of
the integer valuable variable you're
loading it too if you run this code
again it will compile without problem it
will build without problem if you run it
x and y will not contain the values that
you specify here what you see is not
what you're getting
you cannot verify that your program is
working by inspection even if your
program is just one line long pretty
clear right moving on what's the
solution well people have been talking
about this for 20 years and the solution
is really it's the only really solution
is to know what you're doing and don't
do that that is frankly of no value here
is the what's recommended by the
software institute of on their C cert
security coding standard which is the
standards of rules that you should
follow to generate a program in C or C++
which does not have which is correct
which and their suggestion is that you
replace the X and y with a construct
like this now
it's ridiculous there's just no other
way to say it there's no way that
somebody's going to go through and
change all their simple addition
operations to include code like this
besides the fact that it wouldn't depend
on a particular integer type etc etc but
the fact that this is even proposed
outside of a comedy club is frankly an
embarrassment to our profession and take
this I mean I just showed the
ridiculously simple idea just addition
to two numbers what happens if you have
an expression just slightly more complex
two numbers multiplied and then add it
to another one
now you're going to decompose this into
several functions in each one apply this
checking to know you get the right
answer I mean that's even more
ridiculous in the first example which
was already ridiculous so and yet that's
the state of C and C++ today and nobody
nobody nobody is telling me that this is
this has a fix or nobody's proposing
anything except till now so here's the
real solution the real solution is you
use the boost safe numeric and it's safe
integer library you just take all this
places in your program where you use an
int along an 8-bit 8-bit integer
unsigned or whatever and you just wrap
each one in this safe template you
rebuild recompile your program and you
run it and now anytime any of those
previous situations occurs you will get
a an exception it's that simple you
don't have to change anything else
matter of fact if you're like super
picky and paranoid you just wrap this up
into a type def and or a template alias
and then you could switch back and forth
on the fly but why would you want to do
that
well every time I propose this so
finally I get somebody to listen that
the whole C++ integer system is totally
broken and they'll say well what's your
solution I say this is the solution and
what do they tell me what about what's
it cost at runtime how much does it slow
down my program well that depends in
many cases for example this illustration
here if I take 2 8 bit numbers I add
them together
well that's possible that might exceed
more than 8bits c++ and c type promotion
rules actually we'll use an intermediate
type for that which is larger either 16
or 32 bits or I don't know whatever the
Machine supports is its natural energy
size it will do the addition so you
won't get an overflow at that point and
then when you assign in I happen to know
that two 8-bit integers added together
even if they're the maximum they can be
will not will easily fit within a 16-bit
number so in this case the safe integer
library injects no extra code into your
program the runtime cost is absolutely
zero so now of course the question is
aha I got you what's gonna happen if
it's different it's larger sizes because
this always true of course it's not true
it means the way C C and C++ are today
that there will be a runtime cost with
this so you're right now stuck in a
quandary as a craftsman and C++
programmer it's gonna be your job to
install this code run your profiler and
then fix all the places either by
changing the types or decide that the
runtime cost is so small that it's not a
problem if you do that then you will be
among the 1/10 of 1% of C++ programmers
in the world who can tell your boss or
the guy sitting behind your self-driving
car that this program will not fail
would you get it increase in salary for
that probably not but you won't be
embarrassed how about that whatever no I
think that that's a whole other issue
which is subject of my other talk okay
so I've got to and so now actually
that's everything I took all you need to
know to use this library I've already
told you I have two versions of it
excuse me I have one I have a proposal
for the C++ committee you know that's
winding through the thing I kind of
almost don't care anymore
because it's just a hassle and there is
the the real library is submitted to
boost it's on the boost library indicate
incubator and it's has a lot more
capability than I've described here it
has the ability to using policy classes
to change right now that's what I've
described it throws an interrupt and
excuse me it throws an exception but you
could have it do other things call a
special function it has the concept of
an error handling policy the issue of
type promotion as John talked about
elastic integer it has the ability to
invoke to change the types of results to
make sure they're large enough to hold
the result I think that's functionally
identical to the elastic integer concept
that John was talking about and in fact
you can you can specify the type
promotion policy it turns out there's a
number of reasons why you might want to
do that you might want to run a code
that runs on an embedded system I
actually use this to test code that runs
on an 8-bit processor and I changed all
the types to replicate the types that
were he used on that 8-bit processor so
I could run that my test code on my
machine on my PC and know that it will
not crap out when I run it
when I run it on this medical instrument
which is driving some guys hard so
that's it nothing to it
any questions thank goodness okay well
if you multiply the question is how does
a type promotion work is that a fair
rendering of your question yeah and
first of all that's not such a subject
to my talk but I'm gonna answer it
anyway and because this this is a
feature of the library which is posted
which is available for use and you can
try out and the way that it works and
the only way that it can work is using
template metaprogramming when to when to
safe integers are multiplied and you
have the Pala type promotion policy
selected so it's the ones called
automatic then it will say AHA two
unsigned integers the only way that I
can actually guarantee to hold the
result of that is if I have an unsigned
long so I will you I will promote both
of the constituent operations from
unsigned integers to unsigned long and
then do the multiplication and then I
know that it will not exceed the
capacity of an unsigned long right does
that make sense and it's zero cost you
don't have to check for overflows or
anything like that because you've
already you know the range of the of the
initial variables you know the range of
the result and you know that that range
fits in the final result so in that case
the only right time run time cost is
promoting your constituent variables to
a larger size so that the C++ machine
multiplication machinery can work
because the C++ multiple multiplication
machinery always creates the type which
is can which is depends on your
constituent types
so you have to promote your constituent
types in order to get the result it's
big enough it by the way what this means
is it has to do all the range arithmetic
a very a compile time on all integers
it's a lot more difficult to implement
than first meets the eye and the beauty
of it is I can explain in ten minutes
what it does take me ten hours to
explain how it doesn't but you people
have the huge benefit you don't even
have to care about that in ten minutes
you can find probably find a bug that's
been bugging you for years okay there's
two differences well there's two one one
is the question is there's some
compilers which have compiled time
switches which detect some of these
problems okay there's a couple issues
with that to start with there are
certain things like overflow of unsigned
integers which is defined behavior and
not trapped I've chosen to trap it
because I think it's a mistake second
problem is what that in the Intel
processor that sets a particular flag
C++ doesn't have a syntax to really deal
with that flag third that's really an
implementation issue now I implemented
this in a true totally portable way now
somebody who's got nothing else to do
and is concerned about that would say
want to take it the way I implemented it
and specialize some of the functions
that they might take advantage of that
flag yes sir
okay okay the question is did can we
customize the error handling and the
answer is on the proposal I made to the
C++ standard committee I didn't include
that facility because I wanted to keep a
standard library library proposal
simpler for the one that's currently in
the booths review queue it has the
ability for any type to specify an error
an error policy and there's a couple of
them in there and one of them is the
default one is to throw an exception
another one is you can call your own
particular function another one is you
can just ignore it
or and there's another one is to just
traffic compile time so that if you
decided oh I want zero runtime overhead
I set the policy so that it just it just
requires me to fix up the type so that
this will never happen so there's four
different error policies already in
there and of course you're free to put
in your own if you'd like now the real
answer your question would be is you
don't want to do that
what you really want to do is to trap
those interrupts low enough in your
program so that you could recover and
redo the applet the the operation in a
different way right if you if you catch
the interrupt lower then you wouldn't
have a problem anyway
without going into too much detail you
can pretty much do anything you want
there yes sir let's take the first one
what's the result of adding two
safe unsigned chars well it's actually
if you follow the normal type promotion
policies with C++ supports what you'll
get is an unsigned int look it up in the
standard if I add two unsigned chars
each one is promoted to an unsigned int
I could be wrong
stand is pretty dense but anyway the
what happens in c++ and c world it's the
same thing it elevates it tries to
elevate the types to a common type which
is of a certain size the the safe
integer library by default doesn't
intervene in that process it just traps
it if it's going to result in an invalid
value I think that answers the second
question to him okay yes sir yeah well
you know that's why I say it's really
clever and the way you describe it is
exactly right it's actually when you do
it when it starts to require a lot of
cleverness so but basically it overloads
all the integer operations and then
including the assignment so that and
including operations for which one type
is an integer and the other type is an
unsafe integer so you know if you think
about it you can pretty much see there's
only one way to implement it which is
pretty much
overloading everything yes sir
well the that would be not up to me but
let me let me let me make a broader
answer anywhere you use an int the
intention of this library is to be a
drop-in replacement so that any library
that you use it takes a template
parameter that has integer
characteristics it should be you should
be able to substitute the safe
equivalent and have everything work as
as before it's it's my intention and
it's my proposal and it's my belief that
the concept of integer safety should be
orthogonal to any other concept okay I'm
informed the sessions over
thanks for coming I hope you enjoyed it
and good luck you know you guys that are
writing the programming for self-driving
cars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
