trace words five agents and I am an
intern what Victorians told me that
she's actually done some
less development so we're gonna do she's
going to talk about her project and just
her initial experience
she's had some experience with Java
before that
I guess we give us the viewers kind of
the perspective of how he first went
from Java to C++
yes so I got into coding in high school
and that's initially where I like to
have a and then once I got into college
actually our intro class was Java again
oh okay I know this and tour was the
first language that I really learned so
naturally I thought it was the best
thing ever but this is the epitome of
all languages why doesn't everyone know
Java and like little did I know my next
class was data structures actually
taught me C++ and like it opened up a
whole new world his job is so cumbersome
this is so much like typing like you
wanna do something simple there's like a
million lines of code and I realize like
super us plus everything so like
streamline everything so much easier
it's just the syntax just made perfect
sense to me even after I've explored C
and I was like well this is just this is
too much a good is CY like put something
out its
again to cover something like C++ is
that like magical middle ground where it
gives you all the power you need without
being overly cumbersome and like the
MIDI create details and still being a
really elegant central language can you
actually actually
so I think the biggest project I worked
on was probably about a month long was
building out Eli that included a mock
real service plan so like a college way
in male students
like in college design college
watching what's up to it will be you
know like you swipe into your meal ball
and into tuck scrubbing a lot of points
whatever that is or dollars that you put
in a day and I mean not always do
so it was building out faculty accounts
student accounts reading in the data
from the students and faculty
innovation purple so you could have to
get a menu to buy a meal
a quest to your account so you don't
know we get like hungry way too much
Thank You grade the next day we'd be
like oh I have like two dollars left I
really need lunch and it was honestly it
was a pleasure to food in C++ since then
I've done projects in a bunch of other
languages
recently I like Python obviously a tough
job and path passed and I think C++ just
I don't know I start like perfect mix of
all holy sounds terribly forty we lost
another language it's just like it's
like that perfect the perfect mix and I
really enjoyed coding it you said that
you were introduced
well that's and college and so on no was
it
or was it like a more advanced port
actually it's a there's a path in my
college to CJ that you have to go
through so one of the requirements is
databases and in databases require to
learn C++ they make sure that in your
developing probably like first year in
college so you're going to be exposed to
Java samples plus and C they're all
extremely important languages to know
go to grow up and grow up into industry
and I mean some people kind of fun it's
like one of the other
I know a lot of people they're like I
love see it's the best thing ever I
don't like you're crazy you don't know
what you're talking about this really
Java is great I like it
no C++ it's like that beautiful media
where you don't have to sacrifice power
or control for
face user-friendly would be quite the
right word but maybe like developer
friendly if that's it's very Mike
now
I would say this
particularly challenge actually picked
it up really quickly the only thing that
was like you I guess not that I was a
challenge was the idea of importing
primaries so it was a whole new concept
to me but it's also so you can import
libraries and kind of pick and choose
what you need a lot and you don't have
to have a bunch of stuff that you don't
there's in Java this is just everything
you fit everything in there and you
not streamlined at all so I actually
it's terrible I just really like C++
it's the best language that I can't wait
to use it again so are you looking
great operation
yes
you know actually the funny thing is a
lot of times when I go to anyone to
interview the person they look at is all
the clink
once I may always undermine its Java C
C++ tonight oh you know how could I not
we have a new community member so in
your experience territory software like
how many
hundred percent the ones I thought to
Italy I've gone to Intel I've gone to
Microsoft my anything
really likes video games it's not kind
of into that I forgot to EA Activision
make awfully like the idea C++ there's a
lot of engines
but I can't think of a single problem
want some what
so what is your experience
huge I've never been about conference
before and I mean conferences already
are kind of it
new people but to be in a room with me
was like where I say 12,000 of the women
in computing was crazy because I I've
been in engineering and in STEM program
since I was really little and actually
you end up need like the one girl or
they wanted to get most of those
situations and like sometimes the guys
are like great and I had some really fun
projects sometimes there's some negative
experiences and thing but I don't know
it's really empowering to be around all
these other women who code and hearing
their stories and sometimes like really
from our backgrounds to see how they
themselves
really
my group made just try and get her mom
to go back to college
in China are you selfies
you're above 30 doesn't mean you can't
go back to college
learn C++ get a creates a good job so
see but for those people out there and
one of the things I've heard the
conference
don't be
I said sometimes a programming language
seems a lot crazy
like I know when I proceeded I was like
oh my god is too much but my
recommendation is start small look for
tutorials
I do a really tiny project bigger than
hello world although that's important
and we all love it world but I like
start something really small and then
China slowly work up from there
as I find a dude if you start with a
tiny project you kind of understand the
base of language then you're I do start
flowing and you're able to really
flourish and make a great application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
