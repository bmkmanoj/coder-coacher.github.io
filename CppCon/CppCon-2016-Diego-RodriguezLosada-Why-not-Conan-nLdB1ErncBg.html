trolling so I'm going to troll a bit so
I'm going to tell you why you should not
use Conan Conan packets manager
the first reason is because it is not a
C++ package manager it is a C and C++
package manager is it dares to have C
packages what the hell I'm a simplest
possible but I want a C++ package
manager so I've issued a feature request
to remove open ssl safely and those all
those unnecessary packages for us C++
developers because it is not written in
C++ and I only used to tar it in C++ so
that's what I don't use gate anymore I
cannot use Linux anymore
silly on Eclipse beam and many more
because I don't need it there are
already system packet the system packets
managers I can use like the FK Jim no
wait whatever I know the or other
languages like 20 million developers
using language package managers every
day in the world but they are not
programming in C++ they don't know what
they are doing at all
finally these crazy people of Conan they
allow anyone to create their own package
so if you want to upload a boost packet
for 140 you can do it tonight
and nowadays you will look for boost and
you will have like 20 packages and so
you will don't know you don't know what
what you use so you just have yes it the
same crazy thing as a stack overflow
you know it's impossible to know what is
going to be the right answer so I sued a
feature request a stack overflow to just
have one answer and beat it you know
people should collaboratively edit the
answer only one and finally because it
is not mainstream it is only like 600
almost 600 starts in github 60 Forks 23
contributors for being that young is the
it has more started any other community
like hunter CPM whatever it is being
used in production everyday for by
several companies but those crazy
companies are using get to and Linux and
does all these cs6 holes so there they
don't know what they're doing
John is no start so actually I've been a
bad troll because these drawings are not
my own these are real trolling you can
found them on the internet on our
feedback everything those are things
that people are either say everyday
reasons I just want to say that okay
trolls there's you know who loves
killing cows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
