So, I'm Daniel from Hue Spark.
I also work in an entity firm with Nimrod.
And I specialize in
high-performance environments,
where every micro-second
counts. (laughing)
Today I want to show you this
nice, neat data structure
called a StaticFlatMap.
It's a specialization of a map that works
in very specific environments
and it's very good for these.
So first let's take a look at
why the presentation doesn't work.
Nevermind.
So, why is the standard not enough for us?
Usually, std map is great.
We use it all the time, but sometimes
it just doesn't fit our needs.
Let's take an example here.
We have some multi-threaded map,
like some map that everyone edits.
And we have a lock that's very expensive.
And we need to lock the
map, and each operator
do some calculations, do some stuff.
This is an unacceptable piece of code
in our high-performance environment
because we lock all the threads
that are pushing for the map.
We can't work like this.
So I thought of a clever solution.
You might know it.
I have a local copy of
the map, then I lock,
then I copy from the big
map to the local copy.
And then I do the iterations
and the calculations
on the local copy, assuming
that this is faster.
Actually, measurements
show this is much slower.
And further measurements show
that most of the time I spend
is on actually copying the map.
So what's going on here?
The std map, for our use, is too safe.
There are too many edge
cases that it takes care of
and we don't need that and
it costs us in run time.
It's too general.
It cares mostly about
inserts, removes, and lookups.
We don't care about inserts and removes.
We know the key is in initialization time.
And it's too dynamic.
The memory is allocated all over the place
and we want it to be sequential,
something that's fast to iterate over.
Bottom line is, the STL
solution for an ordered map
is just too complicated for us.
All we want is little piece of
swing and we get everything.
And so the solution is simplicity.
I created a map that is
nothing but a sorted array
that has binary search to find items.
That's it, that is the static flat map.
It is extremely simple, and
it's powerful because of that.
These are the measurements
for the function that I showed before,
the copy everything for the std map
took around 25 microseconds.
The new StaticFlatMap, it took
less than a single microsecond.
Which made it from unusable
to actually kinda nice.
So, why is it so fast?
First of all, it's an
array, it's sequential.
All the data is sequential in memory,
which makes iteration fast,
which makes copy fast.
Also, we use locality,
everything is one bunch,
so everything is cached up
and warm and ready to use.
And it's simple, no edge
cases, nothing special,
just an array, use
binary subs, that's all.
So, when should you use it?
Basically, let's look
at the pros and cons.
We have quick iteration,
we have quick copy,
we have quick lookup and edit.
So the binary search is log end,
which is the same as the std map.
And it's sequential and it's static,
giving us all the
performance boost we wanted.
The cons, very slow insert
and very slow removes
because you need to
reorganize the map every time.
It's limited in size, you need to
know the size in advance
because it's static.
Not as good for large maps,
and not as good for large objects.
Because, again, reordering
it will be expensive
the larger it is.
So in conclusion, the
standard std map is great,
but it doesn't always fit our needs
so maybe we need another
solution sometimes.
Use this thing, you can use it
and you should use it with care.
Remember, it is good for, like,
if you know the keys in
advance, and if it's small,
and if you need more copies and iterations
than you need inserts and removes.
And always measure.
Like, you couldn't always
go and try to use it,
thinking it's, might be faster.
But if you don't measure,
you don't actually know.
So always measure, even if it
looks like it should be good.
Like my favorite mug
says, it doesn't matter
how beautiful your theory
is or how smart you are.
If it doesn't agree with
experiment, it's wrong.
That's it!
Thank you all.
You can find the map at this github.
