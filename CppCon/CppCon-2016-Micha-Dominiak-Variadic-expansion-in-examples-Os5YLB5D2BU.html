I work at Nokia networks in Ottawa and
today I'd like to talk to you about
variadic templates but more from the
code generation site rather than type
generation so I'm going to assume that
most of you are familiar with templates
a they are knives right they allow us to
write code once use it with multiple
times multiple types they also allow us
to do some slightly less nice for the
users things like this which breaks the
expectation but let's not talk about
that anymore so we can for example write
this function this is in fact the
standard main function and it returns
the reference to the smaller value
passed inside so frankly I'd prefer this
function to look like this because it's
nicer doesn't give me potentially
dangling references and so on and and to
avoid having enormous amounts of code on
my slides I'm going to write this as
this and let's just assume that all the
boilerplate from this slide is also
present whenever I write something like
this just to be clear so that's nice and
all right that like we want to have the
minimum value of multiple values and
ideally we wouldn't call something like
accumulates to fold on all the values a
partial application is also a use case
where we need something far more
flexible than just C++ 98 templates and
let's not talk about some mistakes that
were made in the library in the past
and what about types that are
parameterizing an arbitrary number of
things the primary example we will be
using today is variance because they are
nice there are useful okay
so about variance there is this type
called boost variant and some people
don't really like it for several several
several reasons and one of the reasons
is that its signature is declaration
looks like this how many of you can read
that all right and all this all these
boost purposes or machinery expands to
something like this I consciously didn't
make make an effort to fit into this
slide so okay you can configure how many
types you can hold in a variant fire I
am a macro it works kind of but whenever
you get an error at compile time it
spews something that's that makes the
output completely unreadable especially
so if you have a variant of something
that has a variant inside and one of you
worked with types like that and how many
of you liked the error messages yes I
thought so okay so there is another
approach that was used for variable
number of template arguments for types
or functions before C++ 11 it was
something like this it's very nice it's
very functional so we have a list the
list is either nothing that's the tail
up after or an element in this case type
followed by a list and it looks
something like this
so this was useful right how many of you
used something like this
okay I see some hands all right how many
of you had to die back a piece of code
that used this and had 30 arguments in
the list I had that clever and it's not
very nice to look through back traces of
all this and notice that there is a
space between the closing brackets for
the template arguments because this is
pre C++ 11 and I will imagine 30 of
those printed one after another it's not
very nice so there's a there's a nice
feature in C++ 11
it's called Vedic templates so you can
write something like this it's a
function that takes any number of
arguments of any types you can call it
in whatever way you want to you can
declare a type that's parameterize by
any number of types you can use that
with any number of types that's nice
here's how we could implement the main
function and once again I'm ignoring all
the perfect forwarding boiler prior to
you and this is recursion we recurs and
of course we need the termination
conditions so I chose this one because
one argument is nicely generic for the
interface and what happens when we
actually call this function so this is a
rough approximation of what happens not
not an exact exact one so the compiler
sees that definition and substitutes all
the arguments and what happens with the
variadic factor the tail dot dot dot
that was in the definition is that it
gets expanded into a comma-separated
list of elements in that pack so this is
the overload for for inch this is the
overload for free ins that's requested
in the previous one and finally
the overload for two arguments where the
puck is empty that's also a valid valid
situation okay that's easy that's nice
right so there is multiple things that
can be done with faradic templates and
recursive techniques are not
particularly interesting so let's move
to something else top one packing how
many of you have been to a steals talk
about tuples all right you will be
slightly bored in this part yes I see
you Stephen
okay so at Apple is a generic data
structure containing some values of some
types this is a tuple which was the
following interface you can create it
there is a hopper coral to make to pool
in the standard library it creates a
type that uses all the arguments and
there is a function called standard get
that allows you to extract a value from
multiple so I'm not going to say
anything for a moment still is sitting
over there
right let's do something useful with
this type that's not very nice for some
people we will use it that's like the
problem that I'm going to solve in a way
is to use topless generic storage and we
have a function called past later or
there's a many variants of this problem
when you have all the arguments for
function call stored in this thing so
it's easy to do when there is no
generousity you can just standard to get
every argument by hand but we can do
better but to do that we need to
generate all the integers from zero to
number of arguments minus one there used
to be a time where this slide would be
like five of them or it went a minute
talk at the conference a there is nice
tool for exactly this purpose it's
called an integer sequence there is a
alias for integer sequence for standard
size T called index sequence there is a
function called make in this sequence
that that's exactly what we need for
this purpose
hey so this is how we do this and if at
any point you have any questions or
anything is unclear please ask
immediately so we can follow everything
so there's one caveat with this
technique it's that we have to have a
wrapper for the call because we somehow
have to deduce the the index sequences
arguments but it takes some boilerplate
it's not very nice in some situations
where you would like to contain
everything within a function and you
slammed us but it's it's doable and
there is a standard library function in
C++ seventeen
hold apply is it apply its called apply
that does exactly all this that we are
doing here all right that's one of the
uses the next years is kind of simple
but touches here a problem with using
variadic templates in suppose was so who
here does not know what spin a is okay
it's a it's not really obscure but it's
like a weird language feature that
allows you to have a an error that is
not an error so there is this type that
contains a member type alias called
type only if the boolean argument is
true so any access into the member a yes
for enable if when the first argument is
false results in a compiler error or not
so this function does not participate in
overload resolution if interesting trade
is false because we are trying to use a
type that is not there so this is a way
to write fine spin - for functions it's
not particularly useful for non-void
functions or for functions well for
non-void functions where we know the
type you can just pass that as a second
argument to enable if and everything
works if you want to use type detection
though not so nice so you can write this
it does basically the same thing yeah
there's many variations of this form
like some people write type name equals
type name STD and I believe instead of
this but whatever it's all the same so
there's something else we can do because
this last forum has one little weird
problem that you may or may not care
about it's that the zero ends up in the
type name so every time you print the
type you know whenever in whatever ways
you get this zero that does nothing as a
template argument so we can write this
this pack will always be empty because
there is no way to deduce the values for
it well unless you explicitly provide
the template arguments for the function
but that's that's silly so this is nice
and all you can also do better shorter
and do something like oh I'm missing
colon colon type on this slide sorry
and so basically create a pack of void
pointers instead of integers but yeah it
was a compiler barking clang yeah
it was there for four years before a
person fixed it was straight before
February so slightly later that a
comment appeared under that bark report
that this actual has been fixed for five
months already so I lied in my previous
the previous time I gave the gave this
talk because it has already been fixed
only not realized and the person who
fixes it was Richard Smith just kind of
appropriate I think all right so great
we can use this in any compiler we can
great there's people who
used to make their their libraries
compatible with Clank by doing the
equals value version of this of this
phonetic forum so I'm very happy that I
can just use those libraries on Clank
now all right there's another thing that
we can do we can expand more complex
expressions and we kind of have seen
that already but let's see what's going
on here so there is a few contexts where
you can do for Attic package expansion
and in it's a consequence of the fact
that very attic pack expansion is really
just expanding all the expanding the
pack into a comma separated list of
things of types of expressions of
whatever and there's a few places where
it would be nice to be able to use those
with declarations particularly with
using declarations when for example
trying to pull an overload from all the
base classes we have there was actually
a paper that went through ewg for
allowing this but it got stuck in cwg so
I hope we will get this in C++ next and
we cannot just create a statement out of
a pack of expression like not even
parenthesize in the pack expansion helps
because what if the package empty you
cannot have just the parent parent
semicolon that makes some sense so not
everything is not everything is easy
with variadic packs of expressions so we
want to call a function parameter
argument ideally we would write
something like this and it would compile
but it does it and for somebody who
doesn't know what's going on the error
messages are very confusing
to expect this expression there's an
expression they're expected semicolon
before they ellipsis but the park isn't
expanded Lee I'm expanding the packs of
the package expand it and I have
semicolon after them no it doesn't work
and the compiler doesn't help explaining
why it doesn't work and how to make it
work all right let's make an attempt to
actually do this let's write a function
that basically swirls any value that's
passed into it there's nothing with it
it just captures a reference it does
literally nothing and so we could try to
write something like this let the
asshole called
grab all the return values of bark holes
and everything should work right Wow
there's one caveat if borrow returns
void for any of the arguments that
doesn't work so we would write something
like this which doesn't look so nice
anymore yeah I'm using a comma
expression there to make all the
expressions have the values 0 so there
is no void among the arguments to
swallow all right so that should work
right how many of you know why this
doesn't work okay
alright so let's try try concrete
example we will print every argument
actually in this case this zero is not
necessary because there's a value
returned by the previous expression but
just to show the general case and we
call the function with one - ABC and it
should print 1 space 2 space ABC right
yay mission accomplished not
all right let's try something better and
something that actually works the
problem here is that the order of
evaluation of function arguments is not
defined to be from left to right or from
right to left or it used not to be
defined to even not interleave as of
simple as 4:17 it's defined that every
argument is fully evaluated separately
they don't there is no interleaving
between the execution of the expressions
initializing the arguments that's nicer
than before but it still doesn't get us
there so let's try something that this
isn't strictly necessary I like this
because it shows that we don't really
return a value
just something to fool the type system
into thinking and we are returning a
value idea Voigt would work but and we
slightly change the definition of
swallow we may get a structure with a
constructor that looks exactly the same
like the function previously and I think
we need to do is just construct the an
object of the type instead of calling a
function the trick is that C++ 11
specifies that for braced initialized
brace the initializer list the order of
evaluation of the arguments is from left
to right always so this finally works so
some people some people use dressed as a
array of integers instead of separate
type and Wright comma zero everywhere
it's a matter of taste how exactly you
do this
I prefer writing it the way I showed you
because I think it conveys the intent
better and most of the function I write
that I suspect will be used this way
return something so it's not a problem
for me but whatever works for you really
all right so there's a use case of
something that tries not to use visitors
that implement it outside of the
function so you're twelve functions have
pretty much the same problem only the
code tends to be in the right place
instead of some random place in the file
before the function that actually does
the visiting of a thing and the four
functions are not nice or not
particularly first we can do better
provided that we have constructs or
lambdas and this time around for those
who somehow solve the previous iteration
of the talk I actually have some
assembly in the slides show the
difference okay so the basic observation
is that lambdas are expressions so since
we can expand the pack of expressions we
should be able to expand the pack of
lump that's right so we should be able
to write something like this okay so
variant is something like ish the
standard variant it has a function
called index that returns the index of
the currently active member the of the
variant it has an Associated function
called get that allows you to get the
member of the variant provided it's
active a and index off is really just a
matter fact that takes the index of T in
the park so the confusing the probably
confusing for some people line is the
using T equals TS it looks weird there's
an expanded packet error but it's
expanded outside of the lambda function
of the lambda body so it's the only
place in the entire thing where there is
an expanded pack so this should expand
to a pack of lambda expressions for
every type in a variant that extracts
the value from the variant and prints it
out and then we create a an array of
function pointers to those lambdas since
we don't capture anything those lambdas
implicitly decay to function pointers
and using that call table we just call
the appropriate function post passing
the variant in this is great this works
almost if you look back at the slides
and look at the name of the guy who
reported the previous year you will
notice it's the same guy and I know that
still probably knows the name I expect
so so this time there is no happy ending
because as far as I am aware and I think
I checked yesterday the back the back
isn't fixed in GCC and the errormsgs GCC
gives are really confusing because they
basically say the same thing as for the
attempt of expanding a pack of function
calls just as a statement it says oh
here you have an expanded pack and at
the end of the lambda word ellipsis is
it says there is no pack to expand so
it's very confusing and but thankfully
we can make a workaround for this and
having read some implementations of
variant that use out of line visitors
and having read my now my own
implementation of variant that uses in
line visitors even with all the
boilerplate that the workaround to make
this work in GCC requires I still think
this is worth it because you don't have
to jump across multiple places to see
what is actually going on and it's kind
of easier to pull up the code I think
all right so we'll use this guy it's an
identity meta function it just it's
supposed to be used as a value that
passes the type together with it so the
previous function when turned into a
version that compiles with GCC looks
something like this
the general idea is the same only now
the line that creates the type audience
is slightly uglier like type name deckle
type type type there appears to be
slightly too many instances of the word
type on that line but you write this
once then you copy paste it everywhere
it's not that bad I'm serious okay so
generator is a generic lambda that takes
the that takes an argument the argument
will be an instance of the meta function
that we saw on the previous slide and
then we return a lamp that does
basically the same thing so the generic
lamp that just provides a context to
allow an easier extraction of the single
type from the type rack and then we call
generator for every type in the variant
with an object of type ID of T's is this
comprehensible to everyone
all right so at some point I was given a
question whether those two are
equivalent like whether to work around
for GCC introduces any costs no it
doesn't just function pointers and the
return value of generator is an empty
type and if you were at a one of the
optimizers talks it was I think two days
ago there was an example of a lobby MRI
were returning a lambda basically
returns void it just conveys type
information and since that's all that's
required to get the function pointer
there's no work overhead although there
is one interesting thing so as I said
there's going to be some assembly in the
slides let's take this program it does
basically the same thing like it's not
important how exactly it's implemented
it uses the same technique to print the
size of if or I'd rather element of the
park of the arguments of fool where I
passed at one time and I in main is
volatile because otherwise in some in
some situations the compiler got way too
smart okay so I mentioned context
problem that's before so context for
lambdas have been implemented in GCC
seven and the output from rhesus is six
is something like this so for those of
you who don't read assembly the first
three repeating blocks are the lambdas
for every type so the first one prints
because that's the size of event the
second one prints four because that's
the size of float and the last one
prints eight because that's the size of
of double next we have main we have code
for main so first we set up the stack
then we set up the volatile variable we
are using and the next one we are doing
is the next one the compiler is doing
their it's fetching the guard variable
for the static array inside the function
because function local static variables
in C++ are fret safe with regards to
initialization so there is a guarantee
that no two threads will initialize the
variable at the same time so it's
checking whether the write has been
initialized if it has not been
initialized it makes a jump and
otherwise it follows we've just a call
to the appropriate function and returns
from main next it first acquires a mutex
basically checks whether the variable
was initialized in the meantime if it
has been and it just turns over to the
code that actually does something
otherwise it initializes the array and
drums to the code that actually does
something all right
that's not very bad after the first
school like it's not nice but we can
live with this only there is a better
code that's generated for this one note
is that clunk generates basically the
same code only it uses sim D for
initialization of the table this is the
output from GCC seven
this time into almost fits on the slide
so it generates the functions and then
it calls the functions it can statically
initialize an array and I think this is
directly related to the fact that
lambdas in C++ 17 are implicitly
contacts per whenever possible but do
note that I did not have to change the
code to say con sex per on the array of
function pointers so this is very nice I
hope it comes to clang soon like soon I
like this all right we have some
techniques that we can use and we are
going to use mostly the last one to
implement a variant type there is this
guy in the standard library and it's
useful for providing storage for a value
of a type without actually declaring
about a variable of the type so the
number one source of bugs related to a
line storage is the fact that you have
to write colon colon type I did this on
numerous occasions it's easy to forget
so thankfully there is an alias in
surplus was 14 I think
yes I can hear you
what is the failure mode if I forget to
write tyfa okay there is no compiler no
this structure is a structure it's an
empty structure so it has a size of 1
and then you try to construct an object
into the storage of the structure of
size of 1 and your variable is probably
larger than one so you write outside of
your class which is not very nice and
not trivially to debug your roli right
so this is the basic idea we have a line
storage for for all the types so we need
the max we need a line storage with the
maximum size among all the types and one
that fits all the alignment requirements
of all the types that we can store and
then we have a member that contains the
index of the currently active member of
the variant this is the simplest
constructor that can possibly exist for
this type we get some value and if that
value is somewhere amongst the possible
types we can store inside the variant we
just construct the type we move
constructed at the storage we have how
many of you don't know the new syntax I
used here everybody knows it good you
raise your hands for we don't notice all
right so this basically takes a pointer
and constructs the object in the storage
that's pointed to
that pointer it's implemented as a
overload of the operator new that just
returns the argument all right
the copy constructor there's of course
I'm going to ignore such weird things
like exception safety for the purpose of
the slides and I'm going to ignore such
things like move operations so this is
all in the beautiful world where
everything succeeds and copies are cheap
all right so this is basically the same
trick with lambdas that will be before
together with the workaround for for GCC
we drop the object from inside the other
variant we construct a copy at our own
storage is this understood yes I can't
hear you can you use the microphones for
any questions because to avoid shouting
why are you repeating this code and not
simply calling visit function but the
generic lambda the visit function says
you will write the next slide I guess a
visit function that I call F map and I
will have in two slides you can instead
of writing oh this is the implementation
of something that is pretty much almost
the same as standard variant and
everything that that's around the
standard variant so you could also ask a
question why am i reimplemented variant
the answer to that is because I don't
like the empties
inside the variant and some the lack of
the requirements in the standard variant
but that's not that's not important okay
this is coffee construction so copy
assignment is slightly longer and we
have to do double dispatch because we
have two variants then okay then K can
have two different active members this
is the only point where the workaround
for GCC gets really not nice because it
adds like six lines of code but whatever
and again this is completely ignoring
exception safety because once you try to
remember about the exceptions it's it
gets way more complex so third this is
copy assignments we first distract the
element we are holding and then we
construct a new n we cannot really copy
assign the objects we could do that only
the types held by both variants were the
same but that's weird special cases that
we don't need
distraction pretty much the same it just
called instructor and there's two more
functions that are useful the first one
is get cooled get there's many different
things you can do when they when they
get is invalid I chose to I chose to
throw an exception I guess sometimes you
might want to terminate instead like I
have no idea what the standard variant
is doing when this happens I don't know
I would have to check and the last
function where I do this last time there
was a lengthy discussion whether the
name of the function is correct or not I
would appreciate if we could not repeat
that discussion here thank you
lies he had the proper the the result of
the discussion was that the proper name
for the function would be any map but
that's a command-line utility so no so
result-type i have to compute beforehand
it's going to be a variant that's able
to hold a value of any of the types that
can possibly arise from calling the
function on a type inside the variant if
we are interested in how this actually
looks I can show you so when we have the
result type we just do basically the
same thing only this time only this time
the functions that we are using will
actually return a value that we have to
return from this function and for the
full implementation of all that I have
my variant you can go there or if you
are interested in it I can show it to
you and that's all the slides I have
