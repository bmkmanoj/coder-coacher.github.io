about the loss and
rediscovery of trigraphs.
In 2009, the United Kingdom suggested
that we deprecate trigraphs
during the C++Ox feature reviews.
I wanna call this trigrexit.
Is it too soon to make Brexit jokes?
I'm sorry Phil.
Canada and IBM found this quite vexing.
As usually happens when two nations
clash on something like this.
A year later a solution was
reached which satisfied no one.
Trigraphs removed raw string literals.
Raw string literals were new
so no one had used them yet.
No one missed the feature.
I'm not sure people actually
use raw string literals,
they are pretty awful.
There things settled for awhile.
2014: Richard Smith, one man,
just to compare him to the
entirety of the United Kingdom,
proposed removing trigraphs
completely from C++17.
Not deprecating, take them out,
wipe them from the face of the standard.
Oddly enough, this time it succeeded.
(laughter)
By some odd coincidence,
at the same meeting,
Richard Smith became C++ Project Editor.
Now, I'm not saying
there's a connection here.
You know, trigraphs could be
removed because it was time.
Richard may have become Project Editor
not as a reward for having hobbled
IBM's two remaining EBCDIC customers,
but for actually his years of service.
He's demonstrated excellence
in project editing.
Not project editing, that's the job title.
Standard editing, I apologize.
IBM accepted this loss with graciousness.
Maybe small air of passive-aggressiveness,
but the idea is there.
So, this is a bit of a
movement, but it happens.
It's life.
2014 was also the year where
the Evolution Working Group
agreed to support u8 character literals.
UTF character literals to go
with the UTF8 string
literals they already had.
They requested wording for this.
UTF8 character literals were added
explicitly limited to US-ASCII characters.
Might surprise you if you
know anything about UTF8.
It shouldn't surprise you if
you know a lot about UTF8.
The reason I mention this
and the reason this
sounds like a conspiracy,
is because this discussion was started
and this wording was
written by Richard Smith.
Twice is enemy action.
That's not the expression.
Anyway, I thought this was a bit shocking
and so again this is--
Thank you Marshall,
this is three times that I actually
had to cut the middle piece out.
So this is obviously a
bit of an ASCII lean here.
IBM called this out.
IBM didn't name names,
but has Richard Smith
ever denied membership
of the ASCII illuminati?
(laughter)
So, that was the death of trigraphs
and the rise of the power
of the ASCII illuminati.
Thankfully Herb explained this
morning what this operator is
because otherwise I'd have to explain that
and blow my time budget completely.
So this is operator spaceship.
Now if you look carefully, you'll see
one, two, three characters in a token.
That sounds an awful lot
like a trigraph to me.
Three, tri, for those
that are paying attention.
Technically it's a
three character digraph.
You could look at it that way.
But what is it a trigraph for?
Now we all heard this one,
it's operator spaceship.
(laughter)
If you're in GCC, it looks like that
because then it would have UTF8 support.
The FAQ for GCC suggests running
your code through a pill one liner.
Those of you at my ACC
lightning talk earlier,
this is another occurrence
of pill traumatic stress disorder.
That's actually not unique code,
that's what happened when PowerPoint
auto-corrected operator spaceship.
(laughter)
But it gave the idea.
Maybe that's what we
should be a trigraph for.
Oh that in GCC.
So, that's pretty much it.
The truth is out there.
You want more stories like this.
You want to discover the
secret history of C++,
it's all publicly on record at that URL.
And the URL is a link from it.
The real URL is about two pages
long and has the year in it.
Those of you who don't
know what a trigraph is,
that's the hashtag, ASCII illuminati.
Thank you very much.
