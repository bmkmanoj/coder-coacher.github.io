for friends I'm Natalia leaving you okay
so enough said about that small
disclaimer this is going to be like a
slightly political talk so what follows
are just my personal thoughts and
opinions not necessarily one so like my
community or my employer especially yeah
but again I want to talk a little bit
about the elephant in the room
as I noticed yesterday what is the
elephant to room I work with cute in
case you don't know cute is a very
powerful C++ framework for
cross-platform UI development it's used
everywhere in all sorts of industries by
many companies just a quick poll how
many of you know about cute yeah holy
yeah so how many of you actually use
cute I hope I guess upset yeah good like
we're in the two digits percentage right
so here's something I noticed about the
cute community when it comes to reaching
out to the sip office community to the
big one
so exactly last Thursday I think I send
out an email on the cute interest
mailing list I was flying here for
giving a training about cute I was
saying hi I'm pecan is there anybody
around and the response from the cube
calm for the cute community was actually
overwhelming
yeah so exactly one reply uh by Charlie
I don't know if he's around hi I start
working uh why's that
I mean what's going on right but you use
cute and you know and get that much
feedback so I said thinking perhaps it's
about you know the contents of this
conference you know there are that many
talks and that meant talked about cute
actually I should increase that number
by want it was mentioned right right
here X yeah light wing but yeah that's a
bit like that it makes me a little bit
sad but that's kind of childish excuse
right this is a big conference there are
many kinds of audience we you can expect
here to talk about each and everybody's
very tool and yeah so I don't think that
should be a sad face usually has a happy
face
however also did like an inverse test
next month in San Francisco do is the
big cute conference it's called cute
world summit so there's plenty to talk
about cute there and I was curious how
many talks about cute and like more than
C++ more techniques are there well yeah
yeah one over sixty at least at from
what I can tell from the website so that
makes me really really sad and that was
that thing okay what's going on I mean
there's these two communities I mean can
we just be friends or no yeah
what what happened really well I've made
theory but as such it's a theory and I
would like to reach out to this big
community if you have better opinions
what actually happened why these two
things have got split up what a belief
happened is that cute is somehow guilty
it isolating itself many years ago cutie
as this enormous not invented here
syndrome it invented all over again
instead of saying to people you know
what it's not the case that we may been
sharing pointers just used one from
boost they're good enough and not use
one from C++ in heaven the good enough
there's has been barely two
participation the language library
centralization process II don't hear
from you know you don't hear the cube
story when we hear those boards at least
I can't find a single contribution
possibly it's not evolving as fast as
C++ that's why it's just guilty between
quotes there's just a finite element
bandwidth we can put in there so we
can't do as we can't go as fast as we
could
but I know that if I go down these ways
of listing things I'm would be probably
start pointing fingers and probably
arguing with people about that if
something I learned at this conference
that if I start arguing yeah I'm losing
so let's let's not go there let's set
try to change the mental frame let's try
to change what happened what is the
mental frame what's what's wrong
really I can't figure it out really I'm
trying our Q developers afraid of
moderns plus plus what's to be afraid of
right it's the best language ever are
just C++ developers using cute ashamed
about using cubes say yeah that's the
thing we my boss makes me you don't
really want to use it or what oh it's
just you I a platoon development just
not that interesting I don't believe so
everybody's using a new I on your
computer I'm pretty sure it some of you
are actually w i's with cubed and you
know i think it is interesting so yeah i
believe that this is actually hurting
everybody this is hurting the community
to developers the community gets cut off
from the biggest prosperous community
and therefore they doesn't get over here
then i give talks and therefore cube
doesn't get enough visibility in the c++
community and therefore people think oh
look could you sound represented let's
logo there thats not sub we talked it
was the first item unless recursion
stack overflow but also this is hurting
the c++ community because there are so
many ideas that the cute country could
contribute back so much feedback so many
ideas so i think you know we should work
together i don't know what's happening
really cute is striving to be an open
inclusive fair and meritocratic
community how do we connect them back
well that i don't know so i would say
that if you like enough to find someone
you can tolerate synchronized in don't
let go yeah and
let's get in touch if you have an
opinion saying idea my name is backpack
thank you for having</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
