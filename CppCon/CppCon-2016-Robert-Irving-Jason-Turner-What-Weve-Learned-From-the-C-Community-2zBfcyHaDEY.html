and I'm independent so you know anyone
wants to hire me or contract let me know
it's a good question raise your hand if
you have heard of the podcast okay no
one else did a more elaborate answer is
I used to listen to a lot of podcast
myself I had a one-hour commute and one
podcast listened to was dotnet rocks
they're up to like twelve hundred
episodes now I think so I was going
through their backlog and I got to one
episode where they interviewed Kate
Gregory who was in now well-known c++
speaker and after listening to that
episode I thought it was great you know
I'd really like to listen to this type
of stuff more often as a C++ developer
so it looked around for the C++ type
podcast content and didn't really find
anything I found a handful of other
specific podcast episodes Kate Gregory
did two shows on that dotnet rock show
and I found one episode with herb Sutter
on Hansel minutes and another one with
Scott Myers on a podcast called hello
world and that was really it you can see
up here I have a link to a list of
software development podcast that's kept
pretty up-to-date and if you look there
there's about five microsoft.net
podcasts dozen or so JavaScript and web
development podcasts but there was
nothing for C++ and that really
frustrated me so I decided to start a
C++ podcast I thought the community
so the for the past year and a half
we've recorded 70 episodes speaking to
various equals plus authors some booths
seven episodes yeah and library
developers and we've had a really great
time doing the show and learning from
the C++ community so today we just
wanted to share some of the lessons
we've learned over the past year and a
half
so to be fair I've only been there for
like 63 if you include the one I was
interviewed in its episodes so the first
thing I wanted to call attention to is
reverse debugging is amazing are you
guys familiar with reverse debugging
anyone all right so we've actually
interviewed two different people
involved with read reverse debugging
Greg law from undo DB undo is here
sponsoring the conference and they
sponsored us for a while but that's not
well I'm why I'm mentioning them and
Robert O'Callahan is his are our reverse
debugger which I don't know how visible
that really is but anyhow it's a Mozilla
project or was a Mozilla project and the
idea is that you can run your program
and record its execution and then just
like you might do next in your debug or
if you want to step through you can do
reverse next and actually step backward
through the program's execution and see
like what the variable states were so
you could get a sig fault and then step
backward and find out why the sig fault
happened it's it's an incredible
technology you should totally check out
like some of the videos both of these
projects have videos demonstrating how
they work a little bit about C++ on the
web as a C++ developer I recognize that
it's being used in browsers it's being
used by you know lots and lots of apps
access the web and communicate over the
web but all the web apps that we see on
a day-to-day basis are all JavaScript
and HTML there's definitely a disk
I think between the C++ in the web but I
think webassembly
has the potential to break down that
barrier and give C++ devs the ability to
write for the web I'm pretty excited by
this it should bring new opportunities
to C++ developers and bring faster more
high-performing apps to the web because
obviously C++ is gonna be a lot faster
than JavaScript this episode that we did
with jf Bastion from Google came out a
year ago and it was right after two
weeks after the initial web assembly
proposal so it's come a long way since
then there's gonna be a talk tomorrow
not by jf but by Dan Bowman we believe
it's from Mozilla tomorrow at 4:45 and
he's going to show what webassembly
looks like today and hopefully what you
can start writing with another episode
we did that relates to C++ in the web
was more recent we had Alfred from
include OS and inclu have has anyone
heard about if they did talk yesterday
yeah it's a library operating system
which means your application is going to
include the OS and basically statically
linked in everything you need to run on
hardware it's difficult to understand if
I can interrupt real quick it's it's
literally a single header include pound
include and you have a bootable C++
program yeah so it seems pretty amazing
they demoed yesterday at their talk that
they created acorn which is a web
hosting platform yeah yeah it's a web
server web server for C++ and they've
talked about other use cases that could
potentially happen like writing your own
micro services with restful api s and in
their talk yesterday they showed how
their demo ones are already
outperforming what node.js can do yeah
and completely unoptimized there's a lot
of work they could do there Apache
outperforms the Apache for raw
connections per second also yeah
so we did a pretty deep dive in the
episode with include OS and yeah it's
just really exciting technology and just
as a new opportunity I think for C++
developers if you ever had a Shawn
parent moment was this fun you have
Marshall so oh I don't actually have any
details up there here you can have that
back we were interviewing Kate and and
there was it's a great interview if you
haven't heard it what you should and she
said that you know she was working on
some project and then she said I had a
Sean moment and and then I I was in C++
now and in May and I was talking to Sean
and he said he was listening to that
episode and he goes what the heck is a
Sean moment and his wife was like what's
a Sean moment he's like I don't know
so it's that moment when you realize the
work you're working too hard basically
that you like you have this much code
and realize actually a standard
algorithm or two could minimize it down
to like one line of code so if you
haven't seen Sean C++ Seasonings talks
everyone familiar with these things
they've already been mentioned at the
conference couple times go watch them
they're excellent yeah so next thing I
want to talk about was a C++ for the
next generation a lot of times when
we're doing the show and we introduce a
guest we ask them how they got started
in programming and we get a lot of
pretty interesting answers guests tell
us they self-taught themselves C++ in
high school in high school we've had
guests tell us they were growing up in
the 70s or 80s they were writing
assembly out of magazines just pretty
cool I don't have a great story myself
maybe because I'm a little bit younger I
did do some HTML in school I wrote a
kind of crappy Star Wars fan site
yeah and I didn't write doing your old
programming until high school when I
took a basic class and then in college I
didn't see in C++ in my freshman year so
I now have two kids of my own age five
and eight and I'd really like to
introduce them to programming at an
earlier age that maybe they could have
some of those cool stories about
learning programming
so I went up said I want to talk about
was Kate Gregory again which is really
one of her favorite guests and when she
was talking about stop teaching see she
mentioned that she had two kids of her
own and she taught them C++ at age 13
and these kids are adults now so when
she was teaching them you know a decade
ago roughly must been C++ 98 and with
modern C++ I think you could introduce
kids of that age or it's I didn't even
younger age to C++ and it could be their
first language I don't see why it
couldn't be especially with things like
game development libraries cinder and SF
ml should really make learning C++ a lot
more exciting for a kid what kid
wouldn't love to make their own video
game I think it's pretty cool and one
other thing I want to mention is if this
is a topic that interests you teaching
C++ to the next generation whether you
have your own kids or not you might want
to look into code org they have their
day of code every year and they're
always looking for volunteers who could
come out to a middle school or a high
school and teach C++ I also wanted to
call out a couple of pretty exceptional
younger guests we've had I think some
that might be in the room so Victoria
here might be here
Victoria Romeo as Jason mentioned
earlier self taught himself C++ as a
teenager and either just graduated
University or is in his last year and
he's been writing open-source C++ video
games and doing modern C++ game dev
tutorials
while still in University another guests
mention is Jonathan Mueller we had him
on more recently he's just going into
his first year of college but he's has a
very popular C++ blog and he's already
written nothing v C++ libraries I don't
know yeah
enough enough so I think I thought I had
a comment on oh yeah we didn't realise
when we went to interview Jonathan or if
we're pronouncing it correctly in German
unit in but he he we didn't realize that
he had literally just graduated from
high school and we had him on the show
pretty crazy and if I can turn this on
you for just a second Rob since you've
never been interviewed on the show you
just mentioned that your first
programming was in basic in high school
what
what were you programming on what
dialect of basic do you remember what
year was that
I'm 32 so I was like 17 or 16 I'm not
sure
15 years 2000s he's young so this comes
from our Alex and rescue Andre when we
interviewed him episode 32 I was trying
to get some details about how D and C++
can interoperate what is the story there
and I learned in comments afterward that
people thought that I was just trying to
get him to specific specifically tell me
if cute worked with D but that's not
really what I was going for I want to
know the details of how D and C was
supposed to talk to each other and they
had been apparently debating in the
community that they needed to like
really understand C++ to be able to
interoperate with it so you would need
to have cos plus namespaces and C++
rules and templates and all of these
other things but I saw they had been
thinking about that road for a long time
then he realized he was part of the
Seacoast West community and the D
commute
in multiple language communities and
realize that like all these communities
were we're getting it wrong all they
really need to do was think of it as a
name mangling and a layout problem so if
you can handle C++ name mangling
appropriately for the platform and
compiler that you're on and know how the
memory model for C++ works then
magically your D and C++
interoperability just works to some
extent there's you know other things
like exceptions that have to be sorted
out but as so he you know he commented
which was my title slide here that the
whole community can miss the point and
it's I guess kind of ironic as Rob
pointed out that we're in a discussion
about the C++ community so don't miss
the point I guess so that's really it we
wanted to leave some room for questions
we also wanted to point out there's
going to be a community building session
tomorrow so if you're interested in
learning more about C+ communities those
opposed user groups that might be a
session you want to go through my panel
worth going to one of the thing I just
want to mention is we're always looking
for new guests on the show if you're
here at CPP con chances are you're
somewhat of an expert in something so
feel free to reach out to us and have
you on the show I talk about C++
sometimes or even if you're not an
expert in anything it can still be fun
to have you on the show yeah
and I would like to say it just in fact
that I recognize many people in the room
that I've been trying to get on the show
so if you want to come talk to me or us
afterward
yes we've plenty time for questions and
if you ask a question we have some
t-shirts to give away too
everyone loves swag yeah yes um it's
pretty easy to set up oh sorry the
question was how do you go about
recording an episode we get in touch
with a guest set a time Jason and I work
together on setting up a series of
discussion topics news articles we're
gonna bring up and send that to the
guests usually like two days before the
interview we try for two days yeah and
then we just jump on skype
there's freely available recording
software that we use to record the call
and I do some post process editing
afterwards but it's really a pretty easy
process for some inexplicable reason my
mic likes to cut out so probably once or
twice an episode in general we get lots
of hi Jason we can't hear you anymore
and we have to wait for my mic to come
back and that gets edited out so you
guys miss that fun yeah by the way I do
want to apologize to everyone for some
of our less than stellar editing in
early episodes I listened to a couple of
our old episodes while preparing notes
and some of it was cringe-worthy so I
apologize for making you all listen to
that I'm gonna try to be better and
better at editing so that's just a
recommendation if you haven't listened
to any of them start at the beginning
and work your way forward you don't want
to go backward in quality yeah it's not
worth it
we do not have a blooper reel no that
just winds up on hitting room floor yeah
um I know great the question I'm sorry
would you consider moving the server C++
yeah right now we post everything on
github I don't remember what it's called
some JavaScript library turns all our
pages into HTML static HTML if someone
made a similar tool for C++ I'd
definitely be up for using it I know
Alfred from include OS talk to us about
maybe getting our website up there yeah
there's yeah at least one C++ content
management system being worked on in
this room the question was what's going
to be in upcoming episodes we usually
record an episode and publish it like
two days later or 1 day later so we
don't have content in the bag weeks from
now we do have guests scheduled two or
three and we put two or three get
scheduled for the next few weeks I know
one is guy Davidson yes I don't know
yeah but yeah please feel free to
recommend guess we're always looking for
recommendation that's the main way we
get guests on the show just by someone
asking us to interview them I think at
this point we've had most of the most
requested guests if you will because we
got Scott and herb and an Andre and you
know those are people that people know
and people wanted to hear on the podcast
well I'll let you answer that one
the question was what episode would you
recommend to hook me into the podcast
we've had a lot of great ones I know I
was talking to a listener the other day
he recommended Hartman Kaiser
when we're talking about parallelism and
that was an early episode that was the
first one URL was the first one I was on
it was a very good episode yeah I
thought not just because I was there so
how did you learn how to talk about C++
without a whiteboard or video or
reference so how did you guys fall upon
the format or has a Jew Roth fall upon
the format and have you been tweaking it
over time maybe we're still learning I
don't know so Richard just came up here
just to get a sticker anyway anything
else it is tricky though I would like to
comment on that briefly sometimes we I
you know Rob will be talking with the
guests or I'll be talking with the
guests but I'm sure you do the same
thing you're sitting there making notes
like okay how can I get further deeper
into this topic without going completely
off the reservation and having no idea
what people are talking about on the air
one thing I'll say is you know I think
podcasts were kind of passive way of
listening to content where you listen to
the episode if it's something that
really interests you go and see if
there's a CPP con talk about it they can
watch on YouTube
for more information or go read some
blog post about it you know we're just a
way of introducing you to some new ideas
and maybe you didn't hear it already
yeah how is hosting the podcast helped
us with our C++ journeys personally for
me I am way more on top of news than I
would otherwise be I'm subscribed to
every C++ news feed I am aware of yeah
and I'm definitely following a lot more
sequels Faust community news than I
would have previously I'm more aware of
because we have to research every topic
we're going to have
the show doesn't extend to make
questions for it yeah that too yeah yes
are there subjects that we think we
should cover more I don't I don't know
any particular subjects I know one
comment we regularly get from listeners
is that we should do more technical
deeper stuff and as we already discussed
that's difficult to do without a
whiteboard or something but as far as I
know that's the most requested thing
that people ask us for we also
frequently get requests for doing more
in true level oh yes that's right yeah
and we're we had a another panel earlier
today that I went and attended where
they were mentioning how user groups
it's hard to get intro level content so
I guess the same applies to us but if
anyone's a C++ professor or something
and they want to come on the show I
think that'd be great
yeah that could be cool yeah so the
question was would we ever consider
doing like an IRC chat or a Google
hangout while doing the podcast and it's
something I've thought a little bit
about but our schedules really erratic
yeah most of the time Wednesday at noon
is when we record Wednesday at lunch on
Eastern coasts yes yeah but that can
vary because if we're talking to someone
on the west coast then that might be too
early for them and we wind up talking to
them at like 9:00 p.m. my time so it's
just very erratic I'm not sure if
listeners would be willing to keep up
with our schedule yeah well on a side
note if you want something like that
John culpas is doing his live
epi chat yeah John called the CBP chat
which is a Google hangout and well not
anymore because Google hangout just got
shut down or Google hangout live thing
so he has to move to you to live
okay but soon how's our tiles alright
well thank you for your time today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
