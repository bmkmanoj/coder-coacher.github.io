You might not know my name very well,
but you might know my books,
a little bit of them, at least.
Oh, let me see, my focus
is not where it should be.
So I'm an author of a couple of books
about templates, standard
library, et cetera.
And there are some new books
about templates and C++17.
And I should point out that I always write
because I don't understand C++.
And I need a book to explain it to me
again and again and again,
because I forget everything,
and everything gets crazy and
more crazy and even crazier.
And this is what the talk is about.
The talk is about the problem
an ordinary, stupid, maybe naive
application programmer has
when they want to write
a pretty simple class
that's having two strings,
and make it perfect.
Here's a class I want to
write with you together.
The class is a class
customer, with three members,
a first name, a last name, and an ID.
And the first name and the
last names are strings.
So what's the problem here?
Well, first of all we need a constructor.
And I will only talk
about this constructor
the whole hour, nothing else.
And the problem with this constructor
is at first not obvious.
We do it the way we learned it.
So we take a const string reference
because we don't want to copy the string
when it gets passed
because copying a string
is pretty expensive.
So we take them by reference.
And by the way, the second
and the third arguments
have default arguments, so
we can pass only one string.
And we initialize first
name, last name, and ID
by the passed arguments.
So I wanna create a customer C,
initialized with two string
literals and an integer.
And here's my first question to you
for the morning, to wake up.
How many expensive string
calls are done here?
I mean, how often do I copy
or copy-assign a string?
Which is a malloc, unless we
have short string optimization.
So it's a potential expensive operation.
Think about.
You have your number?
Okay.
Let's see.
In the program somewhere,
we have the two literals,
Joe and Fix.
The arguments expect a string.
So we have to create two strings
to be able to pass them by reference.
So that means we create two strings,
and that means we have to first malloc,
unless we have short string optimization.
So assume for the moment these are strings
with more than 15 characters.
Then you have always a problem.
And now we have the first
and the second argument,
and now we have to
initialize first and last.
And because we pass it
by a constant reference,
they are copied again to
create our final object.
And the initial temporary F
and L would get destructed.
Okay?
You probably know that.
Maybe all of you.
So we have four mallocs,
or four potential mallocs.
Two because we created the temporaries,
two because we copy them to the members
of the customer class.
So we have C++.
We want to make it perfect.
Sometimes performance matters.
So the question is, how
can we make this perfect?
How can we improve things?
So first of all, what we have done before
we went into C++11, we usually overloaded
for const character star.
So because then we can directly take
an address of a string
literal as an argument
and directly initialize the
members by the passed pointers,
so we save two mallocs.
Two mallocs, only two
creates we have here.
Let's create a string, and pass a string
and a string literal.
Oh, too bad, because now only
the first function matches.
So we have three mallocs, and one of it
is not necessary.
Yeah, because we have the
initial problem again.
And so of course we overload
for all four functions,
for all four combinations.
And that's what we do if we
want to make it perfect in C++.
Well, three and not yet.
Good.
Now we get move semantics.
So what happens if we move?
So we no longer need the string S here.
So I want to move it
into the created object.
How many mallocs?
Two.
Because there's no move support
in the constructor of the string class.
So we create a copy
when we initialize it,
which means, yes, we pass
it to the parameter F,
but when taking F to initialize first,
we create a copy, and
the second copy is for
creating the temporary,
which is not good.
Well, not perfect, I should say.
It's usually fine.
So how can we make this perfect?
Overload for an R value reference.
So use move semantics in the constructor.
Okay.
Let's do that.
Let's overload for an L value reference,
a constant L value reference,
for all the places where we don't need
move semantics, and let's
use an R value reference
for move semantics.
And by the way, move semantics covers both
move L value, so move
existing objects with name,
and temporary.
So a string literal
will be covered by that.
So we don't need the const
character star overload
for the moment.
So when we have, now, our initial,
our creation of the customer C,
and we have our string literal
somewhere in the program,
we create F and L.
We call the second constructor,
so we create
a string.
We still need a string.
But this string is a temporary.
And the good thing with a temporary,
when we have move semantic-less,
we can steal the value.
So what happens here is when we then
initialize the string, we steal
the heap memory of Joe,
and we steal the heap memory of Fix,
which means two mallocs only,
because we still create temporaries,
but copying them got cheap.
That's our final object.
And we delete the temporaries.
We deconstruct these temporaries.
So we have two mallocs here,
two to create
the temporary, and then
we steal the memory,
so we move the strings.
And move is pretty cheap.
It's not perfectly cheap, but it's fine.
Okay.
So of course, again, we
need all the overloads
for all combinations.
So here are some other examples of that.
For example, if we pass a
string and a string literal,
we have not three but two mallocs,
and with move semantics,
we have now one malloc.
And that's almost perfect.
10 minutes are gone,
and I've explained C++.
It's easy.
Let's just do it.
Oh.
Let's pass only one argument.
It doesn't compile.
You know what?
You know why?
We have too many default
values in our constructors.
We blindly copied all the defaults.
And that means, for customer F,
we now have two matching constructors,
which is the second
and the last.
Oops, I'm one too far.
Both match.
So if we overload for all these versions
and you have default arguments,
be sure that you have
the default arguments
for only one combination and
not to make things ambiguous.
Okay, so let's remove
some default arguments
where we don't need them.
Let's, for example, choose
the default arguments
to be used only when we
have R value references.
Let's try out something different.
Let's use copy initialization.
This does not compile.
And by the way, it never compiled
in any of the versions I showed you,
which is surprising.
I mean, I create a customer.
Customer can take a string.
And I pass it nico, and it doesn't work.
And this, in general, is a problem.
This is a problem we have
innormality in the language,
because here we have two
user-defined conversions.
So we first convert the string literal
to a string using a
user-defined constructor.
The library counts as user-defined here.
And then we convert the string,
the resulting temporary
string, to a customer.
So this does not compile,
what you see here.
That's the reason.
And that has always been the case in C++.
So what can we do with that?
Oh, it seems we still need
our const character star overloads.
And of course all the combinations.
Well, strictly speaking, we
don't need all the combinations
because this problem with G can only apply
to the first argument.
Because copy initialization
without list initializing,
so without curly braces,
is only possible with one argument.
But not to make it too complicated,
let's overload all nine combinations.
You like C++, don't you?
And beware that you make
the default arguments right.
To avoid ambiguities.
Two mallocs here.
The good thing is we now have
made it a little bit better,
because we don't have
moves anymore involved
when we pass two string literals,
because we have the constructors taking
the pointer directly.
So we have two mallocs here,
two mallocs here, one malloc here,
and that is, by the way, that is perfect.
It can't become better,
because we create three strings,
we pass five string literals,
so we need five creates,
and we pass one string,
which we move.
It can't become better.
We should at least talk
about passing by value
because all this trouble is driven
by the fact that we pass by reference.
And how many of the
problems here can be avoided
by taking the arguments by value.
Ooh, by value, a string.
Let's see.
First of all, we still have the problem
with the two user-defined conversions.
So let's make it correct.
Let's add this additional
single constructor,
taking a const character star.
Now let's count, and see what happens.
First constructor has four mallocs.
That's not good.
But it works because we create the strings
and because we have by value.
We don't have references.
We pass them to get
copied to first and last,
to the members.
We have the same problem here
and the same problem here.
So these are 11 mallocs.
That's a lot worse than the optimal,
perfect version of five, having five
for these three calls.
So what is the fix?
What is the fix?
Move, yes.
Move the temporaries into the members.
So because you create
them, then you pass them,
so move them to the member
because we don't need that anymore.
And now what does that mean?
Two mallocs here, because
we create two strings,
we create a new value of string here,
and then we move this temporary
F and L, or this argument, I should say,
F and L, to the members first and last.
Two mallocs here.
One because we copy the string.
Yes, and that's good.
We still need the string.
We didn't move the string into the object.
And one to create the
temporary string for the second argument.
And then here we have one malloc
because we move the string
into the member of first.
And
cool.
Done.
So remember where we came from.
We started with
the problem of having just
the string constructor,
single string constructor,
taking objects by reference.
And it ended up to have something like
between seven and nine overloads
to make it perfect.
And with this, we have two versions.
And we are almost perfect.
This overhead here is the moves.
Or at least one, which we have
because we pass F with move semantics.
But of course, we have
something else in the standard,
which is called perfect forwarding.
So we have an alternative approach,
which is let's pass the elements
as a universal reference,
or as it is called now
in the standard, a forwarding reference,
which is an R value reference
of a template parameter,
and use forward.
Not that easy to implement,
but we learned it that way.
This covers all nine
combinations and even more.
Good.
Now when we create a customer C
and pass two string literals,
then F and L, our arguments,
become universal references
or forwarding references
to these literals.
So we don't copy anything.
We just introduce new names for them.
And the key thing with forward is
it does the right thing.
It almost always does the
right thing, I should say.
So in this case,
when we have a temporary,
no, in this case, when we have
an L value and a string literal,
and originally it's an L value,
it takes this to
initialize the two members
first and last.
Two mallocs.
That's it, perfect.
That's why we call it perfect forwarding.
Let's pass a string we have already.
Two mallocs.
Perfect.
One copy of S,
one create for the Fix.
By the way, in this version,
the type S1 is std string,
and the type S2 is const character star.
Am I right?
No.
Why don't you scream?
Hey, you are tired still?
We pass by reference.
By reference means
if you pass template
arguments by reference,
they don't decay.
They keep their original type,
which means that the type of S2 is
an array of four const characters.
But it works.
That's a good thing.
And we can move,
and we have what we had.
We have one malloc because
we moved the string
into first, and we create
one for the temporary.
Done, thank you very
much for your attention.
Oh.
Why don't I get any applause?
(applause)
Ah. (laughs)
Because you knew all of that.
That's the problem, nothing new.
What the hell is this guy telling you?
Well, I wanna multi-weight the problem.
Let's create
a single customer, just
passing one argument.
Does this compile?
No.
What a surprise, if the title is but.
The error is conversion
from const character five,
array of five const characters,
to a non-scalar type
customer is requested.
Yes, yes.
So what's the problem?
The good news is, the good thing is
we have different compilers.
One compiler gives me that.
Another compiler gives me that.
And that's a little bit
helpful, or more helpful.
No viable conversion from
const character five to cust.
Among the different candidates,
it lists, I think it's Clang here.
One candidate template
has the following problem.
I couldn't infer the template argument S2.
Because
template arguments with default values,
or template arguments for arg, no,
I should say template parameters
for call arguments with default values
are not deduced.
You all know that rule, don't you?
So what is solution?
Well, we have to also place
a default for the template parameter.
And what is the default here?
Const character star.
Well, we could also say an
array of one const character,
but that seems to be a little bit strange.
So let's do it that
way, and let's compile.
Let's compile it with GCC.
Fine.
Let's compile it with Clang.
Fine.
Let's compile it with Visual Studio.
Actually, I don't know
which compiler is right.
We wrote a new template book of 850 pages.
And I don't know which compiler is right,
I have to confess.
Who knows which one is right?
Anybody here?
I prepared a few of the
slides over the last two days.
I found it yesterday.
I just said, oh, let's make a last try.
And by the way, why do I always say
the default argument for S2 is std string?
Let's use const characters.
And suddenly it didn't
compile on my compiler.
Okay.
So the good thing is, it
works if you use std string.
On all compilers. (laughs)
You like C++, don't you?
Okay, all problems are gone.
But let's extend the test suite
because we found that we
should try out everything
for this simple class.
So the next test we do is
let's call a copy constructor.
Couple of you know what happens now.
It doesn't compile.
We have no matching constructor
for the initialization of std string.
Note, in instantiation
of the function template
specialization customer taking a customer
for the customer instantiated
as a customer reference,
customer reference, okay,
and an std string is requested here.
Okay, hmm.
A const customer copied to
another customer compiles.
And probably most of you
have seen this problem also,
some time before.
The problem is here.
The problem is that we pass a customer
and not a const customer.
And the compiler now finds
two matching functions.
One is the predefined copy constructor.
The predefined copy constructor
takes a const customer
reference.
We don't pass a const customer.
We pass a customer here.
Wait a moment.
And so our templified
constructor is a better match
by language rules.
So it will be used.
And as it will be used, it is instantiated
for the first time to be a customer,
by the way, to be a customer reference,
we come to that in a moment.
And at the second time,
because we don't pass
a second argument with std string.
So this is used to
be compiled.
And the problem is that the moment,
so F is a customer here.
And we try to initialize the member first
by the customer F.
There was a question.
(man talking quietly)
No, the question is why it's
a predefined copy constructor.
Copy constructors are almost always there
unless you delete them.
Before C++11, they were always there.
So it's different from
the default constructor,
which is only there if there
is no other constructor.
But the copy constructors
are almost always there.
The only exception is if
you have explicitly defined
move constructor or move
assignment operator.
So this is a significant problem.
We run into it all the time,
even in our standard library.
And we have to deal with it.
Unfortunately, we didn't
fix the language here.
You should have done that,
in maybe standardized C++11,
but now it's probably too late.
So we should say here the
inbuilt copy constructor
is a better match.
But it isn't.
And therefore, we have a problem here.
And the usual way to solve
this is to use SFINAE,
or enable-if.
Enable-if says, it's the idea to say
I wanna ignore this constructor
if the following is the case.
And I wanna ignore this
template constructor
if I pass a customer
as a first argument, because then I mean
a copy constructor, and I wanna have
this copy constructor
called and not my function,
which is only there to
initialize my members by strings.
So the way we can program that,
since even before C++11, is with something
like enable-if.
But in C++11 we have
standardize the feature
so we can use a standard enable-if
with some tricky template
techniques here involved,
which roughly means, behind the scenes,
enable-if checks whether the check,
is S1 the same as a type customer,
is true or false at compile time.
And if this is false,
the whole template is gone, is away.
It's not there.
So if we pass a customer
as in a copy constructor,
this is not used.
Well, in theory, if we
make everything right.
We don't have done that already, yeah.
We call that, by the way, SFINAE'd out.
So Google became a word, a verb.
SFINAE became also a verb.
And I am wondering when
it is in the Webster
or any other dictionary.
It's our fault.
In the first edition of C++ Templates,
we introduced that term.
I apologize.
Marshall told us that
it's almost worst acronym
we have in C++.
There's only one worse, which is RAII.
Okay.
So, okay.
This is ugly syntax, isn't it?
It is.
But we have other versions in C++11.
So for example, one ugliness is
because enable-if yields a type,
the type is void and is ignored,
the whole trick is to say
we have here a check,
but there is no reason
we introduce a third template argument.
The third template argument is only there
to introduce this check.
And it yields a type.
And because it yields a
type, we need type name
before std enable-if.
So in C++14, we introduce something like
enable-if underscore T so that we have,
can say both, one leading type name
in front of std enable, and
the trailing colon colon type.
And by the way, that was so cool
that I think it was Walter Brown,
thank you, Walter, proposed to say,
well, we wanna have it all,
so for trades where we
have colon colon value,
so in C++17, we now can write
it at least on one line,
provided the name of the
type trait is not too long.
We have some of that.
Okay.
We still have the error.
Why that?
Because, you see it here.
You see that this
template is instantiated,
not for a customer, we pass a customer.
It's instantiated for a reference.
This is a template
instantiated for a reference.
Why that?
It's a fault of perfect forwarding.
Because when we perfect forward,
no, excuse me, of forwarding it's a fault.
The problem is if we have move semantics
and we pass something with move semantics,
so we declare something
as an R value reference,
when we use it, it's an L value.
And the reason is that move semantics
should not be automatically be forwarded.
Because if that would be the case,
and we use our argument twice,
the first use we would use
the value, with the first use.
So we have a special,
very interesting rules
in the standard saying that there
are some special cases involved
to more or less make
forward do the right thing.
So sometimes calling
move and sometimes not.
And we need an ampersand here
because when we pass
this customer object F,
the template argument S1 is deduced
as an L value.
And here's a rule, by the way.
It's pretty obvious.
It says everything, so
why don't you only read
the standard, and you understood C++.
If the parameter type, which is F here,
is an R value reference,
which is the case,
we have two ampersands,
to a CV-unqualified template parameter,
we have a template parameter S1,
and it's neither qualified with const
nor with volatile,
and the argument is an L value,
yes, we pass an argument
as an L, F as an L value,
the type L value reference to T
is used in place of T for type deduction.
And again, this is to make
move semantics work fine,
more or less in generic code
that we don't need overload
or that we can perfect forward things.
Done!
We have solved our problem.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(applause)
You got it, yeah.
(laughs)
Let's see whether the
applause goes, raises more.
(laughs)
Ring.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Oh, you used my customer class?
Awesome.
What?
How you derive it?
Well,
it's clear.
You have ripped customers, VIP customers.
Oh, I forgot.
You have VIP customers.
Okay.
Publicly derived from customer.
I tell you what.
You will get the problem I just fixed.
So please have it using declarations,
so that we inherit all the
abilities of this constructor
so that we again can
pass one or two strings,
and optionally an int.
Does everything still work?
Does everything still work?
If you know the answer, there's no reason
to buy our new C++ Templates book.
Otherwise, there is. (laughs)
Okay.
Shameless advertisement.
Yes, everything works.
I can initialize even a
VIP with an equals sign.
I can use a copy constructor.
So this, the tricky case is here.
And everything else also works fine.
So great, we're done.
What?
What do you say?
You have a problem?
Why?
Oh.
Oh, you tried to create a customer
and pass the VIP?
Oh, that doesn't compile.
Too bad.
So what is the problem here?
We disable this templified
customer in the base class
only if we pass a customer reference.
But what we pass here is a VIP reference.
This is perfectly legal.
The VIP is a customer because
it's publicly derived.
But this does not compile.
The strange error we got
is you are not allowed
to initialize first, the string first,
with a VIP.
Okay.
So we can't use, it's saying
we should use a different type trait.
There are a couple of
interesting options here.
For example, it's an
interesting discussion,
should we use is-convertible
or is-constructable here?
And just to confuse the Russians,
the order is different depending on
which one of them you use.
Just to confuse the North
Koreans, I should say these days.
You still get an error?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I skipped the ampersand.
But anyway, it's okay because
the ampersand is no longer
necessary because it converts.
A reference converts to a non-reference.
So what is the problem here?
Think about it.
Which language rule is broken here?
Without saying the answer, who knows
what the problem here is?
Please raise your hand.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Good, cool, guys.
I sent a back repo to Jonathan
because when I tried this out,
I got the error message,
and the error message was this.
So now you understand
what's going wrong, huh?
So now you get it?
The problem is similar to a problem
when you get a call down,
and you're lucky because
you had undefined behavior,
and if you didn't got the call down,
even worse things could have happened.
And the problem is simple.
It's a logical error,
which, what we do here?
We define the constructor.
And why we define a constructor,
we say we wanna have it
if an argument is
convertible to a type cust,
which needs a constructor.
So by defining the rules for
how can I create a customer,
I ask myself whether I'm available or not.
So we were lucky to get this error.
By the way,
when I try this out, there's
a longer story behind it,
in some versions it worked fine.
And then I switched to
slightly different way
of enable-if here, and
suddenly the compiler crashed,
which can also be the result of this.
Yeah, we made something wrong here.
We can't use is-convertible-to-cust.
We have to formulate it
the other way around.
We have to say, oh, can't say
is-not-convertible-to-cust.
So we have to say
is-convertible-to-string.
So we have to formulate it positively
because string is not what we define here,
and we can use a type
trait for strings here.
Done.
Perfect, thank you very much.
(applause)
(laughs)
(applause)
If you don't like the way
you have to disable this template,
there's light on the horizon,
which is called C++20
because in C++20, we will
have a language feature
as a side effect of concept
which is called requires
so that we can formulate this requirement
not as a string enable-if
type trait, library feature.
We have now language feature
disabling templates for some cases.
So we simply write this requires
that the type S1 is
convertible to a string.
Otherwise, this template will be ignored.
We are looking forward to C++20.
And, yeah.
I hate it.
When we wrote C++
Templates, the new edition,
I don't know how often I thought
I hate to write enable-if here.
Was a big mistake, really big mistake
that with concepts, we played
the all or nothing game,
which is a serious problem we have
in the Standard Committee right now.
People wanna have concept all or nothing.
And we should have standardized requires,
at least requires.
Because it's obvious that we need it,
because we have enable-if
all over the place.
If you look into standard
libraries implemented,
there's a huge number
of enable-if statements
to fix the problems you just saw
and a couple of other problems.
Let's summarize.
There's no further trap.
There's no further trap I know yet.
Let's think about these three statements.
Let's think about C, D, and E
initialized by two string literals,
by a string and a string literal,
and by a move string and a string literal.
And everything else
should still work fine.
So we started with, we wanna
have perfect performance
for this little customer class.
And when we try to reach
this perfect performance,
we run into trouble.
And we try to solve this trouble.
So the initial version, no,
as a side effect after
some versions we tried,
we came back to the question,
why don't we pass strings by value here?
And it turned out that
this is pretty expensive.
11 potential mallocs
unless we have short string
optimization, because
we have four creates,
and the expensivest thing is that we got,
with these three statements, as a summary,
we got seven copies.
Expensive string copies.
And one move.
So the solution was, here, to use std move
for the by value passed argument F and L.
And we were almost perfect.
We got five mallocs, because
four creates and one copy,
which is exactly what we had.
We had two creates for
the first statement,
because we have two string literals,
then one string literal
at the second statement,
and one string literal
at the third statement.
So we can't avoid that.
And one copy, because
the second constructor
takes S by value.
And it should be its own copy.
And then we have, but the overhead
to a perfect solution is five moves.
That's pretty, pretty good.
The next alternative were five mallocs.
So that was a perfect solution,
but we needed all the overloads.
At least seven.
Had seven or nine.
And then we got our easy solution,
having only one declaration.
And this is also perfect,
but it has a strange enable-if syntax.
And by the way, take your picture now,
because now the slide is complete.
The first two versions still have
the const character star problem.
So when we use copy initialize, let's say,
initialization with the equals sign
and pass a string literal, then,
so therefore in the first two versions
to make this available, to enable this,
you need one other constructor.
The other constructor should just take
one const character star.
And that's all.
That's all I wanna say.
Who's the winner?
Who thinks, well, we don't
vote for the first version,
of course.
Who thinks the second
version, pass by value,
is the best solution here?
Okay.
Who thinks the third version
is the best solution here?
Who thinks the last version
is the best solution here?
And all the others?
Hate C++ or what?
(laughing)
Well, is there an alternative I missed?
String-view?
Ah, how many minutes do we have?
(laughing)
String-view.
Okay, I forgot that, to be honest.
But string-view
is not better.
It's an alternative, but it's not better.
With string-view, let me think.
With string-view, we have,
we create, if we pass an std string,
we can use it as a string-view.
That's fine.
And if we use a string-view to,
so the problem is if
you pass an std string
to a string-view
and then use the string-view argument
to initialize your string,
you call the constructor.
So you still need some overloads for that.
So, yeah.
Next time I will discuss that.
Okay, any other alternative?
(man talking quietly)
What about aggregate initialization?
(man talking quietly)
If I make all feeds public,
are you serious with this question?
(laughing)
So then you directly
can pass the elements,
there's no argument
involved in the constructor,
so it's better, yeah.
So the rule is make all the feeds public!
(laughing)
Thank you very much.
(applause)
Next time I have a slide for that.
(laughing)
Well, any other great contribution,
what else we could do?
Sorry for that. (laughs)
What?
(person talking quietly)
String literals internally in the class?
(person talking quietly)
In the initialization, string literal.
What do you mean by string literal?
(person talking quietly)
Yes, so he's saying when I overload
for const characters, can
I avoid some overloads,
yeah, but we had that already.
Yeah, okay.
(person talking quietly)
The question is can
we, in the second case,
rely on an optimizer to have
the certain performance add
at the third, or what?
So to help with the move?
Well, in practice, this is not done.
I'm not sure.
I'm only an application programmer.
So anyway, summary.
We can afterwards discuss a lot,
and you can send me emails, I'm fine.
And I know I'm not perfect.
I only present my view as
an application programmer.
And you ask again and
again, C++ is tricky.
You can do everything, and
you can make every mistake.
The next thing is, oh, that's missing.
My animations are wrong here.
Second topic was added late
because it turned out that finally
I decided that the second option,
the second bullet is the winner.
So that we say...
Oh, doesn't work.
No, we can put that.
So yeah, here it is.
So that we pass by value
is incredible good.
Not perfect, but I would
recommend it in this case
because we have to teach C++ to people.
The usage of enable-if is a nightmare
for application programmers.
And by the way,
you might think that requires makes it
a little bit better.
We are currently discussing
a couple of troubles
we probably get when we
have the requires class
in the standard library.
Because the requires class
changes the signature
of a function.
And the moment you have the
require class standardized,
and you wanna change your requirement,
you break binary compatibility,
which will be a serious issue.
We currently discuss
where to apply concepts
and how to apply concepts in the library.
We have no solution for that yet.
Yeah.
(man talking quietly)
Yeah, the argument was that the problem
of the expensive copying is not there
if we have short strings
and our implementation uses
the short string optimization,
which is in most compilers now the case.
Usually up to 15 characters.
So if in your programming language
or in your application your customer names
are less than 15 characters, that's fine.
That's perfect, or almost perfect.
Yeah, there are applications
of this problem having a customer
with a string member, which
is a pretty common thing,
I think, where strings are
longer than 15 characters.
And by the way, yeah.
No, yeah, sorry.
(man talking quietly)
If we wouldn't have
default arguments, yeah,
we would not need it, yeah.
You're right, yes.
Sometimes we have default arguments,
or sometimes we have a constructor
taking only one string.
So it happens.
Yeah, so the workaround is
you are not allowed only
to pass the first name.
Yes.
That's how our APIs derived
from the constraints
of a language differ.
Good advice.
We have C++17 support now.
It's good.
So some of the features I discussed here,
are already in C++17,
especially the improvements
of the type traits.
We had a lot of issues, oh,
that's another question.
(man talking quietly)
Pardon?
(man talking quietly)
Pardon?
(man talking quietly)
Clang 4 starts to support C++17,
but the major support is
in Clang 5, you're right.
Yeah, so it's plus.
It's four plus.
At seven plus, we also have GCC 8 here.
Thank you.
Templates are tricky.
You saw a couple of problems here,
which we describe now in the book.
And I have to say, I'm not the expert.
The experts are the two other authors.
I only try to understand what they write.
That was my task in this book.
And
just as a hint, I'm also currently writing
a complete guide about C++17.
If you're interested, go there.
It will be published in a different model
than the other books.
It will be published as soon
as a third of the book is done,
as an ebook.
And you can buy it for very low money,
and then get for free the updates.
Because otherwise, I need one more year
to make this all done.
I have a huge list of issues I learned
already this week when I
listened to the other talks.
So if you're interested, look at that.
And I'm still looking for
reviewers of that book.
The first version will
come out in probably
four weeks or so.
And I'm looking forward to C++20.
For requires and some other things.
That's it.
I'm here, I'm still here the whole week.
So tomorrow I will tell you
my other interesting findings
about what I learned about templates
when we wrote the second edition.
Trying to have a book
signing will be there.
And on Saturday I talk a whole day
about move semantics.
There is more to tell.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Please talk to me later.
Thank you.
