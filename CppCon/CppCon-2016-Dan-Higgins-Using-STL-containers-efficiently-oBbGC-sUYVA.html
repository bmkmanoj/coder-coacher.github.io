writing good okay cool so one of my
background so I was in triple games and
then I went to math works and did and
brought a buncha game developers and
math works we went to science and it was
really cool because we're able to bring
efficiency and speed and in games you
have to do a lot of zine patterns and as
it's pretty hardcore so doing I've seen
a lot of performance mistakes in legacy
code and in real time code and I'm just
going to kind of go over some of the
things that we can do every day so this
isn't really like here's this high level
optimization to do you know which is how
we know all optimization really should
be but there are things you can do every
day and you're coding to make sure your
code is fast you don't die by thousand
cuts so again you know games as very
performant industry if you're looking if
you guys are looking for a really good
plus loss game developers like go and
check out games go recruit people from
games because industry changes so much
so you can find some super good des
there so an example you know math works
we had a graphical thing and moving a
block across screen took a millisecond
the guy's like this is really good it
only takes millisecond lights you know
millisecond gains it's an eternity like
oh my gosh you know now you move a
thousand blocks and a game the the
application freezes for a second so like
you have a lot of real time as a totally
different mentality so every every line
of code really does matter so common
mistakes I see obviously copying objects
there's a lot of things like this is
small object now it doesn't matter this
is a shared pointer I can just copy
instead of pass by reference like like
pass but do that do the easy stuff you
know pass by reference don't don't have
any extra work done unless you must
actually gives you benefit and I find
more often than not people kind of just
feel like own today's age I don't need
to obviously choosing the wrong data
structure we all know that from like
cs101 that you know you need to make one
matches like if you're going to iterate
or something a lot don't pick something
that has memory scattered all over the
place don't have a map or something like
that you need memory that's you know
next to each other a big one I found
especially in legacy code bases is doing
duplicate work right I look up a
variable and I look it up and I look it
up I look it up and the same one over
and over and over and like maybe they do
it in three different functions maybe
the functions are you know spread out
but maybe they're call from like the
same type of area like there there's a
lot of duplicate work
that can happen in a code that that we
can avoid that makes a big difference
and you know optimizer does well I
remember interviewing somewhere for an
optimization position and every answer
was like well the optimizer does that
like well how do you how do you make
this faster the optimizer takes care of
it like optimizer doesn't isn't like
this miracle worker right they do some
really cool stuff but they don't solve
everything like we can do a lot so
simple thing on vectors
you know ICL vectors like vector is like
almost always best choice not saying I
need a map right the other x word you
need a map but like vector you can
actually use you can do some tricks to
make it acts sort of like a list when
you need to list one of them is
something eggs a lot which is how to
race from the middle so like you know
you don't want to like I have a million
items and directs the middle and then I
grab those things I move them together
again like we don't want to do that
right if it's unordered you can do
something really simple which is just a
copy last item on to where you're
deleting it and then pop back right you
don't have any reallocation it's really
quick so I put a bunch of these types of
template functions in there so I can
just say hey I want to race I want to do
a faster race or not and the other one I
put one like we're going to if you're
going to lock a mutex and do some like a
copy of a vector just do a swap like
have it have a dummy vector just just
swap them right you don't need to do a
full deep copy and keep the mutex lock
now we're at one really big thing for
legacy code so math works you know 100
million lines of code think things like
that was on in maps they have things
that they would look up the same item
millions and millions of times that the
data would never change and the answer
is always the same one they're looking
up so you know I built an STD map that
would track that usage so it just simply
produced that so like you know why like
let's just find the ones that produce
the the problems and then you know then
I can replace it with a last recently
used map so then a little tiny cache
which just says hey if nothing's changed
in the map I just keep the last thing
you looked up and the last key you used
and if there's same then I'd only have
to do a search so it's like it's not
really a you know it doesn't make sense
for things that are volatile or things
that your cheat you're searching to all
these other different things all times
which is why I need to kind of do the
statistics and see if it works but if it
does it's a huge boost to
like it's almost like a free beating
right because you can be in the middle
of a system
you know when the arguments was like
more scripting engine so who knows what
data we're going to have like everything
has a pattern so a lot of people don't
don't make assumptions that just because
it's kind of random things that you
think that it will never have a type of
pattern do the research and then this is
a really fun thing everybody's got that
one thing they wrote that they love in a
copyright template I can't really talk
too much about it except for because it
suits so long but you know when people
don't want to return by reference they
don't they have I have a million item
object I don't you know I don't want to
return my reference because the state
might be gone like this copyright
template was great because I can return
this it does a atomic reference counting
and the moment someone needs a writable
version of Forks so that way it's like a
really great way to go into a legacy
code base and start improving it without
having to understand all the state and
everything so I'm like hey if it changes
great then you got your copy if it
doesn't it's a freebie because it's just
a reference count they got to return by
and we don't have to do all this copying
of big data structures around so I think
that's all I have
yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
