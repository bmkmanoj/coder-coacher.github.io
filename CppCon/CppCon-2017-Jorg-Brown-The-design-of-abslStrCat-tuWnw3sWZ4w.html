said my name is Jorg Brown.
I did most of the design work
for something called StrCat,
which is part of absl.
And it's kind of interesting
because it provides a little
tour of C++ inefficiencies and
some interesting techniques
with variable templates.
So, what started all this,
about more than ten years ago,
was there is a lot of this
code where people construct
a string using the plus operator,
and the problem with that is
that there are a crazy amount
of temporaries that are constructed there.
Ten years ago, it would construct,
the string for user name,
append moves this to the front
to create a new temporary,
then would take the temporary,
add libs in to create another temporary,
then would take that temporary
concatenated with city,
create a final temporary,
then that final temporary
would be assigned operator
into the string,
and then all the temporaries
would be destructed.
It took not only a lot of time,
but it generated a ton of code.
So my first reaction was,
well why don't we just make a
simple routine that just
accepts a bunch of std strings,
and we do with that.
The problem with that is
you still need to create
temporary strings for the
string misses and the string
lives in,
but it's still much faster
it still generates much less code.
You can get better now
the way of string view,
or you know ten years ago we
had this thing called string
piece internally,
because now the literal
strings don't need to create
temporary string objects,
they can just create pointer length pairs.
So that's already quite a lot faster.
Having done that, then I
thought, well wait a minute,
if string view is doing this
thing where it automatically
is converting string
literals into you know,
pointer length pairs,
what if i could also do that for integers
and floating point numbers.
So I created yet another
class called AlphaNum,
and it's a simple, you know,
basically just a string view
but also a small pad where
you can store the digits
of a number.
As you can see there,
there's two constructors.
All they do is call some, you
know some shared library code
to take the integer or
floating point number,
and stuff it into digits.
There's one little extra trick.
I couldn't just create a
string view constructor,
because then if you try
to pass a literal string,
C++ would have to do two plus conversions.
First a string view, and then to AlphaNum.
So I have to actually spell
out the individual things
that are string like things.
So, had to do that.
Then we just find StrCat,
you know multiple varieties,
taking various number of arguments.
There, you know,
implementation is dirt simple.
You just do one initial
allocation that is actually
the final size, then copy the results in.
And the great thing is it turned out to be
really, really fast.
Not only does it not have to
allocate a wrong size string,
but unlike something like snprintf,
we wouldn't have to go
through every single character
and figure out what
the format specifier is
and then traverse C type var arts anymore.
So this is already three times faster,
and that's including the
overhead of actually allocating
a string.
A little extra thing though,
I don't, people quickly ran
into the argument numbers.
In the the initial one there
was a limit of nine arguments,
then it was expanded to 26,
and people still complained.
So thankfully with C++ 11
we have this thing
called initialize lists,
and we can use them here.
So now we can find StrCat,
we'll take the first two as AlphaNums,
and the third one will
just be an unlimited number
of arguments,
each one of which will
convert into an AlphaNum,
which then we'll grab the
string view from and pass that
to Cat Pieces.
One subtle thing here,
you'll notice that rather than
just constructing AlphaNum,
I do a static cast to a
const AlphaNum reference.
The reason for that is,
if somebody else wants to
have an interface like this,
they might take const AlphaNum
as one of their parameters,
and they want to pass
that reference to me.
And if I construct an AlphaNum,
then I have to copy the AlphaNum data,
where as if I do a static
cast const AlphaNum reference,
then there's no overhead for that.
No copy.
And then final slide,
just by the way this is
how Cat Pieces works.
Again we just loop over
the initializer list,
first grabbing the initial
size, allocate the string,
then mem copy the data and result.
And that's why it's fast.
This of course, being a lightning talk,
is a much abbreviated portion of the code,
but the actual real code is right there.
Thank you very much.
