My name is Simon Hausmann.
I'm an engineer working on Qt
for the past almost 15 years.
I'm glad to be here.
I'm going to talk a little
bit about the Qt Object Model,
or more specifically, about
some features in that model.
I'm going to take a little
bit of a look inside.
I originally scheduled
this for longer, but now,
since it's a half an
hour, I'm gonna squeeze it
and focus it down to mostly two things.
The background is very simple.
The topic of the conversation
is the object model,
or the message passing
in Qt, and how we can
pass messages from one object to another.
Because if we can,
that's good, if we can't,
it's gonna be a pretty boring application.
As you might remember from
yesterday's keynote from Lars,
Qt really tries to make programming easy,
and it tries to make it safe.
Easy and safe, is
really, really important.
Sometimes we compromise
that over other things.
And so the primary two mechanisms in Qt,
for passing messages, one
of them is sending events.
This is exactly what you think it is.
You just send an event to an object,
and maybe that object will deal
with the event, or it won't.
That's just a functional
method, basically.
And the other mechanism that
we have is signals and slots.
Which I'm going to assume now,
that you heard of before anyway,
because it's been around for a long time.
What I would like to
talk a little bit about
is peeking a little bit
into how those things work.
So, what happens, from emitting
a signal to calling a slot?
What's involved there?
And the second thing I want to
look at, is then afterwards,
is that this actually turns out to be
a very powerful mechanism
for making objects pass
messages to each other,
not only within one
thread, but across threads.
So, I'm just going to
jump straight into code,
because I like doing
that more than slides.
I don't like slides very much.
The example at hand is
a little calculator,
with two objects.
There's a main window, that's
the graphical interface,
which you're gonna see in a second.
You're gonna be blown away by it.
And then there is a calculator object,
which is doing the heavy-duty lifting.
Just to show you how it looks like,
this is top-notch graphical..
In my former life I was
a graphical designer,
evidently, as you can see.
This is the latest
material design, top-notch.
There's an input field, that's
where the cursor's blinking,
and so, we can just enter 1 +
2, and we get a result number.
Okay?
So, just so you know it works.
And the basis of this, is where
the message passer comes in.
The basis of this idea, is that the GUI
is connected to the calculator.
There is the connection from window, here.
So when I look at the
screen, what I really want
is look at the blue
stuff when I highlight,
that's usually what I'm talking about.
Because I can't reach all there.
So, there's a connection
between the window
and the calculator.
When this awesome GUI says,
okay, the user decided
he wants to do a calculation.
It sends out the signal,
we've requested evaluating
in the binary expression.
It calculates something, it's
got a string attached to it,
it's a function, and
then on the calculator
we just want to call a slot
to do the heavy-duty lifting.
And by the way, if this
is going too quickly,
or there's something unclear,
because reading code is really hard,
do not hesitate to interrupt me
or ask me quickly something, okay?
So the window says,
please evaluate something,
calculate something, and calculator does
and we'll get that, we'll
be connected to that.
And when the calculator is
done doing it's heavy lifting,
because it's gonna take a really long time
to calculate those complex additions,
it's going to send out a signal,
that's evaluation completed,
and we just connect that to the window,
which has a slot called display result,
which shows the little label
there, which shows the number.
Nothing particularly fancy.
But this is the core idea, alright?
You have two independent,
semi-independent objects,
and you connect them via
signal slot connection.
So, two things.
Oh, this is actually nice, in creator
you can just go to those things,
like you have the cursor
here, and you just press F2
and it figures out, oh, this is the signal
that belongs to this and this
window, and it go right there.
Or for the calculator, for example,
you can just press F2, this is very neat!
It can go here.
So this is our evaluate
function, here's our calculator,
which is just a QObject, and it has the
dubious Q_OBJECT macro.
And then we declare a slot section,
with a slot that will do
our heavy lifting work.
I can't be bothered to do
this calculation myself,
so I'm just gonna embed
our Javascript engine.
I'm gonna ask our Javascript engine
to evaluate this expression.
But this could be potentially
much longer operation,
and then we finally emit the result.
Which is just declared here, right?
So we never implemented this thing,
this is just a function
declaration down here,
but we're calling it here.
So, what happens, oh yeah,
and then on the GUI side,
just one more thing.
This is our main window
here, and it creates
a little bit of two widgets, a line edit
and the label, and it puts them in order.
And when the line edit is done
finishing, like when
you press enter or so,
and there's a signal
emitted and we connect
the signal to a little lambda expression.
Those are the two lines down here.
And that's where we emit our signal,
emit our signal that we
request the calculator
to do it's very intensive computation.
So, let's run this, and
then we'll just have a look
and see what happens, or
what the call stack is like.
So I'm going to run this
and set a breakpoint,
here in our evaluate function.
I'm gonna set the breakpoint here,
this tiny little red thingy.
And then we are just going to run at 5.
And the debugger ended also.
What is this.
It also stopped there, didn't it?
Oh wait, this is...
The breakpoint I set
earlier, never mind that.
Okay, so here's our awesome calculator.
I'm gonna do 4+5,
And now I'm in this, in my evaluator,
so something did, evidently, work.
But now let's have a look and
see, how did Qt connect this
from the signal, to the slot.
So this is our call stack here,
this is where we are right now.
But I'm gonna go straight
back, to where we emitted
the signal, inside this lambda.
This is where we had the emit call.
So emit as a keyword, isn't
actually anything at all.
If I just press F2 here, to
see what emit really means,
you'll find out that emit means nothing.
The purpose of this emit keyword,
is to make reading the code easier.
The purpose is that,
when you read the code
and you see this emit step, and you see,
okay, semantically the
developer here is trying
to raise a signal, it's
trying to trigger a signal.
This is just about
making code read easier.
But ultimately, it's a function caller,
and this is a function
that we never implemented.
I never showed you that we implemented it,
because we didn't.
We declare signals, and Qt
will take care of implementing
them conveniently for
us, so we can call them.
So, next...
The next stack frame, one
up from emitting that signal
is impact this main window.
Evaluation requested signal.
And from the looks of this, this is...
I do write ugly code, but I
don't write code that ugly,
no, this is generated code.
This is what our meta object compiler
automatically generates for
you, when you declare a signal.
And what it's doing here...
This is a little bit on the tiny side.
What it's doing here is,
we have this expression
as a string, right?
This is our T1 parameter.
So, that all we really do, is we...
This is harder to see than I thought.
Ah, that doesn't work.
So what we really do, is
we take this parameter,
we take the address of it.
So, we don't copy parameters
that you provide to signal,
we don't make a copy of that,
no, we just take the address of it.
So, that's practically for free, right?
And we stuff that into
an array of void stars.
The first parameter here is
actually, what is a nullptr,
is actually the return value.
You can actually give
signals return values,
it's a bit awkward, but it's possible,
because some people do awkward things.
What matters is that the
parameter of the signal
are stuffed, or the
address of the parameters
are stuffed into a void star array,
so that's a practically free operation.
And then, we go into
the belly of the beast,
sorry, it sounds like a secret function.
This is going into Qt.
And what we pass into Qt itself then is,
well a reference to the sender
that it missed a signal.
And the address of what we
call a static meta object.
That's a data structure
that, besides this code
that we generate, we also generate
an entirely read-only data structure,
that describes what signals you declared,
what slots you declared,
what properties you declared,
what are the parameters.
This is the full
introspection game, basically.
So that's also useful, to compare and see.
That information, basically,
allows for going back from
this array of void stars,
no idea what's in it,
to, oh, so the first
thing, the first element
in this void star array,
that's actually a Q string,
okay, that's how I need to deal with it.
So that information is there.
And then the third parameter is an index
in which signal this is, so this happens
to be the first signal, so it's zero,
but if this was the third
signal, it would say
three here, or two.
And finally, it passed these parameters.
So emitting a signal is
firstly, method called
and to generate a code, which just takes
the address of all the parameters,
which is practically a free operation,
and then it goes into Qt itself.
And this is then turning
into more magic code.
That takes a little longer to go through,
but at the heart of it, every
signal that's a connection
is an entry in the
link-less data structure.
So every connection,
from a signal to a slot,
is stored as a connection
object on the sender side.
And calling this activate function
will go through all of those connections,
and for each of those connections
it will try to call the
slot that's connected to it.
Because you have one signal
connected to many slots, if you want to.
Here we have only one,
but you could have more.
So, quick recap.
From emitting our
signal, we went one frame
into generated code, then two call frames
into the belly of cute
beast, as you want so.
And then we come out of the code that
is, again, on our side.
Even though we didn't write it,
it's code that was generated,
because this is our
calculator class, right?
And this is called Qt static metacall.
We never really declared this function,
but somehow it's implemented.
It's actually declared
by this QObject macro.
So the QObject macro
expands, among other things,
to a function declaration,
that includes this Qt static metacall.
And this static metacall,
basically allows us,
and we're actually on
this line of the debugger.
This allows us to call
the create C++ function that is ours,
so the evaluate function, for example.
And this is where we, if we look again
at the signature of this fellow,
this is where on the right,
on the very end, we have again
our dubious void star array.
Terrible.
And we have an integer
ID that's signifying
the slot we want to call.
Instead of passing a string,
saying hey, we want to call evaluate
and comparing strings all
the time, we use integers,
it's a bit quicker.
And in this static metacall,
we can do not only call slots,
like we do in this case
now, but you can also
read properties and figure
out map from string to name
and some of those things.
So there are a couple of,
there's a fair amount of
functionality that's been put
into this generator, to function.
But what we're really interested here now,
and this is where the debugger
stopped, is calling our slot.
So then we're out of the, out of the...
signal slot mechanism, again
we're back in our court.
So from emitting the signal,
which is just a function call,
to one, two, three, four frames, and then
call frames, and then
we're back into our code.
And this is all within the same thread,
and we didn't copy any data on the way.
So, that Q string parameter,
we never took a copy of it.
It took an address of it.
That's for free, we have it anyway.
But we never took a copy of it.
So that's nice.
So quickly recapping signals and slots.
What we've seen is generated code.
This is generated automatically
behind the scenes.
The build system takes
care of detecting it
and calling our meta object a pile of moc,
which generates this stuff, a code.
And it generates our data structures,
by passing your class declarations,
what signals to declare,
what slots to declare, etc.,
what parameters do they take.
All of that just automatically
linked it to your application
as a read-only data structure.
You can even serialize it
and send it across the wire.
We also generate stubs for signals,
that we've seen, right?
We never implemented the
signal, we just call it.
And then there's the
static metacall function,
that is used to actually dispatch
and finally call the slot.
Emitting the signal, again, quick recap.
It's a regular function
call, we call generated.
I've already just said that. (laughs)
We take the address of all the parameters,
we call a magic function.
We go through a few stack frames in Qt,
but we come quickly out
again into our code,
and finally call the final slot.
And then our heavy
calculator does it's work.
Yes, quick question?
- [Man In Audience] Since
you're taking addresses (cough)
does the caller have to maintain
the lifetime of the object,
for as long as the
signal can maybe pick up
the root for that object?
So, since emitting a signal
is a synchronous operation,
in this example, right?
There is no lifetime issue, right?
Because by the time the
signal emission returns,
the slot has returned as well, right?
So the control flow goes
from the signal emission
to the slots, multiple all of those.
At that time, the call is still alive,
so whatever it has there,
on the stack or wherever,
is still alive.
And the execution will only
return to the signal emitter,
when all the slots are completed.
And, at that point, if you're in a slot
and you wanna keep a reference,
you have to take a copy, of course,
or have some other mechanism.
Yes.
- [Man In Audience] Does
the initial core generates
the connection, what's for
Q's connection (cough).
Yes, so this is for direct connection,
I'm going to get....
I'm going to get into
another cooler mechanism
right after this.
One last question quickly, there.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
Ah yes, this was just to demonstrate it,
so I'm using the &quot;old&quot;
style, because I like it.
I'm old.
But, it's also a better way to demonstrate
that we have this metacall.
And it has one advantage,
in the sense that it,
it does less memory allocations.
So, if you connect to
a slot by this string,
we have a memory allocation, less ways,
otherwise we allocate kind
of like a stat function
on the heap for that.
But that's a bug really, so.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
Yeah, so, what he was saying, is that
when you use the string
from out of signals,
with that connection you don't
actually get a compiler error
if something disappears,
or something isn't there.
You'll only get the
error at runtime, right?
Then this is the big advantage of using
the address off operator.
So, you're generally right, I think that's
a more modern syntax to use.
For demonstrating how our
introspection code works,
I think this is a bit more suitable.
So I want to show something else,
which is actually a little bit neater.
I'm just gonna stop this here.
So, the second thing I
wanted to demonstrate,
is how indicative slots are really, really
super multi-threaded programming.
And I'm just going to
move this calculator,
and run this calculator,
that does this super heavy calculation,
in a separate thread.
And this takes just a few lines of codes.
I'm gonna just turn that.
I'm gonna create a Q thread,
I'm going to call it,
creative as I am, I'm
going to call it worker.
And threads like to be
started at some point.
So Q objects are associated with a thread,
the thread that they're created in.
So when you create a Q object,
it's started with a thread,
that you just, that is currently running.
But you can move objects between threads,
you can push them into another thread.
And that's what we're doing now,
we're going to do now.
So, I'm going to take this calculator,
I'm going to move to thread,
and I'm going to move it
into the worker thread.
And that by itself,
doesn't really do much.
It doesn't change any data structures,
but it informs this object
itself, through an event,
that, by the way, you've just been moved.
For a live object, that
might be interesting.
You've been just moved
to a different thread,
just for your information.
And it changes the affinity.
And the affinity is then
used when emitting a signal.
When emitting a signal,
we're trying to call a slot.
Before we call the slot, we're gonna check
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, the receiver,
are you in the same
thread as I am, or not?
And, if it's not the case, then we have
to do something differently.
But let me first complete
this little example.
This is actually all
it takes, but I have to
also do one more trick, to clean this up.
When everything shuts down...
Now I'm gonna use your syntax,
so when the last window's closed.
I am also going to
run a little lambda, that will
quit the event loop of the worker thread,
and just to shut this down properly.
And then I'm going to
wait until the thread
actually finished terminating.
So the way to, oops.
Not calculator, lost our name.
The wrong capture, dammit.
There we go.
So, this is just quitting
the event loop then,
and wait is like a repeat at
join, so it waits until the...
So this is just to make
sure that everything
shuts down properly.
But, in a nutshell I
have three lines of code,
four, five, six, seven maybe.
It's seven lines of code.
Our calculator is now multi-threaded,
and I didn't change anything else.
Especially not with regards
to the message passing.
And to show you that this actually works,
I mean that it really still does work,
so I'm just gonna run it.
And, because now it's multi-threaded,
we can add much bigger numbers
I'm going to add, 1000 to 4.
And we still get the correct result.
It took a little longer, I think,
but we have, it just took
a couple of lines of code
to do this multi-threaded.
And this is the beauty,
this is the true beauty
of signal to slot connects in Qt.
We didn't change the way
those things are connected.
We didn't change that at all.
It works, it just works,
and it's still safe, this is thread safe.
To show you that I'm not talking nonsense,
we can just go to, again,
to our evaluate function,
our calculator here.
Let's set a breakpoint again.
And we run this thing.
Maybe.
Okay, here we are.
And then I'll do 1000 + 400.
Okay, we're still being called,
nothing different so far.
But, here this little
pop up here shows the,
and the debugger indicator,
shows the threads.
There's an XcbEvent
entry there, that's for
because I'm using X11, it's really old.
It has the separate
threads for input events.
Calculator thread #1,
that's the main thread
that's named after the
executable, it's misleading.
And the third one, is this
Q thread that I created.
And this is actually the thread we are in.
So we are caught, we're
running in the other thread.
We're now in the &quot;worker&quot; thread,
and that's where our slot is called.
And if we go back one
step in our call frame,
we see, oh yeah, this is still the same,
now this is still the
same weird calculators,
static metacall thing,
that Q generated somehow.
It's still the same thing.
But then, the call of this
function is a different one now.
This is not anymore QMetaObject activate,
but this is called a QMetaCallEvent.
If we go one back...
Oh yeah, and then this is,
interesting by the way.
If you look at, again,
in calculator evaluate,
this object, if you
just remember the last,
that's usually significant enough,
the last, can you see the
mouse on the right-hand side,
the last bits of the address that's fe0d0,
and if we go, remember that fe0d0.
If we go back in the stack
frame, to the caller,
where suddenly there is a
Qobject called an event,
I want to highlight down here,
and that's the same object.
So our calculator object
received an event.
Instead of being called
directly from the signal,
it said we have been called by an event.
And this is because,
when emitting a signal
and we find out that the
receiver is in a different thread
then we currently are, then we
allocate a Qt event subclass,
it's called the MetaCallEvent,
it's this friend here.
And this is the only
time where we're going to
take a copy of the parameters,
because we're going to have to,
because we passed data to another thread.
So this is where we're
going to take a copy
of all of those parameters,
and as it turns out,
we're very clever, we know
how to copy void stars,
because of the data
structure we generated,
we know what these
individual void stars are,
and we have callbacks and we know
how to copy each of those properly,
calling the copy constructor correctly.
So this happens behind the scenes,
and we generate an event
object, the QMetaCallEvent.
This is where we have copies
of all of the parameters,
and we also store the information of, hey,
this is the slot you're gonna
call, and this is the object.
And then we're gonna take that
event and we're gonna post
it to the other thread.
We're gonna post it to the event
that worked the other thread.
And posting events to the,
to another thread, is a
perfectly thread safe operation.
You transfer ownership of that event,
that happens at the same time.
But that's all it is, and then you post
the event to the other
thread, and then once
that event loop there and
the other thread runs,
it's going to eventually
dispatch this event,
and we going to end up in
QObjectCall and call an event.
Which happens to be our calculator, right?
We've looked at this pointer here.
And from there, by default, QObjects know
how to dispatch these QMetaCallEvents
and then they can call our slot.
So, to recap.
Signals and slots work
really nicely across
thread boundaries, as well.
You can control this when
you do a connect statement,
what kind of connection do you want.
But by default, we're
gonna call it automatic,
which means we detect at emission time.
And if that's the case, we map everything
to an event otherwise,
and we post an event
to the other thread.
And that is a thread safe operation.
And then on the target set,
we're going to deliver
this event to the receiver
and call the slots.
And this works over any slots, of course.
Yes?
- [Man In Audience] How
well does this work,
if you connect first, and
then move your thread?
That doesn't matter.
The default is alter
connection, which means
it's determined at emission time.
So when you emit the
signal, that's when we're
going to check, hey, is this really,
are you in the same thread, or not?
And if the answers no,
then we decide that.
You can also force it.
There are different,
actually, I can recommend
checking the connector documentation.
There are different ways of how you,
what kind of connections you want.
So there's blocking,
queue it, and the like,
that allows to wait until,
wait on the sender side
that's emitting the signal,
that's not different.
You can even wait until the
other thread has completed.
It's fairly powerful,
so I'm just describing
the default behavior, but
it's determined by default
at emission time.
So it, basically, just works.
So you can even move the
calculator back, if you want,
at runtime, we could add a button there,
and move it back into the GUI thread,
by pressing that button.
And nothing would change,
it would still work,
it would detect it automatically.
Yeah, we know, and
that's the event where we
have to copy data, be we do ref counting,
and we love ref counting,
and implicit sharing,
and then we just make a
very, very cheap copy of it.
Is there a question there?
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
If an argument is non-copyable,
you will get an error at emission time.
Or, so at emission time,
that's when we determine,
hey, the receiver is in another thread,
we're gonna have to take a
copy of all those parameters.
And, if we then find
out, oh, sorry, we can't,
then you will get an error
message at emission time.
- [Audience Member]
(garbled, unclear talking)
No, at runtime.
Because you don't know at compile time,
whether the receiver's
gonna be in a different
thread or not.
There's no way of knowing that.
At connect time, if you
say you want it to be
a Qt connection, that's what it's called,
when your Q is through
events, I think that's when
we alternatively would check that.
So if you explicitly say upfront, look
have this kind of connection
where you copy the parameters
for sure, then we will
check at connect time
and you will get the error
message, when you run connect,
not when you emit the signal.
There was a raised arm in the back.
Okay, not raised anymore.
(laughing)
But, that's actually it.
Those are just two
things I wanted to show,
that I think are actually pretty cool,
because they just work.
They make programming a bit easier,
even if it's multi-threaded and...
yeah, even if it's multi-threaded,
which is like, oh, difficult.
But there is a bit of time for questions.
If there are any other
questions, please hit me.
Yes.

(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
(garbled, unclear talking)
So the question was, whether the system
will avoid creating slots
with non-const ref parameters.
No, because slots are
something that you implement.
So you declare the slot, right?
You declare, so our
evaluate function here,
that's the one we declare.
So we are responsible for...
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
This is true.
Which is why, I mean, which
is why you need to know
your data types a little bit.
If you use just Q data types,
you could just get rid of this.
So I can just, oops.
I can just, if I was lazy, I could just,
you know, I didn't know about codes,
references and all of that,
I could just pass Q string
by value, and it's not
gonna make a difference.
Because it's implicitly
shared in ref count.
That's why there's--
- [Audience Member]
(garbled, unclear talking)
Sorry?
- [Audience Member]
(garbled, unclear talking)
On, sorry, a non const reference.
So, if you had something like this.
Yes, I believe that is
something that we do detect.
I believe we do, I believe you will get,
I think you might even
get a compile error.
Let's just try this out.
Otherwise, I think you will get a...
Oh, this is dangerous,
I didn't try this out.
Close, close, close.
I think you will get an error message.
No, you won't, not at least for compiling.
Oh, because in the copying
case, that's fine, right?
When we copy the values it's alright.
And when we...
And when we have a direct connection,
the emitter passes a const reference
and it would cast away the constants.
I think we might actually end up
casting away the constants.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
Or, differently put, don't declare slots
with a non const
reference, unless you know
what you're doing.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
Well, that, non const references are a,
you might as well pass a pointer, right?
So, as soon as you pass raw pointers,
you're in the same business as
passing non const references,
and then you are in C++ territory.
There's not that much
we can protect you from.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
But Qing is safe.
Because in the Qing
case, we'll make a copy.
So for Q'd connection,
this is perfectly safe.
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
But as unsafe as it is,
even if you don't have
a Q'd connection, alright?
- [Man In Audience]
(garbled, unclear talking)
You have signal, that has an... (laughs)
Let's talk about it afterwards. (laughs)
Because the session is
over, unfortunately.
Thank you so much, for coming.
