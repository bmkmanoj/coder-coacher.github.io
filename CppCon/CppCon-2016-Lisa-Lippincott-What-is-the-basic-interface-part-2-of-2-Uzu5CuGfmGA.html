just talked about not leaking
capabilities and now I'm showing an
example here ah this is our old friend
the pools assignment operation where
instead of doing a simple assignment we
destroy the object and it ended and
create a new one with the new value and
we have now carefully put claims of
destructibility explicitly in our
interface implicit claims of proper are
shown here with the blue dot indicating
that that is an implicit claim and we
return to our favorite question what
could possibly go wrong anyone have an
idea you got it the two parameters could
alias the same object and in this case
we have destroyed the object before
reading from it and we have created
undefined behavior in the implementation
based on a danger in the calling
neighborhood and we want to figure out
how to get these to the the fire into
the same neighborhood as the danger and
this one's a little complicated because
X was proper why was proper ex was
destructible but the danger came from
the caller knowing that the this thing
was aliased and the implementation not
knowing that is the implementation had
some capabilities that receive
that interacted in a way that the
implementation could not see and this is
a pretty big problem in you know
everybody runs into this sooner or later
and it's subtle and people wonder how
should we tell when objects are aliased
and you can compare the addresses and if
you compare the addresses all the time
you can find out but that gets really
crazy because you have to do tons of
address comparisons and now you're
looking at tons of cases and you're
making your code go slow and that's just
no fun at all but the important question
is not how should we know that things
are aliased because remember the these
capabilities the proper of x and y the
the readable and writable these trace
back to the construction of the object
when the object was constructed we knew
what it was alias to it was alias to
itself and nothing else so the point is
not to figure out what's a liest but to
figure out how not to forget that things
are aliased somewhere in the along the
lines in order to have this problem we
had to forget that things that we knew
where aliased were aliased and in this
example I've put it right here bar knows
about the aliasing implementation of
food does not know about the aliasing we
need to find a way to express that in
the interface so I'm going to make this
definition to L values are irresponsibly
aliased when the aliasing is not
communicated across the interface
and there's us you know more detailed
words about what happens on which
execution path but the important thing
to know is irresponsibly aliased means
one neighborhood knew about the aliasing
one neighborhood did not and in
particular the responsible neighborhood
knew about the aliasing and the
irresponsible neighborhood didn't yes in
the question is what about internal
members of strout's it is true that you
know that yes you know the in a sense
the internal member of a structure is
aliased to the entire structure and you
can think of that as sort of a partial
aliasing but what I'm going to say is
it's the internal member as alias to
itself and if you want to express that
aliasing you're going to have to be able
to talk about the internal member of the
structure ah so I'm going to actually
slide this definition back into writable
and readable here is the local non
aliasing version of writable it has no
effect when writable has been previously
asserted in the responsible neighborhood
more recently than the L value appears
to have been destroyed that is the old
part and the object is not irresponsibly
alias to NE l value that may be readable
right ball or destructible in an
irresponsible neighborhood and I know
I'm just saying don't do the thing that
I said was bad but this is the point
where you check you want to check at the
point where you need right ability
because that's the because if you don't
check then there might be some
disagreement on how operations affect
each other later before you assert
right ability that right ability is not
going to affect any other operations and
before you assert readability that a
readability is not going to affect other
operations and here's readable same
thing not irresponsibly aliased a little
bit off here I'm not taught you it's
okay to alias I say here that is okay to
alias readable to readable that is the
list in the second bullet point doesn't
mention readability there is a much more
nuanced definition that really belongs
here that didn't make it into the talk
and well there's paper you can read the
paper for the nuanced version and
similarly destructible the destructible
has no effect when destructible has been
previously asserted in the responsible
neighborhood more recently than he
appears to have been destroyed and not
irresponsibly aliased to anything that
might be readable writable or
destructible in an irresponsible
neighborhood so these are the this
irresponsible aliasing is an extra
condition that we put on readable and
writable and destructible when they
appear in interfaces outside of
interfaces there's no irresponsible
neighborhood the extra condition can't
happen but if there's an irresponsible
neighborhood we have to make sure that
the irresponsible neighborhood knows how
the capabilities in that we give it
interact so all that talk has the effect
of moving the fire to the second claim
of propriety here here the responsible
neighborhood the neighborhood of bar the
caller says X is destructible it says X
is proper so far so good and that it
says why is proper and that's where you
notice but why is irresponsibly aliased
2x
so this makes it not okay for barge
called function this way this function
does not allow aliasing but what if we
fix the function here now we have an
implementation that can support aliased
parameters I read from I read into a
temporary and then created the object
from the temporary and now our interface
is really stronger than we want we want
to allow inter alia Singh in this
interface we need to syntax for that
I'll use this claim aliased X&amp;amp;Y now
everybody knows x and y refer to the
same object so problem solved we claim
that the we claim that x and y are
aliased and there's no irresponsible
aliasing and we got our proof to go
through because we used a temporary
instead of going straight from why um
not a problem anymore yeah that's the
awkward part about it here it says they
have to be aliased um and maybe
sometimes you didn't always want to do
you're fools assignment from the object
you started with yes Marshall says I've
turned this entire thing into a no op
and he is pretty much right you know
yeah uh-huh yes I've done a really crazy
way of assigning a thing to itself and
there's really nothing else this
function can do
but there is with a different caller you
run into this problem here this caller
doesn't actually alias the parameters
and now the claim alias the claim of
aliasing fails so it would be nice if we
only claimed aliasing sometimes when
it's important we can do this and this
works if the addresses are equal we will
claim aliasing if the addresses are not
equal we won't claim aliasing and you
know I put in a little graphic here look
no aliasing or change it the other way
look there's aliasing and we get it
right both ways and this is actually
really useful because it signals to the
implementation neighborhood that the
proof of correctness needs to be done in
two cases one case where the addresses
are equal one case where the addresses
are not equal and it works both ways
proofs aren't hard mathematical notation
is sometimes hard the proofs are
actually pretty easy yes ok the question
is how to handle overlapping values i
think this feeds into the like what if
one was a member of the other question
to you asked about arrays but um if i
want to say that x is aliased to a
member of Y if a why was a structure i
would say claim x claim aliased of x
comma y dot number and if i wanted to
compare the addresses i would come
the address of X to the address of Y dot
number if I want to compare the
addresses of true bytes in a byte array
I can do that if I want to do something
like mem copy mem copy is the one that
doesn't all mem copy allows one
direction of aliasing but not the others
both directions ok men move out oh um
yes men move allows any sort of aliasing
I thought mem copy had one sort but not
me in bed but anyway mem move is the
safe one allows aliasing um does the
right thing memmove can say in its
interface a loop over all the possible
comparisons of the different ways the
two arrays might overlap and if N and if
the pointers line up in a particular way
the overlapping portion is aliased so
loops rate for these sorts of things
they go with your arrays any other
questions ok ok I'm going to switch to a
more normal sort of assignment I'm going
to get rid of the destructible and
reconstruct and just go to a simple
assignment but I will give it a more
usual interface here the more usual
interface for assignment returns a
reference to one of its parameters and
here we have improper aliasing again yes
every assignment operator has improper
aliasing according to the basic
interface because it hands back both a
result and a parameter both of them need
to be proper but the interface
the basic interface doesn't say your
result might be alias to your parameter
or at least hmm I haven't said it says
that so one way to solve this is we'll
just put in the interface to our
assignment operator claim alias this
time it we don't need a conditional on
this aliased every time here and this is
actually a really nice thing for a
compiler to know about your assignment
operator and usually they don't if your
assignment operator isn't in line
there's nothing that says you can't
write an assignment operator that
returns a reference to something else
and that matters to your compiler so if
compilers can rely on this we can get
some a little optimization there so
that's one way to handle this a
different way would be to say that these
rather complicated claims belong in the
basic interface that is parameters might
be alias to each other results might be
alias two parameters and we can ask do
we want that as part of the basic
interface is this the usual thing
there's a pro argument you might have
figured out by now that I give the
argument I don't believe first but the
pro argument is more common functions
would fit the basic interface and some
really important ones have aliasing
built into the way we use them
assignment operators streaming operators
swap all of these things we expect to
work even when the parameters are
aliased or with assignment operators we
expect the results to be alias to the
thing we pass in stream operators we
expect the result to be aliased of thing
we pass in so this would make those
things have obey the basic interface
but I'm going to go with Khan because
every if statement makes your proof
break in two cases and having a lot of
cases in your proof it makes it really
hard to get the proof right and it makes
a heart makes it harder to check the
proof to also assignment stream
operators and swap don't really want to
have the basic interface assignment
wants to have an interface that says you
actually did an assignment that is that
the result has the same values the thing
passed in swap wants to have an
interface that says these two things are
the same things in the other order and
stream operators want to have an
interface that the it's not aliased it's
not maybe alias to the same stream the
stream operator wants to have an
interface that says it's definitely a li
the result is definitely alias to the
same stream so the basic interface is
not the interface that fits everything
it's the interface that you start with
as a blank page and build things up from
as the interface that fits a fair number
of things oh so how much time do we have
this went so much faster than last time
so I'm actually going
we have bonus slides if I can figure out
how to show the bonus slides something
do you know wondering why you don't
claim we claimed alias of x and y in the
airport ah ok i will change it but
everything else you playing in the pro
version have gone on a second we were
here this is the one you're it oh so can
you repeat the question yes the question
is everywhere I've claimed something in
the prologue i reclaim it in the
epilogue and here i don't reclaim it in
the epilogue and the question is why
that is an excellent question i'm not
sure i really understand the answer um
and perhaps I should um but i will say
aliased is different from the
capabilities um in that we're talking
about things occupying you know to
capabilities basically occupying the
same space is what aliasing is about and
that's something that can't actually
change um during the lifetime of the
capability but so I think I will go with
the basic answer of maybe I'm maybe I
should
but I don't really understand aliased
well enough to be sure alias is kind of
complicated ah so there there now we can
have a little bit of more interesting
stuff ah so here is a weird sort of
function it's not that weird this is
comparing two pointers to UM using stud
lesson sort of less than because stud
less is the actual comparison for
pointers that aren't related if you you
can ask me afterwards about why that's
important but it's it's not important to
the talk but I didn't want to write
obviously wrong code in the slides this
I think this is a function that has
basic interface compared to pointers
produce ah the minimum i believe yes
this minimum of two pointers fairly
straightforward basic interface here is
a similar function that's a little wacky
going to pass in two references I'm
going to compare them to see which one
is at the smaller address and I'm going
to return the value that was at the
smaller address and if this makes you a
little nervous I think that you are an
ordinary sort of programmer because this
should make you kind of nervous and in
particular if you had code that did this
that made copies of its parameters and
called foo twice you might not get the
same result because the copies were in
different memory locations
than the originals and that's a really
weird function ah Rudyard Kipling wrote
a story about the cat who walked by
himself all places were alike to him
this function is not a cat who walks by
itself this implementation treats
different places differently all places
are not alike to it and that's actually
something we want to avoid a good
function is a cat who walks by himself
the question is just what is wrong with
that weird comparison there and I'm
going to say an hour value expression is
indiscernible to a function if the
function is symmetric with respect to
permutations the possible values of the
expression that's a weird sort of word
indiscernible it's all places being
alike places are indiscernible to the
cat who walks by himself and so most
functions if you take the address if
they take the address of the parameter
they expect it's an address they're able
to take the address of the parameter but
they're going to treat every address
like every other address they can see
that there are different numbers but it
makes no difference to the function and
that is what's wrong with this function
this function takes the address of its
parameters and its result depends on
just what the addresses were in this
unexpected way
now the function that compared pointers
was very similar to this it had two
addresses it compared them but what was
different about the addresses in in that
function versus this one the difference
is these addresses have capability is
associated with them these addresses
there's a proper object and it seems
that if you have a proper object you
shouldn't care where it is if you care
where it is you care about the address
you shouldn't be looking at its bits if
you don't care where it is you can look
at its bits it's this kind of trade-off
and you get this these this trade-off in
a whole bunch of places in the language
so the addresses of readable writable
destructible or proper L values should
be locally indiscernible you shouldn't
care what address what the addresses of
the things you write to our or weed from
or destroy or a proper so I think the
answer is that those functions should
tell us ok we gave you a capability but
we've taken away the discern ability of
the address there's something similar if
I say that a range of things is proper
this for example would be happening in
the for a vector I pass you a vector i
say this range of elements is going to
be proper well it's not just the
addresses of those elements also the end
pointer needs to be taken away it's
indiscernible to if I dereference an
iterator that means I care about the
thing pointed to not about the address
generally I've got quite sure this is
weird stuff I haven't really figured it
out
the representation bites of a scalar
object if I give you an int and say it's
an int what I'm saying is I don't care
about the individual bytes I care about
what number it represents the padding
bytes of a plain old data object
similarly if I pass you a an object I
pass your structure you can read the
padding bytes there they have to be
initialized because you have to be able
to do a bite wise copy of it but it's
important that whatever you do doesn't
actually depend on the values of the
padding bytes it's the in your input is
the same even if the padding bytes are
different so the question is are these
statement is I'm not mentioning the
padding rights for non pod objects and I
could you shouldn't depend on the value
but it's not actually clear that when I
say an object is proper if it's not a
pod I'm probably not saying that those
that it's padding bytes are readable or
writable so if they're not even readable
then they're probably not discernible so
I think it's fair to say that padding
bytes for non pas dobbed X or the V
table pointer those things are not
readable and writable but for pod
objects you have to have readable and
writable in order to do bite wise
copying if it's non cons do you have to
be able to copy it into it and so you
need writable
marshalls confused okay um okay I'm
going to move on while Marshall Ponder's
and i'm going to say back to our
implementation gap here's an extra thing
i will throw in in the implementation oh
this is not an extra thing this is an
old thing any in the implementation we
know anything locally readable maybe
read and only those things so that
actually tells us the complete input to
the function if it only reads from the
things that we say are locally readable
we can say it's gross input is the our
values and addresses that it has access
to through those capabilities so here is
the total in the gross input not even
total gross because it's too big this is
the gross input to the function it has
the addresses of the parameters it has
every our value mentioned in the
prologue and everything that could
possibly be read using the readability
from the prologue it gets all that stuff
it could use as input but that's too
much similarly the gross output we can
say is all the stuff in the epilogue
anything that the epilogue says is
readable is part of the output plus
address of the result part of the gross
output what we could say if we were
platon asst and maybe some of you are
still platanus
we could say that the net input is the
gross input modulo indiscernible changes
that is the net input is your structure
minus the fact that boolean has module
of the fact that boolean has 10
representations on your architecture or
modulo the fact that the padding bytes
might change or modulo the fact that the
address doesn't really matter all of
those things that are indiscernible
don't matter to the net input and
similarly all those things that are
indiscernible don't matter to the net
output this however is a kind of
platonic definition that modulo has to
happen in the platonic universe so
instead I'm going to draw a commutative
diagram and say the mapping that if you
have a gross input and you make an
indiscernible transformation to a
grossing put up another function call of
the same function and you apply the two
functions then there will be an
indiscernible transformation of the
gross output of 1 to the gross output of
the other and that's a way of saying it
without that whole modulo thing and
mathematically a little more solid a
little more category theory um I think
I'm not getting a lot of response here
so does the dotted line mean it's not
the same transformation no that's this
is actually um the way it's its category
theoretic habit the so the dotted line
means if you have the first three arrows
if you have the solid arrows then you
get the dotted arrow for free so
if you have a three solid arrows there
exists a dotted arrow what can we say
about we can say well we can say that
word indiscernible about it that is the
difference between the gross outputs
will be these changes that shouldn't
matter so if i call the same function
twice with indiscernible inputs that is
if the differences between the inputs
don't matter then i will get results
that are indiscernible not the same they
might be sort of different addresses
they might have different padding bytes
they might have different internal
representation that we don't care about
any of that stuff they won't be the same
but they will be indiscernible they will
be enough alike that we don't care
they're not the same and this really is
the procedural programmers answer to the
idea of what's I poor function its can
you repeat you know we think we learn
functions with like plus and you add two
and two you get for you had two and two
again you get for you get the same
answer every time and that's the thing
about functions but functions in C++ are
not functions in mathematics functions
in C++ our algorithms and when we add I
don't know two complex numbers we get a
new complex number in C++ and if we add
those same numbers again but maybe we
stored them in different addresses we
want to say we get the same answer but
maybe the answer is stored in a
different address than the first one too
so what I'm saying is if the inputs if
we repeat the function call by using
indiscernibly changed inputs we get
indiscernibly changed outputs
and here is that rule and our value is
irresponsibly indiscernible when local
indiscernible ax t is not communicated
on return from from implementation to
color now this is kind of turned around
the other way I'm not saying if the
inputs are indiscernible then the
outputs are indiscernible I'm saying
that if the outputs it if sorry what am
I saying and wrap the words around this
what I'm saying is um if an
indiscernible change in the input could
have led to different outputs you'd
better say that that difference didn't
matter so um you know we can always get
to this point because all we have to do
is say that enough stuff doesn't matter
in the epilogue and then we can say
there are indiscernible changes in the
epilogue so really the error doesn't
come from not being repeatable the error
in a certain sense comes from not having
a wide enough definition of what
repetition is and now I want to get back
to our example so here we're going to
fail the implicit claim of no
irresponsible indiscernible ax t that
i'm going to put at the end of the
normal epilogue not the exceptional
epilogue of a function that is if you
return from a function everything that
everything about your epilogue that
didn't depend on that wasn't controlled
by discernible changes by just
noble aspects of your prologue has to be
marked indiscernible and here I have
said that the result is proper therefore
the value of the result that int ought
to be only dependent on discernible
aspects of the input and in this case
it's not because we made a choice based
on an indiscernible aspect of the input
now there is a way to fix that well do
this we'll put in our prologue this
comparison will calculate the comparison
we're going to do and say okay the
ordering of the pointers matters to this
function if we calculate it in the
prologue it must matter to this function
and now there's no more danger yes we're
doing that same calculation in the
function but here this is perfectly
discernible because we said that the
result of that comparison is part of the
gross input and now the result only
depends on the gross input and I know
that one's kind of a deep dive um but
that's really the procedural the
procedural analog of the basic rule of
functional programming which is that you
can do call the same function twice and
get the same result here we have we
always have this extra data hanging
around there's always addresses and
padding bytes and representations
there's always stuff we need to ignore
the important thing is just remember to
say what you need to ignore ah and with
that I'm going to get to the wrap up any
questions before the ramp up let's see
the wrap up
here the basic interface so the basic
interface starts in the prologue we
claim that all of our parameters are
proper ah then we have our
implementation and if the implementation
returns all the parameters have to be
proper the result if there is one has to
be proper not if they are declared
improper we have that out but most of
the time the result if it's an object
type has to be destructible if there's
an exception the parameters need to be
proper the exception needs to be proper
the exception is to be destructible
again there's an out for improper
parameters there's no out I don't see
any reason to allow improper exceptions
they just cause trouble inside the
implementation only locally readable
right all indestructibles are read
written or destroyed respectively more
generally the implementation only uses
the or doesn't use any capabilities that
are held back by the caller if the
implementation wants a capability it has
to ask at the end of the regular
epilogue only there there's no
irresponsible indiscernible ax t that's
the repeatability of the function call
that is things that can't be repeated
have to be indiscernible at the end of
both the regular epilogue and the
exceptional epilogue Noah leaked
capabilities we keep our capabilities in
play until they are destroyed
destruction recycles them into some
other form and finally at the end at the
points where responsibility for behavior
changes hands there's been no
no undefined behavior so far and that is
what I know of the basic interface as of
several months ago I've been working a
bit since then but before we go on basic
interface for a member function very
similar except proper for star this on
entry proper for star this on return
proper for star this on exception when
it's not declared improper so not much
different their basic interface for
constructors very similar except for how
it handles star this star this goes from
unoccupied space on entry to destroy to
destructible and proper on exit or still
unoccupied space if there's an exception
and finally basic interface for
destructors star this is proper on entry
and unoccupied space on exit either way
ah so that's the basic interface as I
know it so far a little incomplete still
I'm sure there are a lot of questions
left I'm not sure I expect you to answer
these questions I don't know how to
answer all of these questions but there
are a lot of things left unanswered here
um propriety for compound types how do
you buy twice copying we touched on that
little earlier we know some of the deal
with padding bytes incomplete types and
polymorphic and virtual functions those
get tricky and interfaces for new and
delete expressions or really we need two
interfaces for all
built-in operators to make this work so
there's a lot of work there in just
going through all the built-in operators
and figuring out what their interfaces
is what is the interface for assignment
or for a shift operator + or for new and
delete and we have that we actually
didn't touch a bit on repeatability of
function calls we didn't touch on
elimination of function calls when can
you say I don't need to call that
function at all even though the call is
in the code that would be a really nice
optimization to make and we don't quite
know when you can do that from what I've
said so far so those are lots of areas
for future future work and now we can
ask if there are questions I do have one
note there's now a paper about this ah
it's in the / it's in the iso c++ future
proposals pooram you can search for
procedural function interfaces earlier
today somebody googled that and it's
pretty high on the list it'll be on the
front page for google if you get there
quick but in any case I so C++ future
proposals for them any questions yes the
question is have I looked at the
contracts proposal that came out of
Jacksonville and the answer is yes um
it's
what to say about the contracts proposal
it's very functional in nature and I
don't think with an expression based non
procedural way of doing interfaces we
can get to where I want to go because I
want to go to proofs and I want to go to
proofs for procedural code not
functional code if you try to write code
that is provable with expression based
interfaces where every claim is just an
expression and you can't put them in if
statements and loops and so forth you
end up having to write your folk your
program in an entirely functional manner
has been my experience so it doesn't get
to where I want to go that doesn't mean
it doesn't get to someplace useful but
not where I want to go yes ah yes I the
the question that or statement is I
didn't show any control flow in the
epilogue that's just chance there is no
reason to not have control flow in any
of these places another thing that
people ask about is what about side
effects in the prologue into epilogue
and my answer is we're in a procedural
language there are going to be side
effects there are always side effects
some electron got shifted from here to
here and it has a different spin or
something there are always side effects
the important thing is not to eliminate
side effects the important thing is to
know which side effects are
indiscernible yes
ah the question is what about similarly
early return so if you look at the
proposal the return statement actually
gets a little more complicated in
interfaces it's okay it is just fine by
me if you return from the prologue you
can return a value from the prologue no
problem the implementation neighborhood
never takes responsibility at that point
the caller just sees what goes on in the
prologue and it's andy there is no
implementation neighborhood return in
the epilogue is little different because
there's already a result if the function
has a result it has a non-void result
type the result already exists in the
epilogue so you can use a return
statement without an expression to
return the existing result and that's
just fine too it's just float just flow
of control if we're going to reason
about procedural programs we're gonna
reason about flow of control yes was any
of this work inspired by pony I don't
think so because I don't know what you
mean by pony aah so no um ah anything
else yes ah is there a beginning of a
library or server there that there's a
paper that's that that is how things
begin um and in some ways it's just the
beginning of a paper too it's going to
have revisions I'm well unless people
utterly hate it it's going to have
revisions uh-huh
and I guess I can there's a noise over
there um but there I told you you
wouldn't be able to see properly if you
sat on that side of the room I think
there is one more thing I want to say
about flow control in prologues and
epilogues which is loops I want to
mention loops loops are really important
in if I say that a vector is proper I
actually mean all of its elements are
going to be proper I also mean by the
way that the addresses of the elements
are going to be indiscernible the
address of the vector itself will be
indiscernible the capacity of the vector
is probably going to be indiscernible in
a Const factor not quite sure about that
last one but um but in order to say all
the elements are proper you need a loop
and once you have loops you can just say
yeah from here everything's proper and
in a slide we all saw this morning in
yarn is talk there was a little comment
that said you can't test reach ability
reach ability is just a loop you can run
the loop you can test it it's not a very
good test because undefined behavior is
the result you get when the test fails
but it's executable code you can test it
ah did you have something no I mean yes
because after testing reach ability yes
ah the point is that you can't test
reach ability in in single pass rages
save for an input or output iterator and
yes and no you can test it it's just the
range is not very useful after you test
it oh so yeah input and output iterators
have this weird one past behavior that
you can't repeat what's going on and
really the answer for input and output
iterators i think is mostly to put those
things in inline if you need to say this
is what's going to happen put it in an
inline function an inline function can
act as an interface where the
implementation is never reached it just
says what it does so if you want to copy
from input iterators you can just say
here is what that means in an annoying
function and not have to split things
out into a separate interface and
implementation because some things can
really only say once ah anything else
yes trachten didn't see it again deep
breath so the point is there was a
deposit that he saw early that he didn't
see in the wrap-up and I will back up to
it because the posit the one positon
this talk and it's not perfectly
apposite something a little more
complicated is going on here but it is
that the first place we ever see
destructibility is here in the regular
epilogue of a constructor and this
doesn't come from previous
destructibility it is created out of
thin air
yes the the question is don't we have
the same posit in the destruct ER and we
do have the same fudge in the structure
um but in the destruct er it's actually
a claim that is the destructibility you
in inlet for the end of the constructor
you don't have to prove destructibility
at the end of your constructor it just
happens and but in order to enter a
destructor you have to prove
destructibility that is you have to use
up that destructibility that you got
from the constructor ah the unoccupied
space uh that's okay the exact mechanism
here still a little fuzzy still working
on it is oh did it you know i'm going to
say you're right that if i'm going to
say that the thing that happened in the
constructor was a positive
destructibility I should be saying that
the unoccupied space is posited at the
end of the destructor and the reason
what oh it is more symmetric that way
the answer really is that I have an idea
I have a more solid idea when I wrote
these slides at least of what unoccupied
space means and I think unoccupied space
means I loop over this to cast this to
unsigned char star plus size and each
individual bite is unoccupied space and
unoccupied space for a bite appears to
be approximately the same thing as a
proper bite so you could actually
prove that the things are unoccupied
space just by looking at what all the
individual part destructors did maybe
but really I shouldn't have written it
that way and that kind of gets down to
that posit really not quite deposit and
that one claim those two claims now
quite right anyway the session appears
to be over so thank you all for coming
and I hope you'll read the paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
