Before I actually get started,
I need to ask you for a
small favor everybody.
I'm an old man as you know.
My wife and I have been
married almost 50 years,
40 years, sorry, 40 years.
(audience laughing)
Our kids would be surprised.
But my wife actually fabricated
all the ties I'm wearing this week.
And I'd appreciate it if
you would help me thank her
for these ties.
(audience clapping and cheering)
(audience laughing)
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
How 'bout we start at the beginning?
Much better.
Yes, yes, yes, okay.
So this is going to be
like a movie trailer.
(audience laughing)
Coming soon to a compiler near you, yes.
The standards committee, WG21,
of which I'm an emeritus member,
for us C++17 is actually old hat.
We've started working on C++20.
And I'm here to share with you tonight
a tiny taste of some things
that are in the pipeline
that we're rather optimistic about.
And it starts with this observation
from roughly 20 years
ago by Dave Abrahams.
That may be a name you recognize.
The Abrahams exception safety
guarantees for example.
If you ever write less than,
you probably also want the
other operators as well.
And the status quo,
since forever,
has been typically,
I mean it's formulaic.
You write one operator and
you implement the other five
in terms of it.
For example, this or this.
Alternatively, some people prefer to write
two operators by hand,
and then implement the other
four in terms of those two.
Like that or like that, okay.
Kind of boring.
We'd like to automate this.
And we've wanted this for
well over 20 years now.
This has been an ongoing problem
for a long, long time.
This is specifically what we would like.
Compiler assistance so
that we only have to write
one operator,
and the rest just works.
Period, done.
We would like something more.
It would really be great
if we could somehow specify
what comparison means for our type.
Because there are types
that should only be equality comparable.
You can't order them.
Like a random number distribution.
You can't arrange them in any sequence.
You can compare them for equality or not,
but that's it.
But there are other kinds
of orderings as well.
And of course we want
backwards compatibility.
Current code should
continue to work just fine.
So we want this to be opt in.
It turns out that
as I said we've been working
on this for a very long time.
The oldest paper that I could find
dates from 1995.
And I suspect there's
some older ones than that
that I haven't been able to unearth yet.
And we've had several library attempts,
the notable ones being
the standard rel ops.
And we've had Boost.operators
which was on the first packages in Boost,
dating back to I think 1999,
maybe 1998 I'm not sure.
But they've proven both awkward
and inadequate.
They don't fill all the
requirements I set forth.
And it happens that in the
last three or four years
there's been a resurgence of interest.
We've had like a dozen papers
exploring this from various angles.
I wrote one,
Bee-ar-ner wrote some.
Etc, etc, okay.
So what's recently happened
is all of this suddenly gelled.
And it's culminated in a recent proposal
that the committee has already reviewed
for a new operator.
This is not something we do lightly.
We're adding a new
operator to the language
officially called the
3-way comparison operator.
Unofficially of course it's
the spaceship operator,
which explains my title slide.
Here are a few details.
we've picked the precedence for it.
We've picked the associativity.
There will be a new header in the library
because it comes with library support.
Here are some of the highlights
of how we envision it to be used.
We define this operator for your type.
That's how you opt in.
For example,
this is kind of the minimum
that you have to write,
assuming the defaults are
acceptable for your type,
as we believe they often will be.
It's a one liner.
What this does is member wise compare.
And how does it compare
net corresponding members?
Well, however those members have defined
their own comparison operators, okay.
And when all is said and done,
you get a three way result.
So what happens when
client code says a less than b,
or a greater than b,
or a, you know, fill in the blank?
Well if the type has the
corresponding operator,
the compiler will arrange to use it.
If it doesn't,
and you've provided a spaceship operator,
then the compiler arranges to use that,
and pretends that you wrote a
call to the spaceship operator
and asks if the result
has the right relationship
against zero.
Right, so I mean we're used to this
'cause we have this in
the standard library
with strcmp right?
So we know how to do this.
Here are some options that
we programmers will have
in case the defaults aren't right for us.
You can provide your own
definition of course.
You don't have to define
it as equal default.
When might you want to do that?
Well if not all the members
are supposed to participate
in the comparison,
or if the order of your
members isn't quite the order
in which you need them compared,
you have to provide your own.
But you write only one function
and it's going to be used.
You also get to specify your
types ordering properties
as the return type of this operator.
And there's a set of library types.
Pick one that defines what
the appropriate operations are
for your type.
You can choose to have
this as a member function,
as I've shown,
or you can have it as a non
member function by design.
Your choice.
And you can actually
overload this for example,
if you want cross-type comparisons.
Okay.
So there's where you go
for more information.
I've said there've been like a dozen,
15 or 20 papers in the
last three or four years.
This is one of the seminal ones.
It doesn't have any part
of the proposal in it,
but it sets forth some key insights
that we've based our design on.
This is the paper that
has the design in it.
It also has examples.
It has a nice bibliography
of the recent papers.
It also has the proposed formal wording.
There will be a revision of
this paper in the next mailing
which will come out either late October,
early November this year, 2017.
And there's a companion paper,
which is mine,
that provides the library wording,
proposed library wording for C++20.
We have not officially decided
what the new header name will be.
We're proposing cmp.
That's the one part that
hasn't yet been blessed
by the committee.
We hope that can be done quickly.
I don't want to have
to type out comparison
as the name of he header.
But the committee will do
what the committee will do.
The proposal as I say is still on its way
through WG21.
We're optimistic.
The design has been approved already.
We now have to review
carefully the wording.
There's not a whole lot of wording,
but it's not trivial either.
So there is some work yet to be done.
But all the words are in these papers.
Mine is still forthcoming.
It'll be out in the same mailing
as the revision of the
initial proposal paper.
We do not yet have any
implementation experience
because it seems like
the vendors are waiting
for at least the initial wording review
before they go and start
implementing things
to try out.
But if you're one of those
people who likes to hack
on GCC maybe or Clang,
please come see me.
I want to talk to you
because we would love to have
an implementation of
this stuff to play with.
And with that,
I thank you all very much.
