give you a brief introduction to geni
project generator tool that we are using
on a main project first what is project
generator it's a tool that creates
projects for you essentially so it
should be it should be a lightweight and
fast and it should support portable
features of various targets it should be
easy to learn and extensible and what is
Jenny Jenny is a project generator tool
it automatically generates projects from
Lua scripts and you can make it apply
some settings on the multiple projects
easily so initial version of Jenny
projects is a fork of a premake 4.4 beta
5 and there is no intention to keep
compatibility with and reason for making
a fork is that main distribution was not
maintained and there was a need to add
new support for new compilers and it is
made by a group of people me included
here and that's about it fourth why not
see make you probably all some of you
probably like see make but you do not
like complex syntaxes and also to
support some custom actions you need to
be an expert to get it running and also
it is easy to maintain but a hell to
create initial configuration why Jenny
it's simple to use and simple to learn
it's easy extensible because it's
created in Bua so you can basically add
things you need inside the scripts and
it's also support very
project projects like fast build new
make files ninja files Visual Studio
almost all versions that are currently
valid and also Xcode and who should you
use Jenny it's targeted to the projects
needing multiple types of project
generated so for example if you are
developing for the multiple platforms
it's much easier for you to to get it
running and it's targeted for people you
having trouble to learn see make or
similar tools it's also because there
are some people that needs some
additional things that are not available
in C make or a hard hardly to be done
where can you get it you can get it from
this github link and also there is a
documentation quite good one there and
there are also binaries in a different
wrapper but you have it all there for
the three big platforms but you can
always build it from the source and how
do we start well initially it's loading
it's checking for the existence of file
called genic Lua in the scripts folder
or in the same folder is the very you
run the project and you then just open
your favorite editor and type this this
would be the initial code that you will
mostly use in most project so you have a
solution in which you will define the
name of the solution that you wish to
create it will be the corresponding to
the visual studio solution you can
define the configurations so for example
debug and release and you can define the
platforms on which you're running also
the language because it supports c-sharp
as well here is the example of a simple
project which is a console application
and you can see here project directory
as as a variable this is all Lewis oh so
you can easily extend what I really need
and you have definition of include yours
which you will like to use you have a
files there and you have a specific rule
for the configuration of the prodigy
make which gives you for example here
C++ 14 only if you wish to add the
libraries it's easiest as well so you
can just put the static clip there and
it will be generating static lips also
you have the predefined toolchains Lua
file and which contains a lot of already
defined targets so for example just to
to create those files you will have this
Genie and just add additional parameters
to run it and who is using it and here
is the list of the few projects that we
have found using this so yeah that's
about it and there are some questions
you can find here after all
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
