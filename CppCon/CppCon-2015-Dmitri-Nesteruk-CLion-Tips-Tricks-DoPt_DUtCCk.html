jetbrains some of you might have heard
about us we make developer tools and
I've been doing it for like 15 years or
something so we recently came onto the
c++ scene with a couple of tools and one
of those is sea lion that's what you're
looking at right now this is not Katie
it's a cross-platform C++ ID for well
currently supporting clang and GCC and
using C mate as the the build system so
I just wanted to show what it's like to
work work in this kind of tool I I'm
gonna start by making a just an ordinary
class so C Line provides us all sorts of
useful thingies for from manufacturing
classes so in this case I'll call the
class person so C line is asking us like
what type of extensions we want and you
can make groups of those you can make it
header only and it also asks you what
what C make targets you want to add this
file to so you there are some options
there once I press ok I get my header
and the CPP and by the way these
templates are customizable so if you do
prefer include guards then you can have
those as well in addition we have the
appropriate entries in the C make list
and we can sort of stop working with
this class so for example I can add a
couple of variables a weight and height
and maybe I want to calculate the body
mass index based on that so what I can
do is I can just define a function
signature here and see line is going to
offer us options of actually
implementing this function either in
place meaning in the header file or you
can generate it in the CPP file so once
I do that I jump into the CVP here is my
actual function and here I can return
weight divided by let's say hi times
height like so so this is a bit of a
problem because I might return type is
void so sealion could kind of pick that
up and it can tell us that by the way
you know do you want your return type to
change to double and I press return and
it gets changed here and obviously in
the header file as well so sea lion else
it comes with lots of refactoring so for
example I can take this
times height in fact we have a shortcut
for it kind of expanding this election I
can bring up a refactoring menu and in
this case I can take it to a separate
variable so I can extract this product
into a separate variable kind of a
couple of options here like I can make
it auto for example I can declare this
Const with a couple of key board short
hand let's just call this height squared
like so but let's suppose that I want to
have a general purpose function for
squaring variables multiplying a
variable by itself and returning that so
once again I can extend selection around
high x height and I can bring up a
refactoring here to extract an entire
method so this method I'm gonna call
this Square and just press the extract
button what this does is it basically
adds a new member function called square
which is a constant you can see here and
it returns height times height but maybe
I want height to be a parameter maybe
this is a general purpose squaring
function for whatever you feed it so for
this once again I can bring up the
refactoring menu and here what I can do
is I can extract a parameter so I can
say that you know I have first of all
see line is asking me what kind of
expression I want to extract in this
case it's just height afterwards see
line is saying well by the way you have
two of those in your in your function
bodies that you want to extract just
just one or both so I'll replace both
occurrences and now I can give it a new
name like value for example so I have my
function for squaring a value and you
also notice something interesting we
didn't have any arguments here
beforehand because it was just returning
high x high but now we see line has
effectively inferred that this was the
value that was being fed into the
function therefore after the refactoring
it's actually changed the signature here
so that it would be called with height
and an additional thing we can do is we
can now get this calculation of square
of height and just get it to replace
height squared so getting rid of height
squared altogether once again you bring
up the refactoring menu and in this case
you can choose in line so we in line the
use of height squared press ENTER and
now we're just using square of height
and that
that temporary variable is no longer
being used so let's jump back into the
header file by the way we have shortcuts
for kind of jumping between declarations
and definitions and here let's suppose
that I I'm not happy with the name
person I want a different name for this
class so I can bring up once again
another refactoring code rename and here
I can just type let's say human for
example so this actually does a lot of
changes because in addition to
performing the change of the symbol so
having human here and also having human
here in addition to that the files got
renamed you'll see human dot H here and
human dot CPP here as well and of course
in cmakelists we also have the
appropriate renaming is done as well so
I have my human clouds but some of the
things are grayed out like why is it
gray here why is the code gray here well
this is because see line goes off and it
actually looks at whether the things you
wrote are being used somewhere and if
they are no that's going to tell you
about it so let's see if we can actually
start using this human class somewhere
so I'm in here say I type human okay so
what happens is that see line obviously
it figures out that there is no such
type here yet but it's saying well do
you want to include human dot age so I
press alt enter and I now have my
include statement up above and then as I
start typing the variable name it's kind
of suggesting that maybe I want human
with a lowercase H so I can complete
this and then I can start using via I
can start using the class so for example
I can get get the BMI we got code
completion throughout the whole IDE so
just press return for something like
this and complete it but the problem is
that we haven't really initialized human
with any kind of value and let's
actually do it in a more sophisticated
way so I'm gonna go into human now let's
suppose that I want another class up the
hierarchy to make an entire sort of
inheritance hierarchy so what I can do
is I can go into the refactoring menu
once again and this time I can try and
extract a superclass so the idea here is
that you can make a superclass and you
can actually take some of the elements
of the current class and sort of move
them off the hierarchy so
case I can go with weight and height and
just extract them so what what oh yes of
course let's let's give this a name like
mammal for example all right so little
and we have a bit of a problem here you
see a sea lion is smart enough to figure
out that a private variable that was
being used can no longer be private
because it's now you now need to use it
in the inheriting class in that BMI
method so it's saying do you want to
escalate visibility do you want to
change these variables from private
visibility to protect it and of course I
say yes because if I don't I'm gonna get
some red code it's not going to work so
now I have a base class called mammal
and I have an inheriting class called
human now you'll see that some of the
files here are grayed out so mammal dot
CPP and mammal - we just created them
but they're not part of C make just yet
so let's add them so I have my source
files variable here and you'll notice
that as I type things so I'm typing
mammal dot CPP I'm getting code
completion here and in addition to code
completion you can also see that it's
kind of highlighted a little bit so sea
lion actually treats the sea make files
very well so you get things like code
completion so for example I can just go
to mammal dot H with a single shortcut
and Here I am so what can we do in
mammal because we want to initialize
this class somehow well one of the
things we can do is we can actually go
off and generate a constructor for
examples so I can go into the generate
menu and you'll see that we have a
couple of things for the kind of stuff
that you might want to generate like
constructors destructors getters and
setters and lots of other stuff so I
want the constructor here it's asking me
what fields I want to initialize I can
just select everything press ok and here
we go I have my constructor of course I
now need a similar constructor in human
so let's let's go into human you'll
notice that because C Line does kind of
continuous code analysis it's saying
that well by the way your base class
doesn't have a default constructor
anymore so do you want to do something
about it and indeed I do so I can press
authentic here and one of the options is
well there are two options here I can
either make a default constructor in
mammal or I can generate a matching
constructor in human so I press return
and here it is I get a construct
which just calls the base class
constructor so now that we know that
we've got this we can finally navigate
into main dot CPP and we have another
issue here another code inspection
because sealion is saying well there is
no such constructor you basically have
too few arguments so this is where we
can actually provide the height and the
width like this and that's it then we
can now sort of start using this code
I'll actually run this and get our value
twenty four point five all right so in
addition to being able to do all these
wonderful refactorings also provide tons
of stuff like navigation and different
visualizations of your code so let's
take a look at some of them now in order
to make this a bit more interesting I'm
going to go into mammal and by the way
notice we have different kinds of
navigation options so you can find
something by class name or for example
you can find something by filename and
we also support this camel humps ideas
so if I type CML sea lion basically what
it does is it goes off into my code base
and it looks at all the files which have
the capital C M and L so it finds C make
list this way very useful and yes we can
also search for also search for symbols
as well so if I want like height for
example I can just add a few letters and
if I press return I get to the
appropriate location okay so I want
another base class so in addition to
mammal I'll have another superclass here
let's call it animal I just extract it
like this I'm not gonna put anything in
it because I just want to demonstrate
something else so once again one of the
things we have to do is we have to get
back into seem Eclipse and add this new
file so that would be animal dot CPP and
animal dot H all right so now that we
have this one of the features that
sealion offers is an ability to
visualize inheritance hierarchies so
essentially we have a separate window
which does a kind of tree like rendering
of who inherits from who so in this case
I have a class called animal and I can
see that it has one descent and called
mammal and this has a descendant called
human and I can obviously double click
on any of them to
she find out what who what the class
looks like and before you ask yes we do
support you know multiple inheritance
and I meant inheritance and you know
virtue and roots and all this all this
other crazy stuff so the alternative is
like for for human class you can also
open up this this menu but it's a the
human class doesn't have any subtypes
what you can do is you can sort of
invert the tree and instead of looking
at the descendants you can look at the
parents so in this case you have a view
of who's the parent of human it's mammal
and this has a parent called animals in
addition to this kind of hierarchy we
have yet another hierarchy view let's go
into main dot CPP another hierarchy view
shows you what you are including what
kind of headers are you including and
what do they actually contain so here I
can see that main dot CPP includes human
dot H and iostream and string and I can
take iostream for example and I can sort
of navigate and expand and expand and so
on by the way another thing that we do
to help you visualize your code is the
file structure pane so this this little
pane on the Left basically shows you a
kind of a tree based view of your types
as well as their members and you can
also sort of select elements and notice
that when you do the focus actually
switches from one element to another so
really convenient stuff and we can
actually I think we can select some one
of these yep
so as I select something in the
hierarchy that I'm exploring on the Left
I can see that it has some defines and
some members there as well and of course
in these cases if I double click any of
them I just open the appropriate file so
this has been a rather small
demonstration of CLI and essentially you
can you can find you can grab a free
one-month trial at jetpens.com slash c
line and by the way if some of you are
users of Visual Studio as opposed to you
know GCC and all that them that we have
a different product called we share PC
plus plus which kind of plugs
individuals today and it does pretty
much the kind of things that I've shown
here today so that's it if anyone has
any questions feel free to
at the moment I don't think we do so the
question was whether we have any
features for expanding macros or
template definitions I know that in the
in the resharper product that we have we
do have a way of totally outlining the
macro but my colleague is kind of
raising the hand here maybe go correct
me now yeah well I think I think we kind
of have to more or less in the sense
that if it's gonna be mainstream then
then it makes sense for us to do that
that's more once again a question to the
developers but but I think that alt so
yes if you have an existing Simek
project with C make list you just open
it and you get pretty much all that I
shown here question over there
well I would say that it's it's more or
less complete in the sense that we do
have everything that that you might need
and also you know pop ups for helping
you import stuff so one final question
we there is a plugin for C Line which
specifically supports them alright
that's it we're out of time thank you
very much everyone oh one last thing
we JetBrains we have a stand on the
fourth floor so if you have more
questions just come around and I'll help
you up
Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
