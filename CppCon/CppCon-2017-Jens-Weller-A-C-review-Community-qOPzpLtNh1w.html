about the review community
we launched around August,
which is focused on reviewing
C++ libraries, and I decided
to talk about this shortly.
And so this started with a
Tweet by Eric in last year
by October, he was kind of
asking why don't we have such
a community or why doesn't
something like this exist.
It would be cool to have
that, and I was thinking about
something similar for awhile.
And but what really got me started was,
C++ Norway I gave a talk
on comparing the Boost
and the Qt communities
and also this got me
kind of started into
thinking what would we need
today as a community, or what would
we want to have today as a community.
And so this kind of
manifests then as a Subreddit
which is now reality,
it's under cpp review,
r/cpp_review on a Reddit and
there's gonna be an upcoming
list at Meeting C++ at my
website of the libraries
which actually passed this review.
And so the the idea about
reviews, I was thinking about
how should we review,
so I would like to have,
of course we focus on one library
and then there's one
Reddit thread for that
which is kind of used as a forum,
and there's discussions et cetera.
But just, you know what
should a review really be.
If you look at Boost,
we have a review manager
and you are supposed to
invest some time into it,
we have a high expectation
on such a review
and it's high volume,
it's like 600 e-mails
and I don't know if e-mails are still
the best medium to do reviews.
And awhile ago Robert Ramey
did a great initiative
by setting up the Boost Library Incubator.
But you have some various,
here you can, most of us
already have Reddit
account but this is like a
local website so you
have to create a local
login and to a WordPress account there
and also unfortunately
though Robert launches
a couple of years ago
and presented the Boost.
But I kind of, until today
there's, I feel kind of
a missing integration into Boost of that.
So and in comparison to
what I currently plan
as I don't want r/cpp_review
to be as focused
and as strict as Boost reviews are.
So if you don't have such
a high quality standard
as Boost and we aim more
at providing a different
view on a library.
So from Boost coming I
see like a lot of what we
do in reviews, for this
conference or this like often
experts only, when we have
like this expert cult in C++.
Everyone wants to be cutting
edge and on the contrary
I kind of think actually
if we review a library we
should have the contribution of everyone.
It should be a group effort maybe.
Because I found this great quote.
In the beginner's mind
there are many possibilities
but in the expert's there are few.
And maybe some of those
possibilities which the
beginners see today are
things which an expert
only doesn't see because he
comes from a different time.
So for people which are not yet experts,
or want to go there or just
want to have there's lots
of low hanging fruit like documentation,
code readability, code
smell, it's just look through
the code do you don't like
something or think this is wrong.
Scott Meyer says this, then
you can ask on the Subreddit
and discuss with the author
and other people can contribute to that.
And of course you can also do
the non so low hanging fruit
like you can try it yourself
and if fuzzing the library,
and static analyzers
and leaks and lattice.
There's lots of things you can do and then
as this group effort, any
contribution then adds
to the sum and we have
the exchange with the devs
from the library, we can discuss it
and of course you get to
rant on someone else's code
and you can learn.
So to summarize, my approach
is more like more feedback
oriented, I don't want to
be as strict as boost is
and the r/cpp Reddit is the place to go.
And I see this feedback to kind
of like, come from everyone
and all contributions are welcome.
The review is one month and
after that it stays public
and people can later go and
see but the responsibility
is still by the library developer.
Yeah so libraries just
you know, the normal thing
which we expect from libraries.
And I expect like the library author,
I want them still to have the freedom
to do their choices, what they want.
Like the systems, et cetera
and same for developer
and the community too.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
