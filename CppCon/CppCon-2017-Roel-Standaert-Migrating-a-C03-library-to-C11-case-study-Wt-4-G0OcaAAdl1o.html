and I work at Emweb, mostly on Wt.
I'm going to talk about how
we dropped C++ 03 support
in Wt four and migrated to
C++ 11 and modernize it a bit.
Of course these decisions we
made and the considerations
that we made so I'm not
telling you that this is
the definite way you should
support every widget based
web framework in C++ to C++ 11.
Here goes.
So first of all to introduce Wt a bit.
It was first released in 2006
so it's been around for a while.
It was created by Koen
Deforche when he decided that
he needed a web interface for this thing
that he was making and he
didn't like web technologies
because for the most part
web technologies are...
Well, they started out as something made
to just display pages of
information with links
in between them
distributed over a network.
But not really for these
single page very interactive
web applications so he
developed a framework
that was more like desktop GUI framework.
In particular a lot more like Qt.
And as a result we can actually
apply graceful degradation
to our framework so when you're...
You can actually use a
text-based browser to browse
Wt sites or you can use modern browsers
and it will use whatever
technology is available.
Like Qt, Wt has an equally cutesy name.
Wt is definitely pronounced &quot;witty.&quot;
So it's used mostly in
embedded applications
so as a front end for any
C++ based application.
Usually the kind of
applications that have to do
a lot of computation in the background.
You need a front end for that.
Wt is very convenient for that.
It's mostly appealing to
people who already know Qt
and want to support that to the web
because there are benefits to
deploying things on the web
rather than having it as
a desktop application.
So to give you an example
of what a typical Wt three
application would look like.
In your main function you would call wRun
which is a utility function
which spawns off a server
based on the arguments that you pass in
and then you pass in this call back.
Create application, for example.
And that one gets called
every time there's a new user
who surfs to this webpage.
Every new user session is one
instance of a W application.
This create application
gets an environment
which tells it something about
the user that's accessing it.
The stuff like the user agent, IP address,
that kind of stuff.
And then you make a new W application.
This is Wt three so you use new still.
And then you get the
roots of this application
which is like in Wt
everything is organized
in this widget tree so
you start from the roots
and you add everything
to this root widget.
So this dot dot dot,
that's where you would add
a whole bunch of stuff to this root widget
and connect your signals and slots
and eventually you return
this application to Wt
and Wt will take it from there.
So for example, what you
could do in this dot dot dot
is you could get this
container, these roots,
in HTML that would be a div.
And then you can use
addWidgets to add stuff to it.
So you're creating like a
button with new W push button.
You would give it a name and
then call addWidget to add it.
You could do the same thing
for some text if you know HTML.
That's kind of like a span.
You could have it say button
not clicked yet for example.
Then you can take some signals for example
there's a click signal
defined on the button
and you can connect that too for example.
So you can update the text
when you click on the button.
As a result, it's exactly
what you would expect.
You see a button with some
text button not clicked yet.
You click the button and it
turns into button clicked.
With Wt four, what we wanted
to do was making using Wt
a lot more fun and for us,
that meant making it more
clear and more safe, especially the way
that we have memory in Wt.
And we wanted to improve
our compilation speed
because well, C++ isn't the
choice; it's slow to compile.
We wanted to make it a bit
more familiar to people
who are already familiar
with modern C++ 11 practices.
So they'd expect to see
stuff like a unique pointer
owns something and a
raw pointer doesn't own.
That's not something in Wt three
and we wanted to move towards that.
We also wanted to fix a
bunch of problems in the API.
That's major version
increments allow us to do that.
But overall, we wanted
to keep it consistent
with how it already was in Wt three.
We don't want to annoy our
existing users by just changing
everything and making it
completely unfamiliar.
Whenever we broke
something we made sure that
if it was a major thing we would
break it at compile time so
that users wouldn't be able
to just re-compile their
Wt three code and just have a
whole bunch of runtime errors
because that would also
just be really annoying.
The first problem that we
really wanted to tackle
is this non-obvious memory management.
This question showed up on
Stack Overflow like a week ago.
Someone asking the same thing I asked
when I started working at Emweb
three and a half years ago.
I didn't know that much of C++ yet.
And I actually started out with C++ 11
and had to learn C++ 03's stuff.
For me, it was also weird
that I was seeing all these
new calls and then no
deletes and I was like whoa.
I was really paranoid
about well, where was all
this memory going, is it
just leaking everywhere?
Well, not really.
The way that we did it
in Wt three was just
whenever you called
addWidget, that would transfer
the ownership to that container.
So the problem with the
typical Wt three code
is one, whatever happens
between the creation
of this new button and
adding it to this container
then well, something could trow there
and then you'd have a leak.
And then afterwards when you'd move it,
well, it's not obvious that
the ownership is transferred.
And there was actually
also a second way to do it
and that's to call this
constructor directly
with the container as a peta measure.
But the problem with
that is we'd have to be
really careful in the implementation
of this addWidget code
because we couldn't assume that
it was a fully instantiated widget yet.
We actually definitely had
a few bugs related to that.
Yeah, it's also mentioned
in the fact of C++
that you shouldn't call virtual functions
when you're in construction
or deconstruction.
It replaces where we doing that
and we had to eliminate that.
It was already very
clear what we had to do
with method number two,
we had to just scratch it.
So now the question was what do we do
with this first way of doing things?
First we thought maybe we could
just not transfer ownership.
For example you could use
make_unique to make this button
and then add a non-owning
pointer to this container.
But then you'd also have
to make sure this button
stays around as long as you need it.
There are pros to this because
well, there's no longer
this potential leak when
you have an exception.
And it's clear who owns
it, you just made it
and you didn't move it
so you still own it.
But the cons are well, what
if this button gets deleted?
What do we do?
Do we remove it from the widget tree
and then the button just disappears?
And it's completely valid
and it will compile.
There's no undefined behavior.
And it's really annoying to debug.
So if you let the pointer
dangle, that would be undefined
behavior but at least there will be tools
that allow us to check that.
It's also a bit cumbersome
because you have to make sure
that this button has to
stay around for long enough.
And then in the end you just
end up making this whole shadow
of hierarchy or something like that
to make sure that it stays
around for long enough.
And even worse well in
this particular case,
we could of course make it
so that it doesn't compile
anymore in several ways
but if you have existing
Wt three code, it would just
call new instead of making each
and then pass that in, then
that would just leak everywhere.
From this we concluded
that this parent owns child
relationship that is still
a good way of doing it.
But we should make it
clear some other way.
We also thought maybe we could
use shared pointers for that.
For example you could
just called make_shared
and add its this shared
pointer and you have
a shared pointer in the container widget
and where you just created it.
Of course, this again,
doesn't leak when there's
an exception that throws but
the ownership relationship
is less clear here and
you have to watch out for
accidentally creating memory leaks.
And one of the ways that you could do that
is that if you would
define lambda in there
and accidentally capture
this shared pointer
then you would just create a loop.
It's also thread safe but
we don't actually need it
to be thread safe because
in a W application
we only modify the widget
tree in one thread at a time.
It's like an event driven
system that guarantees that.
The equivalent of share
pointers to create this loop
would be to use weak pointers
but then it's actually
cumbersome to use because
it has to be thread safe.
You could also of course use raw pointers
or references but then it gets a bit weird
because you're using on the
one side a shared pointer
and then on the other side...
So we just decided to
just keep it the same.
But make it more explicit so
we would just use make_unique
to make the widgets and then
move them over to the container
and this works but there's
an error on the slide.
I hope you can spot it but I
will get back to that later.
So again, one of those
exceptions is that doesn't leak
anymore, it's clear who owns
it now because there's moves
happening but the cons are
well, this is a little bit
more verbose and even worse,
well the widget is null
after we move it so when
you're actually connecting
this slots to that signal
then button is null
and text is null so that's
actually going to blow up.
A safe forward way to
fix that would be to move
the addWidget calls to the back
and then it would be fine again.
So this was the most common
problem we encountered
when porting our examples over.
I actually only found this once.
Someone told me about
this a few weeks ago.
That this existed.
I was looking for a sum checker for it.
It was actually too late.
This was one of the
ways that we could check
use-after-move problems like that.
You could use clang-tidy.
Then if you use
run-clang-tidy.py you can run it
on your entire project.
Before the release of
Wt four, we still found
two of those problems.
So luckily that was
before release, not after.
But because it was a
quite column pattern now
that we were adding these
widgets to the widget tree
but then we still kind of needed them,
we ended up creating
these templated overloads
where you could pass in
a specific kind of widget
and then it would move that widget
but it would also keep a
raw pointer and return that
so that you can still use that.
Then the example becomes a bit simpler.
Instead of having these
moves or having to save it
with a .get or something you
could just call addWidget
and as argument you just
construct it in place
and then you get a raw
pointer out of that.
And then you can later
use that raw pointer
to still connect some singles
to slots, for example.
And then there was just one problem that
we still had to tackle.
We were a bit paranoid
about what if this widget
that emits this signal outlives widgets
that are used in the slot?
That's how we came up
with observing pointers.
We thought we need some
kind of weak pointer
but then for things that are
not in the shared pointer.
We didn't need it to be thread safe.
So this is an extremely
simple implementation now.
We just made every widget inherit
from widget core observable.
These observing and it
would just keep a vector
of these observing pointers
and whenever it was deleted
then it would just invalidate
all those observing pointers
and the expectation there
is that we'll have zero
or very few observing pointers
pointing to one observable.
We notice actually that for the most part
this ended up being unnecessary
because for the most part
the way that our applications worked,
this was an uncommon etch case.
Because we don't want to
really force a new concept
onto our users and if they're
sure that they're definitely
not going to have these dangling pointers
then we didn't want to
necessarily say you have to
use it so nowhere in our API we return it.
Nowhere in our API we request it.
You can use it if you want to
but it's usually unnecessary.
That's like the whole way that we changed
our ownership model and
how we made it more clear.
Another thing that we could do now is
because C++ 11 and beyond
incorporates a lot of features
that were first in Boost, we
could scratch a lot of that
and replace it with stuff
that's now in the STL.
Because we knew that these Boost errors
slowed compilation times a lot.
Especially because you
have a lot of headers
that are just made to support
older compilers and stuff.
We didn't need that, we
just target C++ 11 now.
On Windows, we actually had
to distribute a binary version
of Boost with our binary build on Windows
because it had to be binary compatible.
So we wanted to kind of eliminate
it from our header files.
These are some of the
substitutions that we made.
So we replaced Boost.Signals2
which was previously
our signals slot system works
with our own implementation.
And now our implementation
actually also because
of variadic templates you
don't need STD bind anymore
to bind away a lot of extra rubbish.
We also for example instead of Boost.Asio
we can now switch between
Boost.Asio or Standalone Asio
so that one was the
final one that enabled us
to completely remove
Boost from the headers.
Boost.Date_Time we replaced with chrono
and Howard Hinnant's new date library.
Which is excellent and is
like proposed for inclusion
in the center at some point.
And I hope that it will
get in at some point
because that's one dependency fewer then.
The results of doing this
were actually quite nice.
One of them was Boost's signals too had
quite long stack traces
like if you wanted to see
in a lambda function
where is this really being
emitted to the signal, you
had to go all the way down
to frame 12 to find where
it was being emitted.
Actually I'm not showing
all of the code here yet.
Because there's so many
template substitutions
going on there, I shortened
all of the lines now.
So in Wt four, it's a little bit shorter.
It's still in frame six
but these lines are shorter
and more understandable now.
Also one of the effects is now
that we eliminated the Boost
includes we could really speed
up our compilation times.
So this is on this
example that I showed you.
So it's mostly really
showing this overhead.
Now the preprocessed
file size is just a fifth
of what it was before and compilation time
has also gone down with a fifth.
Also our Windows builds now
have a much smaller installer
because we don't have to include Boost.
It's also a lot faster to
install because Boost has a lot
of tiny header files and for some reason
that's really slow to unpack on Windows.
And our install size went down
and it's three times smaller.
Less than three times smaller.
Now Wt is now basically on Windows BYOB.
Bring your own Boost if you want to.
You don't actually need to but you can use
any version of Boost that you want.
So to conclude, this explicit
ownership now is nice.
It's not straightforward really to adapt
our ownership model to it.
I think we did an alright
job but if someone else
has some other ideas on
how that could be done
then I would love to hear it.
The additions to the STL
are now a great opportunity
to move a lot of weight,
especially where we were using
Boost in our headers, and really
speed up compilation time.
Well Wt four was released
last week and sadly we haven't
heard much yet, we've
heard people say that
our compilation time has
improved and that was good.
We really still have
to hear from our users
to really know if it was successful.
You can get Wt four now at
webtoolkit.eu if you want.
I still have a little bit
of time for questions.
(clapping)
- [Crowd Member] Can
you show the last slide
where you edit the make_unique things?
- This one?
- [Crowd Member] No,
where you have addWidget.
- Oh, that one, yeah.
- [Crowd Member] Yeah.
One more.
That one.
- Okay, sorry.
- [Crowd Member] Why
didn't you make addWidget
also the construction of the
push button link of your text?
You could have saved the
make_unique error with point.
- Can you repeat that?
- [Crowd Member] Just push
down the addWidget to template.
- Yeah, I was thinking about that
and I actually floated that idea.
If you don't know necessarily
that we're really following
these rules of a raw
pointer is always non-owning
then it would be less obvious
that you're moving it.
But yeah, it's something
that we might still add now.
- [Crowd Member] Even on
this slide, two things
that's a lot of implication actually.
Effective to weight.
- So 4.01, we'll have that.
(laughing)
(mumbling)
Yeah, so you're saying
that we should return
a reference instead of a pointer here.
Yeah, well I wouldn't tell so
ask Keon about that about why
he chose a pointer instead
of a reference in this case.
I'm actually not sure.
No more questions?
Okay, thank you.
