in the next talk am i safe to say that
yeah cut the math out if you're gonna
have some bath no ah yen's is going to
talk because he is a speaker and visitor
of many an organizer of one c++
conference and he's going to do I can't
believe this is adorable that in 2014
there are so many C++ conferences that
we need to compare and contrast and
overview them I am absolutely delighted
that that is a topic for us so that is
our topic C++ conferences I have to
disappoint caton one on one special
point no it's not math c++ conferences
are in my opinion not comparable so I'm
obviously biased as I organized my own
conference so I kind of don't try to
compare them as they're different and
each one is special so that's a boring
thread about me so yeah let's get
started in in the topic so super spars
conferences I just made a list of
probably almost every C++ conference
which currently exists first and for all
we are currently at C++ cone as you
noticed I guess then there is c++ and
beyond there's C++ now there is a DC
which stands for advanced developer
conference in Bavaria meeting C++ my
very own conference this year in Berlin
qtf days and going native and you might
have noticed that there are a few
conferences of which you have heard or
which we attended yourself are missing
those are just is just a short list of
pure C++ conferences which are
also existing our conferences that have
a C++ track for example the ACC you the
NDC the Silicon Valley code camp which
also gets organized by the super star
trek by John Cobb and Microsoft's BUILD
conference also usually has a c++ track
or several talks about C++ and thought I
give you an overview where those
conferences are situated those are in
Europe and um those are in America now
our think about it there is also a
conference like thing and japan called
boost study meeting where the japanese
boost seen usually meets a day or two to
i'm not sure why conference like all of
us really a study meeting i have not
have never attended that so and I
probably don't intend to do it because
my Japanese is not very good so one
thing I would like to encourage you is
to speak at conferences because I think
it's a very good thing as a speaker and
I know that many many of you are
speakers already in the room and I know
that many many of you in the room are
also half as a potential to present
something interesting about C++ and it's
a great right training and you could
have started with a lightning talking I
get some of you did start with lightning
talk at this conference if you interest
if you're interested in and speaking
there's usually for each conference call
for paper where you can submit your talk
as a description and title usually and
usually submit a speaker bio and then
you usually get voted by a committee or
from meeting C++ to be edited this year
the first time that's attendees did vote
on the talks that was very successful
and
this result of the voting is basically
yeah the schedule almost so I decided to
give you an overview about three
different conferences which I have
visited three times or organized three
times and those are C++ now cute def
days and my own conference of course too
so here we are with C++ now um it's a
very nice conference as we see in essen
the weather is not always that good but
usually you have you have a very good
veteran s I've been three times now
there but what you what you definitely
should see is that asthma is very high
and they get to some other details about
SMU later c++ now effects it's a rather
small conference to 150 attendees it has
a very high code of how to say that of
really C++ professionals a Tessa its
past us and in the boost con conference
so it's a lot of people from the boost
community are there and it's a if you're
interested in boost this is one of the
best conferences you can go to and it
lasts like this conference five days but
it's a bit easier to choose the talks
because you only have three parallel
tracks and as we saw in the previous
picture the conference itself is in a
park-like surrounding where you can
spend the brakes etc also in the park
it's very nice as always also also as I
already mentioned the conference has its
roots in the boost conference which
originally started there and asked me
and my opinion is a very very good
conference for c++ nerds
but it might be hard to get there
because this year um the the first
picture I showed you was also from this
year from friday or saturday this is a
few days earlier we had winter um i
think is a bits a tribute to the long
winter and the hard winter in north
america but as you should know that SMS
in the rockies you always have to to see
that snow as an option so when you're
coming to smu i definitely have to to
bring summer and winter clothes and
basically switch during the day because
the nights are really cool and awesome
and you also should be aware that sm has
quite a higher altitude so doing sports
etcetera earnestness sometimes a bit
difficult for people topics usually
general c++ boost standard C++ you know
just the shed yourself of the last
year's is always available which you can
look through and further details about
C++ now are at their website which
brings me to the cute developer days
which are specialized conference um this
year again now for the third year I
think an emboldened European version and
there's also a version in San Francisco
as we see on the next slide which is in
November and Ordonez in October and the
two day conference in front of the
conference there's a training day you
can book the straining separately so
that your Canada attend to all three
days or just the conference if you knew
too cute the training data is very good
if you already have done a lot with cute
you might should think about if there's
a training that fits your needs
currently or just change the corner
I usually now skip the training day the
first years I was there it was very good
but now I don't need it anymore i work
every day was cute yeah it's a bit older
already from the conference it has a
long history and cute is not only C++ so
the topics on this conference are not
only C++ are of course cute is a big
topic qml the platforms developing for
different platforms was cute and C++ is
also a topic so they also have talks
like what is new and C++ 11 but it's
less important for the conference and
cute is really the main focus if you
don't like you just should not go there
and details are on cute f-test calm
which will lead you to both websites for
both conferences in Europe and in
America which brings me to my very own
beloved conference meeting C++ 2014
meeting C++ is a little bit more than a
conference you see the history we had
for the last two years quite a little
bit of growth and for this year we also
have 50 students which are sponsored by
a company called think they'll um and
yeah it's also website and blog for c++
and one of my goals as I started meeting
C++ was not always not not also the
conference but also trying to get more
user groups started and I talk about
that tomorrow but back to the conference
as I mentioned it's this year in Berlin
for the first time on and it's probably
going to stay also in Berlin for the
next year's i hope the tropics are
general C++ libraries like boost cute
standard C++ this year we have a theme
track each year this year this will be
scientific programming and with C++ so
we have a focus on
Marik's and threading etc and the the
program was chosen the program was
chosen by a voting so we had over 50
talks which got submitted and the voting
helped me tremendously to actually
choose the right program for the
conference yeah it's two days conference
three tracks with seven talks and two
key notes by a human and hard not to
kaiser and yeah um a little bit of
history this is staff and including me
um basically my user groups or local
user group and destroy Dorf where the
conference was hosted the first two
years and um there's ever since then
being the local staff doing doing what
what the people was a I don't know what
color is said Sian Sian shirts do here
so they do that at my conference and
they were of lecture it was meeting C++
stuff on it and well further details
about my conference and everything I do
there on my website meeting superfast
calm and short I speak tomorrow with
John Corp about C++ user groups and
founding them if you're interested in
getting involved in the community and
building a local community in your area
you might want to attend tomorrow the
first session at nine o'clock not so
much room as I have the studio cleared
up so we are questions no because this
is lightning talks oh and if you have
any questions you can come to me and ask
me and happy to answer any questions our
you know sent me a mention on twitter or
an email thank you for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
