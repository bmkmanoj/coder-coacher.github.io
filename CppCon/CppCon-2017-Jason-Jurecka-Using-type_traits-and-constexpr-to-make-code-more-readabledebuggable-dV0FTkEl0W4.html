I'm a senior engineer at
Blizzard Entertainment.
Last year I gave a talk very quickly
about game engine usage of
new modern C++ features.
And I had a macro-based reflection system
which everyone hated.
People were complaining about
it on the YouTube channel,
and I got some comments afterwards.
- [Host] I'm sorry.
You get to start all over again.
(audience laughing)
Because nobody can hear you.
You're screwing my role man.
- [Host] I know, I know.
Hello, hello.
Oh, you might have to
talk closer to that thing.
I don't know. Maybe we can-
All right ladies.
(audience laughing)
Hold on to your panties.
This is going to be really rough.
(audience laughing)
All right, so let's do this
where everyone can hear it.
So last year I gave a talk
about game engine usage of
C++ 11 features and the like.
Mainly I was focusing on stuff
that was paratactically
availability at the time
which meant I was using a compiler
that had some features from 14,
some features from 11 and
no experimental features.
So I built out a
infrastructure that used a
macro-based reflection system
to generate resources and
to automatically generate
the serializers and
deserializers for that data.
This caused me to have to go in
and define some of the default types,
so then they would be evaluated properly.
And that created kind
of a weird thing thing
where I had to do this work
when I probably shouldn't have.
So now with the new compiler 2017,
I was able to go in and add type traits.
And this allowed me to
remove all of those macros
and then make the code debuggable because
I no longer had just magic
macro and then data comes out.
So now I had debuggable code.
Well, as you can see,
it's still a little bit tough to look at.
I'm using essentially enable_if
to enable a template availability
at compile time based
on whether or not the type is
considered trivially copyable.
I had to kind of put this
on multiple instances
of my function to get it
to just compile and work.
Well, I think that we can do better.
And so now I have this,
using if constexpr,
I now just have a single function
where the interface is the same.
And I evaluate based on the type
which code is getting compiled.
So that's pretty nice.
So now I removed all my macros.
That's awesome, right?
Well, actually, I have to handle a case
where I have something that in my resource
that is not trivially copyable.
For my resources I allow standard vector
which typically isn't
allowed in game resources.
But I'm trying to prove out some of the
advancements in C++
for use in game engines
and things like that.
So to allow for that.
Essentially I have this macro
evaluation that runs though
and makes me less sad.
But essentially what it
does is generate this.
So I have this definition at the top
which is my resource in a head filer.
And then when the macro's processed,
it will generate this templatized override
for the function and
essentially enumerates
each of these types.
It will also go though
and specialize the
serialize for each type.
And if that type is a
trivially copyable type
then it will kind of automatically
use my trivially copyable
version of my serialize.
So this is a lot easier to have kind of
be the magic thing that
exist in the macros.
And the other stuff is
much easier to debug.
So that makes me happy.
So another thing that I
showed was a compiled time
usage of a string hashing.
And what I had before
which was available then
was the original version of constexpr
which meant that you couldn't do loops.
And so I did recursion
based string hashing.
So this was the original layout
which isn't the easiest to debug
because everything is in a ? : type setup.
This is the new layout
which is a lot easier to deal with,
because it's now in loops.
I can step in, and I
can go through each item
and check it and verify when I'm doing the
evaluation at run time.
Or have better knowledge
on kind of what's going
on when the compiler is running this code.
So, can I get rid of more macros,
because at one point I had this
where it was kind of calling
my constexpr function
and then it would just evaluate everything
at compile time if I needed to.
Well, kind of, because we now have this
which came in 2011,
but I found it later,
so I started using that
which meant that I could now put this
user-defined literal at
the end of my string.
And that allowed me to go through
and simplify a bunch of my code,
so then I didn't have
macros all over the place
and making everyone sad who looked at it.
Thank you very much.
