pepper
I'll presented Angela for the trends
today I want to talk about the elephant
do room which is actually I want to know
a little bit about my favorite IDE
it's called Q creator how many of you
know about QT creator that's the
elephant room right I haven't seen a
single talk about it haven't seen that
people talk about this stuff so for
those of you who don't know about kid
creator quickly there's a very nice idea
of course for C++ it's small it's a
hundred megabyte download you can
download right now it has multi support
it supports a variety of build systems Q
makes he makes all the pools other stuff
it has very nice refactoring debugging
profiling Beltane stuff it subversion to
can run the salon static analyzers on it
and so on if you want your fancy every
part of it is extensible via plugins and
it's open source and the main reason why
I use it is actually because it's damn
fast
it's lean Emil a does the job and gets a
result
and despite names but it's called cute
creator but it's actually used not just
for cute code many many people use it
for everything so I've got three minutes
for a demo for this thing I was thinking
about okay what can I show you in three
minutes
so I was trying to do a certain online
pad Zuul
actually sorry I was trying to explain a
friend of mine who does understand
shared pointers how SharePoint us work
yeah I bet you can't read any of that
can you because I'm this is about the
part around it can you know you can't
okay
matter right no surprise okay thank you
both and any any how what can I show
about this yeah this is a C make project
it has nothing to do with cute so okay
what kind of show very quickly this at
usual offers everything you can imagine
I can go over there and for sensory
factor data
only my data it just works I can save it
I can build it I can run it into the
bagger so it's there and whoa what's my
data oh it's actually a shirt pointer
yeah but this is much smarter than I
should be and actually shows me the
external time information I don't want
to see what you want ward the binos and
a lab nose lips tess STD cpp is
implementing this I just want to use the
use count Draft count and what's inside
data oh sorry I don't like that right I
want to see obviously all that so that's
pretty good what's going on below here I
creating a new data at leat data that's
the old way of doing things so actually
is not even crashing it just runs yeah
well let's ask our friend
mam check oh look I'm doing something
invalid so many many things but really
what's the single feature I use every
single day
well as I was saying this is fast this
Lena mean so let me show you I mean it
just opened something big work a lot of
aren't cute so what I just need I open
in a second a project which is about
three hundred thousand files it opened
up in seconds and yeah how do i navigate
this this mess many many files I don't
go around
well single feature I use every single
day is this small thing here in bottom
left corner it's called a locator you
trigger it by control K and once you
look but you trigger it you can easily
move around search for questions inside
your code base so yeah there is another
editor which is getting this thing yeah
yeah I know you see you've seen it so
how do I use this thing
well I trigger control K then I type one
of these letters or one of these strings
followed by space followed by the
arguments so for instance ah I don't
know I want to know about yeah
methods around what I got use data and
main yeah that makes sense
jump to main and go there I want to know
about a file in local projects of
reasons
yeah I want make sense oops that's an
include definition so I want to know
whoever wrote something like show yellow
thing or the great
name right yeah that's such a code will
exist
oh they all did that they blame oh yeah
somebody did that so I'm making names on
slides but so it's public history and so
you yeah I can be fit can navigate
around and in case I get in real trouble
I can always go as ask star core flow
what is a very add the template tap that
and oh yeah meter is down okay
sorry you can see that all right sorry
working great
I've also got points on Stack Overflow
that's even yeah so okay well out of
time
give it a try its again it's open source
and if you get feedback feel free to
send me an email
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
