Yesterday I was asked to
do this lightning talk
about two my personal projects.
It's about regular expressions.
Regular expressions,
I think everybody here
know how to write them.
They are easy to write, sometimes.
But I notice that usually
your regular expressions
in code doesn't change much.
Usually I have only one in code
and it's done and it's there.
If you are not doing some text editor
or something different, something similar.
So, why we are having
string or a presentation
of regular expression?
The regular expression are interpreted.
In C++ we don't like
interpreted languages, usually.
So you can avoid this interpretation
by writing your own finite automaton,
or finite automata, or
you can use some library.
Anyway, there is regular expression.
I think everybody understands.
And I was thinking that it will be nice
to work with a regular
expression like with other types
because every regular expression
is doing something different.
So I did something like this.
It's exactly the same.
You can do things like this.
It's done during compile time.
Optimizer can do lot of things with it.
But you can do something like this,
you can take part of
your regular expression
and store it somewhere else
and use on lot of places.
And you can do even things like this.
It's very easy.
But my friends and my colleagues
doesn't like the syntax
because they are used to old things
and regular expression in old ways.
So we are back here.
There is a proposal, I
don't know actual study,
but it's implemented in Clang and GCC,
which allows you do this.
Effectively, this.
And actually, it's this.
I write LL1 or parser, which
transformed this string
into exactly the same type.
And if you provide me grammars
for JSON, I can parse JSON.
There is example, or is a program.
I tried to minimize code and I used boots
because I don't want to use some,
you know, strings, they are
generating very big code.
And this is translated
and optimized into this.
It's only, I think, 78
instruction, no recursion,
and only two codes at the
end, if you are coding parts.
More information you
can find on my web page.
And that's all, and thank you.
