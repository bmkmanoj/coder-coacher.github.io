as I promised during the lightning talk
today I'm going to tell you about the
C++ video captioning and translating
initiative named the C++ video access
project CPP vApp wicked calm not all of
you have seen my lightning talk that is
why I will briefly remind the answer to
the primary philosophical question what
do we need this all for here is the
answer
the maximum number of people in the room
during the plenary session is within
about 1500 the session is recorded and
then viewed the number of video views is
at least hundred times more another
important fact is that this number is
still growing every month and will
continue growing for a few more years I
recently heard that YouTube counts not
just the number of views but the number
of unique accounts that viewed the video
if that is true then this number is
likely to reflect the actual number of
people who have viewed the video
probably more than once thus the main
impact of a modern tech talk is not on
the live viewers but on the video
viewers to make the story short here's
the picture these are the live viewers
in the room these are the
english-speaking video viewers these are
the English readers those who understand
written English but not spoken and these
are those who don't understand English
these people currently just don't watch
the c++ videos they get nothing out of
our conferences the delivery of the c++
contents to these people that's what we
need this all for now how to deliver the
contents YouTube supports the video
translations in the form of captions
thus we need to create and add those
captions how to do that there is a
number of YouTube help videos and pages
that come to help
however they are somewhat out-of-date
YouTube is a software it's growing
it gets redesigned it's changing after I
had watched YouTube help videos it took
me some time to put all the pieces
together like a puzzle in order to get
the full picture that is why I'd like to
show you briefly how the captioning and
translation works today
before that I need to let you know that
I have manager permission for the
YouTube channels boost con which is the
previous name of the SU class plus now
account
and CPB Khan that is why some of the
screens available for me may not be
available for a general YouTube user
here is how to see the captions if the
captions cover some part of the screen
you can drag them to where you like you
can also customize some other settings
this affects your own preferences only
but before you can see the captions they
need to be created submitted and
published that's what is called
community contributions for the YouTube
channels cpp con meeting c++ boost con
the community contributions are enabled
that is the menu item add subtitles CC
is available the channels are ready for
captioning experiments have shown that
translation is a relatively simple fast
and straightforward job if based on
quality English captions so the first
and the most important step is original
English captioning here is how to
provide the English captions English
captioning is not fast but we are not
alone here YouTube provides the water
generated English captions they have
multiple errors like the punctuation but
they save some typing and time
synchronizing as you see you mostly need
to edit the auto-generated captions and
fix some timing this YouTube help video
provides more details hotkeys etc what
the video does not say is a trick that
helped me a lot I did this
I don't understand more most of the
things that they're talking about and
the speaker becomes much more captioning
friendly if you are a conference
presenter than you are in a unique
position here even if the audio was not
recorded properly you know exactly what
you were saying or what the question of
the audience was you can even remember
who in particular asked the question and
write that name in the captions I want
to address an important point our goal
here is to spread good C++ ideas as
widely as possible not to document a
historical event we want captions to
capture the best intent of the presenter
not what they happen to say please
delete unnecessary words like so well
you know it's like a delayed sentence
false starts or anything else that isn't
contributing to the presentation of the
ideas captioning is a unique opportunity
to go back in time and make corrections
for example if you loosely quote it
Scott captioning gives you the
opportunity to get the cool worded
exactly right plus it may turn out you
were quoting Andray or you know if you
intended to mention something during the
talk but forgot it may feel encouraged
somehow to change what was said but
fidelity to history is less important
than fidelity to intent fix the choose
good briefly speaking you know what
captions best capture the intent of your
presentation so if you are a presenter
than you are the best captioner possible
the page tips for captioners and
translators give some more advice if you
want to get freddied like this
then click this check mark you can also
do it later feel free to add any info
about the captioner in the end of the
captions if you would like to support
our initiative then feel free to add the
link to the community wiki after you are
done press submit contribution the
captions get submitted for review the
YouTube Help says that the captions are
reviewed by the viewers and once enough
approval statistics is gathered if the
captions get published automatically but
so far I have never seen that mechanism
working that is why I would recommend
you to not wait until your submitted
captions get reviewed instead get in
touch either with me for the CPP con or
boost con channels or with the YouTube
channel owners the simplest way to let
me know is over slack not yet and slack
go to here after you joined the CPP lang
team join the CPP vApp channel then
write to me something like my ID please
publish my captions for the CPP con 2017
video named let's say captioning and
translating C++ videos if you have the
wicked comm account then another simple
way to let me know is with a private
message right on the wiki
once I get your message I'll go to
YouTube as CP pecan manager and to the
community contributions section and
we'll review your captions if you are a
presenter then you know better than I do
what captions should be there in such
cases I accelerate my review using this
trick
I usually look for major or evident
issues if I see any eyelid you know in
any case I typically press publish after
that you can see the captions published
afterwards you can make fixes if needed
there is one more important step after
your contribution is published please go
to the catalog of available captions and
translations and add your record by
example of the existing ones this
requires a wicked calm account it is
nice if the record contains the direct
link to the video session abstract
speaker info slides and whatever the
viewer might need please keep the record
sorted by language conference year and
alphabetically otherwise feel free to
propose and implement your mechanism of
keeping the catalog such that the
records can be sorted a filter like in a
spreadsheet or a database now it is time
for translating the procedure is pretty
much the same as the original English
captioning except for a tiny difference
you can write your translation by
yourself or you can press Auto translate
and edit the water translation that's
the only difference
don't forget to get credit feel free to
write your info in the end of
translation and provide a link to the
wiki see when we have quality English
captions well time synchronized the
translating is so easy and fast multiple
people can work together on the same
translation multiple translations can be
worked on in parallel that's it for
captioning you can find more info at the
wiki but on one page I'd like to stop in
details it is what is missing in youtube
if you are a YouTube developer then
please visit this page it is a
ready-made list of feature requests
currently I as a captioner translator
reviewer and publisher miss the
following features if the video has
translations but the viewer does not
know it then nothing tells the viewer
that the translation can be turned on
and how to do that I remember one of
YouTube's help videos or pages mentioned
something like that but didn't provide
any screenshots or videos and I have
never seen that working I'd like the
video owners to be able to enable for
all the videos air
for the viewers in the beginning of the
video that the translations are
available and how to tone them on so
whatever video is captioned or
translated that reminder to trigger the
YouTube feature named cards like on this
my example require manual interferin
stew every video and can only be done by
the channel owners not by the community
sometimes not only the presenters speech
needs to be translated but the slides
also would be nice to have multiple
captions at the same time one translator
speech and other translate the slides
both scrawled and positioned
independently sometimes more than one
person speaks in the video would be nice
to be able to show the captions in
different colors for different people
recently while preparing this
presentation I have noticed on CPP Khan
Channel the new captions submitted for
review the first time I saw them YouTube
was saying that they were submitted a
week ago this means that for one week I
wasn't aware that the new captions had
been submitted for review I as a channel
manager would like to get an email about
the new community contributions and to
be able to customize the frequency of
such emails also I don't see in YouTube
who has submitted the captions and there
is no way to get in touch with the
captioner I'd like to be able to write a
direct message to discuss the captions
there are some other feature requests on
that page and will be added to that page
but the most challenging and at the same
time the most valuable feature YouTube
could have at the VA's motion is the
public video is an opportunity to add a
translation in the form of an extra
soundtrack like in the movie voice
translates voice and the captions
translate the slides show the web links
clarify the code fragments etc if voice
translation is implemented then many of
other feature requests will not be that
important and for the viewers the
viewing will become almost as
comfortable as watching the movies if
you are a YouTube developer or manager
then I'd like to make friends with you I
can provide more details and use cases
if needed
that's about all I have to tell about
the C++ video access project now I'd
like to tell a bit about the history of
this wiki during my volunteering at C++
now conference in May 2017 certain
occasion has triggered my idea of
translating the C++ videos to on
language alone I started research and
John Cobb showed me that reading that
YouTube supports captions he showed me
the captions that he created for a
promotional video for now I believe John
is the first most C++ video captioner I
started experimenting with a short video
and experienced a very unexpected and
highly enthusiastic support from John he
suggested to make the translation a
global community driven initiative he
told me about the site's reddit comm and
wicked calm that were considered as the
candidates for the wiki even the name of
the initiative C++ video access project
was suggested by John if not John then I
believe my idea would stay just an idea
here's the takeaway of this talk these
are live viewers these are English
speaking video viewers these are English
readers those who understand written
English but not spoken these are non
English speakers those who don't
understand English the people in these
two categories do not watch the c++
videos they get nothing from us there is
a huge opportunity to broaden the
audience of the C++ videos to reach
these significant groups of people we
need to caption and translate our videos
if you are a presenter then you are the
best captioner possible if you provide
quality English captions then your video
will reach this group in one shot and
your captions will help the translators
to cover this group if you are
multilingual then you can help leverage
the value of the tremendous work done at
major c++ conferences you can become
known among these people by your next
class pass on-site interview the
interviewers may start recognizing you
by
first and last name if you are in one of
these groups then there is a resource
that links you to the high quality C++
content in your language YouTube
provides support for us as a community
to work together to do the captioning
and translating everything you need is
located on the C++ video access project
wiki or can be easily added by anyone in
the community go to CPP Valve wiki
dot-com and start changing the world
thank you and happy captioning and
translating
you
yes I think there's a correlation
between people don't read this or
non-english languages or will be very
unlikely that somebody not understand
English
so I think this that's it would that
make less sense to other language return
your voice into her turn on
just working it I agree that for such
countries as Germany Sweden and some
other Western European countries
population half of the population most
of the population speaks both languages
but there are many countries such as
China Middle East countries territory of
former Soviet Union Eastern Europe
Africa Latin America many of them don't
speak English if they are developers
they they read they can read maybe some
of them don't even understand written
English so there are still I believe a
strong demand for videos in their native
language
yes that you have some experience and
how long the latest translation and
captioning that I done is John Cobbs
lightning talk five minute six minute
video and it took me time from 9 a.m. to
11 p.m.
captioning and translating to Russian so
it's a it's not difficult but it's very
time-consuming effort so that's why it's
nearly impossible to do alone such an
amount of work that's why this hasn't
started as a community if you're if it's
not the first most your attempt if you
are already experienced in that it would
take I believe one hour and a half video
to caption into English be doing English
to caption you would probably take you
eight hours
yes you can do captioning for certain
part of the video another person if he
wants to continue it can continue and do
the same continue your work and the it
might be collective effort that's
possible you just instead of submitting
your captions you save the draft and
another person continues at that place
you can provide captions for particular
part of the talk where the audio was not
recorded for example even so which
languages are having those the physics
yeah the commander was as I understand
it probably makes sense to see which
work is currently in progress and that's
quite possible to add that page and
there is actually one page which starts
an initiative similar to that so John
created this page and he was working on
this video it's possible to so oh okay
so on CPD babcom so on this page
John has let us others know that he's
working on this video and anybody else
who has wicked calm account can go to
this page and edit this page at whatever
you want safe and in such a way let
other people know that you are working
you
questions yes sure I think it's it makes
sense to be definite also it will warm
the wind and community contributions are
open and I remember when this summer
John was very busy ting his friend in
German in Sweden who was original German
that person told that he saw all the
videos by Alex Stepanov except the only
these four videos and I try to get in
touch with the owner of those videos
those videos are in Russian and I
requested them to open the community
contributions but they still not
responding to one of my notes so I
requested them to open the community
contribution the person responded I
don't know who is the owner and I don't
remember where I took those I told him
the owner is you and here's how to open
them and still there's no reply so if
this owner is watching now recorded this
video please open the community
contributions for this number of videos
where were they
for these videos videos of Alex steppin
off with open those any more questions
alright then let's proceed to the next
session thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
