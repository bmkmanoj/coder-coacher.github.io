static analysis my name is Jason Turner
if you are interested you can go to my
github project and check out this
presentation anything else
I am the co-host of CBP cast which is a
podcast for C++ developers if you
haven't heard of it I suggest you check
it out and listen and I am the co-author
of chie script which will be having an
open session on tomorrow morning feel
free to join us it's an embedded
scripting language for C++ and I am the
author of supercilious best practices
which is a little website that is a
portable coding standards document for
your organization if you're interested
and I'm gonna dependent contractor now
working for anyone in particular at the
moment so according to Wikipedia static
analysis is defined as the analysis of
computer software that is performed
without actually executing programs
today we're gonna be focusing on source
code analysis there are tools that do
object code analysis and we're gonna be
focusing on tools that are freely
available and specifically bringing up
issues that I've seen in the wild and
addressing whether or not static
analysis tools that are out there can
find them also if you consider that
static analysis is the analysis of
programs without executing them that
includes compiler warnings and some
modern compiler warnings are extremely
sophisticated for example with GCC if
you pass the incorrect parameter to a
printf format string you get a warning
without even enabling any warning levels
just using the default wearing levels on
GCC so we're only going to mention
compiler warnings if they are unique
tools that we're gonna be talking about
CVP check which is an open source static
analyzer that's free claims analysis
tools visual studios analyzer which is
built into the visual studio compiler
cover D scan which really
doesn't quite fall into the category of
the other three but it is free if you
have an open-source project and we're
gonna make some mention of metrics + +
which generates metrics about your code
and copy and paste detectors we're only
gonna be scratching the surface this
morning we've only got 30 minutes and
there are many many tools and many many
checks out there so we're only gonna
talk maybe about 10 different test cases
of the potentially 650 that we could
cache with the tools that we're
discussing that doesn't even count cover
these set of checks so this is an
interactive session what is wrong with
this code yes side-effects and assert
exactly right so in a release build that
do something is going to be removed and
depending on your compiler you might get
a warning and a release build telling
you that I is initialized but never used
but that's the only clue that you have
that something's gone wrong but if we
actually use AI then we no longer get a
warning interestingly of the tools that
I tested none of them complained about
this code even though clang and CPU
check and both explicitly say that they
are supposed to catch assert statements
that have side effects so I don't know
if it was just too simple of an example
and again an underneath the radar what
do we see here
uni a lot answers whatever it's always
returning true the f-block
is completely pointless this is related
to real code that I've found in my
system after a couple refactorings it's
simplified but it happens and what about
this one same basic idea the nested if
block is is returning the same value so
but it's still a slightly different
issue when it comes to static analysis
excuse me so CVP check caught the the
first case and I'm rather confused by
the fact that cover D did not catch the
second case because the entire reason I
have this example is because cover D
caught this particular test case and try
script so I I still need to I still need
to actually clean up this code and try
script because I wasn't positive maybe
my second call - very cool actually had
some side effect or something I need to
analyze that all right X example anyone
know that's an L sorry it's just a UH
maybe a poor fine yes that's that's true
that's something we'll get back to in a
minute actually so what size is unsigned
on most platforms 32-bit right and what
size is size T being returned from a
vector size on 64 so we are only
iterating over the first four billion
objects and similarly we are comparing
long here so we fixed the issue now
where is 64 bit but it's assigned long
so we're on the iterating over
potentially approximately two to the 63
elements instead of two to the 64
elements and let's keep compounding the
issue now we've got both of the problems
here it's 32-bit signed integer that
we're comparing against a 64-bit
unsigned we've limited ourselves now to
approximately 2 billion objects so you
already answered this question what else
do we have odd here the vector is empty
which is interesting to point out
anything else that's wrong with this
code that someone might suggest
modifying go ahead well that's true but
the compiler can probably optimize out
the call to size many times maybe but in
a more general sense how might we make
this code better ranged for loop exactly
so clang in Visual Studio weren't about
science comparisons
no one is warning that we're comparing a
32-bit to a 64-bit integer and as a
bonus cpp check actually does a deep
enough analysis of the code to tell us
that we're iterating over an empty
vector which i thought was really
interesting and if anyone has used
klingon modernize you'll know that
clangs modernize analysis steps can
actually identify that that should have
been arranged based for a loop and the
whole problem would have gone away why
does this matter has anyone seen this
article by any chance
it's from Google's research people they
published this blog posting in 2006 so
nine years ago now it's extra extra read
all about it nearly all binary search
algorithms are broken so this particular
snippet of C++ basically doesn't give
you any warnings on most compilers
unless on clang you turn all the way up
to a - w everything or and static
analysis tools but it is making all
kinds of mistakes we are truncating
values all over the place we are only
iterating over at most the first four
billion objects and this starts to
matter and real code today with large
data sets all right this one the title
might give it away but
what do we have here throw at the end
has never had unreachable original
studio warns about that in the ie de
which I thought was pretty cute nothing
else does playing again you have turned
up to W everything excuse me
and as a bonus cover D I'll put back to
that tells us that oh by the way in your
main function you're calling this
function called go that has a really
good chance of throwing an exception and
you're not doing anything about it
part of me says we're not Java
programmers we don't feel like we need
to catch every single exception that
comes but it's it's handy alright some
guineas obviously dereferencing a null
pointer and assigning to it what about
this one
same exact issue may be slightly less
obvious by for just doing a cursory read
of the code though we would read it as
humans what about here
same thing default constructing a shared
pointer and I don't know if the the c++
and guidelines that were just published
this week would actually directly
address this or not because it's a
default constructed shared pointer so it
has a null value so none of the tools
warned about it because you don't have
to initialize something that's got a
constructor and but here we are
assigning it to a a null value so every
tool caught the obvious case of directly
assigning to a null pointer only CPP
check could catch the indirect in all
reference and no tools caught the small
smart pointer version
what do we got here right by the end
beyond the end of the range we all about
that and what about here it's exactly
the same thing but now we're doing it
smart and C++ 11 instead so C style
arrays caught by all the tools stood
array actually I was kind of impressed
CBP Jakarta and Visual Studio notices
the C style array is being used
uninitialized which is handy all right
now we're getting into something a
little bit more complex
perhaps I'll wait for someone to answer
this one right so at the time that F is
called on the very last line there that
some value that was captured by
reference no longer exists okay nowhere
longer catching it by reference what
else what we might be doing wrong here
yes uninitialized value and let's
compound it let's capture an
uninitialized value by reference it's
interesting to see where the static
analysis falls down everyone likes to
complain about this code where we are
using some value uninitialized but if
you throw the capture by reference in on
this slide so we're capturing an
uninitialized value by reference we've
now confused every single tool that
exists you captured by reference they
won't tell you that it's uninitialized
anymore and visual studio caught nothing
and I've talked to other people in the
conference today this captured something
on the stack by reference accidentally
in return it is a
no problem but as far as I know no tool
can catch it yet this is another one of
my favorites because this seriously
broke some of my real code used after
move so he said yes so we are passing
the object o to this function take that
takes our value reference we're moving
it in and take isn't actually taking it
but that's not really the point ever I
would think this is something that
something could catch and real code that
I had that was doing this it operated
fine with absolutely no problems no
crashes on anything on every platform
except for my claim to build so GCC on
Linux was just fine clang on Linux which
I was moving a string or something out I
would get a crash and it took me quite a
while to figure out what I was doing
wrong go ahead Hey that's true in this
case and it yes STD move doesn't
actually do anything as I think Scott
Myers put it move doesn't move something
like that
all it is is doing is casting it to an
r-value reference and the r-value
references then you're being passed in
to take yes but I would say it's almost
guaranteed that if you wrote code like
this it's not what you meant to do right
go ahead
the move does not if technically in this
code for this for the object actually be
invalidated all right so so move cast to
an r-value reference and then the
r-value reference is being passed into
the function take it would be up to this
function take to like literally like do
a move construction or something and
actually take the value out I'm not
expecting any of the tools that I was
looking at to do enough program flow
analysis to actually determine that it
was actually being invalidated I'm just
looking for a tool to say hey dummy
you're using an object immediately after
moving it that's probably not what you
meant to do yes okay so the for the sake
of the video the assert a ssin is that
shared pointer is in a known valid state
after it's been moved from is that
correct
our unique pointer sorry that is correct
okay I'm getting other nods I thought
most of the standard libraries so that
the state was unknown after an object
had been moved from like string and that
kind of thing but I there's special
language for unique pointer okay I
accept that and did not know it what's
that
in haha what caused the actual crash in
my code that so this is an obviously a
simplified example I would have to go
back to my more complete example to
remember I'm sorry I want to think I was
I believe I was moving the values out of
a vector and then trying to work on the
vector after that oh right so as a bonus
CVV check I'll flip back points out to
us that oh by the way do something could
be a static member because it's not
actually touching any object data that's
kind of handy it calls it and an
optimization announcement or something
like that like poor performance kind of
code thing I guess the compiler maybe
can better optimize static members I
don't know enough about compiler
optimization all right let's see who is
paying attention at herbs talk yesterday
I am using hitter raters from three
different vectors and insert come Bertie
catches that no one else does and again
right P is dangling after I reassign s
by making the new shared pointer and no
one no one cares so this is definitely
some things where where I'm hoping will
get much better analysis with the
discussions from the last couple of days
with the C++ guidelines alright now to
talk about some of my honorable mention
tools metrics plus plus can give you far
more metrics about your code than you
could ever possibly need to know but it
can actually be very interesting it can
tell you things like do you have any
blocks of code that have really deep
nested if blocks and too many tabs in a
level and whatever so this is an actual
real snippet of code from chai Script
where I'm doing a runtime check of the
arithmetic type that has been passed in
when I'm getting ready to do some
arithmetic operations and metrics plus
plus and it's cyclomatic complexity
analysis tells me this is a really
complicated block of code maybe you
should consider refactoring it and this
is this was a simple example that was
easy to to put on one screen here
similarly the copy-paste detectors this
is from the PMD project which does a
bunch of it does code static code
analysis on a bunch of languages none of
them are C++ but it has a sub project
called the copy-paste detector and it
can do analysis of your code and tell
you where you've done copy and paste
programming so it found this for me
which is my character escape sequence
parsing and try script that exists
verbatim in two different parts of the
library and I'd still need to clean that
one up it just hasn't gotten a high
enough priority yet so downside of using
static analysis
this code generates a warning on two
different tools it's one of my favorites
to pick on can anyone make a guess as to
what it might be warning at here yes yes
it is well it is warning specifically on
the first line of the add values
declaration very attic template
declaration yes very good it warns that
value isn't used because in this
specific example we're calling add
values with one argument so the very
attic template add values it takes one
argument of value followed by zero or
more arguments in the zeroth case the
parameter expansion on the return
statement which is doing the initializer
for the standard vector is not actually
ever being called it's being expanded
zero times and so the compiler warnings
set oh by the way value is not used i
find this terribly annoying personally
because it is used i just happened to be
exercising it in the zero of case in
this place so if you have a template
metaprogramming stuff throughout your
library and you have this then you will
get warnings from visual studio
specifically which i know the visual
studio team is aware of this particular
issue and i just realized that if you
turn the warnings all the way up i think
on clang then you can convince it to
warn also alright so guess I need to
start wrapping this up false sense of
security I would say as a downside to
using the static analysis tools try
script passed all of these static
analyzers and all warning levels on all
compilers practically speaking with no
warnings at all I'm like yes clearly my
code is perfect and then I learned about
the sanitizers provided by clang and
other tools and I found a bunch more
bugs and then I learned about fuzzy
testing while that was any doing an
interview for CV cast and let that run I
think I let it run for nearly three
weeks on chie script and I found
something like 15 more crashes in my
code and some of them were scary like
potential like security flaws in the
code so yes use the static analyzers but
don't assume just because you're passing
them all that your code is perfect so as
a quick real-world example in this code
the one of the static analyzers told me
that this is you know it's snipped out
but the static analyzer was telling me
that read value was read that was being
assigned a value that was never being
used without being reassigned later so
did a little cleanup and now the flow
that makes more sense I'm not having to
assign the boolean multiple times
whatever a conclusion it was mine it's
been my conclusion looking at these and
if you look at the list of specific
issues that static static analyzers
catch see style issues basically come
across like a solved problem they have
been linters and static analyzers have
been looking for C issues for a very
very long time but there are still many
ways that we can abuse our best
practices and specifically and see
what's plus the love and related issues
we've got a long way to go and something
that I like to mention always is you
need to be in a situation where you can
use as many compilers and analyze as you
can to make sure your codes as good as
you can
cross-platform code whatever it takes
hopefully the C++ core guidelines will
of steering us in a direction where we
can catch even more of these issues so
for my personal recommendations whatever
compiler you're on if you don't have the
ability to integrate static analyzers
specifically under your tools make sure
you've got your warning level set as
high as you can consider enabling
warnings has errors for your compiler so
with clang more than everything you're
gonna have to disable some things
because if you can put clang in C++ see
love in a mode
and then turn on W everything and it'll
warn you that you have code that is not
compatible C++ 98 yes so you're gonna
have to disable a couple things and yes
so I would strongly suggest when you're
automated build environment turning on
visual studios analyzer if using Visual
Studio and we've all got other issues
that we've seen consider writing your
own analysis using Lib clang there's a
few examples out there people using the
Python bindings to Lib clang for doing
code analysis it looks like it's pretty
straightforward to do there's one
particular check CNCC I believe is the
name of the tool it's written in Python
and it will analyze your code to make
sure that you're following your own
internal naming conventions for instance
like now that these things are available
to us let's start using them and also
all the examples on here plus a bunch
more I threw into a repository called
that I called my analysis test suite
it's bad this point basically a
repository of how to not write C++ code
while still letting the compiler give
you no warnings so contribute if you
have got any uh
got any ideas there and again this is
who I am
come check out the open session tomorrow
morning on try script and I'm an
independent contractor always looking to
meet new clients if anyone's interest
and talking to me thanks
any questions
yes yes
CVP check will so the question was
whether or not and code with with lots
of false positives if you can disable
them CPP check specifically if you find
that you have one particular false
positive that's throughout the code base
you can disable that particular warning
at the top level or you can also enable
a flag that lets you selectively disable
analysis warnings around particular
blocks of code I've personally found in
my own code that stuff that I thought
was false positives it ended up often
not really being a false positive so at
this point I have only but oh I mean my
my code base isn't gigantic but I've got
maybe six places throughout the whole
code base where I'm selectively
disabling warnings from different
compilers in different analyzers
anything else yes see ya kaveri t even
on my toy examples using the free
Coverity scan reset it takes like 30
minutes before I get a response back
from Coverity scan I don't know if
that's simply because they just have the
open source stuff on a slow server or
what I've never used the the commercial
tool but CBP check will only will exceed
a new cpp check will let you pass a
number of jobs to it that you want to
run so that you can actually run it in
parallel across your codebase you can
even on very large code bases it's
slower than it's faster than our build
so if you can run it in parallel with a
check in with your build then you should
be good and clangs start excuse me
Visual Studio static analyzer I believe
is much faster and Visual Studio 2015 so
that should be something that we can
start
seriously embalm and implementing in our
continuous build environments and I'm
out of time now thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
