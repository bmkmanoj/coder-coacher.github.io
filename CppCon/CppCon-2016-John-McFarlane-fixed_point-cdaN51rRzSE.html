fixed-point library is something that
I've been working on with the aim of
having fixed point pneumix fixed point
arithmetic standardized and I'm gonna
I'm going to assume a certain sort of
level of knowledge about about the
subject matter and hopefully if you
don't know what fixed point is does
anybody not know what fixed point
arithmetic is okay well I'll typically
use the example of a 16-bit number the
notation there u88 is is one of many
arbitrary different notations used to
describe fixed point types and the the
illustration here shows that they're
unsigned eight eight fixed point type
has eight integer digits and then eight
fractional digits it's it's stored in a
in a short value and I'm signed 16-bit
value under the hood
however it's used to represent numbers
that are real that have a fractional
component okay okay so the reason for
fixed point if you were in the the SG
fourteen talked earlier you will
recognize the graphic in there in the
middle yeah these these are examples of
these illustrate what happens when you
use a fixed point to show a floating
point to represent numbers on the left
there you see a distribution of the
different values that a simple floating
point type can represent and as you see
it's there's a lot of detail at the at
the origin but as numbers increase you
have lower granularity and you have
trouble representing values to to the
same degree of accuracy so typically
with when you're representing space or a
2d coordinates on a map particularly in
simulations
you will see the in the center there you
um you have a lot of detail near the
center of of the map but as you head out
toward away from the origin wherever
you've chosen for your origin you you
start to hit some often serious problems
because the the gaps between each each
position in the next growing your your
accuracy is being reduced and a
celebrated example of that is in a
popular game called minecraft and in
we're seeing here four totally different
areas of a map generated in Minecraft
and it's showing how the the procedural
generation of this map has gone really
badly wrong far away from the origin at
the top you have a part of the map
that's near the origin and it looks
beautiful that we have some coastline
and some some forest areas there but
issue you had you know far and along the
x axis or the y axis or longitude or
latitude eventually you get artifacts
you get the the model breaks down and so
here you just get very nothing's
nothing's working because floating point
has these limitations and so that's one
of the one of the primary incentives for
me to to work on standardizing fixed
point to so that we can use that as an
alternative to floating point to
represent real numbers in a convenient
way but there are a number of other
advantages that the fixed point has in
particular the amount of silicon
necessary to to represent a fixed point
it's pretty much what you the same
requirements you'd use for for integer
or as floating point is a fair bit more
complex particularly if you want it to
be ie seven five four standard okay all
right so this is a really just just
imagine this is my first attempt at
fixed point what you see here is kind of
a typical approach to fixed point using
sort of quite low level
language constructs it's almost even the
context were there kind of gives away
the fact that it that it is not and so
it with our example where we have this
u88 fix point type we want to converting
between the fixed point type and the
floating point is just a matter of
scaling by the necessary amount because
there are 8 bits devoted to fraction it
means that the whole number is represent
it's representing a value 256 times
smaller than the actual integer that's
storing it and say you see there when
you you from float to to to this fixed
point format it's just a matter of
scaling up you can use a bit shift
operator if you want but that it's not
necessary and in fact when I talk about
fixed point I'm really talking about
binary fixed point but indeed you can
have decimal fixed point or hexadecimal
fixed point it's merely the case that
most interest is with binary fixed point
because binary is what machines use to
begin with and there is actually a quite
a bit of interest in representing
decimal fixed point particularly in the
financial sector where they they want to
represent monetary values with with sort
of precision characteristics that you
don't necessarily get with floating
point numbers okay so the we have the
conversion here takes you from from
fixed back to float and then we have
some arithmetic here we have added
multiply pretty necessary operations and
one of the really nice things about
fixed point numbers is that when you add
two fixed point numbers of the same type
together you just have to add them and
the result is already totally correct
just as if you'd added those integers
together however multiply is a whole
different kettle of fish and already
things are getting a little more
complicated here when you multiply two
fixed point values together where they
both have eight fractional digits to
begin with they they now have
sixteen fractional digits and that that
so in order to convert back to type with
only eight fractional digits we here we
have to divide by 256 and so right here
this is where things start to get
complicated and where it might be nice
if we could automate a lot of the the
work involved in representing fixed
point values in this way to avoid
various pitfalls and so speaking of
pitfalls given what you just saw on that
last slide there are hopefully if you're
you know you are presumably C++
programmers and you you probably were
thinking straight away well there
there's some ways I could do this better
and there's a whole bunch of reasons why
the the traditional handwoven in fixed
point arithmetic is is not satisfactory
in particular so if you if you forget
that your whether your value is the the
an actual you're just using is an
integer or whether it's one of these
implicitly scaled fixed point values if
you just forget that for one line you
your value you your math is off by a you
know a factor of two or more and also
there's many I've given the example and
I'll continue to give the example of
this unsigned eight eight type it's a
16-bit type but really any any number of
integer and fractional digits are
possible there's no reason to to limit
fixed point to any particular type and
with the multiply straight away it would
be really nice if we had something we
could where we could overload the
arithmetic operations and then there's a
whole bunch of problems that I found
getting feedback from from this work to
do with so overflow safety it's quite
easy to you know multiply it by two
bigger number and suddenly you
you know overflow or wraparound
undefined behavior and also there are a
bunch of ways in which the the results
are losing information particularly for
instance if you convert from a
floating-point value to a fixed point
value and and the floating point value
is a high precision you're going to lose
some of that information and the way
that rounding happens is is designed for
speed it's not designed for accuracy so
you don't get round to nearest behavior
that you you might want if you wanted
the most accuracy possible and so
there's there's all these problems that
people identify with fixed point and the
more that I've looked at this this
library designed this solution but the
more that I've still realized that most
of them are common to integer as well
and this has got me thinking about
really what what people's expectations
are of a fixed point and what a solution
really should be providing so really
most of this stuff it's it's common to
integers and another thing that it's
kind of obvious but it's become very
apparent as I've gone on is that
integers are fixed point numbers they
just they're just you know you 16 0 or
whatever they there's no there they're
fixed point numbers with no fractional
digits and that's that's that's all
there is to them so basically we are
already in from see we've inherited
fixed point numbers but but it have an
incredibly limited range so as a my
current sort of pursuit the the current
argument I'm trying to make is I as mine
and other proposals are trying to
progress towards standardization I'm I'm
of the opinion that a fixed point is
just one of a bunch of problems that we
want to solve
and the best way to go about solving
these problems is each and isolation so
fixed-point really all it should really
be doing is approximating real numbers
using integers by scaling them by a
fixed amount and should not worry about
all these other things such as rounding
and undefined behavior and overflow
these kinds of things and so I'm sort of
come to the opinion that not just a
fixed point but a bunch of other types
should be defined
they should be literal class templates
and this does everyone know what I mean
by a literal class template it's a type
typically has liberal use of context
particularly in its constructors and it
can be used in places where
traditionally integers and built-in
types would be used and they're
incredibly useful powerful types
okay so I'll present some of there is
some examples of some of the types that
I think it would be worth pursuing and
trying to to provide for users and so
let's go through these so I checked
integer this is don't worry about the
names this is this is a any like a a
type basically that uh it checks whether
overflow has occurred and maybe throws
an exception or terminates the program
with an error or somehow communicates to
the program that an error has occurred
and the value stored in in that
particular variable is no longer should
not be used so a widening integer it
deals with the same problem this is an
interesting distinction there's this
seems two distinct ways to deal with
overflow one is to throw an error but
try and maintain types of the same width
and then another contrasting very
interesting strategy is to
make sure that the result is always wide
enough to contain the result of whatever
operation is going on so we you saw an
example of fixed-point multiplication
earlier on and you find with with fixed
point and indeed with with any integers
that you get back a result that's twice
the width of whatever went in so if you
multiply two 16-bit values together you
need 32 bits and if you get if the
result is a 32-bit integer you're
guaranteed that you will not get
overflow and that's a pretty powerful
guarantee to provide because normally
people just expect that they've got to
be very careful that the the integers
that they use have the capacity
necessary to perform the operations that
they want but it is a notoriously
problematic thank you
situation and CM c++ have come under a
lot of criticism recently for having
many ways for errors to be introduced
into programs
okay so rounding rounded integers now
again this may or may not be something
that is best represented as a type but
imagine a an integer type which instead
of using the same rounding rules that
are built in int or short or long use
imagine that it rounded to nearest
rather than truncating the fractional
part of a value it rounded to the
nearest whole number you you find that a
lot of error is reduced with that kind
of behavior also when you when you
divide integers or when you use shift
you don't necessarily again get the the
sort of rounding behaviour that you want
and it's not even consistent how how
this happens sometimes the operation
will cause truncation of the fractional
part and other times the the number is
rounded towards negative infinity and
this is often is it's not a huge deal
but
if you want as much accuracy as possible
without having to think about it too
much
it would be very desirable for for there
to be a type that actually like an
integer but rounded in a way that was a
bit more if you like mathematically
mathematically correct and okay so
finally fixed point this is a a type
which it's kind of like an integer but
it also has a fractional part and it
there is so you know there's a desire to
have all of the properties of all these
four types bundled together into some
super type which solves these and
possibly other problems and I am I am if
the opinion that it's probably better if
they're broken broken up decomposed into
different problems and the only question
really is is this possible in a way that
is performant and that a is zero cost
basically and that's a really important
thing I think okay so introducing the
fixed point type well it's a class
template you can see a so there's I have
a paper that goes into detail on this
type and and by the way this is
continually evolving the the
specification of this thing so do do
come back I'm planning to to update it
quite soon so if so let's just jump to
the the usage here say you want a we're
going to take our finally take our
16-bit fixed point type and we're going
to turn it into this literal class it's
the power of two there's there's a lot
of desire to to have other bases and
I've kind of yeah I'm skipping over that
for this talk but
certainly we could have power of 10
maybe a third parameter or a different
template but typically people are
expecting a power of two a binary fixed
point type and actually this exponent is
it's pretty much the same value that you
would find in a floating point number
there are in a 32-bit floating point
number there are typically seven bits of
exponent and there there's some quirks -
well there's many many quirks to the
floating point the standard floating
point type but essentially they have an
exponent like this which which says how
many bits to to shift the value in order
to to shift the integer the mantissa bit
in order to get the value that you're
actually looking for yes so here because
we want we want to represent values that
are a kind of eight 8-bit shifted down
there they're 256 times smaller than the
the integer that is holding them that's
why we have the negative eight here to
say that that's that's the value to
shift down by in order to get there get
the real value out and now we can even
even though this is a little a little on
winded we can now you know here we have
an alias to that that type so just a
little aside here I've mentioned
multiply multiplication before and it's
there's this quite an interesting
problem involved in in in how to how to
perform arithmetic as I mentioned if you
add two to values together and they're
the same fixed point type it's it's it's
a matter of just adding the integers
together and that's really great that's
that's nice and easy but once you get to
multiplication and I'm not even going to
get on to division but multiplication
has has some problems because you you
need double the width in order to
preserve all the bits from from in the
result and typically with integers say
you've got to you've multiplied two
32-bit integers together on a machine
which is a 32-bits and the value
overflows well it just gets truncated
and people kind of they know about this
and it's it's something that we live
with for better or worse however if
you're using a 32-bit integer to
represent a number in the range 0 to 1
for instance you and you try to truncate
the the higher bits of a value after
you've multiplied multiply two of these
together you are it's catastrophic
it's just it won't fly and so there is a
conflict here about what is the best
thing to do what's the best strategy for
multiply multiplying and dividing
fixed-point numbers and it's it is a
really interesting thorny problem and
there's there's no super simple solution
that's completely satisfactory to
everybody but a down here so widen
that's that's the the approach I'm
starting to to head towards I think I
think it's just inevitable that you the
people will expect all the all the
precision to be preserved when when when
these arithmetic operations are
performed and actually that's not all
that different to what happens when you
before Myra thematic with integer types
currently what happens typically
promotion occurs and you you find
yourself with a result that is the size
of an integer no matter how how wide the
the inputs were so take take for example
you multiply 2 char values together you
know 100 times 100 if they're signed
chars that you you would have caused
overflow but always multiplying to
charles together the result that the
Charak promoted to integer full 32-bit
integers and then those those values are
multiplied together and that's people
often don't realize that that's that's
what's happening all the time because it
is it typically fixes a lot of problems
before they occur but they're problems
that can't really be avoided with with
fixed point because like I say you might
be
your your farm allow you to be using the
full 32 bits of your your machine
register to store the value you're not
just multiplying one hundred and one
hundred and it's great because it's it
fits within 2 billion that's that
there's no longer the case and yeah this
is a quite a challenging problem to
overcome so I'm going to show you some
of the the things that are that I'm
trying to get done with this fixed point
type and I'm going to rattle through
these you can find these incidentally if
you go to the the github page that I
mentioned at the top there is these and
many other examples are available to try
and give you an idea of how these types
behave so here this is some basic
arithmetic going on I've I've declared a
type there's a declared a variable it's
an 8-bit unsigned fixed point type and
it's got four integer an for fractional
digits and by the way any feedback on
this if you think that negative four is
and a counterintuitive way to say that
there are four fractional digits that's
certainly something that's come up
before and I'd be interested to hear
what people think about this but um this
this value here completely saturates
that that eight eight bits there that's
that that's going to be represented by
250 the value 255 inside the inside this
class and so this object so what happens
next well we in in a really naive
example we multiply this value well we
square this value and assign it right
back to to the original type and
overflow is going to occur here we're
going to lose a an awful lot of
information we're going to lop off four
high and four low bits and this is where
this is where you start to miss floating
point and realize just how useful
floating just how idiot-proof floating
point is it is floating point is great
by the way if
if you're happy with it don't
necessarily consider using fixed-point
ever with C with C++ with C++ 11 makes
it at least feasible if if you need
fixed point it's not going to be a
complete nightmare to come up with a an
API that is that is usable and gets you
this what you expect and and here
straight away the the auto keyword is is
very very handy here when we multiply
these these values together we're gonna
it's not returning the same type that
went in it's it's producing a value it's
producing a type a result in a type
that's wide enough to store the result
and it's it's guaranteed that it's going
to be wide enough which is which is a
pretty powerful thing and so here
there's no overflow there's no error and
yeah it's all good news I've also
provided some named functions multiplied
here is it does a similar thing however
they're widening is is a lot less
aggressive with multiplies so it just
uses whatever the the underlying
promotion rules are for the the type
that you used so up here we said hey
user unsigned int a this is just this is
a standard integer type it basically
means I'm sorry char on most systems and
so you know right away this oops this
value will be it's going to be unsigned
it's going to be 8-bit and you can have
some pretty you can already know some
make some assumptions about the the work
that's going to be done under the hood
and I feel like this is quite a valuable
straightaway it's a valuable way to to
to ask for a particular fixed point type
so I said we're going to break down all
these different problems into different
literal types and then combine them
together
is a rather extreme example of a so I
don't know who's heard of the boost
multi precision library but it's a
library that provides you with integer
types of pretty much unlimited capacity
and in in this case I'm using a helper
type here make you fixed it's a little
bit like you know make make a pair or
make tuple but in this case it makes an
understand fixed point value and it's
this particular type that it's going to
provide has its four hundred integer
bits and four hundred fractional bits
now this type here you'll notice it's
only a 128-bit type but what I'm saying
with this type is use this as the I call
this the archetype so basically take a
type like this widen it as necessary in
order to come up with the type which can
store numbers with this many digits in
it so what you get back is a this type
big number is is now a fixed point type
with 800 digits in it and the beauty of
this is I'm harnessing boost multi
precision and getting do all the work of
storing absurdly large numbers and then
I'm just treating like any other
built-in int and I can I can I can use
it to make a goal which is a value which
is tend to array to the 100 and I can I
can in I can inverse that invert that
googlers yeah I can invert it here and I
now have I don't know if there's a word
for a like a 1 / a Google Google Google
yes there you go yeah and I there was
relatively little plumbing necessary to
to adapt boost mouse precision to work
to work with fixed point and there's no
need to stop there I've I've been
working on a type called elastic integer
which it would be there
the second of those four categories
where you take em you say hey give me a
6 bit integer as the underlying is the
archetypal representational type I
wanted to use int 8 to store this this
value 63 and then when I square my
lastic integer type what I get back is
something that will widen by the correct
number of bits so stay down here I add
these two values together okay thanks
and and it's grown by one bit because
when you add to two integers together
you need one extra bit bit of precision
and this value when combined with with
the elastic with with fixed point gets
you real numbers that grow as needed
pretty much up to up to whatever limit
is provided by the elastic integer and
in this way just to sum up you can you
can keep going with this kind of
composition of types and it's sort of
tackle a lot of these problems I've only
just got started coming up with
different types that that do these
things and another another one is
Robert's safe safe a numeric library
which as I mentioned earlier you can you
can catch overflow and infer an
exception and I've started incorporating
that into fixed point as well so that
you have much safer values and at that
point I need to hand over to to Robert
and do you want to get set up okay so it
might be a good time to take questions
particularly about a fixed point if
anyone's curious yes oh good question
that the question is what is the what is
a positive exponent represent there's
there's no reason not to have a positive
exponent and when you do you get a
number that is larger than the the
integer storing it rather than smaller
so for instance say I had an exponent
with positive 10 I could use that to
represent kilobytes and so a value of 1
would represent 1 kilobyte now they
would I would be losing precision I
couldn't represent individual bits
another example if exponent was set to
positive 1 then I could only represent
even numbers does that make sense it
said that there is no reason to just
fixate on the fractional you can have a
negative number of fractional digits in
a fixed point number it's it's not used
that often usually they are used to
represent fractions but in no way is
that necessary at all ok great thanks
yes that's correct well so it's a little
bit detail that I haven't really got
into but there is I define a type called
set with and you can it's it's like a
template type and one of the arguments
is the the value which you wish to widen
another argument is the number of bits
you wish to widen it to and you can get
a widened value out as a result and so
yes it takes it takes a the end 128
there and the value 800 and produces its
result
yeah it's a struct with a member type
which has the like the widened value in
it and unfortunately you need to
specialize that for the the types that
you're going to use with a fixed point
that's that's one of the necessary bits
of plumbing to get that to work I I have
done some work towards this I can with
with with homes are compartment is a
template parameter and get back a time
it's big enough to store that but I
would really like to take a look at
user-defined literals and see just what
I whether I can take extract from the
from a string maybe or a number whether
I can extract from that template
parameters for the fixed point type yeah
I mean basically what boost Hana does
I've got to look into how Louie does
that and trying to figure that out yeah
yeah yeah that's so that's one the best
on the backlog of many many many tasks
involved related to this oh good
question that the question is what is
the what is a positive exponent
represent there's there's no reason not
to have a positive exponent and when you
do you get a number that is larger than
the the integer storing it rather than
smaller so for instance say I had an
exponent with positive 10 I could use
that to represent kilobytes and so a
value of 1 would represent 1 kilobyte
now they would I would be losing
precision I couldn't represent
individual
it's another example if exponent was set
to positive one then I could only
represent even numbers does that make
sense say that there is no reason to
just fixate on the fractional you can
have a negative number of fractional
digits in a fixed point number it's it's
not used that often usually they are
used to represent fractions but in no
way is that necessary at all okay
great thanks yes that's correct
well so it's a little bit detail that I
haven't really got into but there is a I
define a type called set width and you
can it's like a template type and one of
the arguments is the the value which you
wish to widen another argument is the
number of bits you wish to widen it to
and you can get a widened value out as a
result and so yes it takes it takes a
the end 128 there and the value 800 and
produces its result it yeah it's a
struct with a member type which has the
like that was the widened value in it
and unfortunately you need to specialize
that for the types that you're going to
use with a fixed point that's that's one
of the necessary bits of plumbing to get
that to work
yes I have done some work towards this I
can with with with homes our compartment
is a template parameter and get back a
type there's big enough to store that
but I would really like to take a look
at user-defined literals and see just
what I whether I can take extract from
there from a string maybe or a number
whether I can extract from that template
parameters for the fixed point type yeah
I mean basically what boost Hana does
I've got to look into how Louie does
that and trying to figure that out yeah
yeah yeah that's so that's on the but
that's on the backlog of many many many
tasks involved related to this yes yes
sorry I've already overrun by yes no no
I'm yeah I mean by by all means get get
going with the the AV yeah okay all
right were there any other questions
anything else yes correct
the question was am i stalling for time
yes
I feel like Robert would be the best
person to ask about that because he
keeps them reminding me that I'm not I'm
not really stipulating what types are
valid is the rep type for instance and I
really need to start making it clear
that I can't just pass a I stood
stringing as the is the rep type that's
just not going to work I haven't really
looked into what might be useful with
with concepts either you know formal
concepts or they're just sort of the
right but certainly it would make it
clear what types are and are not
suitable for use for instance I mean I
think there's there's a whole bunch of
different operators if if your rep type
doesn't have plus operator plus then you
you can't add fixed-point that uses it
for instance a bitonic here it's on a
per case basis largely but a being being
copyable is probably just yes okay the
question is what do I think of the UNAM
type that's the one where the I believe
the the type itself is actually actually
variable sized is that right was
straightaway I mean that's a that's a
whole another that's a whole nother
ballgame really I mean having having
something that's variable size like that
it is quite I'd imagine it's quite
difficult to to actually work with it
when it's in machine registers it's
particularly great for representing
numbers serializing them and in in an
efficient manner but for performing
arithmetic I'm not I'm not sure if it's
as practical but certainly converting
two and two from you know man fixed
point would would probably be something
like so there would be useful to anybody
using you know I think
but that's as far as I look to that yeah
okay okay but this will probably be the
last question well I don't know you can
take your time with the ring there we go
okay correct yes for things where
there's a prompter that's the archetype
this design dictates the signage and
also the rep type of fixed point if the
signage they're also obviously
determines the signage in that way it's
it's hopefully it's a it's a good way to
convey in a familiar way roughly what
the capabilities are of the fixed point
or or elastic type that you're going to
to to use is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
