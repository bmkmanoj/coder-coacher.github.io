cute KDE guy at this conference also my
first one very excited so far and i have
many hats on in my free time I
contribute a lot to KDE big open source
project using cute I maintain the K
develop an ID if any one of you uses
dead please drop by tell me what you
think about that I work at kdub
consultancy company in the cute
ecosphere and C++ in general but yet
today I wanted to talk about keep track
um here are few uses massive or has used
massive for heap profiling so few of
human I hope you have used my
visualization tool to actually interpret
the results there um I did that tool
five years ago so to actually figure out
where your memory is being used in your
application very useful got super good
feedback about the visualization part
there but I had a big issue with it it's
super slow especially because valgrind
synchronizes parallel code it easily
leads to overhead of 100-plus or
something like a hundred times that or
something like that or even more and I
always thought isn't it shouldn't it be
possible to get something faster and
while at it couldn't we collect more
data massive only gives you like okay
this function allocated this and that
amount of memory but it is is not able
to tell you wait a minute you actually
called this function while this location
100,000 times at this position or these
are actually all temporary allocations
maybe you want to get rid of that so I
thought about that for a long long time
and finally came up with the solution
called heap track it's the open source
tool you can get it on KDE get which is
nowadays also being mirrored on github
and you just run your application
through heap track and it doesn't think
it should be faster than massive um and
then you can visualize the results I
won't do the live coding here but if you
want to see it too
I hunt me down and help show it to you
the analysis part then it's pretty cool
as well I'm in the process of working on
the UI you can generate massive files
which you can then visualize the massive
visualize if you really want to but
that's not really fun because it takes a
long time to generate a very very
inefficient massive format so if you
want to use my keep track format
directly use keep check GUI and that
directly gives you the number of
allocations that have been done at a
given code point in the peak memory
allocation that resulted at this point
you get the number of leak bite so
essentially once you stop the process
what hasn't been freed and then you can
measure your throughput as well so
allocated is just a bytes allocated in
total ignoring any dia location anything
like that and this is all with stack
traces for every single allocation you
do and it's still faster than massive
the thing is I stand on the shoulders of
giants there and i'll get to that I did
not write the stag unwinder to do that
you can both have a bottom-up and
top-down view which is sometimes useful
more importantly you still have the same
visualization you know from massive
visualizer so these stacked bar charts
where the red one is the total amount of
memory being used and below that you see
the top allocating functions essentially
you can hover it and get a tooltip and i
will add all the interactive features as
well so you can jump to a call stake and
get more information out of it but as I
said keep track gives you more than just
a pure number of allocations right or
allocated bytes it also counts how many
allocations you have been doing here you
see these nice spikes were tons of
allocations in take place and this is
actually
the spell checker being used indicate
edit or that is very inefficient when it
comes to allocations and you also track
the throughput so again the first spike
here is the spell checker the second one
is Intel's graphics driver which
allocates a bunch of memory but it's
probably fine but if you want to check
that keep track gives you all the data
at your hands and also something that
I've been working on recently is adding
a so-called flame graph visualization
it's been invented by Brendan Greg very
smart guy in the performance area and
this one's really really neat the the
width of each bar here gives you the
cost so the wider something is the more
it's fence or here it's the number of
allocations of the more allocations of
triggers and this way you can easily
grasp the very complex call stack tree
and just find hot spots in your code
that you would not expect to be there so
I really invite you all to try it out
it's it's very useful thing one thing
that I haven't yet added to the heap
directly but I plan it's super simple to
do is getting histogram so in the sense
of what sizes has been have been
requested by your application and how
often and here this is a very sad bar
chart for me or histogram because this
is every typical cute application cute
uses its own cue string yeah string
class which is not small string
optimized and you see thousands upon
thousands I mean someone counted in
acute application acute community think
he said something like eighty percent or
sixty percent of the allocations that
acute application does normally our
strings below what five jars or six jars
or something like that it's it's silly
but that's the case you and keep track
again finds these things and can give
you all the data you need
then you can actually go in and maybe
fix it right and we do plan to fix this
for cute 6 by the way so how do i do it
I said already I'm standing on the
shoulders of giants um first thing first
is for linux only because this is what i
use to debug in profile and make things
faster a que de pie often have to work
on windows cute apps as well but because
it's cross cross platform I can just
compile the stuff on Linux make it
faster and it will automatically be
faster than Microsoft as well so um the
first trick data slin explicit specific
is the LD preload trick so you can just
inject arbitrary code into your
application before you started keep
track also allows you to run time
attached to application as running
something that massif is not able to do
because it cannot magically take
executable injected into the vm and then
run from there right but here i asked on
Stack Overflow for the magic to do and
someone showed me the elf code to do it
and it actually works which is pretty
cool so you can after 10 hours in check
to your application see who is
triggering this memory increase and then
visualize it later on it works it's
pretty cool lip unwind is what I'm using
to grab the back traces its amazing
library lots of arcane magic in there
and it's super super fast I mean I can
track millions of call stacks in seconds
and it's it doesn't have that much
overhead but if you try this out do
build live online from get because there
have been some performance optimizations
and most Linux distributions shape a
very old version of it and if I profile
heap trick itself I see some spots in
heaps in lip online which I hope to
optimize in the future as well then
there is lip back trace so unwind gives
me instruction pointers and lip back
trace I can then use to translate that
to yeah basically from the dwarf data to
get function names and line numbers and
files and stuff like
so again this is not my magic code this
is existing code that I thankfully can
use and then yeah the keep track GUI is
what you use to actually visualize the
stuff in stale installing heap track is
pretty simple check it out run the sea
make stuff what you would always do
don't forget to enable optimizations so
you should probably pass HD see make
build type equals r l will step in for
release because otherwise it's going to
be slow right now it's a profiler you
better install it with optimizations
enabled and so you have to wrap up the
good thing is it's it's very usable it's
often much faster especially on embedded
devices than massive you get tons of
data out of it much more than you would
advocate work from massive and it's also
the foundation for more tools in the
future I really plan to add features to
track the P threat API to measure lock
contention for example it should be
trivial now the bad thing is that my UI
part isn't finished yet there's some
things that I really want to fix
thankfully Cade up is now sponsoring me
and for a few days to work on that
full-time so over the next month's you
will see something there and I think
that more people should actually start
using it because it's very time useful
and I'll be a darkly part is again yeah
it's learning specific I saw someone
adding a VIN heaped record get up
without telling me he used some other
technique there to generate the same
file format that i use and then you can
use he trick we and get the same thing
here and yeah if you want to track stack
memory use massive i don't know any
other tool it does that thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
