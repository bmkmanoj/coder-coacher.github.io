Intel on microprocessor debug software
they debug technologies and I want to
talk to you a little bit about some neat
stuff you can do with the type system so
I'll motivate with an example for my
domain microprocessors have a lot of
different kinds of address internally
there's virtual addresses and linear
addresses and guest and host physical
addresses and DDR addresses and control
register addresses and there's a whole
plethora of these things so if I want to
model some aspects of what my processor
is doing in software I need to have
software that uses addresses well if I
have an interface that has a function
that takes an address this is a recipe
for confusion because I don't know here
what kind of address I'm talking about
and the same problem happens in numerous
other contexts if I have a size for
instance if I'm talking about the size
of a control register field the most
natural unit is bits but if I'm talking
about the size of some data structure in
memory then I want bytes and it isn't
obvious from just the API what kind of
thing I'm talking about in all of these
cases but it should be so what do we
commonly do to try to mitigate problems
like this well lots of people may put
the documentation about the intent in a
comment however people are like the
preprocessor and that they tend to just
ignore the comments that's not a very
good solution you can document what your
intent was in the parameter name if you
do this very consistently you wind up
with absent garyun which is fine but
what we're trying to provide here is
information about the kind of stuff
we're dealing with this is really
fundamentally type information it
belongs with the parameter type not with
the parameter name so you can say great
let's do a type def and this is good
this is better it puts the information
where it belongs
but type def SAR only good they're not
great we're nowhere near slice bread
it's good because you have a
semantically meaningful type name now it
communicates your intent and that was
the number one goal and it's easy to
make comprehensive type changes now it's
all in one place so if you want to
substitute your type out for something
else there's only one place you have to
edit and that's much better than doing a
search and replace all across your code
the problem of the type def is it's just
an alias it's not actually a new type so
your function which now you may have
declared you take al in a dirty will
accept any un 60-40 and you can't
overload it for different kinds of
address if you wanted different
functions for different kinds of address
you have to put the type name back in
the function name again and have totally
independent functions this is not what
we really want and unintentionally we
have some bad interoperability going on
here because all these addresses are
just integers you can do crazy things
like add them together when if you look
at the domain of these things a linear
address and a host physical address
these things should never meet you
shouldn't be able to add them it's an
error so there is an idea called an
opaque type def that is a separate type
based on an existing type but is not
simply an alias for that type it's been
proposed as a language feature for a
long time but we don't have it yet
and what I wanted to come here today to
talk about is that you don't need to
wait for it it turns out that you can
get most of the value probably 80% plus
of this language feature proposal from a
library implementation and I have done
one I want to tell you about it
so the basic notion here is I want to
take a variable of some type and I want
to wrap it up in a brand new type and
I'll mimic the interface from the
original type so I can use it like I
would have before but all in terms of
the new type because I want to avoid
implicit conversions and accidental
interoperability with other types so
here's an example using the library I'm
making a linear address type it's based
on a UN 6040 and I can get basically the
entire interface just through
inheritance and I also have to pull in
the constructor because my constructor
is explicit and I want to inherit that
but that's it it doesn't take very much
and now I have a new type that I cannot
accidentally can
Jews for the old type so pretty good
we're getting a little bit closer to
sliced bread it only costs a few lines
to create an America Pig type def and
now I have safer interfaces because
there's no implicit convertibility and I
can overload my functions based upon
this new type this becomes possible now
yay
pretty happy and I was also pleased that
the very first time I tried to do this I
found a bug in my software I had a piece
of code that was using the type def so I
could have easy change ability of my
types so I changed the type and I put
the opaque type death in and bam
compiler finds bug turns out I was
assigning to an integer of the wrong
width and this was crossing type
boundaries where I didn't intend to
something that had escaped compiler
warnings became a compile time error and
my code would no longer compile yippee
that's great but we can build on this as
a foundation for more for some really
neat stuff you don't need to adhere to
the interface of your original type you
can make changes if there are things
that don't make sense to do get rid of
them right you shouldn't be able to
multiply two addresses that doesn't make
sense so delete it and make it a
compiler error you can add
interoperability with other types and
deliberately so you can have exactly the
interactions that you want and not the
ones that you don't so if you have an
address or a family of address types and
you want to interoperate with an off set
you can do so and you can enforce the
semantics you want by controlling the
binary operators so you can make it an
error to add two addresses but you want
to be able to add an address and offset
either way it's commutative and those
should return address is not offsets on
the other side you don't want to
subtract two addresses and get an
address you really want the difference
of two addresses to yield and offset a
different type and you want to be able
to subtract an offset from an address
and get an address but it should be an
error to subtract an address from an
offset when you're not dealing with just
plain integers anymore you can do stuff
like this and this is better because it
catches your errors so in the library
that I developed we're getting all the
behavior from all the operators through
in herre
and it turns out that some operator is
more interesting than others the ones
that have an operator at and at equals
pair are the really interesting ones we
want those to do cool things so if the
user provides operator at equals for all
the types you want to interoperate with
then the library can provide the
operator app in terms of your operator
add equals and you as the user specify
whether you want it to be commutative or
not if it's commutative then you only
have to put the operator at equals in
one of your classes not both you can get
a bit of a savings that way and you as
the user can specify the return type the
parameter types and optionally parameter
conversions sometimes you need to do
this if you want to pierce the veil and
go back to integers to do an operation
that would normally be pre-written like
subtracting two addresses so as a user I
can say I want to have commutative
addition of an address and offset and
maternal address and how can you get
that will you inherit two things and
this says it's a double it returns an
address these are commutative and here
are both types address offset and offset
address two lines to get those special
behaviors and you can specify exactly
how you want your type to interact with
others so it's very straightforward to
take an opaque type def and make
extensions customize the default
interface to add delete operations to
fit the way that you want to use your
type don't make everything integer like
because that's what it started out as
you can make these refinements if you
want implicit conversions for example
you can provide them my library doesn't
put them in by default because I've
found them to be very dangerous but if
you want to put them in and if it's
often just one line per binary operation
involving some other type so it's very
easy to do this and have the very strong
type safety
currently I do have an ugly thing that
if I want to remove a binary operator
that was provided by default by the
library I have to do a template
specialization and maybe a forward
declaration it's kind of ugly I think
what I'll do is I'll add another base
that doesn't provide those by default
and then you'll have something cleaner
to inherit from
so hopefully by this time you're
thinking this is actually pretty cool I
can make a type and refine the interface
very easily a very short amount of code
to make this happen that will turn my
semantic bugs into compile time errors
catching bugs that you don't want to
have to catch later it gives you richer
safer use of types and the refinements
as I keep saying are very easy to make
this is cheap stuff and also there's no
runtime penalty all the thing goes away
at just oh one and I want you to start
thinking this technique is general don't
limit yourself to numeric types you can
use this for Strings too and the
security guys are probably thinking hmmm
what can I do if I had a string type
that I knew was safe that came out of my
application versus a string type that I
know came from user input and these two
types will not interoperate unless I
have deliberately allowed them to you
can catch bugs with this I think it's a
great technique so as I said I want to
make this available I'll do it under a
three clause BSD license so it's free
free it's actually pretty short only
about 1,400 lines and the vast majority
of that is dealing with the automatic
creation of the binary operators through
inheritance I've been able to try it on
GCC and clang they're both happy with it
and modern versions Visual Studio 2015
was not but it might be a problem that I
still have it might not be a compiler
issue I only tried for a few minutes
before I gave up so it do may be an easy
way to fix this and ironically I did not
have at my fingertips a modern version
of the in chocolate powder to try with
so I don't know whether it works there
or not
so I don't have everything packaged up
ready I couldn't get that done before
the conference but here's my email
address you can write to me at home or
at work and when I have it available
then I'll let you know you can start
playing with it and I probably should be
submitting this to boost at some point
if there's anyone out there who'd like
to take my hand and guide me through
that I'd appreciate that help now if I
still have a moment I want to add that I
ran into one thing during the
implementation that I wasn't too happy
about so since I have an audience of C++
experts and Stan
it's committee folks I thought I'd just
put in a plug I really wish I had I know
except Otto because I hate repeating
myself and I wanted my type to provide
no except nests if the basic type it was
driving from was and from normal
integers that almost all the operations
are no except but it fits the
user-defined integral like type I wanted
to be able to support that too and it
might not be no accept but what I wound
up doing then is I repeat the body of my
function in the null except clause all
the time I shouldn't have to do this
please make the compiler do it for me
that's what I like to have an exchange
