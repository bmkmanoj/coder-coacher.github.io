developing in C++ for the defense and
financial industries for the last 10
years it's going to spend the next five
minutes explaining why you should be
terrified of strict aliasing okay we'll
go for it you may be may be scared
and the essential keys to avoid
violating it good this is my first
lightning talk so forgive me if it's
terrible so strictly saying I'd like to
talk about it my name is Amy Weber it's
a subject that I've learned a lot about
lately if you have questions please ask
me afterward if you completely disagree
with me tell me afterward because I
would like to know because I want to
compile the best information about this
and get it out to the public it's a
subject I think a lot of people don't
know about and it it scared me when I
learned about it so maybe it'll scare
you
so don't break the rules what are the
rules this is three 10.10 from standard
the C rules are basically the same what
this says is that you can access the
stored value of memory through the
dynamic type of the value not sure what
happened to the monitor over there so
the dynamic type of the value or a care
or unsigned care type otherwise
undefined behavior which as we all know
is very bad okay does this work
this code takes a UN 32 we want to swap
the two halves of it this is kind of
low-level C code you might have
something like this in your code base so
we take a pointer to a UN 16 and we swap
the two sides of it the the two array
pieces this does not work or it's not
guaranteed to work because we are
aliasing the 32 bit value through a
16-bit value that's not a 32-bit value
and 32 and it's not a care not
guaranteed to work
some people try to get clever you might
have heard that you can use a union to
do this so let's take a union you in 32
and in this case it's an N 16 but it
doesn't matter
so in 16 size to array we reinterpret
casts our 32-bit value to a pointer to
that and we do it through the Union
that's it work right no so let's take a
different Union well actually it's the
same Union we're gonna take the same
Union and in this case it's it's a union
of values of the types that we care
about but we're gonna have essentially a
value of the Union and we're going to
copy into one side of it and copy out of
the other side of it slightly different
example this case does work or is
guaranteed to work but only on GCC
because it's a GCC extension to type on
through unions but only in this very
special case where you copy in and out
of it a lot of people think that it's C
99 but it's not so GCC also has a may
alias attribute which basically says I
know what I'm doing I want this thing to
be able to alias anything else and in
GCC's case so we basically make a type
def - am a alias UN 16 T and if we cast
through that GCC says that that this
will work although getting this right is
a little bit tricky and of course it's
not portable so what do we have left
we can just not do this by using F no
strict a leasing on GCC and clang Visual
Studio I believe doesn't have this
aliasing problem as much but it's of
course not guaranteed they can just
change it at any time in any version so
we reinterpret cast it works because
we've turned T be AAA off which is type
based aliasing information and this this
does work
so or this is what the Committee says
they says they say use mem copy which is
is the code is much less friendly but
we're basically casting to a care
pointer and copying through mem copy why
does this work if you notice mem copy
has void or care pointers as the
arguments you're always allowed to view
your memory as bytes because that's the
way that the OS works read/write mm
coffee
mem set so so this is guaranteed to work
because we're a leasing through care
pointers so this kind of code you may
have seen it all over the place low
level code especially network libraries
serialization deserialization
current modern code that's being
produced definitely has this problem in
the wild including market data from
certain exchanges there's s no strict
aliasing the Linux kernel turns it off
Linus has choice words about this
optimization live event some other
libraries I'm sure also turn it off but
we have seen real-world performance
losses when you turn it off so it's kind
of unfortunate
I asked GCC help and I got in conclusive
answers about whether or not placement
knew would actually do what you wanted
to do here and just this morning I heard
from Jason Merrill that he asked the C
the C++ sent core standards mailing list
and they said the value of the thing
after the placement new is indeterminate
so note no type hunting through
placement new so why don't we have alias
cast well it would work only on systems
that allow non-aligned memory access and
that's x86 and new arms which is a lot
of the world so maybe we could have this
but we don't right now so be aware thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
