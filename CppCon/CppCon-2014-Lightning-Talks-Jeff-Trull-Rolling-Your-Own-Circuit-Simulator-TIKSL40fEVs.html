sitting
there you go a former microprocessor
design engineer and now a C++ consultant
who sometimes misses the days when he
needed a microscope to see his work and
this is an intriguing title rolling your
own circuit simulator with eigen and
busto de int so in 15 minutes a circuit
simulator sure we can do that okay so
historically computer-aided design
programs had this sort of thick layer of
infrastructure in the bottom of them
that were things like you know graph
algorithms or linear algebra or numerix
or parsers or stuff like that
and these are a lot of things that sort
of look like general-purpose libraries
but back then when these programs were
started which is sometimes a really long
time ago the people involved were like
they tended to be like XC programmers
and that also sometimes even like the
standard library wasn't always that
reliable and stuff like that so you've
got all this stuff that's kind of like
internally invented code but time as
times have changed and there's a lot of
good stuff out there for doing
engineering work and I think that in the
in the EDA and the CAD world we need to
start thinking about using some of these
libraries that are available now so that
we can focus instead of this this all
this sort of legacy code that we're
maintaining focus instead on addressing
our problem area and and focusing on our
core competency instead and so I'm going
to give a motivating example which is
circuit simulation so for the purpose of
this of this group I think we can
describe circuits as a type of graph and
graphs have nodes are where the
components of the graph come together
and they have voltages and the edges of
the graph are sometimes called branches
they are components and the components
have currents and the currents are
functions of the voltages across the
components between the connecting nodes
and there the value of the component and
sometimes the history that the component
has gone through so here's a here's an
example this is the simplest one you can
imagine it
a resistor the resistor has a current
between the two nodes which is
proportional to the difference in
voltages on the nodes and the value of
the resistor so here's the example
circuit I'm going to use it's got three
sort of interesting components just
disregard the input voltage for now
there's a resistor then there's a
capacitor and then there's an inductor
and so I'm going to try to simulate what
happens when we apply a square wave at
the input on the left and what what
should be happening on the output so
here's how you can analyze that
differential equations yeah it was a
little bit startled to do this for me as
well
so if you if you do like me and go get
your differential equations textbook
from college you can work out that
there's there's basically two equations
that are important here the first one
has the sum of all the currents going
into the node number one on the right
has to be zero because of charge
conservation the other one represents
the branch current on the output
inductor if you solve all of that take
my word for it you come up with a the
output as a function of time with that
square wave input looks like that
equation on the bottom so we can we can
go and and sort of simulate this by
simply implementing that equation we
construct a circuit which is a function
object and you supply the the time and
it returns to you the output value at
that time so that's one way of solving
this and there you can move plotting out
the results and it looks like this so
they just it just kind of like you get a
square input in it kind of rings you
know so there's a problem with this
which is that you don't want people
sitting around and like manually solving
differential equations to come up with
their their program it's also not
general there's even some some kinds of
circuits where you actually can't
manually solve the differential equation
but we can use numeric integration and
make this a lot easier
handle both of those issues so the boost
odeon --the library came out two years
ago you can use it for numerical
integration of systems of differential
equations you just need to supply four
things to it you need the state
definition which is kind of like if you
look at that that first example I showed
it's like the current and the voltage at
the output you need a callable object
and this actually sort of instantiates
your differential equations it returns
for a given state vector and time it
returns the change in the state vector
and OD aunt is going to repeatedly call
this to determine the values at each
point need the initial conditions which
are just the first values of the state
variables and finally a callable object
every time OD and figures out the value
at a time point it's going to call this
thing and you can store it away or print
it or whatever so here's how this would
look for example circuit I'm building
here another function object but this
time it's in the form that OD e ant
wants to see we have this we have the
state vector which is just two two
values and the the operator give it
takes the current value of the state
variables and the time and returns in
that second reference parameter the
change in the values and if you look now
instead of solving the differential
equations and having just one thing
that's a function of time
I'm actually just reorganized the
equations a little bit and now I can
return the change in the state variables
as function of time and this is the way
OD an wants to see it and so when you're
actually going to call this thing I'm
instantiating the circuit by creating
the initial conditions and then this is
the main call to to the integrate
function that odn provides and you give
it the that circuit object I created the
initial conditions the time range and
something to do with the values as it
calculates it
so that's still that's that's good it's
and it's an improvement of our what we
started with we decided to manually
rearrange everything so there's still
some sort of human intervention here
what we really want to do is have a
mechanical way of representing circuits
in a standard form that we can can then
operate on so that the user can supply
any circuit they want and we'll still
handle it correctly the standard way of
representing circuits now is something
called modified nodal analysis you'll
end up with a set of matrices some of
which hold one of which holds the
time-dependent elements and one of which
holds everything else and I'll
demonstrate that so this is kind of what
it looks like instead of two equations
two differential equations in two
variables we now have four differential
equations at four variables but in
return for that increase verbosity we
have a standard format that we can
mechanically put information into so if
you look down at the G matrix there
you'll see this little you'll see this
this pattern where there's the one over
ours there's four one over ours there
that's what we call that the stamp of
the resistor component and you can you
can take the the user can supply a any
resistor and just simply say the value
of the resistor and the nodes is
connected in between and we have a
mechanical way of sticking that in the
matrix and when you put this all
together you have a correct differential
equation of differential equations that
represents the circuit correctly but now
we've created it mechanically so once
we've done that now we can we can
multiply both sides of this equation by
the inverse of C and we get the form
that boost OD and wanted to see we can
now calculate that change in the state
variables as a function of the time and
the current state variable but to do
that we're going to need a matrix
library to represent the matrices
and this in this case I chose eigem
there's there's several but eigen had a
really active a user base and friendly
documentation so I started there it's
also got a lot of other features
including algorithms which we're going
to make use of so this is an example of
the stamp which is the conventional way
of representing a component and I've
given the example of the resistor which
I showed you earlier so this is just a
way if you look at the usage here
imagine that we're reading in from the
user or some file or something like that
all the different resistors and other
components we can simply call this
function as long as we have a matrix of
the right size then we'll end up with
with all of the matrices we need to
represent the system we have
unfortunately a little problem here and
some of you know about math we'll we'll
know what it is we can't actually
multiply both sides by the inverse of C
here because C is singular which means
it can't be inverted this this is a it's
the singular is the mathematical term
but I kind of think of it as the matrix
has too many zeros it's it's not very
but I'm not a mathematician but we can
fix this and so here's how we're going
to fix it we're going to turn those four
equations into two equations and two
variables again by first of all moving
the nonzero elements of C up into the
upper left-hand corner with Gaussian
elimination do you guys remember that
Russ can take advantage of the all zero
roses of C to restate two of the state
variables in terms of the other two so
this is how the code will look and eigen
provides all of this stuff for you it's
gonna apply Gaussian elimination to C
and it's going to remember all the
operations that did and the result of
that is you see C is now L and C are in
the upper left hand corner and it's also
reordered G and it used the
applied the same changes to G that it
did to C because it remembered them and
so now we have another system of four
equations and four variables that's just
been reordered but it's still it's still
effectively the same so but now we can
we can apply a little bit more algebra
and get to something that we can invert
so what we're gonna do now is that we're
going to eliminate those last two state
variables the the v-0 and the input
current using some algebra and again
this is more eigen stuff we end up with
something that looks like that equation
down there and now the C nu is actually
a matrix that can be inverted and once
we've done that then we can end up with
that last line there where we can once
again calculate the change in the state
variables based on their current value
in the time which is what OD and once
having done that we can do our numerical
integration and you get a graph that
looks like that which is very much like
the first one only there's a little bit
of numeric integration artifacts I
actually just left that in so you could
see it was being done that way so in
conclusion we now have all these really
awesome libraries OD and eigen there's
actually a whole bunch of matrix and
linear algebra libraries out there and
they can do some pretty incredible
things for us and so a lot of this stuff
that we used to do kind of like with
this sort of you know proprietary
library layer which has bugs and has to
be maintained and all that kind of stuff
you can start to eliminate them and
instead of doing that use an open source
library that that's very powerful and
robust and well maintained and has lots
of eyes on it and even contribute to it
and life will be like super better I
think so
and there's some resources thank you
