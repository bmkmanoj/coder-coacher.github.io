about d-ring GUI which is a supposed
library that I really like and I want to
share with everyone so this is a gree
library and so let's review how a GUI
libraries work this basically I'm going
to talk about two main ways to write GUI
libraries the first one is the retain
mode GUI so when you write a retain mode
GUI typically your program looks
something like this
where you set up like a window maybe
some widgets likes a text box or some
buttons and you'll kind of like poke
them all up together
and maybe put on some callbacks and you
know bust out your design patterns book
put in some observers and some all the
skin you know fancy stuff and after you
set everything up you say run and then
it just goes and after that it kind of
just like everything all the logic is
handled inside of callbacks and that
kind of logic the second way to write a
green library is immediate mode so this
is an example of a mini about GUI where
you see the main difference is that the
cord on the Left they're actually each
one of those function calls makes the
corresponding we get appear so when you
say in GUI text that makes a text block
text box appear and the idea is that
this code on the left is actually run in
a loop so you run this coordinate loop
over and over again and at every
iteration of your program you regenerate
the entire GUI and so you know that
might sound kind of weird at first but
actually turns out to be extremely
useful for writing clean code and
writing fast code I mean fast I mean in
terms of development speed not in terms
of performance so actually here's some
pros and cons so if you're using retain
mode this is this interrupt base that
means you only do work when events
happen so when you click on your mouse
or whatever that makes it more efficient
in terms of power so if you got have a
program that runs for a long time you
probably ought to go with retain mode
however immediate mode is is actually
polling based so it's power inefficient
in the sense that it'll be doing
constant work no matter what even if
nothing is happening retain mode is
mostly static so you basically build
everything up up front and then it
doesn't change very much after that and
if you do want to change things after
that it's gonna be pretty ugly and your
part gonna have like lots of pointer
problems on the other hand you mean mo
is very dynamic because since you
rebuild it every frame every frame you
can completely change how the GUI looks
depending on what's going on in your
program retain mode is probably better
for long term design but I mean a mode
is actually good for a fast prototyping
and so I would recommend using retain
mode for everyday GUI apps like
but he mo is actually really useful for
real-time simulations where basically
you want to have a GUI that's very
responsive based on what's going on in
real time in your program so dear in GUI
is a library that implements this
immediate mode GUI paradigm in C++
here's some nice little screenshots I
took from the github page that show you
basically what it looks like on top
right here you can actually it's being
used that timeline for a rendering
program so you can get a feel for yeah
people use this in real time simulations
if you want to use the do um GUI in your
programs today there's only a few steps
you have to do first go to the in GUI
github which I'll show at the end of
this talk
grab the sources for EM GUI just add
them to your project and also download
the premium bindings they have they have
bindings for directx and opengl and all
offering systems a like and stuff you
have a few callbacks through you have to
put into your main so not very much work
just calling it a new frame and process
events and called render era debris loop
and after that you basically just start
putting in in booty calls so you just
write text or button or whatever and
they'll start generating in gooey
wickets so I'm actually ending a bit
early but here's the links to those
libraries so are rather DM GUI is the
library the top there if you want to
grab that but it's also another one
another immediate mode GUI library by
called nuclear that's also pretty good
and actually a nuclear is an CC library
so if you're happen to be constrained to
NCC that could be a really interesting
choice and here's some gifts that I
found of em doing action so you can see
also very useful for writing tools and
that's all thank you for the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
