Signed Integers, Faster and Corrector.
It's about, well, I came to see
lightning talks here last year.
Jon Kalb gave a great talk about unsigned,
he was mostly talking
about the correctness
and safety of sticking
with signed integers.
Chandler Carruth also gave a great talk
and it touched upon how
unsigned integers aren't
always the fastest.
But also there's this
guy Krister Walfridsson,
he was on CPP Cast a few
months ago, he writes a great
blog talking about GCC optimization.
It's a great read, and in
particular there's this one
article that just goes
through a bunch of ways
in which signed integers
can exploit undefined
behavior to write, faster,
more optimized, simpler,
more terse code and it
kind of blew my mind.
So I thought I'd share it with you.
I also, I've been trying
to persuade other people,
colleagues, people on the slack channel.
That you know, signed is faster
and it's difficult to persuade people.
It's generally difficult to
persuade people of things.
And so I'm not gonna try
I just wanna share these
cool optimizations but I will
have a quick round-a-bout,
you know, undefined behavior,
contracts that kind of thing.
Because it is a fundamentally difficult
thing to explain to people.
Contracts because they have
more than one human in them
are a necessarily complicated thing.
And when people look
at contracts, you know,
which bit of this line do you think
I'm going to bring up here, really.
The const keyword.
Now I've got a question for
you, is const liberating
or is it restrictive, which is it?
- [Audience] Both.
Both, right well it depends.
If you are implementing this
function it's restrictive,
and if you're the user of
this function it's liberating.
And so what happens if we
turn the tables on the user
and force them to be the
ones that observe const.
Well suddenly when they
do, you know, bad things.
Nobody feels like, I don't
think anybody would feel
too sorry for the author of
this code if something bad
happened as a result of
him doing this const cast.
Is there really any
difference when you cause
undefined behavior because
you used a signed integer
rather than an unsigned integer.
Well, I don't know I've
tried arguing with people
and of course there's a
certain point at which you
just figure you try and plant
a seed in somebody's head
and walk away.
Because sometimes it takes
a long time to get people
to come 'round to your way of thinking.
Maybe if they're about to buy a car,
and it has zero miles on the clock perhaps
you could persuade them
that unsigned is not the,
you know, wraparound is not the
best way to go about things.
And here there's reasons
why unsigned having defined
behavior perhaps isn't such
a great thing after all.
Anyway, if you're arguing...
- [Audience] you're losing.
You're losing, so let
me just show you some
compiler explorer stuff.
So these are some of
the examples that we're,
that I found on this blog
and this one's probably
not that surprising, well you know if you
increase a signed integer it's bigger.
That's not the case
with unsigned here, I'm,
on the left we have what
the code looks like if T is
a signed integer, and on the right we have
what the code looks like if T is unsigned
and here it's a little bit simpler.
Because we know that, you know, if you add
a positive number to
another positive number,
you get a bigger number, right?
Well not the case with
unsigned, so you have to do
extra checks to make sure
that number isn't now
very, very low.
Okay this one's pretty good.
This is pretty extreme
actually, I mean I am
cherry picking some of
these examples for sure.
But here again, if you multiply
x by, you know, a number
and then you divide it
by a smaller number,
well you're gonna end up
with something that was
bigger than x to begin
with and in this case,
14 divided by 7 is 2
and so there's basically
something that, a hacky
way to double the value.
So just, wow, five minutes
(beeping sound)
really isn't very long, so there are
just more examples like
this and I recommend you
