common problem, I think,
with a fairly obvious solution.
Let's say that there's some
project out there, monorail.
Just to give you an
example of the context,
let's say you're working
on an open source project
and the thing you want
to call is a function
in another open source project.
So, you don't necessarily
have their headers around,
but you want to be able
to provide a function
that calls that other routine.
So, the obvious way to do it is just say
namespace monorail, size_t hash
and you're gonna have,
you know, a little routine
called MonorailHash that
takes a private value,
passes it to MonorailHash, and returns.
Result nice and fine,
except there are two things
that will break you
and that's if MonorailHash happens to add
an extra default argument.
Anybody calling that after
including the appropriate header
will work fine, but you won't,
because you're calling the function
with the wrong signature
that doesn't exist anymore.
The other thing is if they call this,
using some other hash
and some other namespace.
Then, again, if you include the header,
it'll know to call legacy_rail::Hash,
but not in your code.
You're calling it in the wrong namespace.
So, if you don't mind modifying callers,
you can do this, what I
think is the right way,
which is make a function called CallHash
and you make it much more generic
and then anybody that used to
call YourClass.MonorailHash,
now calls the generic version, CallHash,
with a pointer to MonorailHash.
But, number one, it's ugly.
Number two, which is actually,
it happened in my case,
that might involve
changing a lot of callers,
which can be problematic.
So, let's have some fun.
Let's try to work around this.
You may have heard when,
because template instantiation is delayed,
you can sometimes have
functions inside of templates
that call things that don't yet exist.
So, you might think, oh
well, I'll just declare this,
with a defaulted template parameter
and the answer's that
actually still doesn't work,
because it doesn't know
about the definition
of Hash in monorail.
So, it'll get a little bit more tricky.
We'll declare the namespace
and then call Hash
and, that way, we can
just follow through on it.
This almost works.
However, there are no
arguments to Otherfunc, sorry,
to, that should say Hash,
that depend on a template parameter.
So, okay, let's make it depend
on a template parameter.
We'll just declare the default
parameter to still be int
and then cast a value to that,
then it can't determine the call to Hash
until MonorailHash is called.
This actually works all by itself.
And people can call it,
but only if the monorail
header's included before yours.
If the monorail header's
included afterwards,
you get this weird message,
saying Hash wasn't declared
in this scope at the time
that your class was here.
And, to make things worse,
MSVC has no problem with this,
but Clang and GCC do.
And then, this is the
hack to get around that.
You declare a small helper
function in namespace monorail,
whose only job is to take an int
and then construct an int, when asked.
And, that way,
this helper function
invokes argument deduction.
Then it finds Hash in the monorail header.
This works no matter what order
the monorail header is included
and just, for the record,
you really should do this,
but just for an introduction
into how template instantiation can work.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
