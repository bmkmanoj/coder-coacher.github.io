into programming was about ten years ago
I was doing astrophysics at the time and
we're doing numerical simulations of the
cosmological structure formation they
look like this doesn't work they look
like this
yeah no hang on yeah so this is rendered
from such a computer simulation they
were running on like massively parallel
computer clusters and we were using
these things to study how galaxies
evolve yeah pretty cool huh let me show
you the code hmm so that's like actual
actual production code anyone knows what
programming language that is that's
Fortran now let me scroll down a little
bit yeah um it's go down a bit further
just keeps going it's like the same file
it's like I don't know tens of thousands
of lines of code yeah it's the same
stuff so um this was my first
programming language this is how I
learned how to code and then after a few
years of this I was like this can't be
it is this it is this how is this what
programming is no that can't be it that
must be a better way right and I kept I
started searching and I found this and I
said yeah this is much better yeah and I
went to my supervisor at the time let's
say hey that new project you know that
we're going to do I'm going to write
this in C++ that's going to be much
better right and he was like are you
crazy no one's going to be able to read
your code
well I went ahead and did it anyway um
and then that was so much fun that I
decided hey let's not do the science
stuff let's just become a C++ programmer
yeah and then I applied for a job at a
company called Native Instruments by
doing music software and I applied for a
job there in order to get it I need to
pass a I needed to pass a coding test
yeah the coding test looked something
like that
I got a string and I had to replace you
know one sub string with another sub
string and I was like yeah I can do this
with C++ huh Stack Overflow yeah yeah
STL right you have to need to know this
STL well if you need performance here's
an optimized function uh yeah you can do
it with the char pointer as well you
know in super sauce eleven you can do
with reg X right this is cool oh hang on
he's a template highest version of it so
um yeah and then I found this thing
called AB juice which is a CSS framework
and hey you can write it like this and
that's the code s admitted and they were
like hey this guy knows juice cool and I
got the job yeah so um fast forward a
few years I moved on and I now actually
work on juice and since then I learned a
lot and I want to part up point out like
a particular book I read which is this
one anyone here read this book really
recommended I can be sir I can summarize
the whole book in one slide the only
valid measurement of code quality is WTS
per minute and I think I can rephrase
this I think actually my philosophy is
code should be as close as possible to
plain English and this is something that
Jews actually is really really good at I
mean from what I hear from our users
this is like the number one reason why
they like juice so much you know you can
you can write code like that you know it
just tells you what's going on it's
really easy to read and then you open
the header and then you know you can
just read it but you know as much as I
care about juice there's one thing I
care about
more which is C++ itself and you know
here's a piece a line of bus code from
my talk on Tuesday and you know in C++
17 I can't write this anymore now this
is wrong I have to write it like that
and you know this makes me sad because
you know here's the problem I know what
a Mersenne twister is right I know why
the why the new version is the better
one I'm a C++ fan right I'm here I can
go to a talk about like template
metaprogramming new techniques in C++ 17
I'm gonna have a great time but it's not
about me it's about the 90% of our users
you know they don't know this stuff they
don't care about the stuff they there's
slack in C++ because you know they're
writing all your software you have to
use C++ for that but but they just want
to shuffle their vector because they're
just implementing their first card game
you know and and I think we all do
people are not the only industry like
that and I think you know the great
thing about juice is that we allow
people to you know write simple code but
I think C+ busses the language really
should be better at this you know yeah
we need the heavy stuff in there for the
people who need it probably most of the
people in this room but we really should
also cater for you know all the other
people out there who want to write
simple code and they don't care about
you know details and I think I think
this is important so I just wanted to
share this with you thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
