programming and I wanted to talk about
programming and then I did this did a
presentation about programming and C++
know and I thought I share that with you
because it's actually a fun experience
so I've been thinking about programming
and you know the future of programming
is already micro hinted and so you know
during your career at least one of those
and you know you specialize and like C++
and meta programming or you generalize
and to something like C++ I was when I
was a freelancer I did that like a a
specialist in C++ but I generalize it
and C++ framework so I did I did work on
other frameworks and if you have like a
normal job then you might be more
specialized than doing a certain task
for your company which for a certain
product and at a certain point maybe you
mutate and you do you start doing
something completely different like I
did like you know getting involved in
community work organizing a conference
and doing all those things and and then
maybe something else happens and this is
actually a quote from a keynote at C++
now which is by those who see nerd life
very famous and this is one of the most
ridiculous things I ever heard at C++
now actually and so but on the other
hand it always wasn't Beckenham of my
mind I got me thinking today I think
maybe Stanley Lippmann wasn't like
totally wrong because on the other hand
people who are not programming they they
they hear this safe you drop learn
programming okay and that's basically
the philosophy of a lot of what other
people do my brother did that and it was
like really crazy when I visited
my brother this year I was sitting at my
PC doing this laptop doing a C+ person
he was doing on his laptop Ruby on Rails
and this was kind of crazy because
actually I started something completely
different from that and he's not
supposed to be a programmer that wasn't
like in his career so what do you do if
you're a programmer you know we can't
become a programmer we cannot learn
programming because we're already
programmers so you know is the answer
becoming a better programmer or what
should we do as programmers what is our
career advice as like everybody else
like this loan program it's an outlet
it's trying to learn a programming and
on the other hand learning programming
is usually popular and we already like
teacher that kindergarten level and
elementary school it's so and on the
other point in ten years we have no idea
how you know predicting the future is
that right oh I've seen you've seen it
enough sites for that and so I think
that programming we like to become like
speaking like a foreign language like I
speak English and German and Jennifer is
it and so and on the other hand we have
things like machine learning good things
and maybe have self-driving cars in the
future but maybe also said like you know
our drops will probably become easier or
become more productive language but also
as a is cetera and we have no idea of
the demand keeps up or there's like a
lot of programmers then and if the
demand is still there or we may be they
have like it an overcapacity so again
the question you know what what to do if
you're a programmer what what what
you're doing and for your career to
still be a programmer in ten years
become a better programmer or maybe I I
think maybe you like thinking outside of
the box and learn to apply the tools of
programming and other fears and like we
really like to understand what makes
programming what is programming not just
like using api's so I think that domain
knowledge plus programming should you
know open a lot of interesting ways for
your own future future and maybe feature
and also yeah maybe you know have an
exit plan like a plan B that's probably
a good option to have as we do not
really know what the future of us you
know and that's thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
