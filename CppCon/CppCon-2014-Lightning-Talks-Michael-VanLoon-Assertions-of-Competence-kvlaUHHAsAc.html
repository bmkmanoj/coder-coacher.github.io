been programming for over 30 years
C++ for over 20 years which I like means
he started before he was born
currently he works for f5 networks and
wants to show how you can be moderately
confident when making assertions so I
apologize this presentation was
originally intended for a much more
basic audience but I figured that Kate
had a strategy here where she accepted a
whole wide variety of presentations and
somebody's got to bring up the other end
right all right let's see if this shows
up
all right so what is an assert it's just
to see something positively forcefully
aggressively demonstrate existence when
I can't talk about manhood
the purpose of an asserts to validate
input check for something happens every
now and then I make dialogue box no
maybe not asserts are to declare
invariance or facts things that should
really never actually happen
the purpose of an assert is to say give
an expectation that variable will never
be a certain value or or a state will
never happen
and I see an expectation because we're
writing complex code and you know
sometimes you throw an assert in there
just to see if my assumption really is
true that that's okay you know if it's
if it's there for a little while but but
if an assert remains in your code really
the the expectation is that it's
something that should never ever happen
the the cool thing about that of course
is if we've achieved that state the
assert can can stay there to help us
reinforce that that assumption continues
to be true in the future so great what
are you know who cares what are they for
who are they for they're there for you
no no hold on the certs are for you guys
they're for us the user never sees them
or they shouldn't you know they're for
and and they're not supposed to show up
in the release builds if you're doing
that properly so are they good for error
checking well no the users never going
to see them no they're not in the
release code and no an error is
something that you expect to happen an
error is something that you handle
an assert as is saying that something
should never happen it's saying I don't
expect this assert to ever be useful in
a way so what happens when you assert
I'm Unix your default behavior as you
get a cig abort which makes your process
and die and go away somewhat in
gracefully and on Windows you get a
little pop-up dialog box asking if you
know you want to do something like debug
it or you know make it go away so you
know we know what's the use of that
obviously it's something that you as a
programmer can use but you know your end
users aren't really gonna want to see
that so much
what about servers well ok that that's
even a case that's a little bit further
removed because on a server you might be
sitting in a data center somewhere with
a thousand virtual machines and and your
system mins are all listening to how you
know a service that goes away
for no for no reason you got to go find
the core dump you got to send it off to
support and they got to figure out
what's going on or on Windows you're on
a headless server it has no monitor and
in fact it has no desktop or at least
not one that you can get to and there's
a little dialog box they're sitting
there waiting for you to click it to
tell it what you want to do so your
process doesn't even actually die it
just kind of hangs alright so then if
that's true how do we use them well
let's see first one you know seems cool
we're asserting that at this point in
the code a certain state is always true
sure what about number two we're certain
that you know a certain point of the
code and object is always valid
it should never ever be invalid at this
point in the code third one is not input
it's say we have an algorithm and the
output of that algorithm should always
be within a certain range okay that
seems like a safe a safe thing
maybe maybe not the fourth one because
we have no control over what our input
stream might be you know it it's it's
expected that we might get something
that is invalid so we have to handle it
number five
that's not cool for multiple reasons
obviously if we we have memory
allocation problems it's going to throw
an exception but even if somehow we
disable that and we get a null pointer
that's something you really need to
handle not just you know assert and the
bigger problem of course is that that
assert goes away in release code and you
don't have any app you know allocate an
object so not cool at compile time
there's static asserts I'm not going to
really talk about those too much because
I'm already over my five minutes and the
cool thing on the windows thing is is
the dialog box thing isn't necessary
it's just the default behavior you can
actually tell windows to assert to a
file instead of your console or on linux
write a little wrapper that can do that
for you if there's so limited why do we
use them because they're great they're
self debugging code they help us say
things that should never happen and find
when they do other methodologies unit
tests things like that
I'm concluding because I'm over time but
the things that I want to stress as well
as is they're not your only tool use
your unit tests and use your debug
testing and use your brain think about
your code add the asserts as an extra
tool but use them and there we go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
