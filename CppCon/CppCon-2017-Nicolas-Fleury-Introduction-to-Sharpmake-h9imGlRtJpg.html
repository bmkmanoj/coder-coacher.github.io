So yeah, I'm Nicolas Fleury.
I work at at Ubisoft
Montreal on Rainbow Six Siege
and a few years ago in a CppCon talk
I introduced FastBuild
but I didn't mention a
tech really important to us,
which is Sharpmake.
And we're finally making
it open-source at Ubisoft.
So if you know Premake and Cmake
well, it's pretty similar
in what it does,
and in my opinion
and a lot of others' it is actually
a lot more fun to work with.
So Sharpmake is using C#
as its scripting language
and its implementation language as well.
And it's really designed
for big C++ projects.
This is really where Sharpmake is shining.
And what we've seen is that C++ programmers
are also really comfortable
to edit the Sharpmake files.
And Sharpmake is fast to generate projects
and this is really important for us
because we generate projects
each time we sync code.
And today, we even generate
our C# projects with it as well.
It has built-in support
for FastBuild makefiles,
which is great if you want
to give FastBuild a try.
And since it's in C#, with Visual Studio
we get IntelliSense and
debugging support as well,
which is appreciated.
So this talk is really giving you
a very quick glimpse of
the concepts of Sharpmake.
The first one,
the fragments, they are defined
with enums like this one.
We can see the values
are using different bits.
The fragments are used to define targets
which are basically classes
with a bunch of properties,
each one with a different fragment type.
And the fragments
are letting you multiply a
number of targets easily.
So here through a single call
through the target constructor
I'm actually building an instance
representing a target list.
A project in Sharpmake
is implemented with a class,
and by project I mean
a library or executable.
The constructor of that class will be
called a single time
unless it's a base class
for another project as well.
In the constructor,
one of the main things you will do
is add the targets to the project.
Sharpmake is made that way
to be able to parallelize
the processing of all the projects
as soon as possible.
It's not that big of a deal
because typically what you will do
is define a class
hierarchy for your projects
and move that line to a base class
to not repeat yourself.
In a project you can add
one or more Configure functions
and they take two arguments.
The first one is the configuration
which is the output.
And the second one is the target,
which is the input.
The configure function is called for
every target in the project.
Which means that inside that function
you can use code very
intuitive for C++ programmers.
You can use if-else, switch-cases,
virtual functions, public static
functions in other classes,
whatever you want;
this is normal C# code.
When it comes to dependencies
you add them inside Configure functions
since dependencies can
be specific to targets.
So you specify the
project type to depend on
and the target.
The target is typically the same
but it's possible
for different project types
to use different target types.
If that the case, it won't compile.
So we'll need to write
some conversion code
between the two types.
Which you can write the way you want.
Here it's done inside a public method.
Dependencies are important for programmers.
Meaning for C++ programmers,
we want to define
everything about our library
in a single place.
And Sharpmake is giving you
all the tools to do that.
So for example,
for processor definitions
there's a difference between
the one that should be for the dependent
and the one for to compile
the library itself.
Same thing for include paths
and there's even stuff if you
want to have, for example,
specific files in the
final executable folder.
When I say that the project is a class,
I don't mean the project file.
So project files in Sharpmake
is like any output
and it's all handled automatically.
So suppose here I'm
setting the project file name.
Here we can see another
feature of Sharpmake
which is a reflection based system that
we can use in strings.
We use this one sometimes instead of C#
normal string features,
because it's actually evaluated
much later by Sharpmake.
But anyways, suppose I
change this line to this one?
Now I'm saying that my project file
should be platform specific.
So I want to generate more project files.
Well that's it.
You only change that line
and Sharpmake will generate
solutions, all of that
according to that.
and it will say if anything
doesn't make sense.
So that's pretty much it.
We've been using Sharpmake
in production since 2011.
So even if we release it only
today, it's actually a major tech.
There's a bunch of features
I'm not mentioning.
This is all the platforms it is supporting
and for any platform you don't
see the code public on github
it's actually because the platform holders,
for NDA reasons,
prefer you go through them
to get the code.
So please do.
Don't re-implement.
And with the remaining time,
I want to mention another tool
that was made open-source last week
by someone who could not be here today.
It's the Orbit profiler.
It's a profiler that is basically
instrumenting your code live.
Inserting hooks at the beginning
and end of your functions
live in your application.
And in the end,
you get something like
the best of both worlds.
between a sampling profiler
and an instrumenting profiler.
So I suggest to check it out as well.
Thank you.
