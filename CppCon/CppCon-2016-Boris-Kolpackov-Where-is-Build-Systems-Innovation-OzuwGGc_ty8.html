talks by Bryan can tell if you haven't
highly come in very entertaining so the
other day I was watching one about
freebsd jails and Solaris zones and you
know you get a whole new perspective on
incarceration but the thing that stood
out to me is when he was talking about
the state of salaries in the late
eighties and it was apparently in a maze
so they spent many years cleaning it up
and then finally they had this nice
operating system but they realized that
in the past ten years there was no
operating system innovation there was
nothing interesting happening so then
they went ahead and start working on
DTrace and gfs and salaries zones and it
start to me that we is in a same
situation we have this nice new clean
language but we still stuck with C++ 98
there are build systems and the problem
when you with being stuck with something
primitive is that you cannot even
imagine that they can be a radically
different way to do things so a good
example a CVS engi right when i was
using CVS or now many of you had the
pleasure I never even thought that about
something like git rebase so i'm working
on build 2 which is the new build system
c++ build tool chain and what we decided
to do we decided to just throw away all
the baggage let's start from scratch in
more than C++ and once you get the
basics right all of a sudden all this
young women need to to look for
innovation you know I just stays that
you just jumps at you so I only have
time to show you one hopefully Michael
won't cut me off so one thing that we
drill it took a great care of inbuilt to
ease cross-compilation so now it's
actually a pleasure to use and once you
get that it's like git rebase you know
you want to rebase I mean cross compile
everything and why is that well because
it's more convenient right you can do it
from the comfort of your development
environment from max of being whatever
you want so when you work on an open
source cross compiler project
you really only need to worry about
their income polish these days right
client GCC and visuals to claim GCC are
easy available everywhere visual studies
a bit of a plane so apparently these
days you can even use visual studio to
build linux binaries not exactly sure
how it works or why someone would want
to do that but what I want to do is to
cross-compile what visual studio from
linux to windows so i don't need one
need to leave my in a preferred
development environment and well even
really think about running a visual
studio ID right in on linux i think
everyone realizes it's probably never
going to happen but running the
toolchain the compiler itself is
actually possible so i have a couple of
virgins here now this mrs. up whether
you hear a little bit at c++ now someone
asked me hey are you running ubuntu use
the land on windows like no i'm running
ubuntu use the land on ubuntu so this is
actually linux machine that is running a
little wrapper that we want let me rot
and it's actually fairly simple just
translate some parts using wine so you
can see it's visual studio 14 compiler
here so i want to show you a concrete
example how it's helpful so i have a
build utility library that we use in our
build system and i have a couple of
configurations for tasting going and you
can see the last one is visual studio so
what I did that I broke it a little bit
I'm gonna break up then introduced a
syntax error so remember this is all
running on on linux and i'm going to
compile this configuration so those of
you familiar with visual studio years
will immediately recognize it right this
c 2 144 carnegie is a giveaway the cool
thing is Emacs actually cognizes this
error format so we didn't have to do
anything so i can say go to the next
error and it just jumps the right line
for me so this was a very speculative
project we kind of thought hey can we
make it work if we can if we can just
compile it will be already huge win and
once you get that in the next thing you
think hey can I run tests it turns out
you can actually run a lot of tests we
can run all our build system tests on
the wine on linux so i also broke
test so I'm going to run that so I'm a
messed up an assertion test in in my
test for this sha256 so this is an
assertion failed equivalent for wine
while the output is not as nice you
still get all the information so you get
the line and source filing so thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
