don't forget to oppose at the end to
legalize the meta programming library we
started with the oil it started out of
own need because in our software and the
software joy will make heavy use of
template metaprogramming and its birth
clay the pitch ists boost MPL for c++
1114 and it works on visual studio 2013
clan GCC any compiler you want so it's
one of the two obviously someone the
idea comes that I was just started to
write open source the library we had
internally at the company and then oil
said is it what is the brigham thing
you're doing right now and say ok now
we're going to call the library go
regarding the thief or yeah and source
of inspiration whenever we had an idea
how about how we should do it water
interface we should have what we did is
simple we said how is it done in to
stamp here so if you already use ghost
MPL getting it to goose egg on is going
suppose we go let's it's going to be
very easy and actually when I started it
was the article written by Peter dimov
which gave me the idea to write the
library because I realized would be
actually very easy and also of course it
IDs from Eric nebula three very
important talk goes it must be instant
compile time and when I say instant
compile time it takes 10 seconds to
build the whole library with all every
test and we have like how many tests
1100 almost 200 okay so two hundred to
two hundred two thousand we have many
many tests it's instant compile time
whatever the complexity because we make
heavy use of C++ 11 features biotic
templates there is not a single macro
the library it's purely see plasmas
sister never copies yeah like you want
to do metaprogramming but you don't want
to kill yourself in two years and white
support the software we use is also has
to run on windows so it has to compile
on business to do 2013 and so so welcome
visitors due 2015 it's Clank 3.5 3.6 we
exploit on the default length from micro
s GCC 478 ok 48 49 50 alright another
point and go back when the other point
which is all about the sustainability of
the library is that just be simple to
use but that's basically what the
interfacing inner 8-8 from the NPI gave
us but we also wanted it to be easy to
look into because we don't want our
co-worker to be lagging behind what's
going wrong into this piece of software
so we try to keep the implementation as
straightforward or trivial as possible
the cliq you rock everything my
assistant please check this right yes so
why do we use bringin four instead of
just playing around with C++ compile
time checks obviously constant
computations increase ODB we use we even
I we don't really why the gender
protocol we generated civilization and
what do you use it for real exactly so
we use it to end all different kind of
problem related to memory like the
layout layout sorry so we have some kind
of automatic structure of array to array
of structures converter so you can
actually write an array of structures
and regenerates a properly designed
early memory layout on the fly we do
that we have something that compute
complex functions than time so you try
to build large data flow that combine
multiple multiple tables and stuff like
that and it's available with the boost
software license so you can just use it
and just just go just use it ok so in
demo features what okay just so Intel
features what we try to do was to be a
sport as MPL as possible because even if
MPs thought to be aging a bit the basic
API is basically what you need we
basically have everything in term of
algorithms we have all the classical
sequences but in fact this is the main
main point that everything is a tight
list actually so if you want to use a
boost valiant as a type list and you
want to turn the booze variant of
integral to booze variant of the
equivalent floating-point types you just
can't pass whose variant of something to
two brilliant and it will just walk you
don't need to adapt that and we get rid
to of also of all the iterative based
API because that was a bit cumbersome so
everything works like it's a range
actually and everything else is
classical we also added a bit of red
oh okay we also have a bit of a runtime
support so we have a proper
implementation of for which chart we
have something that kind to a static if
let you select different branches in
different lambdas stuff exists we show
it inside the curls benefit is useful
because you you start comforting types
and you end up wanting to take the
decisions to make something at runtime
and all the other active stuff we
support which also support prasad just
based lambdas so you can actually build
large complex lambda expressions and as
you say we wanted to work with visual
studio 2013 and everything is macro free
actually so it's it straight forward to
read if you really want to look into the
implementation what the heck is night it
doesn't function yeah you rock
everything again so this is a kind of
stuff we can actually write a very very
rough and simplified example or so you
you can buy you can build list of types
including with void inside that some
sort of the library doesn't report and
you can just transform it to add the
pointer on everything okay and you turns
out into a STD total done and as I say
everything is likely so you can do
exactly the same but but using directly
a variant should be booze violent
actually yes the STD value is not there
so anyway so well we have this variant
of some stuff you just take it pass it
to the same time to transform and you
turn it into a top or afterwards okay so
as long as you have a type which is
basically looking like sometimes
brackets type type type sites types it's
a friggin cyclist okay and we we don't
ask you anything about that so that's
the main zooming go
and as I say we have this French based
interface we shamelessly take from what
andrean red X on the school say about d
so let's tell you what this brigand list
of stuff okay and you want to try to
first int inside that okay so you
basically get that so you also you can
also do find elements to get directly to
the types and the result is is not an
iterator or whatever is basically we
consume the type least until we found
whatever we need to found and we retain
user type list with the first element
being the first step that verifies the
predicate so I so you can take that and
you know that the front of this is what
you want and you can actually push it
back to another call to find if you want
to find the second one and so on and so
on so so you doesn't have to deal with
me Terry Raider like like m pierre de
Graaff and stuff like this and okay so
it's it's on github we work with our to
try to have something that actually
combines tonight so you can actually try
to actual for 3ds okay and say tell us
if it doesn't work where why when and we
greatly appreciate it to get any
feedback on that thang</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
