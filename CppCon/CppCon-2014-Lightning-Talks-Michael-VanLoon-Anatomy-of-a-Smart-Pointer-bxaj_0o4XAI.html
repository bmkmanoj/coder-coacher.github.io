five and his instead asked me for ten
because he wants to add to your store of
arcane and useless knowledge by sharing
how smart pointer sausage is made all
right I'm not really but as anybody
who's worn the button can attest they
aren't really a doctor
so yes what do we want to know about
arcane and useless knowledge because
it's early in the morning we probably
haven't had enough coffee
so what's a smart pointer most you guys
probably know most of this stuff but for
those who need a refresher or maybe want
to know a little bit more the basics are
it's a container it holds a pointer
pretty basic but the cool thing is that
it facilitates our III which means that
of course it constructs with reasonable
defaults you don't have a pointer that's
holding some random value that may look
like memory because you forgot to
initialize it it also even more
importantly cleans itself up when it's
time to do that there's various ways
that they might do that and we're going
to talk about those and it may convey
some interface semantics which is nice
if you have a unique pointer obviously
it's unique you can't share it and so
it's it's good if that's clear in your
interface if you have a shared pointer
it implies you're sharing the pointer
it's a proxy which means that you can
use it in place of the pointer in in
many circumstances that's kind of the
whole point so some examples out of
pointers go pointer unique pointer
shared pointer weak pointer a couple of
commoners there are many others of
course these are generic smart pointers
they're whole the whole pointers is just
about any type there are main
domain-specific smart pointers smart
pointer we're kind of abusing the term a
little bit here they're really smart
containers string is one it it contains
your string properly it D allocates it
when
using it it has reasonable
initialization defaults Windows has some
beasts turkey variant T is a cool one
because it's this variant type and knows
how to properly contain and manage it so
different kinds of reference counting
well there's I use object based
reference counting and container based
reference counting as my terms because I
like them better than intrusive is one
that boost likes to use it's been used
in other places too object based
reference count means the count is
stored in the object this is similar to
the the calm model the Microsoft uses a
lot it's been around forever and ever I
don't like the term intrusive because
obviously we're doing this with the
cooperation of the object it was an
intentional interface design so we're
not really intruding on it we're doing
it in cooperation but the fact that
we're calling the object and asking it
to do things with its reference is why
it's called him true serve and of course
container based reference counting is
the share pointer style we're all
familiar with hopefully the object based
reference counting model has the
advantage that it's the smart pointer
logic is very simple the smart pointer
for an or one of these is basically just
an ref and delete or add breath and
release or whatever you want to call the
interface I won't go over everything
because we don't have that much time but
basically it can it can add a little bit
of complexity object but the smart
pointer container is simpler also it's
easier to pass through say C interfaces
because you can pass around the raw
pointers and you're still calling the
address and release on the pointer
you're not having to manage it whereas
with a shared pointer we need to of
course with exceptions make sure that we
pass around the shared pointers
themselves because they have to know
about each other since they share a
common a common theme
so how it works algae-based reference
counting that's about all I'm going to
talk about because you know it's it's
not the common case Auto pointer one of
the original smart pointers it contains
a raw pointer and an ownership flag the
ownership is transferred to the the last
guy basically who got the pointer which
means it's problematic so maybe that's
not the guy who should be destroying the
thing and so it's deprecated cause we
have better stuff now scope point of
unique pointer scope pointer is a boost
thing unique pointers is C++ 11 pointer
that's an improvement on scope pointer
does not allow transfer of ownership
obviously scoped and unique that's
intentional it makes it much simpler and
makes it more efficient also
conveyancing the internet interface
semantics that it's unique right the
unique pointer off also has the the
option of having a custom deleter
which is a function that you can pass in
that says when it's time to destroy this
thing instead of calling delete I want
you to do this which is a nice way to
clean up resources somebody I don't
remember maybe was Bernie
yesterday was talking about well what if
you're using malloc well here's a good
way you use accustomed to leader that
does free instead of delete
yeah okay thanks so shared pointer I
think most of us are familiar with
shared pointer but basically it's a
reference counted container that
contains your pointer and hopefully if
you're using it properly
the last user of it is the one who
releases the the last reference and
everything goes out of scope so I don't
have a laser pointer I'm going to use my
mouse so hopefully it's accurate enough
and I of course didn't have time to make
these slides even more fancy and
detailed so we're doing it this way
shared pointer basically is is a a
complex design where you have your
shared pointer the thing that you've
declared and it is a share pointer to a
type internally it contain
now this is a logical representation
this isn't how its implemented in every
compiler obviously there there's some
some differences but this just gives you
an idea of how to put together logically
there's a pointer to the thing that
you're containing obviously and there's
also a corner to a reference count
container and this is the thing that's
shared among all the shared pointers now
if I were to say take share pointer p1
and create a shared pointer P to that is
a sign from p1 they are going to contain
references to the same reference count
container and inside here there's a
strong reference count a weak reference
count eighty pointer and the leader the
strong reference count is going to go
from one to two because now we have two
references to this thing inside here we
also of course have a pointer to T and
our deleter why do we have a pointer
here and a pointer here I know that's a
question obviously you need it here
because if you have a deleter function
well even if you know I'm to leave it
fine if you're using delete you still
need to have the pointer so you can
delete it right but do we really want it
do you reference a pointer every time we
need the answer to give me my pointer no
it's much more efficient if we can just
pull it straight out of here but we can
also do cool tricks like a dynamic cast
to a related type and get a shared
pointer back to that say t2 is derived
from T and we want a shared pointer to
t2 from p1 or p2 we can do that inside
here we're going to get a container that
has a t2 pointer and a reference to the
same block because obviously they refer
the same object cool stuff we can do an
optimization that we can make because
when you're using these kind of
paradigms it's really nice to not have
to explicitly ever use delete or new the
share pointer itself of course makes it
so that we don't have to use delete
which is nice how can we avoid using new
well there's this thing called make sure
and one effect is that it does the new
for you
the other cool thing is it can be a
little bit more
Damone the reason why is it's capable of
most I should say many of them
implementations can allocate the shared
pointer and the reference block all in
one memory allocation a little more
efficient Chandler will like this even
though it's you know got links and
things because this is one block more
cache locality he gets picked on a lot
doesn't he
the cool thing is so it's it's it's a
little bit more compact it's a little
more efficient and it's also capable of
I was going to say something but now
it's put on my head so anyway the the
rest of it works the same way as the the
other shared pointer of course since
it's all allocated here there's a little
bit more complex about deleting the last
reference but it all works enabled share
from this has a cool feature it's a cool
feature that we have as well because one
of the things that I saw is weakness
with share pointers that you can't
really pass the raw pointer around and
then you get another shared pointer from
it unless you do something like this
enabled share from this as a class that
you can derive from and it makes your
object aware of its shared pointer the
reference count block and the way that
it does that is there's some magic
inside enabled share from this that
takes the so this is my object of an a
drive from an able chair from this it
requires that somebody's created a
shared pointer first to your object and
so maybe you've done a make sure well in
this case you haven't because we don't
have the block embedded but say you've
created your object with and you've put
it in a shared pointer now there is a
shared pointer block if I ask say I get
the raw pointer and I ask my object for
another shared pointer it can use the
knowledge of this this link here and
give me back a new shared pointer that
knows about the shared reference and
do the right thing and that's kind of
how that stuff's all glued together I'm
20 seconds over so my summary is use
smart pointers they're the right way to
do things to avoid news and deletes
prefer unique pointer it's more
efficient your shared pointer if you
have to use make sure to be more
efficient consider the object based
reference hunting model if fits your
paradigm better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
