O'Dwyer hello
and I organized a meet-up in the San
Francisco area particularly San
Francisco itself so if you're in that
area and you're not already aware of it
I guess come talk to me or come join us
on October 3rd and so these are the
intermission slides for my template talk
just like quick little little puzzler
here there's audience participation
encouraged I've got to show a little bit
of code here and I'm gonna ask does this
compile and then you're gonna say yes or
no does this compile yeah okay cool
that's fine okay so let's make this a
little more complicated its make f a
template at someone play compiler here
what does this do
doesn't compile why not can't can't the
Duce template parameter i awesome all
right some people who use the compiler
before all right all right let's do that
that work I heard it yes I heard a loud
no if you have an explicit special okay
that's interesting anyone else yeah F
was not declared in the scope
interesting why don't we get ADL in this
case because you need to specify the
template argue I did specify the
template argument zero from a standard
get San I get doesn't exactly hit well
okay it's you can't you can't you have
to believe this did okay suppose I
rewrite it like this
does that help
it is the same thing all I did was add
two spaces but yes SF is not declared in
this scope because at this point we
don't even know that F is the name of an
overload set F is just the thing that
we're comparing to zero and for a
template name to be explicitly qualified
by template arguments the name must be
known to refer to a template otherwise
what we're not actually giving a
template arguments we're just staying a
less than sign so what we have in here
is F less than zero and it's okay well
what is F well I don't know what F is
there is no f'n scope so it's not a
function call now we can make it one
which was we just stick this ugly
definition in here template class F away
to F in fact we didn't even need to be a
function it could be a it could be a
class at this point as long as it was a
template just to let the compiler know
hey F in this scope is a template and
then it parse is just fine and ADL kicks
in and we got the right F and it doesn't
even matter that this F you know right
right here that this takes a class when
really would need to knit like that's
all fine F is a template and we can go
book it up and we're happy yes F has to
be a template if it's a function it's
not gonna work what happens you put the
template keyword before it as of C++ 17
as far as I know
syntax error similarly if you have a
type name that the compiler doesn't know
is the pipe name and you stick type name
in front of it syntax error you can only
use those independent contexts such as
inside the body of a template if you try
to use it in normal code like this just
say I know what I'm doing the compiler
doesn't care if you know what you're
doing
now that's it that's all I got
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
