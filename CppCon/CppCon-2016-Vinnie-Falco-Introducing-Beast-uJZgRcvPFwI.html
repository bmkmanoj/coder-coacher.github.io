good news is this is the last talk the
bad news is it's a long one so my name
is Vinnie Falco I work at Ripple
I have the pleasure and honor of working
with Howard Hinnant Scott sure
Thursday morning's keynote speaker David
Schwartz who's chief cryptographer and
I'm gonna talk to you about a library
I've developed called beast so beast is
a header only C++ 11 or later library
that offers HTTP and WebSocket
implementations using boost SEO so boost
is a requirement is a dependency it
tries to emulate boost at SEO in every
way all of the interfaces resemble SEO
the documentation resembles a Zeo it's
got a lot of the same features it's in
the boost incubator and as soon as I get
home I'm going to submit it for a boost
review there's documentation tests and
sample code including a fully functional
web server and WebSocket server and the
good news is its production ready code
it's running on ripple production
servers there's a few other third
parties in the wild that are shipping
products using beast so I think it's
very robust I haven't heard any bug
reports yet surely they'll be coming
soon so that you might have seen this
brochure that I've been handing out that
has information about beast including
the link there's a box full of brochures
please feel free to grab one on your way
out okay so so why do we need HTTP and
WebSockets well here we have an HTTP
request in JavaScript this is built into
the language you can see it looks very
nice and here's the equivalent request
in C++ so it's been long enough we need
this thing it's a little bit
embarrassing that we don't have it yet
so I'm gonna give I'm gonna give the
talk broken up into two parts I'm going
to talk about WebSocket then we're going
to talk about HTTP and I'm going to show
you very tiny example programs
so for WebSocket beast establishes the
session for you it lets you send and
receive WebSocket messages and you can
use it to build clients or servers or
the interfaces are symmetric and it
offers both synchronous and asynchronous
interface
now I don't recommend that you build
production servers with the synchronous
api's but they're there for completeness
and for you know writing test programs
or getting up and running quickly the
performance is competitive its
production ready passes the autobahn
test suite so I'm gonna show you an
WebSocket echo example it's gonna
connect to a remote server handshake and
send a message and then receive and
print the the response the first thing
we need to do is connect to the remote
host now in this sample code the boost
ezio symbols are purple so the what we
need to do is establish our socket
connection so there's no beast code here
yet this is what you're familiar with
boost a Co we are resolving a DNS name
and then we're connecting to it using
boost as you know when this code is done
running we're gonna have a socket that's
connected and then it's going to be
ready to roll so now that we have our
connected socket we create the Beast web
socket stream which is a wrapper around
the socket the template argument tells
you the type of what it's wrapping in
this case it's an on owning reference to
a socket that could just as easily be an
SSL stream or an owning reference or
even your own user-defined type which
meets the requirements of sync or a sync
stream so we declare our variable now we
perform a WebSocket handshake which
consists of an HTTP request and response
sequence it's the HTTP upgrade message
beast handles that for you in the call
you tell it the hosts which becomes the
host field in the HTTP headers and then
slash is the URI that could be your you
know whatever your CGI /bin or whatever
you're using
so we handshake and now we write our
message so we're using a Zio's buffer
function which creates a constant buffer
sequence from a string beasts write
function takes any constant buffer
sequence that meets the requirements so
you can use all the things that you're
familiar with from ezio so we sent our
message now we want to receive a message
and print it out so we declare a stream
buff to hold the contents of the message
and and then a local variable of type
opcode which is an enum that tells you
if your receive the message is binary or
text that's part of the WebSocket
protocol so we call read when that
turns now we know if it's binary or text
and we have the data in our stream buff
so now we want to write that to standard
out to string is a beast utility
function that converts a constant buffer
sequence into a standard string so beast
comes with not only HTTP and WebSocket
but a really handy collection of utility
functions such as - string - it's beyond
the scope of this talk for me to go over
all the utility functions but they're in
there and they're in the docs so we got
our message and now we need to close the
WebSocket connection so this is a
protocol level closed in WebSocket the
connection is considered closed when
both sides send a close frame this is
doing that and beast' handles that for
you it manages the negotiation of those
messages you can tell it the code which
could be normal or an error or whatever
you want to tell the other side and and
then it closes the socket for you okay
so you saw the synchronous interfaces
that use exceptions but there's also
interfaces that use error codes just
like SEO and of course of the full suite
of asynchronous interfaces just like SEO
here we have an example that uses a
completion handler that takes the error
code which is just like SEO or you could
use a covert een stack full or stackless
standard futures or even your own
user-defined types as long as they meet
the requirements so this API is ready
for the networking specification I've
worked with Chris on making sure that
this is going to be right and it's gonna
be great okay so HTTP requests and
responses are used in the WebSocket
handshake so the library also exposes
those HTTP implementations to you so
that you can take advantage of it and do
HTTP in your own C++ programs so now I'm
going to show you a very short HTTP
example the scope of the libraries HTTP
support is to provide a universal
message container so that means it
offers a container that can store
complete HTTP message including the
headers the request or response specific
fields and also the message body the
container is usually copyable and
moveable and and it has everything that
it needs so so there's actually two
protocols for HTTP now there is the HTTP
one which
1.0 and 1.1 and HTTP to the current
implementation in beast serializes and
DC realises HTTP 1 messages only there
are future plans to do 2.0 it's not in
there yet
like the WebSocket you can build clients
or servers the interfaces are symmetric
there are synchronous and asynchronous
interfaces that work with any stream
concept like the IP TCP socket or SSL
stream the performance is ready for
production we have servers that are
using it it's great now one thing about
this library is that it's not really
targeted towards end-users it's targeted
towards library developers now what does
that mean that means that these
interfaces are low level it's not a
replacement for curl there are things
that it doesn't do like it won't decode
your your mime types or you know figure
out your multi-part message body but it
provides a foundation upon which the C++
community can build all of the HTTP
tools and implementations that other
languages have so I'm gonna show you an
example of doing an HTTP request in
response we're gonna connect to the
remote host we're gonna build a get
request and send it out and then we're
gonna receive the response and print it
okay first step just like before we need
to create create our socket and connect
to the remote host so we use boost as EO
to do that
there's no beast involved yet just like
before this code is gonna run we're
gonna have our socket that's going to be
nicely connected and then we're going to
be ready to rock and roll so we want to
send a request we declare the message
container so here we're declaring HTTP 1
container that is a request and the
template argument tells you the type of
the message body in this case there's no
message body so we say empty body which
is a special beast type that means hey
there's no body now we fill the fields
out the method is a string it can be any
string that you want hopefully the other
end will know what that is if it's get
you're gonna have a lot of success the
URL is another just a plain string
there's nothing fancy with the URLs you
just provide the string and that's it
version of 11 means HTTP 1.1 it's very
simple not there's no over-engineering
here
the user-agent is a required header 41.1
so we have to insert it okay so now we
have a complete get request and we want
to send it how do we send it well we
call right just like that there's our
socket now you can see there's a
function called prepare that's an
optional function that you can call
prepares a beast function that fills in
some information for you it does a
little bit of work for you like it'll
set the content length in this case to
zero it'll set connection keep alive or
connection closed according to your
preferences this is a little some
overloads that do things for you you
don't have to use it if you want
complete control over the HTTP message
you can have it again this is the
low-level library so it's designed to
let you do anything that you want so we
sent our request now we want to receive
the response so we declare an object of
type response this is going to be an
HTTP 1 response the template argument
tells us that the body is going to be
represented by a standard string which
is everyone knows how to use those it's
easy to print it's easy to understand so
that's what we're gonna do and now we
call read on the socket so after that
call returns we're gonna have a nice
response that's all filled in it's all
gonna be great now due to the way that
the parser works the implementation of
read can read pass the message and start
reading some of the next message for
performance reasons any of those extra
bytes that it had to read they're going
to be in the stream buffer and you reuse
them on the next call it all works so
beast message containers are streamable
to any standard Oh stream and it uses
the same D serialization algorithm
that it uses to write to the socket so
now you can see what they look like you
know and standard out it's great it's
useful for debugging ok
just like WebSocket you have
asynchronous interfaces for all the
functions they look just like SEO
functions they have the same limitations
and the same performance characteristics
here we have an example of doing a read
with the completion Handler that
completion token could be a co-routine
stack full or stackless a standard
future or your own user-defined type
that meets the requirements now there's
a lot of advanced features that I'm not
really able to cover right now for
example user-defined customizations of
the message body where you can define
not only your own type
container but also the algorithms used
to send and receive that body for
example you can have an HTTP message
whose body is incremental data that's
generated from a KO routine for example
a long-running database query you can
have that streaming out and it can be
either push or pull depending on how you
write it
you can have a read-only message body
such as serving a file from the hard
drive which is one of the examples that
beast comes with that web server has an
example of a message with the file body
so any HTTP library has to have a parser
if it's gonna deserialize requests and
responses and beast is no different it's
got a parser that's header only it's
modeled after the node.js parser which
is pretty cool pretty fast a lot of
people use it this parser is stateless
it doesn't allocate any memory and it's
totally self-contained so if you were to
get beast's parser and reuse it in your
own project without the rest of it I
won't be offended and it'll work for you
so in summary I would like to think that
if the author of boost SEO was to write
on HTTP or WebSocket library he would
write something whose interfaces looked
very much like this I have a couple of
extra minutes so I will just quickly
show you the performance of the parser
so everything in beast was designed to
be sensitive to performance it competes
very favorably this is what the message
container looks like you can see it's
very simple there's the headers and then
there's the body and there's a little
bit more but for exposition I've left
that stuff out you can check it out in
the repository so there's a box of
brochures if you after if you want to
talk to me or if you want to step up and
grab a brochure so you can get the URL
or you can see that sample code help
yourself to it and I appreciate the
great job that the organizers have done
and giving me the opportunity to present
beast to you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
