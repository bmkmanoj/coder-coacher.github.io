mal à des and I am a student computer
science student from the University of
Messina in Sicily and the C++ enthusiast
today I'm going to talk about a very
interesting code snippet that was
originally posted by Shaam parent on
Twitter and it is actually this street
right here how many of you are familiar
with this to it all right so it's a very
cryptic piece of code that actually
execute a callable object on a repast
argument other than analyzing this code
snippet we're actually going to expand
it and have it allow usage of generic
arity functions and also take a look at
supposes 17 fold expressions and make
back to make in order map functions that
will actually deduce the type of the
continuous from the past arguments so
let's begin by showing you a simple
example this is the code from tweet just
copy pasted and this is how it works we
call for each argument with a callable
object in this case a lambda generic
lambda here and some amount of arguments
any amount of our grants there they
don't have to be the same type they can
be any kind of type and if we run this
code segment we see that we get the
expected output and what it does is
practically called that lambda passing
every single argument as the argument of
the lambda that's basically it so it's
hard to understand written in that way
but if we actually rewrite the function
and try to understand what's going on
it's actually quite simple so the first
thing that's actually strange is this
initializer list here event that gets
casted to void and returned this is here
because we need a context where we can
expand our very attic templates
arguments using the ellipsis operator as
you can see in the signature of the
function that every 90 renamed ear we're
passing a function any kind of colorful
object by forwarding reference and an
any amount of parameters using a verdict
template we can actually expand this
back only in specific contexts such as
an initializer list or a sista array or
a generic variadic lambda so using
is an initializer list or a sister array
guarantees that the order of the
arguments is actually expanded from left
to right the first iteration of this
snippet posted by Shaam parent actually
used generic lambda and that doesn't
guarantee the order of evaluation so
this is why we have the initializer list
now as you can see this big piece of
code between the round parentheses is
what is going to get expanded by from
this ellipsis operator so we're going to
expand this a number of times that's the
same number of arguments we're passing
to the function and inside this piece of
code that is going to get expanded
thanks to the ellipsis operator we're
actually calling the function or
gullible object and forwarding one of
the arguments of the back now since this
is an initializer list event we actually
need to make this whole expression
evaluate to an int so that it can be
expanded a compiled from inside this
initializer list so we just use the
comma operator here to evaluate to an
end and that's basically it this is very
simple when you look at it this way but
it's very powerful so if you're still a
little confused this for our skull which
is the same as the previous example
roughly expands to something something
like this it's an insulator list event
and this is the parentheses that gets
expanded with the ellipses operator and
every time we expand a single argument
we're repeating the function we're
passing the argument to the function and
we're using the coma operator to
evaluate wint and all of these sorry all
of this is roughly the same as writing
this piece of code so it's a
compile-time expansion with no kind of
overhead it's very powerful and this is
the same example so there's no need to
run it let's move on to the second
example so this is the function without
any comment but with some formatting and
wet space it's very clean in this way
and you can see actually what's what's
happening so what is this useful for one
example idea is using is creating a make
vector function so like make array in
order make underscore functions this
will actually not require the user to
specify the type
of the items it will deduce the type of
the items from the items themselves so
the first problem we have is that we
need to deduce what type of container of
vector we're actually going to return
and to do that we're going to use STD
common type T so if you're not familiar
with this underscore T syntax it's
basically the basically sequels plus 14
introduced many versions of the original
tape type traits functions ending with
underscore T to avoid using type name
Collin Collin type it uses the using
syntax from CS plus 11 and it's just a
way to avoid writing column column type
at the end that's very noisy in terms of
syntax so this is what you would write
using CS plus 11 you needed type name
and cone cone type and now you can just
say at point or underscores here and
it's the same exact thing so it's just
syntactic sugar so we can use common
type T to actually get the correct type
that we're going to return inside of the
vector and we can we can instantiate the
vector with vector item which is a type
values for the common type now since we
know how many items we're actually going
to construct the vector week with we can
just reserve the memory in advance so
this is a small nice optimization and we
can do that using the size of ellipsis
operator which returns this the number
of very edek arguments passed to the
function now we actually need to emplace
back the items into the vector and
that's where for arcs comes into play we
simply use four hours to iterate over
the past arguments which are forwarded
here and our callable object is a
generic lambda taking a generic x by
forwarding reference and capturing the
vector and it's going to place back the
forward third argument inside the back
door everything clear ok and then we
just return the vector the cool thing is
that we can now just say auto-feed zero
for example make vector with some
arguments and it will deduce the tag
itself so this is roughly equivalent to
writing a CD vector event reserving the
memory and then placing back the numbers
145 so that's it we can statically
assert that the correct vector site is
being returned in this cases its back
prevent and we can do that with other
types for example which can scarce star
and it's going to get the correct type
as well and if we mix type like a city
string and cons carstar basically SCD
common type t will actually deduce the
most common type by checking the
possible implicit conversions so the
type that's that can be converted to all
the other types is the common type and
that's particular it so let's just
compile this segment to see the output
as you can see we get one two three four
five from the first vector here we get
hello everyone from the second vector
and we get hello word from the third
actor so before moving on and
implementing more interesting stuff we
need to digress a little and cover
compile-time injured integer sequences
and this is the feature that was
introduced in sickle cells 14 and it
will be very useful for the next code
segments so when writing template code
and meta programming it's very useful to
have contiguous compile-time integer
sequences because you often want to
access arrays and tuples using metal
programs so a compile-time and syllabus
14 actually standardize this into a type
called index sequences that can be
generated using STD make index sequence
so if we say using 60 equals STD making
text sequence of ten this will actually
construct a type a list of indexes that
goes from 0 to 10 non-inclusive so is at
least a compile-time list of numbers
that goes from 0 to 10 non-inclusive
this is useful because we can actually
specialize our templates to match the
index sequence so that we can actually
expand using the ellipsis operator every
single index and this can be used to
actually for example print an index
sequence using for arts so if we define
if we forward declare a template struct
here that takes a single type and we if
we specialize it with a very adik size t
template that actually matches an index
sequence containing those integer those
index stories we can actually print the
index sequence by expanding inside our
fur arts function
in the sequence itself which is actually
a very attic pack of arguments so by
doing that we can just call sick printer
with our previously Alice said 60 and
called print and it will actually print
the number from 0 to 9 so let's write
out and as you can see it works we can
also avoid using like an alias and just
call it make index sequence of 5
directly into the sick printer so as you
can see it works this is a very powerful
feature especially when dealing with
nested index sequences and we'll see
some of that in the next code segment so
what we want to implement now is a
function that will allow us to iterate
over STD topple elements so it is
heterogeneous iteration over a CD table
elements to do that we actually need
another helper function that would be
standardized in c++ 17 it's called apply
there is a proposal by peter stormare
lad which is here at the conference
which gives us a very basic
implementation and they roughly followed
the proposal to implement it so it is
composed by two different function we
have an implementation faction called
apply input and an interface function
called apply the interface function
takes a callable object and at apple and
what this the semantics of your funk
sure are that the elements inside the
table are unpacked and past all that
ones to the function so we'll actually
rename a CD chapel with the name of the
function and called it with all the
argument at school with all the
arguments at once to do that we actually
need an index sequence that will go from
0 to the size of the table so that we
can use STD get with the ellipses
operator and get every single element of
the table after calculating the index
sequence here we call our implementation
function forwarding or callable object
and forwarding or double and actually
creating an instance of indices that
will be matched not buy a template
specialization but by an overload so we
can actually get the the the inner index
list in this and in this order method is
this other approach which is also very
nice after we actually unpack the
indices we can just call a CD get we
unisys for every element of the top old
here and all of this is going to expand
to a city gate from zero to the size of
the table so all the elements of the
double and we can just call the function
we do said ellipsis operations inside so
what we're actually doing is unpacking
the values of the table inside the
function and calling the function and
this will be standardized is it is
already available in this test ed
experimental namespace so now we want to
iterate over the elements of a double
and do that we can actually mix our
apply function with our for art's
function so this is a quite interesting
what we do is we call apply passing this
lambda here this dinner generic lambda
here as your callable object and our
double will be forwarded to apply as
well so we unpack the elements of the
trouble inside a generic lambda jarek
periodic lambda taking any amount of
arguments that will forward the
arguments to four arcs alongside the
original color function so what we're
doing here we we are unpacking the
values of the table inside for arts for
arts is going to get every single value
of the table and forwarding a forward it
to our original function and this will
actually allow us to iterate over tuples
with a very convenient syntax using a
lambda jurek lambda so it's a very
simple implementation as you can see
here if we call for trouble with a
generic printer lambda here that caused
a cdc out and SED mcdouble what what's
actually actually happening is this
function here this printer function here
is getting cold with 10 then with hello
again with the 15 f float and then we
see not all at once like apply but
element / elements so we're actually
iterating over the tuple so this is
roughly equivalent to writing this
function here which is for arcs with
every element of the topple the thing
that for tablets doing is actually
unpacking the table elements inside of
four arcs so we get top alliteration if
we compile this code segment as you can
see we get the expected result and it's
pretty useful or if you didn't use this
kind of approach you would have to use a
compile-time template recursion
but nowadays we have boost Anna so just
go use Busan so now we're going to plant
something very interesting but also very
complex us first so for ours is very
useful but it is limited to do two unary
functions what if we want to actually
define the arity of our function as a
template parameter we can actually do
that and this folio implementation was
written originally on Stack Overflow by
Daniel fray and I've clean it up so what
happens here is that we actually need to
forward declare an implementation
function for our for our fore and aft
function and the main for an arts
function will be called by the user with
a narrative parameter that would be
actually defined by the user and
obviously we will pass a function and
the number of argument we will start by
using the number of arguments here using
the sides of ellipsis operator and we
actually need to statically assert that
the number of arguments is divisible by
the era t because we want to call the
decodable objects with arguments in
groups of RIT priority so if it isn't
actually divisible by RIT it is
impossible we will have some extra
arguments that will not that will not
get cold so we call the implementation
function with two different index
sequences here the first sequence will
actually eventually be from zero to the
number of function calls that will be
executed so if we have like ten
arguments and we're going to call that
binary function this will go from zero
to five because the binary function will
be called five times and everything will
use two arguments the second index
sequence will actually go from zero to
the arity of the function and this will
be using implementation function to
actually get the correct parameters the
implementation class has a static exact
method that will actually require the
collab of object and d all the elements
forwarded as a topple this can will
actually get optimized by the compiler
so there's no actual overhead here so we
remember we're passing these two index
sequences the function and a couple
containing all the arguments that we
pass the winter to the interface
function now we can define our
representation
function and we actually specialize over
the index sequences so I've called the
first one TN calls because it's the
number of function calls that will
happen and the second one is TN arity
because it's just from zero to the
average of the function the static exact
void will take the trouble by cons
reference and it will use the the
expansion hide IAM using not an
initializer list but a bull bull cystal
array other set to swallow for
readability and we actually do what we
did for fur arts we cast it to void and
inside of these contexts where ellipsis
operators expansion can take place we
repeat this expression here a number of
times equal to TN Colts so we're
actually defining sorry actually calling
our function TN cost I'm here this will
get expanded five times if we add ten
arguments and a binary function so
here's an example to understand what's
going on if we add this binary function
called FM and we call for an args with a
narrative to passing the function and
then four parameters here as you can see
they're not in STD pairs or in groups
they're just parameters and what's going
to happen in this expansion right here
is that for every code that needs to be
made to the function to actually swallow
all the arguments passed to the function
we're going to call X again with the
index of the function call x the arity
of the function defined by the user and
we're going to pass the function or
callable object and the table of the
elements that will actually be forwarded
as a top-load then we actually use the
comma operator to make the expression
evaluate to a ballot boolean so that it
will not so that the compiler will not
complain because we're using a bull see
cell array so as you can see we have two
calls to X second one will be called
with 0 and 1 will be called with two and
those are actually the starting indices
of our arguments so in scitech second we
will start from zero and we will go from
zero to tiara T which was
to and actually get the first and the
second argument in the second call we
will start from two and get the third
and the fourth arguments so this is the
ex second function which is another
implementation function and this is
where we actually call or color will
object using STD get of the base size t
template parameter which is actually
this number here in our example is zero
or m2 and we're going to add that to drg
so it goes so it actually takes the
correct parameters so again to
understand what's going on take a look
at this example expansion where we were
we actually call the function again with
four parameters and arity of two and
this first expression here that is in
the exact function will get expanded to
this and as you can see we're actually
getting the argument at position 0 and
the argument opposition 1 so 0 and 10
and this expands to a call to function
with 0 and 10 and the second expression
here will actually expand to a CD get of
2 plus 0 and 2 plus 1 so we're actually
getting 20 and 30 and this will expand
to a function call to 20 and 30 so this
is actually doing what what we want this
is grouping the elements together the
arguments together by arity and passing
them not one at a time but and at a time
to the collarbone object to see an
example of this in action if we call for
n args we are ready to and we pass a
binary printer function here that will
actually paint the product of two
numbers and pass arguments like 21 22 23
and 24 without any kind of explicit
explicit grouping like STD fair or an
initializer list it will actually do the
right thing and group the arguments
together at compile time so if we
actually execute this code segment we
can see that we actually get the correct
products of the number we passed eight
arguments to the function but we aren't
getting four because we define the rets
too we can do the same with any iot
because it is a
template parameters and in this case we
have an IV of 3 and we actually passing
a lambda here generic lambda here that
will some the arguments together and
print out the sound and passing
arguments in groups of three here like
11 12 to 2 and so on and as you can see
we will we get the expected result here
so this is interesting and let's see a
possible use case in the next code
segment is everything clear so far any
question okay so a possible use segment
for sorry possible use case for this
will be shown in this code segment and
we're actually going to implement a make
you know that map function like to make
vector function this one is not going to
require the user to explicitly say the
type of the map it will infer the type
of the map from the past arguments so
the first thing we have to deal with is
defining some kind of output that will
allow us to figure out the common type
for all the keys and the comment I for
all the values of the STD another map to
do that we're going to use C++ 14 index
sequences to divide the plastid
perimeter type parameter pack types in
two different packs so if our types the
arguments will be pass all at once so we
actually want to get some sort of
checkerboard pattern here where our
first index sequence will actually get
all the keys so this will be the indices
that we actually want and the second
index sequence will get all the values
after having those sequences we can
actually call STD common type T on those
specific sub sequences so that we can
get the common key type and the common
value type and then we can instantiate
the map so to do that we're going to
find to a struct called common kdl /
that will take a sequence and the number
of arguments and basically the sequence
will go from 0 to half the number of
arguments and it will figure out using
simple arithmetic and ellipses operator
expansions what the common the common
type of the keys are is sorry and the
common type of the value is so as you
can see here in the implementation we
match against the index sequence
remember that the index sequence goes
from 0 to help the number of our
we assert obviously that it is divisible
by 2 and now we're going to use a CD
chapel element T to actually get the end
type of the of DeBary addict back which
contains all of our arguments so we
define a simple address here taking the
indexes template parameter which is a
simple address for a CD table element t
that will actually call that will
actually wrap all of all of our argument
since an STD trouble and this will is
actually equivalent to the nth type of
the parameter pack and to get the key
tip the key type of all of our arguments
we call a CD common type key using type
at the index sequence that goes from 0
to half the number of arguments x 2 so
this basically calls common type key on
all the even parameters that were
passing to this to this helper class for
do value type will do the same thing but
actually call it with plus 1 here so
this will actually get all the odd index
set types of our arguments so that we
this way we can figure out the common
key type in the common by the type again
an example expansion of this is for
three arguments through generic
arguments is having the key type here
being expanded for with 0 2 and 4 so all
the even indices and the value type with
one three and five and six this is
common type key we can use this to
instantiate or map so we're going to
actually define some alice's here just
for syntactical sugar that will actually
get the common key type in the common
value type from the list of all the
arguments and we're just going to make
some little test here with static assert
so if we have a parameter pack with two
types the first type we will obviously
be the key and the second type will
object be the value and as you can see
the tests pass correctly and the power
of this is that you can have any number
of parameters without any kind of
explicit grouping so no STD pair no STD
tapal and it will actually figure out
what the keys are and the values are
based upon the position of the arguments
inside of the template parameter list so
in this case if we have a
this ring aunt SED string float const
char pointer and long it will actually
did use that the case that the key type
is string and it will deduce that the
value type is float so we can finally
implement make an order map it will
alius the common key type in the common
value type and it will use them to
instantiate a non-urgent map called
result again we actually know how many
items we're going to have inside the
unordered map so we can reserve the
memory advances mod optimization and now
we can use for n arcs with a binary
arity and our colorable object that will
be called for every group of two
arguments with VD generic lambda here
that will actually forward the key and
the value to the map someplace member so
this is actually I'm placing both the
key and the value and then we just
forward our arguments to the foreign
arts function so an example usage of
this make an order map function U is
shown here as you can see we have this M
and we're actually using string literals
here this is an STD string with value 0
is eNOS STD spring with value 1 this is
a normalcy style con scarce drink with
value 2 and here we have some numerical
values if we call make an order map and
then static assert the type of the key
and the value we can actually see that
the correct type is deduced and we have
string for the key and floats for the
value so this can be useful sometimes
where you don't want to explicitly have
the user decide what type of the map
should be and as you can see we can just
run the code the code segment here and
it will print 0 1 2 which is the
expected result so how much time is left
ok we have time to quickly look at fold
expressions so everything is sure sorry
yeah
I'm not sure actually so the question is
why r md the numbers printed us afloat
here well we are sure that they actually
floats because we statically assert at
the type of the map this value is float
so it's something it has something to do
with stdc out it's not part of their so
let's briefly look at fold expression so
everything you've seen here will be
useless in c++ 17 because we have for
the expressions and an example of that
is a compile-time way of checking if
compile-time boolean values are true
these this is a super sauce protein
implementation where we actually need a
compile-time recursion and integral
constant to check if old the past
interval constant bull values are true
and as you can see this gets quite
annoying because you need a base case
struct in a recursive case struct to
deal with the recursion but it works but
in C++ 17 we can just use fault
expressions which reduce the number
amount of co2 just this line so what
fold expression actually do is they take
a parameter pack an operator and
optionally a base value and they do a
fold operation over the parameter pack
and the operator with the base value
this is a concept very often used in
functional programming and it is roughly
equivalent to having recursion and
actually passing every single element
and and calling the operator between the
previous element and the current element
so just folding all the back of the
parameters with the single operator into
a single value that will actually be the
result of our computation so we can use
fold expressions with a set of operators
that the standards gives us and one of
those operators is actually the coma
operator so we can actually reimplement
for each argument the one unary function
with a simple fold expression here we
just call the function with the
parameter pack
the comb operator and the ellipsis
operator and this will actually do what
we implemented with for each argument
and what was in shambles Twitter so
that's the syllabus 17 way of
implementing for each argument what
about make vector so we can implement
make vector just like this we get the
common type T of the parameter pack we
reserve the memory and then in round
parenthesis we have the expression that
we want to be repeated which is and
place back with every single element of
the parameter pack we just put the
ellipsis operator here and it will
actually do a fold over the comm
operator and this is make vector so as
you can see it's three line of code very
simple what about the non-generic for n
arcs so the implementation is a lot
simpler than the previous one but I'm
still sure it could be improved what we
actually do here is we have a three-step
implementation the first step that is
actually the deeper step inside of your
implementation will actually call the
collarbone object getting the correct
elements from the forwarded table if you
remember in the previous implementation
we were passing all the arguments inside
the vault apple and this will be as
simple as using STD get with the start
index and and the index that represents
the arity of the function and the topple
so it will actually call the function
with an amount of arguments that's equal
to the RIT the second step will actually
use a fold expression over the comm
operator to call this first step here
for a foreigner for an art step using a
sequence that goes from zero to the
arity and in here will actually multiply
the the amount of function calls by dr g
as we did in the previous example and
actually passing the sequence that we're
going to use with STD get as a value
here so that we can get into as an
overload and unpack the index in the
indices inside of it in our third step
function and as you can see we don't we
don't need all that compile-time
recursion that we add in the previous
implementation can just fold over to
come operator and that's the same thing
now in the interface function it's very
similar to the one in the previous code
segment we just forward the arguments as
a couple and we pass this double to
foreign arcs expansion with the desire
of diuretic and that's basically it so
some examples here very simple for
example we are using for an arc Sweden
arity of two here to our print wrapper
which basically just prints the
arguments and it will print the
arguments in groups as expected as you
can see zero one two three four five and
six seven and the same with an average
of three and it will print the arguments
in groups of three here so that's
basically it thanks for attending if you
