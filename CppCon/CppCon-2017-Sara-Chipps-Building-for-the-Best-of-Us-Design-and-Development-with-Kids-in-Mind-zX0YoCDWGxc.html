Which I think is when we're starting.
I want to be prompt.
Everyone's been really
prompt in this conference.
So I don't want to be
the first one that's not.
I hope you guys have
had a great conference
since wrapping up.
I've had a great week.
This is probably the smartest group
I've every been surrounded by.
So I think I'm gonna
continue coming to these.
Because they always say you want to
be the least intelligent
person in the room.
So, today we're gonna
talk about programing
and building interfaces for kids.
It's a little bit about me.
My name is Sara, I live in New York City.
I am the CEO and co-founder
of a company called Jewelbots.
I'm gonna tell you a little
bit about what we built.
How we built it and why we built it?
Who uses it?
So today's talk.
So we're gonna talk about why
I think this group of people is important
that we build for.
And why it's important that we make
technology accessible for them.
I'm gonna show you guys some magic.
We have some special guests here today.
We're gonna do a deep dive into the tech
behind Jewelbots.
Actually pretty high technology.
And look into how we built an
accessible API for C++ for kids.
So first I have some questions.
Raise your hand if you
are under 20 years old
when you learned to code.
Whoa, look around.
Okay, keep them up.
Keep them up.
Put your hand down if you were over 15.
Over 15 years old.
Okay, put your hand down
if you were over 13.
Put your hand down if you're
over 11 when you learned.
So look around.
There's about 10% of you left
of people that learned to
code before they were 11.
Which is interesting, right.
This is something I learned
when I started talking to my peers.
So I've been a software
developer for 16 years.
I worked in the field five years
before I worked with
another female on my team.
And it was another five years after that
until I worked with another one.
And I was bummed because
I really love doing this
and I think this is an awesome career.
And I think that this is something that
lot's of people should know how to do.
And so the bug bit me and I was like.
I've got to figure out a way to get more
women doing this because this is amazing.
And so I started a non-profit in 2010
that taught adult women how to code.
Girl Develop It is in 50 cities
and we've taught almost a
100,000 women at this point.
But one thing I heard from all of my.
Not all, many of our students
was I didn't know what an engineer was
until I got to college.
And by then it was too late.
Other people already
knew what they were doing
and I didn't want to inject myself
in something I knew nothing about.
So I decided to start taking a look
into this group of young girls.
Why some men are learning
when they're younger.
Why aren't the same thing
happening with women?
So, some things I learned
during my research
were really interesting.
This demographic of
people is one of the most
influential demographics.
And that sounds crazy to most people.
But I'm gonna show you
a little bit about why.
Raise your hand if you
know who that guy is.
Anyone know that guy?
Alright, that guy used to be this guy.
(laughing)
Until, 19 14 year old
girls discovered wow.
He is in Teen Beat and he is the best
and he's gonna be a celebrity.
And that's why we know who he is today.
What about this guy.
Okay, well this guy used to be this guy
and I can say that I.
Not single handedly but I was definitely
int he group of young girls that made
this guy into a big celebrity as well.
Taylor Swift, I mean.
We don't have to argue.
It's not men in their 40's that are like.
Such great music.
(laughing)
I mean you still do but.
(laughing)
But even bigger than that.
Platforms that you and I use everyday.
Instagram, Snapchat, Musical.ly.
They're early adapters
for these platforms.
We're not the ones discovering them.
They won't tell you that
unless you talk to people that work there.
Because that's not technically legal.
But it's kids that's finding these things
and making them into huge successes.
So why don't we give more
respect to this group?
We know that all professions.
You know, every conversation
that we've had this week
is how much more
technology is being built?
How many more technologist
that we need in the future?
However, this group still today.
18% of computer science graduates.
19% of AP computer science test takers.
15% of Google's technology group.
And 51% of Americans are female.
So why is that happening?
So, I did a little more research.
First of all, boys get the coolest toys.
Boys toys are all about building
and creating and inventing.
There's stuff for all ages really.
Especially that pre-teen range.
There's some brands that really own it.
Especially Nerf, Nerf
is probably the biggest
for that group.
But there is some more advanced Legos.
You start playing with
helicopters, things like that.
The hand held devices.
Looking at the things we built for boys.
We send a really clear message about
what we're trying to teach them.
But when it comes to the
things that we build for girls,
they're consumables.
They're here, play with this phone.
Or here, have this tea set.
It's not like you're gonna
build tea sets when you grow up.
And also, in that age nine
to fourteen year old range.
There's not a lot of products.
And there's definitely nothing doing well.
I contribute that to the fact of girls
much younger are giving dolls.
So it used to be that
almost up until high school
you would play with dolls.
And now, younger and younger
they're getting over dolls
and they're just turning to smart phones.
And there's no products
really for that age group.
Which is something we
found is an opportunity.
So we talked to 200 girls
and let me just tell you how fun that was.
So the way we did that is we
started talking to teachers
and we were like.
Let's do some introduction
to programming classes
for you guys.
We know that you don't have any resources.
And in exchange we're just
gonna ask your students
to answer some questions for us.
And we went in there and we
heard some really cool stuff.
My first idea was I was
like, here's what we'll do.
We'll make a bracelet.
It'll change color to match your outfit.
So you wake up in the morning
like I want to wear blue.
Program my bracelet to be blue.
I was like this is what they'll love.
And so I started running that past them.
And they were like that sounds stupid.
I would never wear that.
And we were like oh, okay.
It's a great age group
cause they'll tell you
exactly what they think.
And so when we started talking to them
and the thing that came up
over and over and over again.
Which is friendship.
Like my friends are so important.
I spend all this time with my friends.
You know like this is my best friend.
This is my other best friend
and so that theme kept coming up.
And understanding that.
It's the time in their life when they are
developing those friendships.
And they are already.
All of them are wearing
friendship bracelets.
The analog kind but still
friendship bracelets.
We were like, okay.
Well maybe this is what we do.
We're a small team but we spend
a lot of time white boarding.
Kind of thinking about what
this device would look like.
And what we landed on were Jewelbots.
So Jewelbots are smart
programmable friendship bracelets.
There's an active online community
where girls can share
code that they write.
They let you send secret
messages to your friends.
So basically out of the box
there's still super fun.
Things like Minecraft and MySpace, Neopets
and all the things that inspire coders
to move on to become software developers.
They all start fun and
then you can code them.
So we thought that part
was really important.
You don't have to code
them right out the box.
Often parents are like.
What am I gonna do when
my kids use Jewelbots
to cheat on their tests?
And I'm like if you're
kids are writing C++
to cheat on their 7th grade English test.
Then that is awesome.
(laughing)
And so we tell them that they can
give their devices super powers with code.
So while prototyping process.
It took us three years, almost three years
to get to the point where we
were able to ship product.
We learned a lot from people
who had done this before.
That's just kind of like an iteration of
all of the different
designs we went through.
Different bracelet types we thought about.
We learned all types of things such as.
It turns out wrists on kids
are all different sizes.
Right, there's not one
size wrists for kids.
So some of the designs we
thought from the beginning
were a good idea weren't.
And then other things.
We heard from parents.
Oh that looks cheap.
I wouldn't pay for that.
And so that was other input
that we got as we were building.
And so that's kind of like the looks like.
So what we learned is when
you're building these things.
I know not everyone here has
built a consumer product.
I'm sure a lot of us played with Arduino.
It's not the same.
I thought it was which is why
I started to build a consumer product.
But it turns out to be much, much harder.
So we start with a looks like prototype
and a work likes prototype.
So works like is like your Arduino's.
Making something that works like
what you ultimately want to build.
And then you make something
that looks like something
you want to build.
And then the prototyping process
of just bringing these
guys closer together.
So while we're iterating on
the look feel of the outside.
We were iterating on the look
and feel of the inside too.
Which I'll show in a second.
One thing to note is I hate the flower.
So we came up with dozens
and dozens of designs
for the initial thing.
And from the beginning
we've always been like
these girls decide what we build.
We're not gonna decide.
So dozens of pinwheels, stars.
We had everyone vote.
The flower won by a landslide.
Nothing was even close.
And I was like, man.
Now I have to build a programming product
and tell people it's gonna help
girls because it's a flower.
Everyone's gonna freak out.
But so far everyone's been
really great about it.
People love the flower.
So this is what the inside
kind of has looked like
as we've been building it.
We've got some.
It's been really big and big battery.
And then its gradually gotten smaller.
Until we now we've got this little guy.
I'll talk a little bit about
more how we've distributed
and how that has done in a few minutes.
But now I think it's time for a demo.
As I like to say, some magic.
So raise your hand if you're
coming to the workshop later
and you'd like to be friends with me.
Okay, alright.
Want to come up Michael.
(laughing)
So great.
Okay so this is a Jewelbot.
So we're gonna play with our Jewelbots.
We're gonna pair ours.
So we're friends now.
- [Man] It was so easy.
- So easy.
(laughing)
I'm getting married in New York next year.
So you're gonna be able to come to that?
- [Man] Absolutely.
- Okay great.
- [Man] I am now.
- Yeah.
- [Man] Does it matter?
- No it doesn't matter.
Alright, so we're gonna pair
ours so we can be friends.
So the way we're gonna do that
is we're gonna hold down the
center button for two seconds.
One locomotive, two locomotive.
And now what's happening is they're.
Oh, they already found each other.
So now we have to pick a friendship color.
Which one do you like?
- This is almost too much stress.
I don't know, that one.
(laughing)
- Okay, so what happens
is now I picked green
for our friendship color.
So now this guy is telling this guy.
Okay we're gonna be green.
And now whenever Michael
and I are together
we're gonna be green together.
Yours is gonna light up in a second.
So awesome, so now you're green.
Okay great, you can go sit down.
We'll need you later.
But, you can go sit down.
(clapping)
Okay so that's the
friendship functionality.
We need one more.
Alright, in the back.
Imagine we're in middle school.
(laughing)
- [Man] It's not too large of a jump.
(laughing)
- I'm Sara.
- I'm Nicole.
- Nicole, nice to meet you.
You can come to my
wedding next year as well.
Okay, great.
Let's get this on.
Okay, so we're gonna do the same thing.
So you're gonna hold
down the center button.
Make sure you hear it click.
Whoops, you just turned it on sorry.
You're was off.
Okay, now you're gonna hold
down the center button.
Which is one locomotive, two locomotive.
Okay, so now they're finding each other.
I'm controlling it again too.
What color do we want to be?
- That one.
- Okay, we're gonna be red.
So now my guy is saying,
okay we're gonna be red.
And you're guy is gonna
say, alright we're red.
And so what's gonna happen
is yours is gonna be red.
Mine is gonna be green and red.
Because the way we wanted
to work it in a way.
This is kids so we wanted to make sure
they're definitely giving a thumbs up
to the fact that they're pairing.
So, Nicole you can sit down
and I'll call you back up later.
Okay, so that's how Jewelbots
work out of the box.
You can send each other messages.
Things like that.
But I am not the leading
expert on coding them.
This is my next favorite.
I learned about this later.
So if you ask me about
the fact that I would be
giving talks with kids talking
about C++ a few years ago.
I would have told you that's crazy.
But I'm here to tell you that it's not.
I'm gonna introduce our
first special guest today.
Samaa.
Samaa is local to the area.
She's an amazing coder.
Acquaintance, friend of Melinda Gates.
An awesome community activist.
And she's gonna come talk to you
a little bit about Jewelbots.
- Hi, I'm Samaa and today
I'm going to talk to you
about Jewelbots.
So , Jewelbots is a
programmable friendship bracelet
that is aimed at girls in
their pre-teens and teens.
It is really a great introduction to STEM.
Especially if you're a
beginner like myself.
And you might be wondering
what is a friendship bracelet?
A friendship bracelet is basically a way
that girls can share
a token of their trust
and signify their friendship.
By mixing and matching bracelets.
Jewelbots is like that but better.
Because you actually can program it.
And you can speak with your friends
with morse code via Bluetooth.
Jewelbots is programmable
using a language C++.
Here is an empty sketch in Arduino IDE.
And Arduino IDE is a
service for developers
who can program using Arduino boards.
Here is actually an
example of the first code
that I ever wrote.
Okay, so now that you know a
little more about Jewelbots.
Let's talk about some of the components.
There are five main components.
You have your LED's.
So LED's are basically the lights
that are turning on on your Jewelbot.
You have your timers which you
can use to control your code.
Animations, which is when
the LED can actually.
What's the word?
Pulsate in a sequence with one color.
Like it could be blue or green or magenta.
You have buzzers which are basically
when the Jewelbot buzzes.
And then you have buttons.
I forgot to mention the
Jewelbots haptic device.
But then you have buttons so that
you can press a button and then
your code will enact after that.
So now that we've talked
a little bit about that.
Let's talk about the code
you can actually write
using these components.
So here is a pomodoro timer that I wrote.
And the arrows you can
see some of the components
I was talking about.
And if you don't know
what a pomodoro timer is.
A pomodoro timer is a
basically the idea of
30 minutes of work and
then a five minute break.
This is really great for
a student such as myself.
Because sometimes you have
that big homework assignment
but you still need to take that break
and stretch your legs and
maybe check your phone.
(laughing)
So here is a much more shortened example.
This is shortened to five minutes.
But basically every few
seconds it's gonna flash green
so that I know my timer is starting.
Okay, so let's actually
write a hello world.
So, you'll notice there is set up in loop.
Set up is basically where
you're going to have your code
but it's only going to run once.
Loop is when your code
will run in infinite
amount of times as long
as the Jewelbot is on.
Today we're gonna write in loop.
So first we want to declare our variables.
Timer, okay.
And now let's call our function.
So we're just gonna write a simple little
turning on the lights.
So LED.
Turn on all, okay.
And then timer.
So we want to choose how long the lights
are gonna stay on
because otherwise they're
just gonna turn off really fast.
So let's do five seconds.
But you'll notice.
So you might wonder why
there are three zero's.
Well, the Jewelbot timer
understands it in milliseconds.
So the way we're gonna write it is
it's really five seconds.
But we just have to add
those three extra zero's
for our code to work.
So now we want to verify our code.
Uh oh, we have an error.
So as you can see.
This is a colon instead of a semicolon.
Oops, and so now we're
gonna verify it again.
What, oh.
Oh I see, sorry.
Sometimes.
(chuckle)
Oh yeah, okay.
Sometimes we make errors.
So, okay.
And now you can see that works.
So if we were gonna do this
normally we would upload it.
But I don't have my Jewelbot
plugged in to my computer right now.
Let's look at timers.
So as I was talking before
about pomodoro timer
I'm just gonna walk
through the code with you.
So you'll notice that actually.
The code is not under set up or a loop.
When you're incorporating button press
you're gonna put the
code under your button.
So we have all five of the components
we were talking about before.
How it's gonna start is that
we have timer pause one second
after we turn on Jewelbot.
And then it's gonna buzz four times
because we have a four loop.
Then after that it's gonna
buzz four times long.
So now we're knowing, okay.
Our code is activated and
it's gonna turn on all green.
And then for about 30 minutes or so.
Every 30 seconds it's going to flash green
to show us that, okay.
Our code is still working
and our timer is still going.
And we still have to focus.
And then we can check our phone.
And at the end we have a
animation be single color blue.
And I think.
Yeah, I did explain animation.
But I'll just explain them again.
So animations are
basically when your LED's
are going to pulsate.
And then it ends.
And I know, okay.
Now I can take my five minute
break and stretch my legs.
Let's go back to our presentation though.
So, now that you know a
little more about Jewelbots.
I'm gonna talk to you about why
I personally love Jewelbots.
When you buy a Jewelbot
you really are becoming
a part of a really great community.
Becoming part of Jewelbots.
There are so many people
who are so excited
to get girls into STEM.
And to learn about STEM themselves.
And really just learn how to code.
I know that through Jewelbots
I've even made friends.
Such as Eleanor right here.
And I really got to learn how to code
and be part of the coding community.
In fact once Sara and
Naquimby had Google Hangouts
and we really just got to learn actually
how to code a game together.
So it's just really
just a great community.
I also love Jewelbots because
I get to code with my dad.
So my dad is a computer programmer
and I've never really
understood what he does.
I mean I knew he codes
but I didn't really
understand what he did.
And through Jewelbots I've got
to understand a little better
and learn what he does in programming.
So this is us programming
for the first time together.
Programming Jewelbots for
the first time together.
And then we actually share our codes.
So are there any Whovian's in this room?
(clapping)
Whoo.
So this is awesome.
The Dr. Whovian convention in Seattle.
And you can't see it here
but we actually programmed our Jewelbots
so that they would flash white and blue
like the pulsating colors of the Tardis.
(clapping)
So, okay.
So now that you know all this.
Maybe you want to check out Jewelbots.
Maybe you have one
and you just want to know how to use them
or cool things you can do.
So I have a few sources.
So I was talking about the community.
There's the community forums
where you can talk and you can share code.
Sometimes they even have fun questions
like once they had what's
your favorite show?
What's you favorite color?
You can become an ambassador on there.
So totally check that out.
There's the Jewelbot Zine
where they actually have a magazine
where you can look at
a bunch of cool things.
I actually got the chance to tell my story
in one of the recent issues.
So you should totally check those out
and you can learn about apps
and a bunch of cool STEM related things.
There is my blog bits
of coding imagination.
If you know a girl or have a daughter
or a teenager who really is
into coding or has a Jewelbot.
You should totally go check out my blog
because I talk about different
programs you can write.
I explain a little bit about Jewelbots.
I actually have a fall
program coming up soon.
So you should totally check that out.
And then there's Laura and
Louisa's learning blog.
Where I learned at medium.com
and you can learn about
functions and variable there.
So I hope that with what you've learned
from my presentation
and Sara's presentation
and Eleanor's presentation.
What's coming soon.
That you will go tell
others about Jewelbots.
Maybe get one yourself and
really hashtag code like a girl.
Thank you.
- I'm Eleanor and I am
a Jewelbots ambassador.
So I also am a competitive swimmer.
I travel the world a lot.
And I also play Lacrosse.
So what's an ambassador?
A Jewelbots ambassador is a user
who uses Jewelbots to spread
the word to other girls.
And get them interested in coding.
But why Jewelbots?
Why not teach your girls how to code
the same way we teach boys how to code?
Well, Jewelbots is made
by girls, for girls.
And it's specifically
made to teach us in a way
that interests us.
Like through friendship.
Like Sara and Samaa already explained.
So C++ for kids?
(laughing)
The Jewelbots Arduino boards
are very easy to understand.
And even kids of the age of eight
have already learned how
to code their Jewelbots.
And even if you don't
understand it very well.
They have instructions on their website
that you can use if you need help.
They have two different boards
which is the solo coding board
which I'll explain in a second.
And the friendship coding board.
The solo coding board you use by yourself
if you just want to code
to code your Jewelbot
to not react when it's
around your friends.
And then the friendship
coding board you can use to.
You can use your code and make it so that
when your friends are around
and it's that specific color group.
Your code will run when
you're around them.
So let's talk about the solo coding board.
There are five different functions
like Samaa already explained.
And in the LED function you can code
the four LED's to light up individually.
Or you can code them to
light up all at once.
There are also LED animations
which she already explained.
But there are two others.
To just the three single color.
One is an animation that's
based off of the Jewlbots logo.
Where it flashes their colors and buzzes.
And then there's also the rainbow sequence
which just flashes a ton of
different lights and a rainbow.
And then there's also the buzzer function
which Samaa already explained.
Where they have preset buzzer
functions which you can use
whereas they couldn't code
for different amount of times.
And there's also a custom buzzer
where you can choose the
strength at which it plays
and the length.
There's the timer which is
pretty self explanatory.
You can choose it to
make breaks in your code
and to keep LED's on for
however long you want
and then make them turn off.
And then there's the button
which Samaa already explained
where you can.
You're code will run when
you press the button.
So the friendship coding board
is pretty much the same
as a solo coding board
but it runs when you
you're friends of that
specific color group are near by
and it uses if-then
statements in Bodleans.
So here's some pictures of my code
and there are some examples in there.
For instance, over here.
I'm turning on different LED's.
They're all in at once but
they're all in different colors.
So this one's kind of meant to be like
seeing the cycle of the
sun and the moon rise.
So the yellow represents the sun
and the blue just represents the sky.
And eventually the yellow
instead of being yellow
it turns white which is the moon.
This is one of the
programs I did a while ago.
I'll show it in just a second.
And then this one's my most recent code.
It uses the friendship coding board.
Whenever your friends in
that color group are nearby.
It's kind of like a doorbell.
So it flashes in one color
then it flashes in the other buzzer
and it buzzes when one lights on
and then it buzzes when
the other lights are on.
Oh gosh I'm on the wrong slide.
Oh no.
So here's some of my code in action.
These are videos.
And this is my first code that I ever made
where this was way back when
when we had just started out.
And I think that we had to work through
making all of the LED's light up at once.
And I had made these two light up blue
and these two light up red.
This is the code that was in
the middle on my other slide.
Where is, well hopefully.
I don't think the sounds on.
But it buzzes and lights
up in different colors.
And then eventually it will light up
in the Jewelbots animation.
And then it will light
up in other colors again.
And then this code is the code I just made
where it's the cycle.
The sun and moon.
I think I accidentally filmed it
when my Jewelbot was upside down.
So, it's kind of going
in the wrong direction.
Yeah.
I don't think it's gonna play.
But I think that the coolest thing by far
that Jewelbots have done is made it so
that kids at the age of eight.
And some even a little
bit younger than that
know how to code now.
And I think that that's
just really, really cool.
And I hope that you
guys all think the same.
So this product is amazing
and I'm glad you guys all game to this.
So bye.
(clapping)
- So, they show you how they
work and how they get coded.
So I'm gonna tell you a little bit how
we approach design and
building an API for kids.
And making sure it was
accessible for everyone.
So a little bit more about the technology.
So these are a whole bunch of
different plastics and nylon.
The cap is made with
injection molded plastic.
And the body is made
with a weird CNC process.
I don't quite understand.
And the hardware lives inside.
The bands are interchangeable.
You get some different
colors which is neat.
Hopefully down the road we want to
make all different kinds of designs.
And then inside we've
got a button 4 RBG LED's.
A USB, input and this nRF51822.
And let me tell you the story about how
this became the chip that we used.
This is from someone.
Who here has built hardware?
Consumer hardware.
Yeah, this is probably the most people
I've seen at a conference
that has actually done that.
So let me tell you the story here.
So I was at a sales session
with a Nordic representative.
And I knew what we wanted to do.
I knew it was really
important that there be
a device that connects to
a bunch of other devices.
And I had heard of this intel chip
that could do three
simultaneous relationships
either peripheral.
Either serve as a peripheral
or serve as a central device.
And this guy told me about their new chip
which had eight.
Which allowed you to make eight
simultaneous relationships
both central and peripheral.
Which is nuts.
I was so stoked about that.
And I was like this is it.
This is our chip.
Here are the things the did not say.
He did not say that no
had used it in production.
It was to even an alpha yet.
And it wouldn't be for about two years.
So we include this on all our designs
and when we were getting.
We were helping them debug
data sheets the whole time.
Just being like oh, so this doesn't work.
And they'd be like, oh yeah.
That's totally wrong.
Sorry, we've known about that.
We're like okay, could you tell us.
That would be great.
(laughing)
That was an adventure and a half.
So just more of the details of
what's on the microprocessor.
It's super small in here.
It was important that
the device fit on wrists.
So we had to go with something super tiny.
Microprocessor is four
millimeters by four millimeters.
Super small.
The joke I make there is
always you could eat one.
You would never know.
You would never know that you ate it.
But this tiny guy can do lots
of really interesting things.
So the capability here is really neat.
The Jewelbots have the same
capability as an Apple Watch.
Just doesn't have a screen.
Not the new one though.
It can't make phone calls.
Kind of ruined that for me.
So it can connect to a
bunch of other Jewelbots
at the same time.
It can connect to your Amazon Alexa.
It can connect to your phone.
It can connect to a drone.
Worse way to control a drone but who knows
what your life is like.
(laughing)
But right now, we're
limited to the functionality
that we showed you today.
And I'll talk a little bit more
about how we designed that.
So Jewelbots paired to
each other using BLE.
They react to other Jewelbots
when they are in range
as you saw before.
Enable you to communicate.
So in order to send a
message I just hit a button
and it rotates through my
different friends that are nearby.
So I'm gonna pick my green friend.
And somewhere in the next 30 seconds.
Tell us when you get the message.
Yeah, okay great.
(laughing)
So and you can code them using
Arduino programming environment.
So rather than write our own IDE
which an insane thing to do.
We wanted to use something
that people might be used to.
So Arduino is one of them.
We're working on visual studios support.
Visual studio just added Arduino stuff
and we just need to know
that our boards work
with visual studios.
That's something down the road.
We just rolled out the Jewelbots app
which is pretty simple right now.
It's makes a set up
for your devices easier
so you don't have to be
in front of a computer.
The instructions that
come with the Jewelbots
basically say here's how you turn it on.
Go on the internet to
find out how to set it up.
Because when we had to
finalize instructions
we were still building firmware.
So we were like man, we don't really know.
We hope that this works
like that but we don't know.
So our instructions are online
and it's good cause we release updates.
So we can just update the instructions.
It's built with Cordova and Ionic.
So Ionic/Cordova has great support
for Bluetooth is the thing.
There's a really neat
library that allows you
to do great things that are more.
Less opaque than the native apps.
So that's why we use them right now.
It's only on iPhone.
Okay, so those folks who
haven't done this before.
Basically the microprocessor
lives on a bigger board.
Like you saw and there's
components all around the board.
And the microprocessor
sends communications
to all the components on the board
using electricity and
patterns and a timer.
Which sends certain messages
and tell it when to go on.
And when to turn off.
And so that's basically
how that part works.
And so that's the really low level stuff.
And then a level on top of that is C code.
And the reason why we're using C
is because this is a tiny chip
and there's no room for a compiler.
So we can't use things like
Python or anything like that.
That would be easier to write.
A lot of program appearance.
None at this conference cause
you guys already know this.
Other conferences will say why
don't you use Ruby on Rails.
It's so much easier for
kids and this is why.
So you already saw on how the LED's work.
But the code for making this
firmware looks like this.
So basically no matter
what component you're using
you're sending this type of message
to tell things when to turn on.
And that uses the same
function to turn things.
To send messages back
to the microprocessor.
So this is what we are
not gonna open up to kids.
We did not think that this
would be the interface
to tell people coding for the
very first time how to code.
So knowing that this is
what we were working with.
We did our own level of firmware
in order to control the components.
And then on top of that added the API
that they could control the components.
So when it came to things
like working with LED's.
We created state handler for LED's
knowing that we would
be controlling the LED's
with the next level of code, the C++.
In order to give access to the kids.
And so that looks like
something like this.
So we give them functions
that have real world names
that sound like English.
Like LED.turn light on.
And things like that.
And now as far as different colors.
We weren't gonna give them the addresses
to put in to tell them how to control RGB.
So we were like what can we do?
So we picked a series of
colors that we thought
they might want to play with.
I think there's eight.
So we gave them access to
things like magenta and green.
The things that they
would want to use often.
On my list of get more colors though.
Cause there's only eight.
This was a very heated
discussion within the team
and I still think we chose wrong.
Because it was either
give the LED's positions
which I don't think that kids are sitting
there being like okay.
North of my device is.
Or numbers but I lost this argument
so it ended up being position.
And so when they are
deciding which LED to use
instead of again giving an address.
They're giving things
like northeast southwest
and that kind of thing.
And then I don't know
if you can read that.
But that's how we give the API.
We give them for LED positioning
and the different labels for the colors
that they can use in
their functions whenever.
And that makes something
that looks like this.
I don't know if you guys.
I don't know if you guys can see that.
But basically it's LED turn on single.
LED turn on all.
This is a lot of the
functions that you saw
Eleanor and Samaa talking about.
And then I was gonna do a
coding demo for you guys
but you've already seen that.
And so for the animations we figured that
kids would want to write animations.
Like have things accessible
that they could use whenever.
And of course rainbows was
the first thing we thought of
cause they're awesome.
And then the ability to
let the lights breathe.
So we gave them that too.
So this is just kind of how we
write the code for animations
on our end and then we abstract it out
so that they can use just simple commands.
Like animation.rainbows and
then they're ready to go.
And then things like the button.
It's interesting stuff.
So one thing that was.
The reason we have two different boards.
The friendship board and the solo board
is because as you saw
friendship functionality
is set up by pressing the button.
Holding down the button.
Different things like that.
We wanted to make it
clear that if you want to
be in friendship mode.
You don't want to overwrite
those button presses
to make it confusing, right.
Cause if you overwrite the button press
of holding it down two seconds.
Then the end user expects
to be able to still do that.
However they've written
code that overwrites
and is not very obvious.
So we set that up into
two separate boards.
They understand this is the board I use
if I want to play with friends.
This is the board I use if I
want to control everything.
And so the board that
they code for friends.
You have access to much less.
As far as you can't do a long button press
or anything like that.
And so only event base
programming is the button
and then in there they
can put different things
like LED's and using
the buzzer and the timer
and things like that.
Okay, so now this part is
where we're gonna go back
to our two lovely volunteers.
So friendship code is my
favorite part of this.
Because you can code your device
to react in certain ways
for certain friends.
So on our end the way
it works in the Jewelbot
is these guys are constantly
polling the room for Jewelbots.
So their like is there a Jewelbot around?
Is there a Jewelbot around?
It it my friend?
And once it sees a friend
that's when I turns on.
And so what we figured
they would want access to
is the first time I see a friend.
Or when I see certain friends.
So we set up the API's so it's
if I see my friend do this.
If I see my blue friends do that.
I'm going to exit out of here.
I'm gonna open up a new
one cause I think I.
So we give some examples
for friend color group.
I think this is a blank one.
Too many people.
Okay, so.
I'm going to code this.
So when I see my green friends
and I see my red friends.
I get a bunch of rainbows.
So right here if you can see the code says
seeing green friends and first time green.
I get a bunch of rainbows.
So I'm going to add these guys.
I think I got too many parenthesis there.
Oh great.
I want to remove this.
I don't need these guys either.
Okay so I'm going to do this and then.
I'm just gonna add my red in here too.
Okay see red.
Okay so the way I code my Jewelbot
is I take off the cap and I
plug in the micro USB cable.
This is what you get
with like your Android.
And then to put it into coding mode.
Into a boot loader.
So it will accept code
from my Arduino IDE.
I hold down the button for two seconds.
Until it flashes purple.
In our design colors is very important
at figuring out what colors mean what.
And then what I do is I first make sure
I'm on the right port.
And then I upload my code.
So this is time consuming.
The upload part.
The Arduino IDE is
something that we really
don't have control over.
But there's a lot of people
working on making it better.
It's an awesome tool as far as
something that's open source.
And something that anyone can use.
So it works like a regular Arduino.
It from up to the device.
Here I'll make this bigger so you guys
can see what's going on.
And then once it uploads.
Actually I'm gonna ask
you guys to do this now.
Can I ask you guys to go out in the hall
until your Jewelbots turn off.
Sorry what did you say?
(chatter)
Lights, oh you saw lights yeah.
Okay great.
So when it's done coding
you'll get a rainbow.
Which you just saw.
And so, alright once they're
gone I'm gonna unplug.
Okay so when they come in
we should get some rainbows.
Okay, you guys can come in.
Someone may need to go get them, yeah.
So we see one already.
- [Man] It's off right now, so.
- Okay.
- [Man] Hopefully when they come in.
- Yeah.
Rainbows.
(clapping)
Okay, live coding man.
Thank goodness that worked.
(laughing)
Alright, so a little
bit about where we are
now that the product.
We have found out that we
have a 44% conversion rate
from people that just play
with these guys to coders.
It was a lot higher than we had hoped.
But we're really happy about that number.
And we have almost 10K units.
Next month we'll hit a 10,000 unit.
Which means there are 10,000 units
in 25 countries right now.
So I just did the math for you guys.
That's how many new coders we've gotten.
In the past year a lot of these coders
are for the first time.
And then we had hundreds
of folks at these workshops
which are so great.
We all built a game together
and it's for beginners.
So, anyone here wants to help.
There's a lot of things
that we want to do.
We're a pretty small team.
Right now there's three and a half of us.
One of them is my mom.
If you ever have support to get
that's who you're talking to.
(laughing)
Also my mom tells me
that every support ticket
she gets she prays for whoever it is.
(laughing)
(clapping)
So if you need prayer just email us.
So a lot of things we want to do
is add social media
capabilities to the app.
Like the things on our list.
Like add social media
capabilities to the app
so you get a push.
Like if I get a Facebook
message my Jewelbot turns blue.
That would be awesome.
We don't think that has
anything to do with coding.
We think that has everything
to do with marketing
and why kids that don't
have developer parents.
That's never heard of coding before.
That don't care will want
to have a device like this.
New animations are always great.
Right now we only have two.
And more games.
One of the first games that came out of
when we first started shipping.
We didn't know what was going to happen.
Lots of kids play hide and seek with them.
Especially if you're playing outside.
It's really great because you'll know
that you're close to the
person when it turns on.
So fun things like using
proximity to turn the lights on.
You know like brighter as
you get closer is pretty fun.
I mean there's also other stuff going on.
Adults are working on stuff too.
Like someone is coding
their Jewelbot right now
so it deploys to GitHub for them.
Which is cool.
(laughing)
And so neat things like that are possible.
Just cause the whole
thing is open sourced.
Like every level of it from
the design to everything.
So yeah, we'd love your help.
And thank you.
There's a happy Samaa picture.
(clapping)
I think we have a few
minutes for questions, right.
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead.
- [Woman] I wanted to ask
because I'm a little confused
about the coding friends
versus coding individually.
In the code individually.
Can you have access to like?
Most of the things that
we were seeing was.
Your code was more like here's a formula.
Here's an if else statement.
- Yeah.
- [Woman] And my question is
as far as the spectrum of
compacting the in code.
Is there that ability
for them to go deeper?
- Yeah, on both sides there are.
So they can still do the
four loop and things.
It's just like things
like a long button press.
That's in the API for solo coding.
But not in friendship coding
so it doesn't overwrite the ability
to add friends kind of thing.
- [Woman] Are you guys
finding any future models
with additional hardware capabilities?
- Yeah, we're working on.
Oh, I just got a sign
that says repeat question.
Are we working on any additional hardware
for models with different abilities?
So this is an actual.
This is an interesting
thing that we've learned.
So when we first started talking to girls.
Especially we tried to talk to people
across demographics and
socio economic classes.
And in the more elite private schools.
We go and they'd be wearing
things like a Fitbit
and a Jawbone UP.
And we'd be like oh cool.
How many steps have you taken today?
And they'd be like I don't know.
And we'd be like, alright.
Where's the app, can you tell?
And most of the time they
didn't even have the app
or they never opened the
app or they never looked.
And we'd be like, alright.
Why are you wearing that.
And they would be like, I don't know.
It's like a wearable, it's cool.
And we'd be like okay.
So the first model we did
not add an accelerometer.
Cause we were like we don't care.
But now when we're talking to them
and how fast fashion moves.
A lot of them are wearing
them and when we ask them now.
It's more like I wear this
because I compete with my friends over
how many steps we take.
So it's like she takes
10,000, I took 50,000.
I'm killing it.
So the next version will
have an accelerometer.
We're working on some other things too.
Blue in the back.
- [Man] So what I was
curious about was two things.
The first one is like, plugging it in.
Because I don't want to
plug in my devices normally.
So are you thinking about doing wireless?
(mumbling)
- Yeah, that was something we talked about
a lot in the beginning.
We knew we had the human
resources to code one.
Either Bluetooth upload or wired.
And so we picked wired just so we weren't
alienating people who had desktops.
However, that ability is there.
So definitely one day we
want to go to do it, yeah.
(mumbling)
So you charge it by plugging
it in with the micro USB.
So if it's off it will last a week or two.
And full lights, full everything going.
About two and a half days.
So in between those.
And then there's someone
in green in the back, yeah.
- [Man] So I could go check but
60 seconds in 35 countries.
I assume that you have.
(mumbles)
- No, we don't yet.
Yeah, but we'd love help with
that if anyone is interested.
(mumbling)
Yeah, I agree yeah.
(mumbling)
Exactly, yeah.
(mumbling)
(laughing)
(mumbling)
Yeah, so two things.
We have the schematics
for the charm online
and I'll make sure that's on GitHub today.
And so you can 3D print your own
and you don't have to do the flower.
And yes down the road we
definitely want to release
lots of different.
Like these guys we call them charms.
So we already have designs
for different charms.
Like a robot one and things like that.
So yeah, that's definitely
on the timeline.
- [Woman] Copying off from there.
Can you put an LED screen on
there or anything like that?
Not necessarily Apple level but
just something to attach to.
I don't really want to
deal with morse code.
I'm sorry, I don't want to.
- No one does.
So usually the secret
messages end up being like
if I send you three buzzes.
Meet me outside or things like that.
Like less than morse code
because it's complicated.
However, price point wise
it's really hard to do that.
Doing that and keeping it
under a $100 is really.
So, for now there's no plans to do that.
Is there a question in the back?
- [Man] How much are you selling them now?
- This is the sales part.
So right now we're selling
them for 69 for one.
99 for two, 129 for three.
- [Woman] So can't they light up.
(mumbling)
Can they be triggered by online events?
Like an arrest interface.
For instance instead of having it light up
when a friend walks in the room.
Can it light up when one of
my friends tweets something?
- Yeah, that hasn't been
built yet but it's possible.
So it's definitely
something that we'd love.
- [Man] What is the distance of?
(mumbling)
- So it's 30 meters.
- [Man] Can you repeat the question.
- Sorry, what is the distance?
Like what is the distance of range?
It's 30 meters.
Yeah, last question.
- [Man] What are the
plans for the Android app?
- The plans for the Android are when I can
get to the Android app.
So definitely it's out there.
We're using Cordova so it's like
we just need to make sure everything.
There might be one.
I just haven't tested it yet.
But there's probably
changes that need to happen
as far as Android.
So we're doing a workshop.
It starts at.
The workshop starts at 6:30.
It's in room 409.
And we have Jewelbots for you to borrow.
Jewelbots for you to buy, discount.
And between now and then
we're also having some pizza.
John, do you want to say
something about that?
Or are you just walking out?
- [Man] THere's pizza ready now.
It's California Pizza Kitchen.
Go down to 6th street and it's two blocks.
A little more than two blocks maybe.
(mumbling)
- Yeah.
- [Man] Well that's it.
(chatter)
Alright.
- [Man] But anyways, yeah.
They're waiting for us there so.
- Thank you everyone.
Thanks for coming.
