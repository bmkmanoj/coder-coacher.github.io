share with you a story
about an interesting curious discovery
or pattern I found while I
was working on some code.
So imagine we have the code above.
We have two classes.
One on the left, one on the right.
We'll just call them A and B.
A refers to a B,
and B refers to an A.
A tries to use a member function of a B.
And B tries to use a
member function of an A.
What could possibly be wrong with this.
So...
It fails to compile.
So I've highlighted kind
of the important parts.
So my main include the A
which then included the B
which had the error of
the A not being a type.
So can anyone tell me
what is wrong with this?
- [Audience member] The
forward declaration.
I heard something about
a forward declaration.
And we'll go with that.
So you can go on Wikipedia
and read the definition.
But all it means is a declaration
without its definition of the same point.
So let's try to add that.
So I've added the forward declarations
for each type up here.
Does that fix the problem?
- [Audience] No.
No.
We get a different kind of error.
So main include A, includes the B,
which says, &quot;Invalid
use of incomplete type.&quot;
And then towards the bottom
it unthankfully reminds us,
&quot;Hey you forward declared that thing.&quot;
So what's wrong with this one?
- [Audience member]
You didn't include the-
Well, it's a little more complicated.
But...
So I decided to step back.
I didn't fully understand the problem.
And I just wanted to share
some of that with you.
It's not too important,
but if we declare a whole bunch of symbols
to represent all the things
that can go into a header file.
So all of our types.
All of our variables.
All of the functions that we declare.
And we define the
relationships between them.
We end up with a graph,
and it's a dependency graph.
And thankfully it's
asynchronous dependency graph.
Which means we should be able to do this.
There should be a way.
And after you stare at
this for a little bit.
You realize that there's
kind of three layers here.
One is kind of the forward declaration
that we tried to add manually before.
And then there's kind of
the stuff in the middle.
And then the stuff at the bottom.
And the stuff at the bottom is
your function implementations
and perhaps you have
a few global variables
So...
What?
Oh, okay.
So if you think about this enough
you can actually decompose any header file
into this general skim.
So if you put your type
declarations in one file.
You put your type definitions,
your free function declarations,
and your variable declarations
in an interface file, let's call it.
And you put your inline
functions in an input file.
You can get around this problem.
Which is kind of cool.
So let's go back to this one.
And it's important to note,
I'll draw the arrows.
There is a cyclical dependency here.
If you include what calls what,
it keeps going around.
So, first of all,
I'll use the labels that
I introduced before.
We'll actually have
everything include each other.
And it's kind of a mess, but...
let's put some arrows.
And if you try to go from any point
in this and go up,
you will uniquely get to the top,
and you'll won't end up in a cycle.
So this was the pattern I discovered.
I wasn't expecting it.
But I thought I would share it with you,
because I think it has
some general applicability
to all of our code actually.
So was anyone at Vikor's
talk earlier this afternoon?
Or is Viktor here?
Well anyway, he was building doctest.
Which is a unit test framework.
And he's comparing the
timing against catch.
Catch is the red bars.
His is the blue bars that you can't see.
So it really matters.
So if you're a library author,
if you have tightly coupled header files,
you definitely try this approach.
And if not, maybe you should just think
about applying it to your code sake.
Because it makes you more strongly think
about how your header files are laid out.
If you're a user,
you should look for forward declarations
out there in the wild.
If you use a library,
maybe you should nudged the maintainers
of it to add something like this for you.
And if you don't know about it,
iostream actually provide this today.
If you include the iostreams
insertion operator,
you can include iosfwd,
and you can get the type.
And you can remove ostream
from your header file.
Thank you very much.
