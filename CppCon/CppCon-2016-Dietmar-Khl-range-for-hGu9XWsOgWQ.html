range for everybody knows that I guess
overseen it everybody loves it
I saw a range for and actually I see
that code often and actually all the
objects right that's really bad
don't do that if you ever see that code
rather replace it by something like that
if you insist
by that fine right this is the way I
would write it it's constant right place
if you actually if something actually
changes things
you just put a reference on that's fine
as well
and then that's an actually in theory
the range may produce our values in
which case you may want to have
something like that and then I see
people when they have kept that to do
that this is really bad
what you do over here is you basically
again explain to you all the objects you
basically detroy everything this is like
trampling on kittens right you don't do
that
don't trample on kids so basically Auto
ref ref never has an author you
reference pretty much it is oh well it
may be another reference but you don't
know it is actually something called
info boring reference so just quickly so
people understand what that is
forwarding reference happens also
Nautilus was all too but also if you
have a tee ref ref and T is deduced it's
a forwarding reference these guys behave
kind of funny if I have an mutable L
value and I bonded to another reference
I could have written the Declaration as
well as in ref so it may be actually in
interest and actually if you try to move
these guys you actually destroy the guy
you probably want to keep for in that
doesn't matter but if it had been a
string it would be bad
likewise if I have a constant in the
constant and bind that to a autograph
ref I could have said well have
threatened in con stress so it's again
an L value and then the other cases
over here we actually have a term briefs
would actually did use the September II
and it's fine so that's equivalent to
kind of that and this guy could have
been moved okay
now a little bit something which people
may not be aware of there's actually an
upcoming change and C++ 17 which I'm
actually personally very excited about
and that is this is how range based
force defined understand that like this
blue and white blobs are basically
verboten replaced in the code and then
it's a little bit of scaffolding put
around the same which is kind of awkward
in that is this yellow stuff over here
Auto I T equals begin and R and end of
his end of our the thing which is bad as
it makes begin and the end the same type
and C++ 17 will change that to basically
do that and that was really small change
right auto just as an extra auto so the
begin and the end can be different types
so with which effectively means the
begin can be an iterator and the end
could be a sentinel so you can actually
do sentinel stuff and you don't have to
play around for something like oh a mi
at the end i my at the end do we are we
both at the end kind of logic all right
those pretty much all I wanted to talk
about so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
