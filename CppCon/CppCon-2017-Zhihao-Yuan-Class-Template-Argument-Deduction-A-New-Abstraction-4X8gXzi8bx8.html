And there are lots of
people, after seeing that,
they say that, &quot;Oh,
this is a minor update.&quot;
There's nothing exciting,
nothing actually changes
the way we program.
I want to say, these people
didn't study hard enough.
Because there is actually
not just one thing
which I'm going to talk about here today,
there are lots of things in C++ 17
that actually can change
the way we program
and change the way we can think program.
This tiny looking feature,
class template argument deduction,
actually gives us a new abstraction.
A new way for us to view
and design interface.
And before starting, I
should thank Michael Spertus,
who created this feature,
and contiguously put efforts
to make this feature
better and also, today,
have made a poster outside called
Class Template Argument
Deduction Best Practices.
I read that poster, and I'm
very happy about seeing it,
because he covers lots of materials
that I didn't cover here,
because I really don't
have time to cover it.
So, please go read that poster.
Now, we are introducing new feature.
Hub often tells us to
start with some comparison,
like before after.
So, with this new feature, we
can now save five keystrokes.
If you go beginning and end,
you save ten keystrokes.
Is that exciting?
Well, actually, the
second line, I should say,
it doesn't always work.
It sometimes cannot
replace the before one.
The poster made by Michael explained why.
I didn't have a dedicated
slide in this talk
to explain why, if at the end
of talk I didn't explain it,
please remind me.
But, let's move on.
So, this part excited me, because so that
I can finally write C++ like
a dynamic program language.
Still with strong type checkings.
But you don't need to specify all types.
It's good for both the
reader and the compiler.
But does that work on all containers?
How about this?
Well, none of them work.
So, I start to feel this
talk is hard to continue now.
It's not exciting, it's
actually disappointing.
So, this is why the title of the talk is
Class Template Argument
Deduction: A New Abstraction.
Let's forgot about this tiny pieces.
Some of them make sense after
you understand this feature,
some of them we will fix it in the future.
This feature itself, we need
to view it in another angle.
And let's start from the very
basic. The language details.
I'll try to explain this
feature, as detailed as I can.
So that you can make full use of it.
As you may know, the class
template argument deduction,
it consists of two parts.
One part is automatic deduction,
and another part is deduction guide,
which you explicitly
write to tell compiler
how to do the deduction they
cannot automatically do.
And automatic deduction
just gives you some default behaviors,
and just like all other defaults from C++,
they can be overwritten so they exist.
But you need to know how
exactly default behaviors works
in order to override them.
Otherwise, you end up
with something like this.
Where every time I want to
override something special,
number functions, I need
to look at whole slide.
So, what automatic deduction gives you.
First, it gives you a new syntax.
The syntax is, and in the
slides they're followed by
a type name.
And the type name can
of course be qualified.
So, what does exactly mean,
you can use template-name
in place of a simple-type-specifier.
And putting it this way.
Auto is a simple-type-specifier.
Which means, you can
almost use the new syntax,
class template argument deduction,
in places where auto can be
used, in almost all places.
But, with, plus minus all exceptions.
But, please, understand it in that way.
And how we actually do the deduction.
So, the following is not
exactly what compiler does.
But, please use our imagination.
Just like what you do in
mental overload resolution.
So, when you are writing
this last sentence,
to use a type-name
against a class-template,
without providing the argument list.
You can imagine that the compiler
tries to move the
class-template, parameter list,
down to the constructor,
so constructor-templates,
and puts them together,
and you immediately find that
the last line stop to work,
because you are right
now continually deducing
against the constructor-template
against the class
rather than the class-template.
So the next time if
you run into a problem,
or how bracing tradition works,
how aggregate works against...
In the context of class
template argument deduction,
just think of it in this way.
The compiler has to move
the original template,
class template parameter list,
down to the function templates.
After that, we can do the deduction,
we can get the results
for each parameters.
And we put those parameters
back to where they came from
to form the specialization.
In this case, it's vector,
char, allocator char.
So, we got our first rule
of automatic deduction.
That is one part of our
deduction candidates
come from the constructor
with compiler synthesized
template parameter lists.
However, during this process,
there is a tiny issue.
Well, actually, not
tiny. But let me explain.
You can imagine that, previously,
when are you designing a class-template,
you expect user to manually specify
the class-template argument, right?
You don't expect them to be deduced.
Therefore, in some cases,
when the compiler tries to move
the class template parameter list down,
here's something that it changes.
If you move it down here,
this T ref ref used to
be an rvalue reference,
now it becomes a forwarding reference.
That's a semantic changes.
Fortunately, we fixed it.
The standard just says
that that rvalue reference
came from class-template parameter list,
it's not a forwarding reference.
That's it. It's an
exception, special rule.
Where this feature can be used?
As I said, it can be used in
place of auto in many places.
Imagine it's a better auto in some way.
Notably, the exception includes,
you can use it in new with
more than one argument,
but you can't use that with auto.
And the class-template argument deduction
can be only followed by semi-qualifiers.
No ref, no ref ref, no pointers.
And there are some thing I think we missed
in the new standard, I hope
we can fix in the future.
For example, we are able to use auto
in place of return type.
That's class-template
argument deduction not allows.
Richard Smith already said,
if someone proposed to add it,
it would be accepted.
So, you gotta trust me, write a new paper.
For this, intuitively, for the last one,
should start say to act longer.
Not sure whether it fully
makes sense, but, anyway.
So, also, in other other ways,
it has other ways similar to auto.
Like auto allows to declare
more than one variables
at the same time, with
class-template argument deduction
you can do it as well, and
the requirements is the same.
The both variables need to
be exactly the same type.
Uniform initialization kicks
in, there is some difference,
and difference on top of difference.
I'm going to explain how detailed is it...
What the difference are.
I apologize that I have to
introduce something not existing
in the standard yet to
explain the rationale.
But, trust me, that's the most intuitive
and most clear way to
remember this difference.
The first thing, let me
introduce some variable,
let's say it's an optional int.
So, auto, if you use
auto to declare something
with parentheses, that
variable, it copy constructed.
New auto something, it
allocates something,
and copy constructed.
The last thing doesn't
exist in the standard yet,
but you can imagine what that is.
It creates a PR value,
like copy construct.
Let's look at type name.
Exactly the same thing.
Your parentheses, one
argument, copy construct.
If opt is specialization of optional,
and if you use new, allocate
space, copy construct,
temporary copy construct.
And if we are in the
case of single argument
with a parenthesis,
exactly the same thing.
The column on left-hand side...
Yeah, left-hand side,
all do copy construct.
The column on the right-hand side
also all do copy construct.
And we finally brought
down to the difference
to this one tiny piece.
This one tiny slide.
That is, when auto is being
used against a copy list
initialization with
more than one argument,
it creates initializer list.
And when the copy is being used
with direct list initialization
with more than one argument,
it does not allow it.
But for class-template argument
deduction it just works.
So we got our second rule.
That is, when the class-template
argument deduction
are used against one argument,
and that argument is a
specialization of the class-template
you wanted to declare against,
it always try to do copy.
So we have this new set of candidates,
that is a copy deduction candidate
to impose this.
This behavior can be overwritten.
I will explain this later,
but as you see in previous slides,
it may not be a good idea to do so.
Because in generic programming,
somebody might want to
compare it against auto,
using in place auto, they
got different behavior,
that would be something surprising happen.
And next, I'm going to
talk about our third
kind of deduction candidates,
that is a default constructor.
It simulates the behavior of
generating default constructor
for, if you do not declare any,
but there are little bit difference.
Let's start with how actually we use them.
So, in C++14, we added this
transparent comparator.
So that's when you are writing algorithms,
you can say, std sort,
bg ed, and comparator,
the diamond operator,
and then parentheses.
The diamond operator,
there's no such thing,
it's just the empty class
template argument list.
And it will use the default templates,
argument that is void.
But now, we get class-template
argument deduction,
although there's no source for deduction,
but we can add this new syntax
allow us to eliminate this diamond.
Now we get something very close to
Sean Perham's HSL operate.
I love it. This tiny new changes.
So, what's the difference between
compiler provided default
constructor, then?
There's one tiny piece of difference.
You can notice that the only places
where this vision makes sense,
is that you have a main templates,
and default your class-template parameter
to point to your functionality
to a specialization,
which means only
specialization makes sense.
The main templates doesn't matter.
So, special rule.
That is, we just provide
this default constructor
deduction candidate, even your
main template is not defined.
It can be just a declaration.
As long as you have such a
specialization, it just works.
So, we have finished
our automatic deduction.
Now, let's go to the cases
where automatic deduction
is not enough.
So, take a look at this example.
We have a constructor template.
Which has no T in its argument list.
So you cannot deduce T out of this.
What do with it?
So we introduced deduction
guide. Not in this syntax.
It's just, imagine that
you have some mechanics
in a law suit to describe
what's the deduction result
you want to see.
And specifies in a way,
like a return type.
And you move this thing
out of the class scope.
Then we go to deduction candidate.
And this one is called deduction guide.
Exact syntax is called a deduction guide,
it's just like a constructor
but followed by return type.
Although, this declaration
is neither a function
or function template.
It's just a declaration has to appear
in the scope where the
class template is declared.
And the last line actually
posed a restriction
from our point of view, here.
That is, the simple-template-id,
which appears in place of the return type,
has to be specialization
for the class-template.
Which means we can use a
trade to compute this type.
And you saw how to match it back.
From my point of view, this restriction
is something deserve to fix.
So, so far, we have done talking about
almost all the language...
No, not yet.
We have done talking about
all the deduction candidates.
And the first three are
for automatic deduction,
the last one is a focus
for the rest of the talk.
So, let's move on.
I'm first going to
explain the interactions
between these deduction candidates.
More specifically, how the deduction guide
interact with automatic
deduction candidates.
Putting in a simple way.
All your candidates are
ongoing overload resolution
within one overloader set.
What does that mean?
Imagine that...
Let me put it in this way.
When you're writing deduction guide,
you are adding new candidates
for overload resolution
to an existing overloader set.
You are not replacing any signature
that is generated by compilers
through automatic deduction.
You are only adding it.
The automatic deduction
candidates are always there.
They are not replaced.
There are some way to suppress them,
but if you do not manually
try to suppress them,
they will give you surprising results.
Here's an example.
I write this deduction guide
based on a language rule.
A deduction guide takes priority
over the automatic deduction candidate
when the deduction guide
is at least as specialized
as the automatic deduction candidates.
Well, in this case, it's not
just at least as specialized.
It's even more constrained,
so it takes priority always.
However, when these
constraints not satisfied,
my last line is not rejected.
Instead, it force down
to the automatic deduction candidates,
so you cannot actually
impose more constraint
through deduction guide.
You need some other ways to do so.
Or maybe this is just not a good design.
For the rest of talk,
I'm going to talk about
how to design rather than
trying to fix these problems.
But, okay.
Let's start with going deeper.
Here I provide a deduction guide toolbox.
Let's start with the very basic.
To think about what a
deduction guide is good for.
So, obviously, it's
good for disambiguation.
Because, you're adding new overloads
to an existing overloader set.
And if you ever listen or
watched my previous talk
in C++ now, there's a talk called
Disambiguation the Black Technology,
you will know more details about it.
But look at this example.
I think the ambiguation
is very obvious, right?
At the same position,
you have Comp, Alloc,
and all of it is constrained.
So when you're passing Alloc, allocator,
both answer are equally good,
so there's an ambiguation.
Now, how to fix it?
We can fix it by adding
constraints on the deduction guide.
So, here, I constrained the allocator
to satisfy allocator concepts.
This one, this deduction guide
is more constrained than this.
Than the second constructor.
So that it takes priorities,
and in that way, the last line, compiles.
The next trick is not actually a trick,
next thing is about how
exactly write deduction guides.
Because there are some
special things going on
in deduction guide which
can make your life easier.
So let's look at this example.
It's a fairly simple example, right?
It illustrates that automatic
deduction often doesn't work.
Even for the simple cases
where we just use a forwarding reference
for universal constructor.
Because, why it doesn't work?
Because T doesn't present here.
There's only a U here.
The U is only come from
the constructor template.
So, the last line didn't compile.
How do we make it compile?
So, maybe, learn from make option?
Which is an existing
utility in standard library.
It takes a argument,
forward it, decayed it,
so hout translates that
into a deduction guide.
I should say that works,
but please, don't do that.
Try this.
So, Michael's poster
also has this section.
Try to use this style as much as possible.
Actually, to be honest,
please, always use this style,
because it always works.
Let me explain.
So, if you use this to declare
a function, take by value,
it may not work, because
that type may not be copyable
or movable.
It needs a copyable, not movable. Right.
In that case it doesn't work.
However, deduction guide only
perform overload resolution.
Which means, it only
queries your type to see
whether it can get involved
in overload resolution
in your context where copy
construction is desired.
And it happens to be the case that in C++,
all types can get into
overload resolution,
participate in overload
resolution, for copying.
Just look at this slide, look
at the highlighted column.
There is no slots that
says the copy constructor
is not declared.
The copy constructor
declaration is always there.
Even you deleted its body.
You deleted it, but it
doesn't change its nature
that it can participate
in overload resolution,
and the result is that all
type have the potential
for being copied.
So, I change this from slide here.
If at the end of this talk you
forget about everything else,
please remember this piece.
Just use this style. Take by
value in overload resolution.
It's not just because
this style is simpler.
It's because that's part
of the essence of this
deduction guide.
It's the first utility in C++
that splits overload resolution
from the function application.
When previously we are writing function,
when we're writing overloader sets,
one difficulty is that
the overload resolution
is tangled with the actual application.
If you look at pair signature in standard,
how many there are, 32?
They are all there for tricking
the actual application,
the way of the actual application.
But, this deduction
guide give us this chance
to specify the overload
resolution in one place
and do the actual functional
application in another place.
And it comes with lots of other benefits.
For example, it replaces all
the copy like signatures.
These are all the possible
signatures you can impose
on a copy constructor
and move constructor.
And there are more.
Includes a volatile here.
But this one signature that take by value,
covers all of them.
And actually, in the core language,
the copy deduction candidate
is written using this style.
So, the language itself
is also using this style.
The copy deduction candidate
impose a new candidate
out of an invented constructor, C(C).
That is the class template name.
Not just the language use it.
The library also use it whenever possible.
We use this style on pair, tuple, array,
all the tuple-like types.
So, the next tool in our tool-box
is how to suppress an automatic candidate.
As we previously discussed,
the deduction guide
are good for disambiguate,
not good for adding new constraints,
because the existence of the
automatic deduction candidate,
when you are writing deduction guide,
you have to make your deduction guide...
You know, if you
constrain, then you need to
make them mutually exclusive.
Now, that comes with a problem.
What if some part of
the result I don't want.
How do I suppress the result produced
from automatic candidates?
Intuitively, we want to
use dash delete to do so.
However, that syntax is not
yet allowed for some reason.
'Cause, if you are very familiar with C++,
then you know dash delete is a definition
not just a declaration, but
let's forgot about that,
we can simulate that.
You don't want a result,
right, just give it
a copy of the result.
Now, since we can suppress one deduction,
an automatic deduction candidate,
is that possible to suppress
all automatic candidates?
Well, yeah.
Step one, rename your existing
class template parameter
to something else.
Step two, redefine it to identity T.
If you are familiar with
identity T, that's its code,
but it basically says put this type here,
non-deduced context.
Therefore, all the automatic
deduction candidate involved
are suppressed.
Now, why want to do so?
Well, from an engineering point of view,
maybe because you have
seen lots of surprises
in previous slides, sometimes
you require fix this
to fix automatic deduction candidates,
and you can imagine that if one user
starts using your library,
and they start to rely
on one automatic deduction,
and some other user
send it back, reports
says that that deduction
doesn't make any sense,
and you later want to use the
deduction guide to fix it,
impose a breaking change.
This trick can be used
to fix that problem,
because you can just try
to shape your library
with all deduction candidates disabled
at the first place, maybe
later we can fix that
if we have time.
But, more important thing to us is that,
you got a chance to override
any automatic deduction candidate.
Because, actually, not override,
but semantically override.
The deduction candidates no longer exist.
So think of it in a
overload resolution way.
The first step in overload resolution
is to try get all the...
Try match the arguments
position by position.
If your r function takes three arguments,
you pass in two arguments,
obviously it doesn't
pass overload resolution.
That's your first step.
So, with all automatic
deduction candidates disabled,
we can now override the automatic behavior
caused by constructors in a
position by position basis.
Even though you see T is obviously
not a specialized size T.
And it can enable many tricks
after disabling when
writing deduction guide.
Like, the priority tags, the
dot dot dot trick, and more.
If you are not familiar with this,
I don't have time to explain it,
because there'll be another talk.
Let's move on.
If you are interested, ask
whoever library implementers
you are familiar with.
The last thing in our tool box
is that you can dictate the
type you want to deduce.
Let me finish this example,
and why this is important.
So here is an ostream joiner.
This example comes from the
library fundamentals TS V2.
This one is just much simplified version.
So, with ostream joiner
it first takes an ostream,
and next it takes whatever,
a stand delimiter,
but there is an issue, somebody
may think it's an issue,
is that, if it takes
a pointer to an array,
what if later the content changes,
and my ostream joiner changes as well,
well, it may be a problem to some people.
How 'bout fix it by
imposing stoul string here?
So that you stall this delimiter.
Somewhat reasonable, right?
And, it turns out we can fix
this with a deduction guide.
Like this.
You just say that, when
the input is going to
a character array,
you do this to stoul string.
That syntax, if you are not
familiar with that syntax,
let's go back and take a look
at our deduction guide syntax.
The deduction guide is
merely a declaration.
It doesn't say that it has
to start with the templates.
If you are familiar with
how template work in C++,
the template is just a declaration
prefixed by a template head.
If declaration is then using,
then that becomes their alias
templates, things like that,
deduction guide does the same thing.
By itself, it's still a deduction guide.
You can use it to point concrete
types from one to another.
Now, with this thing,
it's like you are forcing,
I'm using the term invite here,
you're inviting implicit conversion
from the character array to stoul string.
Can that be still called deduction?
Like, when doing function
template parameter deduction,
you won't run into the case that is,
while you are doing deduction,
you are also having a implicit conversion.
That is why I use the term 'dictate' here.
You are saying that, I
just want list results.
So, if you try to understand
this example more deeper,
you will realize that the second
essence of deduction guide
is that, it's not deducing.
It gives you an ability
to select a specialization
for a given overload resolution.
So, in the next section of
our talk, the last section,
I'm going to say that, how
we make use of this essence.
Your work is not done after
you've deduced something.
Your work is just started.
I want you to think about
which specialization you want
instead of what template
arguments you want.
You know, think about the
deduction guide as a whole.
Pick your specialization
before you're writing
a deduction guide.
I call it
design by having class-template
argument deduction in mind.
So, what do I mean by design?
Let's look at this example.
So, I say this is a bad style.
How people come up with this bad style?
Obviously, they didn't think
about the specialization
as a whole, they merely copied this thing
from make optional, right?
If I design this deduction guide,
this is what I'm going to do.
User ask me,
&quot;Hey, your optional
opt = 42 doesn't work.&quot;
Okay. Pick your favorite specialization.
I want optional&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;.
Okay, so deduction guide.
Did that solve the problem?
Are you kidding me?
Okay. Maybe I need to
add more deduction guide.
So now I have optional
int to optional int.
Optional char to optional char.
Generalize those into
optional T to optional T.
So you just got your
idiomatic deduction guide.
It's not... This style is not invented.
It's just intuitive
based on user requests.
We call this design.
You don't copy from something existing.
Just think about what result you want.
What result user want.
It's just like business management.
Marketing, ask for use cases,
and use our innovation.
The innovation here in C++,
in class-template argument deduction
when we generalize it,
makes things larger,
specialize, makes things more focus.
And do this again and again.
Now, this is how I
design a deduction guide.
Now, let's go to the next question.
Why I say this is,
this is a new abstraction.
You are just not designing
one deduction guide.
You're actually designing
a whole class template.
So, why are you writing deduction guide?
Previously, we discussed several cases,
like to fix a bug, disambiguation,
to add some new feature,
enable a non-deduced case,
but I can tell you that by
writing multiple deduction guide,
it can give your class
template a new interface.
Essentially, the class-template
argument deduction,
what it gives you is a new interface.
This interface is a template
name followed by parentheses,
or some initializer,
arguments, dot dot dot, right?
It's a interface for your
entire class templates
because it doesn't say its specialization.
It's an interface for your
whole class templates.
It can involve all specializations.
So, here's an example of
how to make use of that.
The design flaw is similar to before.
So, here's a new case.
Let's say we have a my
vector, with an allocator,
as a template parameter.
If you are familiar with regular type,
you may found that this design
is not very satisfactory,
because, you impose policies in its type,
so that a vector of different allocator
can't even be compared.
But, you know, the salient
property of two vector
are merely the values,
why you want to compare
the allocator?
If you replace the question
mark with equal equal
that doesn't even compile,
because they are different types.
So that is why we have
this polymorphic allocator.
Its purpose is to solve this problem
by eliminating this
piece of type information
out of your container.
Here I'm using an allocator designed
that is different from what
the existing standard library,
but I'll continue.
Let's say we have a polymorphic
allocator as a base.
And you have pool
allocator, did ref on it,
and did new delete
allocator, did ref on it,
and let's look at our
previous example again.
Dammit, that still doesn't compile.
Even you defaulted your template,
your class template parameter
to polymorphic allocator.
Because automatic deduction candidates
deduce those into two different types.
Again, design it.
What's your favorite specialization
when seeing this vector
followed by a initialized
list and some allocator?
Just a base class.
Here's your deduction
candidate. Problem solved.
In this case, require...
This example require to suppress
all the automatic candidates first.
If you are a overload resolution expert,
you will know immediately why,
but I don't have time to explain why here.
Oops.
Okay.
So, what do I mean by new interface?
The new interface is for the
whole class template, right?
Think about this. Nobody
writes this, right?
Nobody write code like this.
The template parameter
list are not designed
for people to manually fill in
these class template parameters.
If you write this,
I don't know how to describe that.
You can imagine that that
type of interface exists.
That interface designed
only for deduction.
Does that make sense to
class-template argument deduction?
Yes.
But this is totally experimental material.
Don't try it at home.
Well, you can try it at home,
don't try it at your company I should say.
So, just like you write
multiple specializations,
I mean, multiple overloads,
hidden specialization
for your class templates,
we reverse the process.
We can choose to not
write deduction guides
for the class templates, but instead,
we build specialization to
implement the interface.
We create a deduction guide.
We imagine that we have
the interface first,
and we use some specialization
to implement it.
So, look at this example.
The vector bool problem is
sort of well known, right?
Theoretically, we have a chance to fix it
by imposing a type tag.
It's a real bool tag,
doesn't has to be bool,
bool, like anything.
It's just there for
picking a specialization.
Give you a place to
build the specialization.
And then you can build this
specialization with real bool,
therefore fix the problem.
Somebody might say, &quot;That
doesn't always work.&quot;
Because, when no arguments is passed
then how to deal with this?
Well, that's not unsolvable, right?
With boost hana, where
you can use value type,
and deduce from value type,
so theoretically speaking, we
really have a new interface.
That interface doesn't
require to pass any explicit
class template arguments at all.
We can only stick with this
new interface if you want.
Maybe this can be improved
in the future standard.
We have some new syntax
to allow you optionally
to fill in some type of parameters,
but the door is wide open.
The possibility's right here.
So, conclusion.
I just want to say one sentence.
Try to design your entire class template
as one overload set.
Don't try to fix bugs.
Don't try to design
deduction guides slowly.
Put them together, start for looking at
what syntax, what result you want,
after reading a given syntax.
