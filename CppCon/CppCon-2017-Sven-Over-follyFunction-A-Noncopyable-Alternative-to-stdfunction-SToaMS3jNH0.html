I'm Sven, I am a software
engineer at Facebook London.
And I'm gonna talk to
you about folly::Function
a Non-copyable Alternative
to std::function,
which I started working
on a year and a half ago.
It's been modified and different issues
have been fixed by some of my
Facebook colleagues as well,
and should be in a pretty good shape now.
I guess most of you, being
season C plus plus developers
know what std::function
is, have used it before
so let me start with a tl; dr for you.
So folly::Function is a
replacement for std::function
which, unlike std::function,
is not copyable,
so it's a move-only type.
It is noexcept movable and
also unlike std::function
it enforces const correctness.
I'll go into more detail
about that, obviously later.
It's as fast or faster than std::function
in terms of execution speed
and also compile speed
on the relevant platforms
where we tested it.
It's been now in
production use at Facebook
for about 18 months so I can tell you
a little bit about the
experiences we've made
and if you want to have a look at it,
you can check it out.
It's part of the folly library,
which is Facebook's basically
collection of useful things
that we put together a library
which you can get at github.
Right, in this talk,
I shall tell you a little bit
of a theoretical introduction
going from callable types
to function wrappers.
But then I will tell you specifically
about the problems we
had using std::function,
which also led to the design
decisions for folly:Function
so I tell you about that.
And I will just tell you more about
what our experiences were whilst changing
from one to the other,
and during like I said
the regular production
use that we have seen now.
Okay, so this theoretical introduction,
Callable Types in C++
they include function pointers
or function references,
obviously lambdas and
any classes or structs
that you define yourself if you define
an invocation operator.
If you happen to use a lambda
that doesn't catch any data,
or if you happen to define
a member function off your
structure class aesthetic,
then those can all be cast
into function pointers
and they're completely stateless,
which means that essentially
just appoint to the code
that the compiler generated.
But often, you want to
pass a little bit of data,
a little bit of context
with your callable object,
so that would be, in the case of lambda,
when you capture some
data and in the codemark
that you define you have
access to that data.
Or, in your struct or class
when you define member functions
or the invocational operator.
As soon as it's non-static,
the code in here will have
access to all the states
of this class object.
You can go one step further,
and define your lamba as mutable,
or your member function as non-const.
And in that case you only have access
at the state in the sense
that you can look at it,
you can also mutate it.
Alright, so what was this useful for?
So passing callables
generally is used for,
this is like a stupid example,
if you were to have a function
work that takes an integer
and returns a string
and you want to call an
asynchronous version of that,
then you would probably
code it in the sense
that it takes the input parameters,
and instead of returning
the result right now,
it will later invoke a little
function that you pass it
with a result when it has that.
The problem here when
you use this as your API,
like I said, like a function
point is very much stateless.
So you give it a function process result,
but that function will
later only have access
to like globally defined data variables.
And usually when you do this,
you want to pass a little
bit of context with it
so that the processResults
function later knows
what piece of work was getting the results
from something like that.
So, a function point is not the best thing
to use in this API.
If you work with older APIs,
you sometimes see that you would
pass to work asynchronously
or to a void point that later
then gets passed to your
processResult function, which
is workaround around that.
But void pointers are not good there,
they are not type safe and all that.
So much better, we use a function wrapper.
So instead of declaring
your process results
parameters as a function point,
you use a function wrapper clause,
which is a template clause.
And the template signatures
only the signature
of the function, or more generally,
the callable object that you need.
So anything that takes a
standard string as an argument,
and returns void in this case,
should be something that you can put
into this function wrapper
to pass it to your API.
And I give you here like
a super simplified version
how you would implement
such a function wrapper.
A simplified and incomplete.
But the idea is that your function wrapper
will have to store some function pointers,
and why the type of the
function wrapper itself
doesn't say yet which kind of
object you later wrap in it,
because it only gives you
the function signature.
This is called type erasure, basically.
The magic happens when you
define a templated construction,
constructors in the assignment operators
that can take any type
and then extenuate some
little bit of static
code that can later run,
take a pointer to the
state that you store,
probably on the heap or somewhere else,
and this function wrapper
to execute your function.
So it will populate a
function point of execution
in this data structure.
And you probably need more,
you probably also need a function pointer
to something that can
later on destroy the object
when your function wrapper gets destroyed.
Okay, so this is super simplified,
and this obviously exists in
a more fleshed out version.
And it's called std::function,
so that's there already.
What does the std::function look like?
On our standard platform,
the GCC standard library
on x86_64 usually is 48 bytes.
And 16 of those bytes are used
for two function pointers,
similar to what I just shown you.
It starts the function
pointer for executing
or invoking your object,
and it's also second function point for
the management function
that it extenuates which
can copy your object or can
delete your object, and so on.
And all the remaining space, 32 bytes,
can be used to store your actual object
in the fact function wrapper itself.
If it fits into 32 bytes,
you can avoid another heap allocation,
and just store it in place.
If it doesn't fit in there, obviously,
send function will make a heap allocation
and only store the pointer
to the object on the heap
inside this space as well.
As a matter of fact,
std::function is copyable,
and when you make a
copy of a std::function,
it makes a copy of the
wrapped object as well.
And as a matter of fact,
it's also noexcept
moveable, which will become,
or the relevance of which
will become clear in a moment.
Okay, so typical use cases.
I'm working at Facebook,
and we have a large codebase
using C++, so I can
look inside and see like
what are typical use
cases as how we use this.
And the two things that
I sort of see everywhere,
the two classes of use cases,
is either passing
std::function as a little task
to libraries for
execution at a later time,
or in a different thread
or something like this.
And the other thing is
to store those tasks
for later execution, for instance,
in the implementation of those libraries.
In either case, you
pass those tasks around,
and typically they are
only executed once, anyway,
so there's very little reason why you need
the std::function thing
to be copyable for us.
As a matter of fact,
in those certain cases,
there's never the need
to make a copy of them.
Okay, I want to give you
a little bit more detailed
examples here what it looks like.
So, in this folly library,
which is open source
so we can look at it
and use it if you like,
we have an abstract base
class in an interface
called folly::Executor, which is basically
interface defining things that
can execute tasks for you.
So implementation could
be a CPU thread pool,
so you pass tasks to this executor,
and the thread will execute
it when a thread is available.
And what we use is std::function void
to pass those tasks around
because folly executor
is an abstract base class
and there's at method
that you use to edit tasks
is virtual, we can't use templates,
we have to use a specific type.
So the type that we use obviously,
is or was std::function.
To illustrate the other use case
in folly we also have
an implementation of the
future and promise pattern,
which you also know from
the standard library,
but ours is a little bit more fleshed out
and feature rich and we couldn't wait,
or didn't want to wait,
until the standard library
offers this features.
As unlike the standard library,
our future also has a .then method,
where you can give it a little task
that will be executed when your
future actually has a value.
And the result of the .then
returns a future again,
for the result of your little lambda,
so you can change them and all that,
it's super useful and we
use this a lot, obviously.
Again, the implementation
uses std::function
to store the call back
because when you call .then,
the future typically
doesn't have a value yet,
so we store the callback and later
when the future has a value,
can execute your little task.
So that's all nice and well,
what is the problem with
std::function for us?
So the biggest problem was
that we often wanted to use
move-only types and capture
them in those little tasks.
So typically, you would
like to be able to store
a unique_ptr or a promise of
this future and promise pattern
in these little tasks to make use of them.
The problem here is that
when you store non-copyable
objects in your lambda,
the lambda itself becomes non-copyable,
and now this doesn't compile,
because this gets eventually
converted into a std::function,
and std::function only
works with copyable objects.
So this will get you the compiler error.
Which is bad, and people still want to do
what they wanted to do
so they find workarounds.
One workaround was, this is the clean one,
you just move your
MoveOnly object on the heap
and use a shared_prt to refer to it.
Shared_ptrs are copyable, obviously,
even if your object
itself wasn't copyable,
so you can copy the shared_prt
in your lambda, use that.
That works, that is fine to some degree,
but it comes with overheads.
So it impacts performance because A,
now you have always
extra memory allocations
to store every single object on the heap,
and secondly as you pass
these things around,
you have to increment and
decrement atomic reference counts,
which can also mess with
your caching and all this,
so this can have performance overhead,
because this sometimes we use in code
that executes very often
and has to be fast.
So people came up with
a different workaround,
and this is a bit nasty.
So there's a class in folly as well,
so like I said you can
look at it if you want,
it's called MoveWrapper,
it's a template class.
And basically it's a wrapper
around an object of type T,
and the MoveWrapper implements
the copy constructor
by moving the contained object.
This is bad, because it
breaks copy semantics.
Making a copy of a
MoveWrapper doesn't really
give you too difficult objects afterwards,
but one valid object
that received the object,
and one left over empty shell.
You can think of folly::MoveWrapper
if you were to put a unique
point into MoveWrapper,
that's a essentially
the old std::auto_ptr,
and everyone loved that, so
that must be a good idea, right?
So if you have any code that
makes copies of objects,
and then assumes that it has
two valid objects afterwards,
it just breaks when you
pass these things around.
On the other hand, this doesn't
come with the performance
overhead of the share pointer solution,
so if you happen to know
that your implementation
ever does that, it never
has to make copies,
then that kind of works.
But the compiler can't help
you enforce these things.
So that point, we thought like,
okay, we need a different function wrapper
to solve those problems.
We requiring that all callable objects
that you store in a function wrapper
to be copyable is painful for us.
And for most of our use cases,
it's not helpful, it's not useful,
because we never make those copies.
And if we did, it breaks
anyway now our code base
because people use this
move wrapper thing.
So basically what you want
the code from earlier,
you just want this to work.
This should compile and it
should behave as expected.
Okay, std::function problem.
There's another problem
that wasn't maybe super
obvious for us, but while we're at it,
std::function also has a
lax idea of const correctness.
So std::function is a function wrapper,
and std::function itself
has an invocation operator,
and that is declared const, which means,
even if you only have a const reference
for your std::function,
you can invoke your object.
But it's happy with taking objects
that have to have non-const
references to be caused,
so something that you take
to state when you call it,
you just put it in a std::function
and now it looks like
something that you can call
without it mutating in state.
This is not necessarily bad itself,
the problem is just like the
compiler can't help you anymore
when you do this wrong.
Normally const correctness
help you enforce...
Or enforcing const correctness
helps you find those
bugs and avoid those bugs.
The compiler can't help you now,
you have to make sure you
write all the code correct.
So, here comes folly::function.
Folly::function, okay, how is it designed?
Obviously, non-copyable.
Why I say obviously?
So, the thing is, what we wanted it
we want it to be able to
store non-copyable callables.
But we also want to do this without like
bad performance impact.
So, it shouldn't internally
do the standard checkpoint
or trick because I said that
needs to extra memory locations
and it's expensive and all that.
And also it should
maintain value semantics.
You should think of it
as a thing containing
and owning an object,
and as you pass it
around you pass ownership
of that around as well.
So basically what that means,
that the folly::function,
the wrap object itself,
must also be non-copyable.
But that's fine, because we
hardly ever want to copy it.
The other decision we made is
it should be noexcept movable.
Which is kind of important
for non-copyable types,
because you want to be
able to use those types
with STL containers and
say instead of a vector,
if it has to reallocate and
move all your objects around,
it will only use move symantics
if move is guaranteed not to throw,
because it will be problem
if in the middle it throws
and then what do you do?
Move the rest back, that
might throw as well.
No, the STL containers would
copy objects if they're not
noexcept movable, which
obviously is a problem
if the object is not copyable.
So it's kind of like,
if you think about it,
non-copyable types really
have to be noexcept movable.
And the other thing is that
if you think about it,
we expect many of our
own classes to have
folly::function members,
and if folly::function
wasn't noexcept movable
then it would be like kind of contagious,
all those other data structures
that contain folly::function
would become no except movable.
And we rather want to live in a world
where roughly everything
is noexcept movable,
so yeah, that's what we decided for that.
We also decide to make a const correct,
and like I said earlier,
std::function kind of
makes a mistake if you will
that it accepts functions
that mutate their state
but appears as a thing that
does not mutate its state.
And now you can choose whether
you should go the way where the
state should be mutate-able,
then you can accept anything
but you'll also need a non-const reference
of your function wrapper
to be able to call it,
or you go the other way and
say everything is const,
we only accept callables that
do not mutate their state
when we call them.
And then it's fine that the
folly::function also called
as a const state.
Those are the two options,
and we basically have both of them.
So it comes in two flavors,
the folly::function template,
which takes the function signature here.
You can add const at the end,
and then it's the const behavior,
otherwise it's the mutable behavior.
Implementation details,
comparing with what I told you
what std::function earlier.
Folly::function objects
are a little bit larger.
They occupy 64 bytes.
The implementations
actually pretty similar
to how std::function works.
So folly::function also
contains two function pointers,
one that calls your actual object,
and the other one that
call to management function
for moving your object,
deleting your object, et cetera.
And then there's now 48 bytes
left for in place storage.
The reason why we made
it a little bit bigger,
I mean this is a trade off.
The larger you make the wrapper,
the more objects you can store in line
without extra memory allocations.
But the larger you make it,
the more memory you just waste if
you end up storing small objects in it.
So it's kind of like
you can pick your size,
and we just came down on 64 bytes because
it aligns nicely with cache lines
on our standard architecture.
I think for a moment we also thought
64 bytes is good because then we can store
a std::function object
if we have those still
lying around in our code base.
We can wrap this here without
an extra memory allocation.
However, that argument
doesn't really work,
because like I said earlier std::function
is not noexcept movable,
and in order to have
folly::function no except movable
we have to put all objects
that are not noexcept movable
on the heap because the
pointer to the heap object
we can always move that
without throwing exceptions,
but we might not be able
to move the object itself.
Speaking of wrapping one
in the other of those two,
you can absolutely wrap
a std::function object
in a folly::function, but
not the other way around.
The reason is just the
copyability requirements.
Because folly::function aren't copyable,
you can't store it in the std::function.
Other way around works fine,
which is a good thing as
you migrate your code base
and your APIs, it's mostly
kind of backwards compatible,
if you change functions
or take folly::functions,
they can still accept
std::function past them.
Okay, and then we migrated
to folly::function.
It works mostly as a drop-in
replacement for std::function.
The places where it doesn't work
as a simple drop-in replacement
are those where you
actually need copyability
of your function wrapper.
Those cases are surprisingly rare,
I really didn't find many of those.
The other thing is if you rely on this lax
const correctness
behavior of std::function,
then you might run into problems
when you switch to folly::function,
but I think that is a good thing because
if your code only works
when const correctness
is not enforced then that's kind of a bug,
and should be fixed anyway.
What we also learned is
of those two varients, the
mutable and the const variant
of folly::function,
in most places we need the mutable one.
Like all const folly::function
is used occasionally,
but not very often.
And what I also saw when
I was migrating APIs
that we often passed
std::function as const references,
which led to many sort
of accidental copies
of std::function.
And what you have to do in order to
make it work with folly::function,
you have to pass them either
as non-const references,
or as available references.
Most of the times, available
reference is because
you kind of move them
down your API layers.
This basically applies only to
the mutable variant of folly::function.
If you have the const
variant of folly::function,
then you can also pass
it as a const reference.
At least, if you want
to execute the function
in the function that
you pass it to, anyway.
So, migration has happened in many places.
The adoption at Facebook is
such that in the examples
that I showed you earlier
for the APIs, I showed you
the folly::future example,
that is not based on folly::function,
and that was an instant win.
Because no usercode had to change,
but from that time on people could just
move capture data in the lambdas,
move only types as well,
and it just worked.
It's compiled and it works as expected.
Folly::function also
replaced std::function
for the other example,
the folly::Executor,
the space class way can pass tasks
to some implementations
that execute the task later.
That was a little bit more work because
being a base class we have a
good number of implementations.
So you had to go through
all the implementations
and see if you could just flip the type,
whether the implementation
would still work,
or whether copies were made.
Which usually were just accidental copies,
it was just copies where people
forget to write standard move,
not copies they made
because they actually wanted
to have a copy.
And in those cases where the migration
was actually non-trivial,
it usually pointed to
other problems in the code.
For us, especially when
you actually make copies
of objects that was a problem because
other parts of the code base
never expected that to happen,
so they used this rend
folly move wrapper thing.
But after a while, it wasn't
that difficult, really.
Now we have both, we have std::function,
we have folly::function,
and both can be useful.
So, when you have functions,
when you have code that actually wants
to get a function pass and will later
have to make copies of that,
std::function is exactly what you need.
I would say in pretty
much every other case,
folly::function is better because
it's less restrictive for the user.
If you don't need to make copies,
don't force your user to
give you something copyable.
And then the thing for our code base,
that might not be the
same problem for everyone,
but because we have lifts
along with std::functions
and the problems and we
made these workarounds
and we used folly::MoveWrapper
as a workaround,
we have this folly::MoveWrapper now
in many places in the code base
that makes it difficult
to use std::function
for its intended purpose,
because if you use std::function with the
intention to actually make copies,
you might still have people
passing you move wrapper objects
and then copies are not possible at all.
But that's like, maybe, a problem
specific to our code base.
Alright, I should show
you some benchmarks.
So I said it was as fast or better
in runtime speed as folly::function.
So this is a benchmark,
the benchmark code itself is also part
of the folly repository,
so when you check it out on github
you can rerun this yourself.
And this is only a subset of
the benchmark that it runs.
But roughly speaking the upper half
what is compared here
is invoking a function,
invoking a fn_ptr,
invoking a std_function,
invoking a folly_function.
Standard memory, if you're interested.
And basically, the
important thing is just...
Ah, wrong button.
Is just this here,
invoking a std::function
takes 2.3 nanosecond.
Invoking a folly::function
takes two nanoseconds.
So it's even slightly better.
And then there's another benchmark
which first creates one of those objects
and then invokes it.
So creating a function
pointer doesn't really
take any time.
So, I guess that's probably
a measurement error here,
that it's slightly faster.
But then creating a std::function object,
and then afterwards invoking it,
ah there we are, takes three nanoseconds.
I was off by one line.
Takes three nanoseconds for std::function,
and for folly::function, 2.8 nanoseconds.
So it's not really that
important that it's faster,
it was only important for us that we don't
invent a performance regression,
and that's obviously not the case.
Alright, conclusions, all the
things that I've said before.
Folly::function is mostly
drop-in replacement
for std::function.
It lifts the requirement for copyability
of your wrapped objects.
The migration to folly::function
is usually fairly easy,
makes the code look nicer in many places.
It enforces const
correctness, which is good,
because the compiler
can help you spot bugs.
It's as fast or better as
std::function at run-time.
And after 18 months we
are pretty happy, I guess,
at Facebook with it.
With that, I thank you all for coming,
and I think we probably
have a few minutes left
for questions if there are any.
(audience applauds)
- [Man] I have one question about const.
What does const mean for a callback?
Does it mean that the callback
objects itself is const?
- So, const.
I don't know if this is now
more confusing, or helpful,
but it's basically the const
that you would put here
in your own function.
So const means that you
can't mutate the state
that you have packaged
with your callable object.
So in a lambda, when
you capture some data,
you can't change that data
unless you declare the lambda mutable,
then you allow it.
And the mutable lambda is not const,
can't be wrapped as a const thing.
Whereas, the non-mutable
lambda is const, and it's fine.
- [Man] So it's basically the object
with the operator callback.
- Yes, basically const means that
your object can be invoked
from a const reference.
If it's non-const, you
need a non-const reference
to the object to actually call it.
- [Man] Hi, from what I
see from your migration
from std::function to folly::function,
you don't have any API
problems at Facebook?
Or how did you manage that?
- I don't want to say zero,
there's always the odd case where
there's like a little chain of things
where you see you don't
have to change one API,
but like sort of a
dependency chain of APIs,
and at some point it
gets maybe complicated.
But like in general,
it turned out to be easier than I thought,
as in general in most
places it was a fairly
one to one replacement,
and the most things I had
to change, for examples,
implementors of the executors class were
the people were not
careful and making copies
of the task even though
they didn't have to,
just because they didn't
write standard move,
and that kind of thing so,
just swapping the type broke the build,
but that was super easy to fix.
And in the few cases where
it wasn't trivial to fix,
it was really pointing
to an underlying problem,
I would say.
- [Man] I think the
question was about binary--
- [Man] Yes, API--
- Oh, sorry.
So, say that again then.
- [Man] So, my question was,
given the way you migrated
from those two functions
in folly::function, it appears
that you don't have any
API problems so I'm just wondering
how did you feel that you deploy yourself?
- Yeah, that's more like a workflow thing,
we basically statically link everything
and build everything
from current masters, so,
it didn't have to be binary compatible.
Good point, I never thought about that,
because working at Facebook,
and linking everything
statically I never had to,
so yeah, thanks for the question.
- [Man] Just as an implementation detail,
I wondered what the management
function pointer was for
inside the wrapper.
- Okay, so this is somewhat
an optimization thing as well.
So basically, the code that
the compiler has to instantiate
separately for every type
that you want to wrap in it,
is obviously invoking your object,
but then in std::function
you have to be able
to make a copy of that object
when the std::function itself is copied.
You have to be able to
destroy the object when
the std::function is destroyed.
Std::function also has
a couple of other things
that we never needed like
getting the type idea from the wrap type
and things like this.
And they basically bundled
everything that is not invocation
into one function so that
you don't have to store
that many function pointers in it.
And it's like, the trade off is like,
okay invocation is the standard use case,
that should be fast,
so we have a dedicated
function pointer in the object
to quickly execute the function.
Everything else, operations
that don't happen so often.
So we bundled them all into one function
so we only have to store
one function pointer,
if that makes sense.
(Sven laughs)
Obviously not.
- [Man] I guess I don't understand
where that function comes from.
Is that another argument that you'd added?
- No, so, think of it...
In the implementation of
the assignment operator
and the constructor
that can take any type.
Basically there the compiler instantiates
some other templated static functions,
and stores their function pointers.
So it's the compiler
doing the work for you
for every type that you have a pass
to those function wrappers.
I get a sessions over sign.
There was like half a question,
is it really quick?
- [Man] I wanted to know if you
used like multiple functions
or you have this
Frankenstein function that
you store only the one function pointer,
and the strength of the
Frankenstein function.
- So you mean this management function?
- [Man] Yeah, management function.
- So the point is...
The question is whether folly::function
does the same trick with
this bundled function
that does various management
functions, and yes.
The implementation is fairly
similar to std::function.
It's really just the decisions.
You have to decide whether
your type is copyable or not,
and we made a different decision.
But we kind of use all the same tricks
of std::function in the
implementation otherwise.
Alright, sessions over,
thank you all very much for coming.
