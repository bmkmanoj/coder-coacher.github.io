today I'm gonna talk about
Sourcetrail, a software developer tool
for reading and understanding source code.
So my story starts a couple years ago
at the Google Chrome team.
I was an intern and my task was
add a check box to the web inspector
to show and hide this frame red meter.
And it was a super simple task.
The only problem was
it took me three weeks.
And I learned a big lesson.
I learned that software developers
really spend a lot of time on reading
and understanding source code.
And we can argue about the numbers,
but most developers I
talk to agree that it's
somewhere between 50 to
98 percent, or something.
And that got me wondering like,
do we really have the
best tools for this task?
And so, the Chromium team has a
really powerful tool actually.
They have Chromium Code Search,
which does cross referencing.
It's basically an in-browser,
find all references.
But, after working with
this tool for months,
I was wondering, you know,
I look at source code all the time
and I have to collect all information
by looking at files and
build this mental model.
Can't I just, you know,
have a tool that helps me
build that mental model somehow?
And, I'm gonna do a jump here
so you can read the
whole story on our blog.
But it turns out, yes it's possible.
And so, our result is Sourcetrail,
which is a offline
cross-platform developer tool.
And what it does is it
indexes your source code.
It uses Clang LibTooling to retrieve
all the information
about which classes exist
and how they reference each other.
And the user interface is then made for
simple navigation and exploration,
consisting of search, code,
and graph, and demo time.
All right.
So, pretty much, works like that.
You just search for anything like
I chose classes, methods, whatever.
And since the last build you can
also filter by just classes.
And then, the graph shows you like
first level dependencies
to all other symbols.
And the code shows you the
definition plus all references.
You can click on anything here
and it will update both sites.
And here the class player,
you also see it has
base class on top, derived
ones at the bottom.
And if you click on etches,
it will show you the exact location.
Some features that are useful sometimes
is like looking at a whole call graph
leading to a certain
function method being called.
You can do the same thing with classes
and see like the whole inheritance chain.
Like this information, just
information in the graph,
is scattered between
four files or something.
So the graph really helps in
seeing the bigger picture of things.
And lastly, you guys like templates, so
for template classes you
can also see implicit
specializations and you can
see where they are used.
All right, I could go on for
probably an hour, but time is short.
All right, so we have
an intro video where I
show more of the tool
if you're interested.
And so, Sourcetrail is
already a tool that is,
that you can download and
use and that's helpful.
But, at the same time, it's
still in heavy development
and we add new features
with every new release.
So, I'd be happy to have
to you having a look
and give me some feedback.
And everything I just showed you
you can find on sourcetrail.com
and thank you for listening.
