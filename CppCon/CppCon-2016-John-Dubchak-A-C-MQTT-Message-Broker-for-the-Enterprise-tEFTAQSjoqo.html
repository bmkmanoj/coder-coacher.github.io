how many people here are interested in
kind of a distributed system approach to
this all right
so a lot of this is on the design of the
broker to use MQTT as the protocol now I
don't have a lot of distributed system
content on here but what I can do
having done a system very similar using
a lot of the same content I can actually
weave some of that in if you're
interested so don't be afraid to ask
questions hey how would you do XY and Z
by extending this okay so don't be shy
about going further I'll try and take
those questions as they come I'll do my
best
I'll answer based on the knowledge we
share here the knowledge from that other
system and if some of it goes too far
and you know I don't mind saying I got
no idea but I can try and look it up for
you that's unreasonable good all right
see if I can get this going all right
are you ready cool all right so I'm John
Doug check I work at Castlight health as
well advance of slide I guess so I'm new
with this clicker so give me some time
with it already straight again here we
go here we go so our agenda today
typical right first thing you want to do
is shameless self-promotion and then I'm
gonna give you a little overview of
messaging how many here are familiar
with messaging systems in the enterprise
just what kind of systems are we
familiar with anyone
or me rabbit rabbit I'm cute okay
self-made system there's a lot of those
in the enterprise 0 mq JMS I heard yep
that's yeah
funny thing you'll see someone a little
bit of concepts from JMS in here as well
you know a lot of that is my background
as well so we're going to talk a little
bit about basic messaging concepts in
regardless of what system you've worked
in whether it be homegrown RabbitMQ 0 mq
JMS or any of them they all
fundamentally talked about the same
things and with enterprise messaging the
scale is larger the challenges are
bigger but essentially the same
fundamentals underlie all of that as
well so with the MQTT messaging protocol
we're going to get into designing and
implementing a broker kind of the
challenges I faced and where it came
from and what's interesting about that
is I was at C++ now back in May was
anybody there that's in the room nobody
good anybody in MQTT expert excellent so
everything I tell you except for this
guy here is the straight-up truth
believe me take it at gospel truth so at
at buscando call it as well
in May I sat through a presentation with
Michael chase presenting on his mqtt
client I hadn't really used MQTT I'd
used
rabbitmq and you know activemq and some
of the other larger ones WebSphere and
you know for four basic messaging and
messaging systems to think about
enterprise messaging right if you're
actually talking about the low level
messaging protocol as a developer I
think you're doing something wrong
because you're
actually talking about fundamental
things that should be abstracted away
from application-level concerns kind of
my opinion anyways but Michael presented
was a really interesting client design
and implementation on what they had done
for a kind of a glass sorting machine
and so I thought you know I really
hadn't had much experience with mqtt so
I thought here's a great opportunity for
me to try and sit down with what he said
was a lightweight protocol something
that was reasonably easy to t use and
maybe I could design a broker around
that based on like I said an earlier
rest server that I had written that
worked across a number of machine
sharing work and distributed work as
well and I thought what you know I'll
give a shot so this is kind of the work
product of that irrational decision at
the time so a little bit about me been
doing C++ I want to say since well my
first encounter with C++ was back in 91
and reading a chapter of a book the book
was on see there was a chapter on C++
and I started with templates you can
guess how that went and so I didn't
really do much with it until about 95
when I picked up more information really
on just how to do regular C++ versus C
with classes and I stuck with it and
started professionally programming about
97 receipt West Was and they're going to
the conferences that have been being
offered since about I think it was 2000
or 2001 I believe it was 2000 the first
conference I attended was in Boston and
they ended up sitting beside Eric nabla
for the week
and that was right around the time that
Andres book on modern C++ design which I
had in my hand and brought with me and I
asked Andre to sign it you know he
signed it for me you know he was a guru
a rock star at the time and I was just a
little guy trying to learn all this
stuff and you can tell what Eric's
career where it's gone the trajectory in
mind that it wasn't lost in water so
messaging overview so what is messaging
my definition of messaging is abstract
right the communication of data from a
sender to receiver over a given
messaging channel and agreed-upon format
of exchange
now what's key here
Tori missed one its communication all
right what can all agree with that it's
data we have a sender we have a receiver
there's a channel it's great an
agreed-upon format and we're having an
exchange and what's interesting about
that and I'm not gonna say too much
about it because most of us have
messaging experience is these to me
represent the domain of interest when
designing a messaging system and to me
the canonical messaging model is
basically client-server right request in
response and that's what really MQTT is
built around requesting a response
regardless of what the messaging the
actual request is there's always a
communication of requests and response
so look this is really advancing so in
the styles of communication we appoint a
point right T 0 to TN T 1 represents a
time point where after the client sends
a message it actually is received by the
server and between t1 and t2 server does
some processing and an acknowledgement
is sent back well or the server has
received it in the connection or the
communication ends here there's no
communication right
JMS or other things I just called a
queue you just drop a message on a queue
fire-and-forget requested in response
similar to what we saw t0 to t1 same
sort of thing t1 to t2 the server
receives it processes that generates an
acknowledgment and from t3 to t4 sends
it back now the key here aside from the
obvious client and server you know we
have our request we have our response
but these blue arrows represent a really
important thing right the communication
channel the only reason I highlight that
is because in mqtt it represents a
persistent connection on both ends right
so failing that persistent connection
you're going to have a broken connection
no communication and a failed pattern so
request callback same sort of thing now
what's interesting in this case the
initiating client and the responding
client or the callback client don't have
to be the same / same component or the
same process but they can be and
oftentimes in certain things they are
and then the last thing this is the last
one oops nope the actor model right
everybody's familiar with reactive
programming now and WebSockets and
things like that the actor model it's
just a mathematical model of concurrent
computation treats actors as universal
primitives of concurrent computation
nothing special but the really nice
thing with that is that you're you're
folding an entire state and the entire
communication of everything into one I
guess I want to say unit of work but
that's not even the right word one
abstraction
in our case would almost be a single
callable now the last one we're looking
at is published and subscribed and the
reason I left publish and subscribe last
is because similar to the call back
model we have a subscriber who
subscribes to an endpoint and in the
case of mqtt it the endpoint is I don't
think I included a slide unfortunately
Wow
what a mistake that was its slash
forward slash delimited if you will and
they register with the publisher and
then they in this case the
acknowledgement or the response contains
subscription information that may or may
not be stored by the subscriber and the
reason it's dotted is that again may or
may not be this received by the same
subscriber and what was interesting
about that is yesterday Michael's talk
they used a proxy to actually
communicate between their subscriber and
the broker to avoid the persistent
connection between whatever mobile
device or whatever tiny device they had
and then communicated with that proxy in
order to handle the persistent
connection so you can assume a proxy in
small embedded devices very small tiny
like it you know and your maybe your
mobile phone or maybe even a heart
sensor for instance it can't maintain a
persistent connection to some server you
know in the cloud on your on its behalf
so it would proxy through something and
then connect periodically in order to
exchange state or communicate so in this
case
t zero obviously t one represents that
first transmission T two is the receipt
and then t2 the t3 is the delay in
whatever the publisher has to do and to
connect or to sorry
create whatever response and
subscription info it needs to and then T
four represents that subscription being
forwarded basic basic basic but I want
to make sure that we all talk about the
same thing
so with enterprise messaging right we
have a number of tools or suite of tools
that provide anything business process
orchestration systems and data
integration monitoring transformation
and routing logging security you name it
right there's all these things what's
interesting about one of these things
one of these points here this
transformation and routing that's really
kind of the canonical definition of what
a broker is there's other aspects to
enterprise messaging as well around the
systems and data integration and
messaging and orchestration that provide
a deeper richer functionality and with
mqtt being a lightweight messaging
protocol that actually exchanged in a
binary format you need to ask yourself
okay if I wanted to bridge those two
worlds how could I do that and we'll
talk a little bit later about ways that
you could actually transform or
integrate mqtt with an enterprise system
simply by mapping or translating and
kind of by I don't want to use the word
proxying but we'll see different
patterns later or we'll talk about it at
least so then again all of the different
technologies we talked about earlier and
most systems are not homogeneous who
works with a single tool technology here
none of us right all right so the
architectural attributes of enterprise
systems highly available fault tolerant
secure redundant reliable with delivery
guarantee and retry and message ordering
now there's one issue with MQTT the
protocol doesn't talk about message
ordering matter of fact it doesn't
guarantee message ordering it does talk
about delivering messages in a
guaranteed manner to the extent that you
have certain things configured at the
time you connect and establish a
communication connection with the broker
but it doesn't guarantee message
delivery so with most brokers well with
any broker you're not going to get that
unless you create some sort of extension
or have some sort of extension which is
where you know you get into an issue of
getting now you're outside the protocol
you're adding different functionality so
moving on and then client session
management there is small session
management that MQTT talks about but
it's very specific on what it manages
and it only manages a small amount of
state so getting to the protocol so
that's what it means it's a pub sub pub
size pub sub message model and it's
standardized both in Oasis and ISO
lightweight but it's got to constrain
vocabulary so if it was a DSL you know
it would be small enough to implement
and easily consumable so the protocol
requirements is that enters your data
values 16 bits and big-endian order all
text is utf-8 and encoded strings so
you're transferring bytes clients have
to send bytes broker receives bytes
acknowledgments are invites everything's
in bytes now that leads to a problem if
you're trying to send a lot of data
because all strings are prefixed with a
2 byte length and in utf-8 strings are
limited to 65 535 bytes character data
must be well formed and the null
character is not permitted in string
data so you're not sending gigabytes of
data across the network that
unfortunately is kind of a limitation
obviously in our private messaging so
the question becomes where would you use
mqtt if you were going to use it as part
of your messaging architecture and
enterprise messaging you might use it
say is a small eventing maybe a small
notification system or you might
actually take and use different
enterprise integration patterns with it
so for instance rather than trying to
transfer you know the huge amounts of
data you know anything over 65 K for
instance I mean that's a pretty limited
amount so take for instance if you're
doing a regular integration pattern
where you're transferring for instance
say a small file that's you know less
than a Meg but say it's 600 K that's not
unreasonable to transfer 600 K across
the wire what is that let's make it 400
K so that's a hundred packets hundred
packets isn't that that much right but
the problem is you can't send that so
what are you going to do send you know
that many messages problem is you can't
link messages so with regular patterns
you could do something along the lines
of rather than sending the large file
you could probably send in the payload
maybe a file location or maybe an
endpoint or something that then you know
your
goes to an endpoint consumer that then
calls back pulls I file down and then
continues processing as part of the the
enterprise integration pattern so you're
limited to the amount of data you can
send but you're not limited based on
your patterns and you know for most
people if you've read Gregor Hope's book
on enterprise integration patterns
there's a litany of things you can do to
work around that so moving on so the
message types very very simple right
there's a connect subscribe and
unsubscribe and then for each of those
you have your corresponding and
acknowledgments publish and then you're
published release publish complete ping
request ping response and disconnect now
the key is when you're communicating
between these two client and server or
subscriber and publisher how do you
maintain that connection and that's
obviously where ping comes in the ping
requests so let's look at a couple of
use cases right the Internet of Things
is great because you have all these
different devices they could publish
through the broker through their various
endpoints you know you can have your
thermostat publish to a point say
thermostat is connected through your
home and maybe it's connected through
home convenience comfort and it says ok
it's message is too hot or maybe it's
cooling down this is okay just right so
now maybe that I'm not sure what that
symbol is does anyone know give me a
guess a SmartWatch really that looks
like a what does that do
that's the SmartWatch right sending
email
hahahaha
that's a female's watch the other one's
a male okay alright I'll go with that
sorry smartphone and yeah it was a neat
symbol I'm like I'll put it on there so
you end up publishing through the end
point in this case I mean there might be
something listening for that say let's
say it's this whatever this is it wants
to know when the temperature reached
reaches a certain point it would
subscribe to that particular endpoint in
the broker that that publishes two picks
up the message and then would carry out
some action right so publish/subscribe
it's basically an event notification
system you know and you could have
coordination within your house right the
smart thing tv turns on the refrigerator
opens so you can go get your snack
another interesting one there's your
there's your enterprise architecture why
couldn't you actually have part of your
event notification system down in here
MQTT broker living it's not too
difficult you could do it so let's look
at the use case I've got about thirty
minutes maybe a little bit longer that's
that's a good point so what I'm going to
do rather than go into all of the server
design and stuff I decided to focus on
the connect because the connect would
give enough meat I guess to the design
of the actual broker and then we can get
into how I would scale that broker if I
was gonna actually do something
distribute it with it sorry when I
actually do something distributed with
it so again simply use case right that's
connecting we have our basic channel
stuff to worry about we have our
subscriber publisher client broker and
then from there it's really what we care
about we have
the transport connect that happens
between the client an air transport and
a broker and that's not something we're
gonna see too much in terms of something
we really care about but when you're
writing software that's what you end up
starting at and then you have very
simply your connect through the
transport and then the acknowledgement
so what does that lead to some basic
abstractions so here's in mqtt here's
the header you end up sending or the
list of data and I'll break it down
that's the header part you know type is
the type of that header is actually
common across all all of the connections
type is only four bits long and one
refers to connect I think two is connect
DAC or something and then you know
publish pub acts subscribe subscribe act
all of those things and then this one
here it's not anything it's reserved and
then length just refers to the remaining
length of the message that is calculated
and then protocol well advance it to the
next part and this is the variable
header where you end up sending the
protocol which is MQTT the level which
is the version number in this case this
is 3.11
the Union here of the bits is the rules
essentially around what is getting sent
so first bit is reserved clean session
means that I'm starting with a new
session or I want to preserve my session
the will message just means I'm going to
send you a message
that lives down here that when I
disconnect you're gonna send it back to
me so that I can take some action
whether it be notifying something
internally or I can do something with it
quality of service is two bits which
just it's zero one or two and then we'll
routine tells me or tells the broker
client tells a broker I want you to
retain that message in the session so
that you do tell me
and then password and username obviously
really password and username are nothing
more than flags that say okay I have a
password username in the payload of this
payload client ID is the only one that's
required the rest are optional because
you need to connect before you can
subscribe to a topic right so that topic
is just there it's not used all right so
moving on we're gonna look at the flags
and kind of go into a little more detail
on what they mean because there's a
several different rules so clean session
zero must resume communication based on
current session will if it's one
connections accepted a message must be
stored right just like I said will sorry
wrong button if will message is zero
will QSR QoS quality of service must be
zero will message is one QoS can be
neither can be either 0 1 or 2
and then we'll retain broker should
retain will message or not 1 or 0
password is present past user name is
present what's interesting must not be
present they used must a lot meaning
that you clearly there's it's you can't
interpret it any other way it just must
and
your contact is just basic the only
thing you care about our session and
return code and those are the return
codes just basic stuff so looking at the
component design on the preliminaries so
I tried to use templates a lot as we're
supposed to use policy based design
similar to what was recommended in
Andres book it's a great design
technique I don't use as much template
metaprogramming as I do as others do but
I do use a bit of it and then
implementations based on first
principles meaning that I didn't use
boost ASIO library whereas others one of
them thought I would and it's just
implemented as a single daemon on Linux
now the trick here is if not a trick
sorry
kind of a poor choice of words with
demons on Linux you can you can run more
than one but with mqtt it's the protocol
and the standard require a very specific
port and you can't run obviously on the
same port so it's one and done on the
host and then for me this was just a
personal research project exploring mqtt
again there wasn't any goals around
providing distributed semantics to this
again that was another project and I do
have several policies that I can
actually now fold into it should I want
those so where I started we can ignore
configuration and logging I mean that's
I did do some state management around
session the interesting thing is
design around rules involving the use of
predicates and where I was going with
that was I wanted to do very attic
templates with predicates and I thought
it would be really cool if you could
create a set of predicates rolled up as
a set of very attic templates and then
just do an apply on them and I got close
but I didn't didn't really have enough
time to wrap it up and so it kind of
left that implementation off and then
the the process scaling simply just
means you know I was using thread
pooling and package tasks as a way to to
handle a little bit of scaling inside
the server and then you know response
handling channel communications and
request processing all within the broker
the broker runs as a single process so
the details around that apologize for
how the slide is laid out really I'm
just showing a class for the broker that
derives from a basic demon and that
demon actually is has a network policy
and it takes another handle or sorry an
acceptor which is again a template
template parameter of an accept it takes
an opaque handle so it kind of builds on
itself and the demon itself is actually
a little more involved so the demon
takes a number of policies but there
most of them are defaults so there's a
demon policy and the idea what that
demon policy is that you could
instantiate a demon on on other
platforms as well my Poppa
parameterizing the puppet the policy the
signal handler and then just in this
case I defaulted for exception handling
to throw a runtime error
and then instantiating the broker it's
pretty straightforward right you read
some configuration set it up the handles
type just an opaque definitely mas not
opaque it's a specific type server name
you set setup the port call start it
gets interesting when after that what
happens after starts so in the Linux
daemon this is from Michael Karras book
Linux programming interface I just want
to make sure that everybody understood
creating daemons I don't know if anybody
does that writes this stuff for
themselves but the nice thing is with
creating a demon
simply call fork and that actually just
basically kills your parent makes you a
child process of the init process and
from there you actually call set session
ID to give you a new session obviously
exit if it returns minus 1 and as a
convenient shortcut calling fork again
actually does a bunch of extra work
behind the scenes and it relieves you of
the burden of having to do a bunch of
stuff on Linux and you clear the you
mask set the working directory to route
clear some file descriptors careful if
you've got a logging framework that uses
file descriptors that's a fun one and
then you use dupe to to reopen standard
out standard error to dev know and then
so the networking service if you
remember that was the policy for the
basic daemon now remember we had the
transport layer and this is kind of what
this access you'll see the the network
service is parameterised with a socket
socket life style life cycles sorry it
takes and accept
it takes an accept service descriptor
and it derives from them now the key is
when you call start start is delegated
to by the daemon and determines if it's
listening on that socket connects to it
listens and then sets up for our accept
write and the accept is what reads the
or waits for connections so that wait
for connection real straightforward so
it's an internal override it just loops
forever calls receive on itself and it
gets a handle back if the handle is good
and it's enabled reading on it or if it
doesn't enable reading we we have a
problem otherwise some magic happens and
it's not really magic because here it is
handler is called handle on that and it
creates a response strategy and really
what that response strategy does is
nothing more than allow for the exchange
to occur our story to be created and
that buffer that gets created from the
message to the exchange eventually ends
up being part of this task and submitted
to a pool which is a thread pool for
work so all in all the server just gets
a connect in builds the message whatever
type of message it is based on an
exchange submits it to the pool and
that's really what the broker does now
the key to the broker being able to
enforce all its rules and handle its
status changes if you will is the on
status change so the broker passes this
instance and of itself on the exchange
and on you'll see how the exchange does
callbacks as it progresses through its
lifecycle so what's an exchange it has a
state-created running stop blocked
canceled finished and there's a proceed
you can get the status you can set the
status you notice in a minute why and
then you can also get the configuration
and set the configuration now this is
really an abstract interface and really
in the exchange it starts the task the
exchange state is transitioned from
created to in progress and the event
callback occurs on the broker the broker
receives a non-conference to that
exchange and then in depending on what
type of exchange that is again we're
going to have a connect exchange the
SUBSCRIBE exchange publish exchange and
various acts because the exchange is the
one that communicates with the client
and does connection cleanup at the end
and it notifies the broker so it knows
based on its type what rules it needs to
enforce so again while not completely
isolated like an actor it's it's
encapsulated enough that it manages
enough of its state that it's
independent oh wow that's last line so
the point with that and where I would go
with that because again you have this
this state if you will in the exchange
and it handles or it operates
independently in a separate thread the
only with the connection so if you look
at the messaging and let's talk about
the distribution part right so how would
I distribute this as a system the first
thing I'm thinking right now is a single
broker would handle you could do several
things you could configure this broker
to handle only connections then you
could have a separate broker that
manages state for those connections and
you could configure multiple publishers
to handle again the communication layer
of publishing sending and receiving and
even subscriptions so you would
distribute the work of breaking up a
broker into multiple I guess not
processes but by the phases if you will
and and do that but the problem I see
with that is that given the size of the
communication that you're not going to
have a lot of pending work being done
and not a lot of iqb connection but I
think you'd be more connection bound
than anything so you'd probably just
scale the connections with a proxy
server in front of that even and get
around that but at any rate I don't I'm
not really sure so I mean we're a little
early but I thought I'd open it up to
questions
sorry I missed that last part what was
the driving force
excellent question so the question was a
lot of these concepts and things have
already been implemented in 0m q and
rabbitmq and any of the other m qs
already so what was the driving force in
implementing this and mqtt it's good
question for me it was mostly to explore
MQTT it wasn't hey I'm gonna build a
better mousetrap it was a lightweight
protocol ultimately what I'd like to do
is be able to scale this down to
embedded devices and actually distribute
those embedded devices and see how I
could actually get multiple devices to
work together that's really all it you
know it's mostly selfishly motivated you
know RabbitMQ on a JVM you know or even
working with other heavier products that
require more memory you're not going to
really be able to do that so it was just
mostly kind of a research project on my
own yes so the broker right now so sorry
let me repeat the question so the
question was the limit size of the
message is 65 K but the payload limit is
260 megabytes you say so how does your
broker treat the payload size does it
treat it well right now I mean you could
right now I have
pushed it to the point where I have
exceeded multiple clients you know
pushing that much data through it so I
can't really say oh it scales really
well because I mean that's a performance
test that I just haven't run on it but I
mean I can't really say it treats it
well or not so I haven't done that but
you know theoretically it's it's gonna
fall over at some point you know I'm
gonna have to bleed off some of that
that work to something else and and
that's either be some sort of you know
distributed workers or something that
handled that work you know just file
readers or file writers or something
that's you know proxied somewhere else
yes excellent so what is the strategy I
use for packaging tasks and thread pool
so I have a thread pool that I've
written that's just a regular thread
pool and I just use regular package
tests that was a kind of a definition
like a using clause that I was showing
and I just move the the actual oh sorry
let me back up so in the thread pool
it's got a template parameter it accepts
and so I'm passing in the actual package
test as that and then as a callable so
I've wrapped it into a callable and from
that callable when I move that into the
thread pool when it's ready for work the
wrapper function that that package task
is in then handles calling the package
task waiting for the result
again keeping in mind that there's
callbacks right in the exchange that
occur after that happens I haven't done
a performance test like two clients it
depends on the size of the message and
what they're doing right part me an MQ
message empty message or you're thinking
deadlock is that what you're suggesting
cuz that was both the only thing I can
think of like that you'd be worried
about but that right there wasn't the
exact that didn't include the locking
code I have so there are there are two
different locks in two different scopes
right there's a submit submission lock
that is different than the actual lock
that wraps the receipt of it and the
reading of the data so they occur in two
different locks and they don't cross if
you will I know if that's right
they don't overlap I guess it's the
right term yeah I mean empty message and
two clients you're thinking deadlock
right right and then again I'm not doing
performance at this point this is I only
started this in June so it's only been a
few months you know maybe maybe next
year at this time maybe I'll have well I
definitely will have if I keep up with
it so it plans again there's a schedule
I have between now and C++ now of what
I'm doing and
version Stephan project plans so you
know anyone else yes it did yeah well
it's part of the MQTT sorry let me
repeat the question so in the earlier
slides I had a struct for the Kinect and
in the header that I identified there
was not only just header data but there
was other stuff so the specification
talks about a canonical format so
there's a fixed header a variable header
and then the payload and that's in all
messages and in the case of the Kinect
it's very specific well in all of the
messages very specific of the format or
and the types of data that go in each
and for the connect header the initial
sorry I'm just thinking big endian
versus the little Andy and I'm just
trying to the type is the most
significant bits requires four and then
there's another least significant bits
are reserved and then the next byte is
the remaining length and then after that
I can't remember off the top of my head
there was something else but that was
the but that was kind of what I tried
depicting in that struct so it is it is
according to the SPECT based on how it
is and then in the make message
the function that I have the template
function I go through and actually build
the message correctly byte by byte
according to the spec and how its laid
out I'm not sure if that answers your
question but there are certain reserved
you know bits and there are is a strict
format on how the bytes align and layout
so it is it is to match with that though
not in the exact bit format so those
watching at home what the spec open
don't scream bloody murder because there
is bytes manipulation that happens in
they make message so does that answer
your question
and I can show you more after if you are
anyone else okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
