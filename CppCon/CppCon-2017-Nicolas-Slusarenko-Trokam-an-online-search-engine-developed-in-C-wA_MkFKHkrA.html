I wonder if I could develop
online search engine.
So I made up this working prototype.
Let's see if we search for instance,
for Linux, what we got.
Well these are the results.
You see there are no advertisements.
All the results are out-did-able.
Let's check out.
Oh.
This is the result of
the ranking algorithm.
That means that you could know why
the results are in that particular order.
The page ranking algorithm
I'm using is fairly simple.
But no matter how basic or complex
this algorithm becomes in time,
it's my commitment that the
results will be out-date-able.
This prototype, I call this Step One.
It's almost entirely done in C++ okay?
Working on this prototype I learned
the design challenges and the
bottlenecks I have to solve.
I already start working on Step Two
which is completely, fully C++.
You might check out in the footer links,
there's a link to the Step Two
so you might get a flavor
of what's going on in this.
Everything is running on the cloud.
This Step One is running on Digital Ocean
and Step Two is already
installed on Amazon Web Services.
The new database model,
the new database model
is already implemented in AWS Aurora.
I would say that Step
Two will be completed
once the system recurrently index
100 million pages with
the new ranking algorithm.
All the code is free, it's GPL'd
and it's already available in Get Help.
You might find the link in the footer.
Everyone of you are invited to
contribute in this project.
This is not my full time job.
I've been developing this as
my concept in my spare time.
I wish somehow I could devote
more time to this project.
Thank you very much for your attention.
