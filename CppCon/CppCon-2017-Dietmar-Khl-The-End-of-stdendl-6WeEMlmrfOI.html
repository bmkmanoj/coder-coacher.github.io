left it and I came across an though
everybody knows about endo who has used
and though everybody has who's still
using it
everybody is know but some people so
everybody knows how to use it stood out
endo that's great
actually that is not really the biggest
problem because see how it is not
perfect as much but what people normally
see is when you've right and it's a new
line it kind of is a new line but it
actually happens to be slightly more
that's basically a new line and a flush
there's a 10 relief that actually also
entered us something to the new line and
basically translates it into an end of
line sequence it doesn't the
translation from new line into new line
character turn or catch it to a new line
depending on which system you are does
happen on the file system level it's
basically if you open a file and text
mode on some platforms it does translate
addressed to that and it has no business
on that it s actually basically the
reason it exists it's mimicking the i/o
streams on Asko io lbf setting which you
can set and the set V buff stuff or
something like that but it does do a new
line and a flash and basically if you do
that a lot it's like having a van with a
little bit of load and you travel that
over and over what you actually want to
do is you want to have a van which is
like that has fully loaded it's a big
pile of things and every time those van
is full then you want to shovel things
out
it makes messes difference the
difference is on a simple test
this is writing a divine character file
I think it's a million files or lines or
something like that
once this end line once without and line
the it's a performance difference of
factor of six it's not six percent was a
factor of six and that is massive I've
actually worked in multiple places where
people have problems with iostream
performance and was actually entirely
down to endo iostream is
actually not fast it's actually fairly
fast so it's much slower it's actually
fast but if you misuse it it becomes
slow so what you really want to do is if
you really mean to write a flush say
flash the reason ender is not useful for
that anymore is people use it as an end
line character but it's not an end line
it's an end line and flash so you don't
know what they mean if you use flash
you're very obvious what it does if you
really like the funny manipulator
it's very easy to create a manipulator
for yourself if you want to write an L
here's the code this is all it takes and
you can write an hour and you get a
different manipulator name it whatever
you want
so the general approach for writing
manipulators it works nicely so on
summary express intent and don't use
endo it makes your program slow and just
to run thinks of a picture of a cat
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
