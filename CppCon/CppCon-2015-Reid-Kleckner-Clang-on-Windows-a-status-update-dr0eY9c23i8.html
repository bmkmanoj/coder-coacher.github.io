work on clang and I make I basically
work on making clang work well in
Windows I work for Google and basically
it's sort of this whole effort is really
about getting getting clang working so
we can sort of use it for all of our all
of our projects that we ship on Windows
as well as other platforms but you know
everyone else gets to consume it all so
that's that's pretty awesome
and I I gave this talk I decided to give
this talk because I'm here at this
conference and I keep talking to people
and they all want to know you know like
what's the what's what's the deal with
clang on Windows like when am I going to
have it you know what are the what's
done like what what's when will it be
done and so I I felt it was important to
come and basically answer this
frequently asked question so the main
thing is that we basically don't have
exception handling done yet that's what
I'm working on along with one of my
colleagues pretty consistently that's
what I've been doing for several months
and will probably continue to do for a
while the other the other missing piece
for that I think a lot of people will
need before they can actually get into
using clang on Windows for their
day-to-day you know developer experience
on Windows is debug information this is
a very important part of the MVC visual
studio ecosystem that you know we have a
long way to go with and know where we're
going there yeah but what does work as
we spent a lot of time working on MVC
compatibility and getting ASA and
working there and so I was gonna talk
about that first so this is mostly just
a laundry list of the stuff that we've
already worked out right like we've
already spent a very long time making
sure that clang is you know 100%
compatible with the way that visual C++
does like record layout figures out how
it's going to lay out its V tables
exactly what order those you know funny
overloaded virtual methods are going to
be in you know turns out it's backwards
that's fine whatever I don't care but it
works now you know all this good stuff
and if you know this
turned out to be the easy part which is
kind of surprising right like we got
good at this you know and so if you if
you encounter more bugs with
compatibility like you can if you can
file bugs about it with you know
reproducers we were happy to look at it
and I'm you know pretty confident that
we can get through it pretty quickly the
the thing that was not so easy was
exception handling so what's up with
that basically you know seh was designed
probably that 30 years ago or something
and it's you know what it seems like it
was designed in a vacuum I don't know I
don't know who the people were you know
I don't I don't ask I don't need to but
it's not you know it wasn't designed by
multiple compiler vendors the same way
that the exception handling mechanism
that we use on system 5 platforms was
you know it's yeah so it's it was you
know much more of a challenge but you
know we we understand everything now we
tried one implementation approach and we
basically got pretty far with it and we
thought we were done with it and then we
realized that there were a lot of
problems around wreath Rowing exceptions
and c++ the tables that we were
generating were just you know not not
right along with the code but we've you
know gone back and come up with a new
design and you know both c++ exceptions
and structured exception handling which
is you get to via double underscore try
should be working you know sometime in
the next few months I guess December's
probably reasonable one thing I wanted
to point out that's sort of out of out
of scope for the work that you know
we're doing towards making exceptions
work is we're not really we're not
tackling a problem with modeling
non-call or asynchronous exceptions in
LLVM so you know it you can catch these
kinds of exceptions if you do it through
a you know level of function call
indirection you know just put your
function that's doing the funky division
into another separate function without
side of the try scope and we can
 but we weren't we're not really
digging into this representational
problem right now all right so the other
thing that's sort of to do is basically
debug info and it's pretty important to
interoperate with the existing tools on
the on the platform and there's sort of
two ways we can go forward from here
one is to pursue dwarf which is the
standard format that we use on other
platforms you know both Mac and Linux
pretty much yeah it's what we coordinate
with Apple on that kind of thing there's
a Standards Committee and all that and
or we could pursue pdbs and code view
and this is this is what tools like
events tracing for Windows expect to
consume to be able to generate stack
traces for your program and so for now
we're kind of pursuing both in parallel
and seeing seeing what works well yeah
one of the interesting things here is
that as Visual Studio starts to gain
support for Android they also need to be
able to imbibe Dwarfs so there's some
hope that maybe that functionality could
be used to debug Windows applications
built that clang on Windows but anyway
this is this is more of a long-term
effort you know I can't promise this for
something like December I just expect it
to get better over time so you know
should should be getting good over the
next year though I'm out of five minute
talks alone I'm done I was gonna I was
gonna plug address sanitizer that's the
that's basically the tool that you know
we've spent most of our effort making
sure that it works well on Windows so
you know it's probably gonna have the
best out of the box experience of all
the things that we do we use it with
chrome and we use it with Firefox so
should give it a try
like I said exception family is gonna be
done soon and debug info should get
better so you should go to elllo.org
and go download a bill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
