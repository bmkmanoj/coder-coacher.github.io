that's the first joke so since dad up in
and I see this watch works so duck
typing I love duck typing this is where
you have a problem so you explain it to
a rubber duck and the dark solves a
problem and types it up for you okay I
was looking into functional data
structures looking at the list and out
of me I couldn't make head or tail of it
all right maybe that's a bit too
highbrow let's sir bring it down a notch
java it's a great tool for toning coffee
into stack dumped any java programmers
here okay good you're going to help me
with this next one so knock knock joke
so when i say knock knock you guys to
say who's ur so knock knock java all
right let's leave the java programmers
alone
making have an infinite number of
monkeys he put them in front of a
computer keyboard now eventually one of
them is going to write a complete
working java program the rest will be
writing pearl all right back to C++
here's some C++ it's a random number
generator now I've actually seen code
like this in the wild it's not funny and
actually to be honest programa jokes on
that funny really fortunately that's not
the type of stand-up that I wanted to
talk about there's another type of
stand-up that we often face in our jobs
that's the daily stand-up meeting who
does or has done a daily stand-up
meeting quite a few people so real
familiar with them the idea is you know
we do these meetings regularly maybe
daily and we want to keep them short
maybe less than 15 minutes that's why we
stand up so we feel uncomfortable we
want to keep it short so who's going to
stand up meeting that's more than 20
minutes half an hour an hour yesterday
few hands who's done a daily stand-up
meeting where everyone sits down quite a
few yeah all right all right but this
one who's been on a project where
someone a high art felt that by doing
daily stand-ups it made you more agile
yeah yeah quite a few what it's good to
rent about these things but that's not
the type of stand-up I wanted to talk
about either so actually oh it's not
going to work is it here we go a little
bit of science familiar with this mean
stand back i'm going to try some science
what I'm going to modify that a bit and
say it works stand up I want to try some
science so I want to take this literally
everyone stand up and yes that means you
okay now this is interesting just in the
process of moving from a sitting to a
standing position you've increased the
flow of oxygen to your brain by about
twenty percent and as make you slightly
smarter than you were at this moment ago
so it's a real shame that we spend so
much of our working lives sitting down
it's actually worse than that we'll get
to that in a moment but just how much
time do we so in sitting well you tell
me ah doesn't help her forget tweets
coming through okay so if you feel that
you spend on average working day less
than three hours sitting you can sit
down now yeah just this one or two all
right next group if you feel you spend
less than six hours a day on an average
working day sitting you can sit down now
few more but most people are still
standing so you six plusses I'm going to
let you sit down as well now but pay
close attention to the next part so you
may remember this infographic it was
going around on the internet few years
ago sitting is killing you it's quite
long lots of shocking statistics and
facts in there and right at the end this
handy list of references to back it all
up I fortunate because it's an
infographic you can't click on them and
actually quite hard to read so I did the
job we're transcribing them all so you
can read them and I even went as far as
clicking on them and reading all of the
links and also following the references
from those and in some cases the
references of the references and
cross-referencing them all so I made
sure that this actually backed up all
the facts on infographic and mostly it
did few bits you can read things into it
I just want to pick out one of the
statistics that was in there so
according to this if you sit for six or
more hours a day which remember was most
of you you're actually forty percent
more likely to die in the next 15 years
but knows who said sm-3 which is the
first group that's actually quite a
sobering statistic so we were joking
around earlier but now with mineral
getting serious and here's the real
kicker that's true even if you exercise
so if you thought the going to the gym
three times a week was going to get you
out of this really doesn't those
references i mentioned earlier a lot of
them actually led back to a body of work
by this guy James Levine so dedicated a
large chunk of his life to this written
a few books on it one of these books he
says this quoting from a doctor actually
going to the gym even several times a
week does not reverse the harmful
effects of sitting to be clear it does
help but it doesn't completely overcome
a sedentary lifestyle so what's the
solution there's actually quite a neat
solution where neat is an acronym which
stands for no next five non-exercise
activity thermogenesis that's just a
fancy way of saying everyday activities
so the thermogenesis part is just the
way we refer to the energy expenditure
of your your body it's a measure of heat
and we have a union for that the calorie
which scientifically is defined as the
energy needed to increase one gram of
water by one Celsius to be clear that
what we call the the small calorie will
be using in science if you read
nutrition labels or talk about exercise
we talk about kilocalories we talk about
them soft and we just call them calories
as well it can be a bit confusing at
first but it's a thousand times
different so you shouldn't get them
mixed up but bear that in mind you know
rigas interesting
is a certain number of calories our
bodies burn just keeping you alive
keeping the organs running your heart
pumping lung is breathing brain ticking
over and this is called the basal
metabolic rate just a baseline varies
from person to person depending on you
build and age and so on for me works out
about eighteen fifty kilo calories a day
for most people it's going to be
somewhere around that sort of figure the
exact numbers don't matter but there's
is this rate of course we spend most of
our time so we're not most of our time a
fair chunk of our time sleeping so
that's the basal metabolic rate that's
fine on an average working day we'll get
up in the morning hopefully get ready in
the door low bits and pieces before we
shoot out the door so we're burning
about you know another 20 to 30 calories
there not much more than the basal
metabolic rate and then for a lot of us
will have a commute into the office what
would be sitting about half an hour to
an hour a bit of activity while we go
into the office and then the rest of the
day or a large chunk of it as you set
yourselves it's been most of that time
sitting barely above the basal metabolic
rate most of that time few little spikes
and even if we go out for lunch a lot of
us have lunch at our desks we go out and
maybe risk out to nearby restaurant and
sit down again that's sitting all this
time and commuting back of course but we
tell ourselves it's okay because in the
evening or lunchtime or whenever being a
fit it in I'm going to go to the gym
probably just learn that doesn't
actually reverse the effects so I've
jumped on a slide there so the solution
now we know what the problem is because
it's not the total calories we're
talking about here it's breaking up
these periods of sitting you guys need
to insert more breaks ideally at least
every hour we should spend at least two
to five minutes doing something other
than sitting roughly be walking around
doesn't have to be a brisk walking
you don't have to stop working you can
be talking on the phone talking to a
colleague just go down the hall to speak
to someone instead of emailing them all
these little tricks that we hear about
but we just want to break up those
periods long periods of sitting because
that's what's doing the damage the other
thing we can do we have the opportunity
to get one of those standing sitting
desks I've got one we'd only be standing
all the time either but if you alternate
periods of standing and sitting
interspersed with these breaks then
we'll really go be a long way towards
overcoming this this problem with our
sedentary lifestyles if you want to
really take it up a notch so XKCD has
you back given moment to read that
now this is why I know so much about
this this was me a couple years ago this
has me just last December I'm a bit more
like that now just put that into figures
i was 130 three kilograms in down to 80
2.9 that's the loss of 52 kilograms or
key prefer 114 pounds 8.1 stone okay
that wasn't just through the neat
activity stuff there's a whole thing a
nutritional change and so on and if you
want to find out more about that and a
lot more about fitness nutrition in the
context of programmers I've done a
couple of longer talks on that you go to
my website level of indirection calm
there's a this tab here appearances see
my previous talks in as a couple of
videos talk is mens sana in corpore sano
so recommend going to see that now for a
wrap-up couple of things be great if you
could support me doing the the london
three peaks challenge next month by
donating something to my justgiving
campaign in support of cancer research
i'm going to be running up free of the
tallest towers in london and running
between them and then abseiling down the
last one so that'll be great and then
one more thing from that james levine
book that i took away it talks about the
muscles particularly the legs and
apparently the muscles the outer layers
for the fascia an interesting thing
about the fascia is that it modes itself
to the position it finds itself in most
of the time so if you're mostly sitting
mold itself into a sitting position
you're mostly standing mostly a standing
position which means you're more
comfortable sitting if you're sitting
most of the time and the reverse is true
if you're standing and walking most of
the time you're more comfortable doing
that and it's changed from one to the
other and it takes a week or two so the
more you standing and walking the more
comfortable that becomes for
so now we have scientific proof that
daily stand-ups do make you more agile
thanks for being a star
