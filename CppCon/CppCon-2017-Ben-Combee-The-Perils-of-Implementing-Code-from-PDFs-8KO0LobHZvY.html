of different streaming technologies at
Roku Alston's and stuff for our Smart TV
platform we have an office here in
Austin Texas and we use lots of C++ in
our code
so this talk like every good lightning
talk started with a tweet error stray
flash 3:42 in program this is what
happens when you copy and paste from the
h.265 spec so you have to ask why am i
copying from this well part of my job is
dealing with a lot of closed captions
h.265 suspect for 4k video and when
you're doing closed captions you have to
get the order of the pictures right or
else your caption looks like he lipped
it instead of like this this is a
problem which hopefully no one out there
ever sees because we fix it before it
gets to you so HD 65 spec much like the
C++ spec is a very complex beast a lot
of very smart PhDs working on this and
seems like their thought process is
basically I'm going to write all this
code and see oh I have to make it
English let's convert it to English so
he was a quote from a section that I was
having to deal with sliced pick order
county low speed specified it's a
picture order count modulo Mac picks
count that okay I'm getting tired
reading this I'll come back to this in a
moment so there's about 600 pages lives
in the spec document there's some tables
there are some nice figures but it's a
whole lot to deal with
fortunately I didn't have to deal with
all of it so the general algorithm here
is you go through you find the data
structures you paste it in your editor
you start converting it back from this
English to like form into code you have
to basically it's some random access
document things get mentioned in one
place then get mentioned lots of other
places and you have to find that one
place to figure out it kind of turns
into this giant dependency graph you
know kind of to build up okay do I
resolve everything it's like you're a
human make file at this point so I get
to this point and I compile and I get
the 342 error
so something you might know where the
punch line is here so it's like okay
what is this problem 342 oh that's a
cocktail okay
obviously convert that to hex and wait
where'd I get a circumflex a from that's
nowhere in the document my code had a
dash in it want me to take you back to
the previous thing if you look there in
the Mac pick order count LSB -1 that's
where it came from
yes so what why this is not match up
utf-8 thank you a Kernighan - is u TF u
+ 2010 so it's represented in 3 bytes
and GCC doesn't understand utf-8 it will
greatly take it in comments in Albany
try to use it this goes ah so yeah this
was fairly easy to fix once I figured it
out in my research I found lots of other
characters to look for curly quotes
single quotes m dashes and dashes if you
look at the end of the line with
non-breaking spaces I listed them all
for you so important thing is just be
careful if every some whatever edits
your code in Microsoft Word none of you
would ever do that but I definitely have
JSON files sent back to me that someone
edited Word it's a bad thing so in the
end stray characters was just a very
small problem getting every code working
in these you know final form was a big
thing but it's working we now have
captions going for 4k content and if you
want to know more about the kind of fun
stuff we're solving in c++ at Roku
please catch me in all the various usual
channels slack and Twitter they go very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
