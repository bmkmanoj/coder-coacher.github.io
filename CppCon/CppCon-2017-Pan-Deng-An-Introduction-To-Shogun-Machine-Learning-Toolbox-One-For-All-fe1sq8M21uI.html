I think I'm out of time, okay.
So now I'm going to introduce you
the C++ base machine learning tool box
called Shogun.
Shogan was first established in 1999,
and so far it has around
300,000 lines of code
on GitHub.
It is well established and well-commented,
and most notably is that Shogun
is mostly written in C++.
And how can Shogun
survive or survive today?
As I have mentioned in my title,
which you may not have noticed,
Shogun is a highly integrated library,
which provides users abundant resources
for its unified interface.
And today I'm going to
introduce you two features
of Shogun, interfacing diverse
machine learning library
and multiple languages
to support my statement.
So before I start, let's take a step back
to look at a simple example
of machine learning.
Imagine you have two
types dogs on the plane
and you want computers to learn
how to distinguish them and predict
the types of the new dogs coming in.
So machine learning
can do this, of course.
With the classic support
vector machine method,
or SVM method, we can draw a line
based on the distance
between the two groups,
and the method can also provide us
the prediction of different dogs
based on the line it drew.
So that seems very simple, right?
But things can get complicated.
Apart from linear separators or kernels,
we can also have non-linear kernels
for more complex or
higher dimensional cases.
There are tens of publicly available
C++ implementation of SVM are there,
and each of them have a
subset of kernel functions
with their unique benefits
and defects, of course.
If you are a newcomer to
machine learning field,
how could you choose from them?
Well, you may wanna try them out,
but, good news is, they all come
with their own interfaces as well.
This is where Shogun comes to handy.
So as the code shows,
Shogun could allow you
to initialize an SVM clause
with different types of SVM operators
that you like by specifying the template.
And so there is shared pointer of Shogun.
And you can also specify the solver type
and just train the model by
calling the train method,
and you get the train model.
And once you apply your test data to it,
you will get the prediction.
So with this interface it is pretty easy
to compare and try all different kind
of machine learning method.
Okay, let's move on to the next point.
Though mostly written in C++,
Shogun actually supports
multiple high-level languages pretty well
via SWIG.
A software enables
bidirectional communication
between C++ and its target languages.
This basically means, it basically allows
one to use Shogun library
without learning any C++.
You may ask, I am a C++ hacker,
why do I care about this?
So, imagine this situation.
You may be so genius that you develop
a algorithm to classify the dogs perfectly
without over fading.
And you want break it out,
(laughing)
however it is implemented in C++.
How could of world know what it have done?
It's become pretty easy with Shogun.
You could just expose your algorithm
to multiple community
of different languages
by very little changing,
or maybe just minor
changes to adapt to Shogun.
Here are some examples showing
the linear SVM method of Shogun
implemented in C++, Python,
C#, and Java.
So due to the time limit
I will just stop here
and if you're interest in Shogun,
you could have a look at the shogun.ml
with multiple Shogun users
and the machine learning method.
And Shogun has become part of main focus
earlier this year,
and we're definitely interested
to get more developers involved.
And we have all different goals achieved
including multiple other interfaces
for libraries and languages,
and, of course, C++ 17 migration.
And, here's a website and
source code of Shogun.
And you can also ping us on IRC
if you are interested.
And thanks for attention.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
