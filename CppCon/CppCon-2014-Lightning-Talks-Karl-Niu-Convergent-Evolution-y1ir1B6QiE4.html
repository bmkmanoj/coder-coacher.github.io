will compare and contrast C++ concepts
with type classes from functional
programming languages as a program
manager on the visual c++ front-end team
he's interested in type theory and
language design and can later you guys
can teach me how to be on the right page
in an office document okay this five
minutes five whoa here we go okay so my
talk is called convergent evolution
because it is about control pow I don't
want this um you don't see it but
there's a Wi-Fi hotspot thing nottin
screen out dang it okay the client
anyway uh let's talk about is about now
it's not anything new if you read the
papers most of this information is it's
already been pointed out elsewhere but I
just thought it was a cool idea i think
it's a cool idea and i want to show you
guys how cool it is and might help you
think about your programs a different
light and i think it demonstrates that
when there is a design problem and if
you try to solve the problem right
everybody comes at a same solution for
it so start out with the well-known fact
that programs are proofs they call this
the hurt curry Howard correspondence
basically means is types are
propositions or statements of whether
it's true or false and an object with
that type is a proof of the proposition
that that type represents now of course
this is not true in any real life
pouring system especially not C++
because C++ is messieurs evaluation is
schemes to think of its side of factors
cosmic rays and come in and mess up in
memory bits for you it's it's not a it's
not a very neat
a system but it's fun to think of it lie
like that sometimes and i think it's my
opinion this idea ties every foreign
language in the world together in
harmony now what does this mean a very
kind of a rough interpretation of the
types in c++ are that you know you got
functions functions are whoops functions
are implication which is why I'm Haskell
it uses arrow any sort of aggregate is
and obviously you want two valleys
together you need both some types unions
Haskell has also great day arrives these
are either or situations and why they're
or we also have parametric polymorphism
it's for all Haskell has for all
explicitly write for all and C++ you got
to use templates essential tides are
complicated and I will not be talking
about them but if you read types and
foreign languages apparently there are
pairs of values and types together leave
it at that now there are with me for a
second what exactly is a constraint yeah
think about it its goals an example you
say you want to sort a set right and you
know you got to prove that the elements
of that said have a total order now you
got the Q sort function from see you can
look at that there's a compare function
there that takes to void stars and
returns a greater than equal to or less
than and hear that that is the proof by
the definition of pull or debt that it
proves that there's a total order on the
elements of the set it's a constraint on
the elements of this set yes once again
if I'm always see then was not like a
pure functional thing it's a very rough
approximation but essentially a
constraint is just an extra parameter
right your lemmas in your proof
so why are there concepts and type
classes life like the convenience of
course I mean if you really think about
it all they are all kinda we can program
in a way if you want to provide proofs
for something you just pass it in
explicitly right but we don't want to do
that all the time if you have an
established fact about a type if you
know something you want to be able to
just say it once tell the compiler hey
this is known about these things and
every time I mention this constraint vil
bring it up for me out you're telling
the compiler to who here knows what jfgi
means stands for just get it from the
environment for me please I don't want
to supply that proof every time I want
to sort a set of T objects if I can if I
already told you that T has a total
order and this is like three interesting
as in Haskell and in scalar type classes
are implemented in terms underneath
there you implemented with implicit
parameters they are implicit parameters
their implicit parameters that are
indexed by the type and yes type classes
are a type of a different kind than the
normal text you deal with but they're
still a type nonetheless and by
mentioning the type class so eventually
this how your indexing into that the the
thing you've told the compiler already
and you can bring it out you know yours
here's a record of these methods you use
them directly so that's what they are
concepts and type classes they allow you
to state facts about types in a single
place and then those facts are not known
everywhere it's been mentioning the
constraint of course every time people
bring up concepts they lo we want to
simplify a template template errors and
that's that's nice and all but yeah the
more theoretical I'd like to think of it
this way it's more it's it tickles the
functional programming at me so if you
drink the kool-aid here's what stuff
looks like you know this is the left is
actually kind of it is what Haskell
libraries have you have a sort function
its sorts a list
that equals greater than that's the
arrow that that tells you things on the
left that's the constraint so you have a
Nord if it's ordered well order requires
that you be able to sort something a
bully it's a best than or equal to and
then that of course requires an equality
thing and you translate that into c plus
plus you got I hope I got the syntax
right for that one thank you thank you
very much so that's it so I one more
question for you guys was this is well
known information before I brought it up
here this is like do any of you guys
already think of constraints in such a
way it's good to know so yeah further
reading if you got done i'll type
classes as object implicit and it'll is
it's very good taper martin luther ski
of course people already like i said
there's a paper already on comparing
haskell type classes in generic
programming in c++ with concepts and
that's it that's my father</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
