conference and almost all have wanted to
present it for every presenter there
will be tens to hundreds of attendees in
the room for every attendee in the room
there will be hundreds to thousands of
video views the main impact of a modern
tech talk is not on the live viewers but
on the video viewers however for every
viewer who understands English well
enough to watch the video in English
there are tens to hundreds of those who
don't those developers can quickly and
relatively well understand English but
not spoken and for every English reader
there are tens of those who don't
understand written English well enough
the people in either of these last two
groups just don't watch the videos in
English they get nothing out of the work
and money that has gone into creating
the hundreds of hours of recordings from
conferences like CPP Khan meeting C++ or
C++ now this talk is about fixing that
it is about how we can bring great C++
content to developers all over the world
speaking different languages not just
the English speakers YouTube supports
video captioning for the same video
there can be multiple captions in
different languages those captions can
be provided not just by the video owner
but by any of you with a Google or
YouTube account captioning or
translation of the videos is called
community contributions the captioners
and translators can get credit for their
work after the video owner has enabled
the community contributions the
translations can be submitted after a
review they get published
for the city pecan meeting C++ and C++
now YouTube channels the community
contributions are enabled now comes the
hard part the community needs to step up
and do the translating this is obviously
too big a job for a single person or a
small group that is why we start at the
C++ video access project located at CPP
Val dot wiki dot-com the mission of this
site is to provide support to the
captioners and translators coordinate
our efforts and publish our progress it
turns out that translating isn't the
hardest part once the video is captioned
it takes surprisingly little time for a
bilingual speaker to extract the English
captions translate the English text and
submit the translation the real work is
creating the original English captions
you probably know that YouTube provides
auto-generated captions but these aren't
quite good enough for regular talks for
Tech Talks
they fail miserably we need a lot of
help from English language speakers to
create clean English captions as the
starting point and the conference
presenters are in a unique position to
know what captions best capture the
intent of their presentation tomorrow at
1:10 p.m. I am giving a large tent or
captioning and translating C++ videos I
will briefly illustrate the captioning
process for video owners presenters
captioners translators and viewers I
will show you what the C++ video access
project website has what you can add and
how hopefully I will told you the story
of this initiative
that session is not going to be recorded
so for those who are in the room
watching in person is the only chance to
see it for those who are now watching
this talk recorded just go to cpp val
dot wiki dot-com and start exploring the
opportunities here is the take away of
the storm
syphilis cos videos are much more
valuable when well captioned in english
and translated into other languages
YouTube provides support for us as a
community to work together to do this
captioning in translating the C++ video
access project provides information and
support if you are a C++ presenter you
are in a unique position to provide
quality English captions and to
translate your videos to the other
languages you speak if you are
multilingual you can help leverage the
value of the work done at major C++
conferences in reply your name will
become known in the simplest possible
unity if you cannot watch C++ videos in
English there is a resource that gathers
in one place the links to the sequence
post videos in the language you speak
and that resource is the C++ video
access project CPP VAT dot viki.com come
to tomorrow's talk to learn more and
start getting involved thank you and see
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
