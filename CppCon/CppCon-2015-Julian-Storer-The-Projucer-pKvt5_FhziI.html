nice easy start to the morning before 15
minutes I'm gonna be demoing on you
products the producer which you will all
have got in your goodie bags when you
were when you registered for CPP calm
there's a little memory stick in there
with the juice logo on and on there is a
very early preview of the producer which
you can have a go of we're kind of soft
launching it this week
we'll be releasing a public beats are in
the next couple of weeks when we go out
our butt juice version for launch so
quickly the background for the guys who
haven't heard of what juice is where
it's a big one this big do it's all
frameworks kind of in the QT style in
the sense that we have everything from
GUI frameworks networking you know
cryptography and a loss of audio stuff
and we're probably the most widely used
framework in the audio music tech
industry and so most of the plug-in
audio plugins and what do you actually
see pretty likely to be built with juice
somewhere in there and what we tend to
get in that in that industry is a lot of
very customized user interfaces you'll
see lots of really crazy customized we
had sliders weird displays for feedback
of all kinds of musical audio data so
what and what I seem to have spent the
last 10 years doing a lot of is tweaking
pixels on user interfaces so will tend
to get will have a very customized UI
and will I seem to spend a lot of time
nudging a font size or moving a tweaking
a gradient color or you know moving a
line around it's in compile waiting for
you have to start up again going back to
that part of the app and seeing if it's
in the right place and no it's still 2
pixels to the left so you go back to the
code
sweet sweet graphics again and go around
and the nature of the kind of interfaces
we do also means that it doesn't lend
itself very well to give a designer
tools because they they they're less
dynamic
we have a GUI design tool and people
people do use it but when you're doing
really complicated interface it's really
the only way to test and iterate on
these is to actually change the code and
see what happens so the producer is an
attempt to act augmenting the your
normal workflow with a way of taking a
little part of your app out and just
viewing it on its own in real time while
you edit code so we'll give you a
demonstration the slide you've got there
isn't PowerPoint or keynote I'm just
going to zoom out that's a little piece
of code I wrote last night and the code
is over here on the right really really
simple anyone who's ever seen juice or
Java or QQ widget type classes will
recognize this as a little widget class
with a painting routine that just draws
the stuff that you can see on the screen
there so it fills the background it so
it sets a font it prints the producer at
the top and there's a few things now say
I'm not happy with this like I think my
name is a little bit small on there so
let me see this is the I think this is a
bit very sick the size of my name so I
can just adjust that because if it's
bigger
I put the kind of regular gradients
around the thing but this it's not quite
right so let's let's tweak that color a
bit and this is this the tool you're
seeing on the right is our rum it's not
an idea we have a tool called the
introducer which was the predecessor to
the producer Pro being a bit better and
this has been juices project management
sore for many years now and it lets you
build project with good file structure
as you've seen in many other IDs
configurations here let you set
different targets like Visual Studio
Xcode it spits out this project fast
we're not trying to get rid of the the
the tools that people use from their
everyday lives I still use Xcode we use
Visual Studio all the time
this is kind of management tool for that
but now we've bolted into it the lrvm
compiler so we also have a place here
where it'll build the code pull out any
classes it recognizes and then what
we're seeing over here in this
it's instantiated an instance of this
component on its own without actually
running me out so it never calls main it
just pulls out one class
Crick's for the magic boilerplate and
runs the whole thing in the jet engine
so I was I was just tweaking some
numbers though if you change a little in
the code it can detect that and inject
those directly into running out but it's
also very quick if you want to rewrite
so like if I don't want our logo there
I'm just going to comment that out let's
go
and by doing some really clever
precompiled header tricks and not
getting rid of the running code and
silver we've got a replaceable compiled
version to replace it with you get a
very nice feedback loop where you can
just sit on it with one window open
showing the result another one showing
the code and just tweak it and seeing
real time what's going on so I'll show
you some more examples of this in this
little demo project we've also got this
one this is on the memory on the memory
sticks that you guys have got so if you
were to install this and run it you'll
see pretty much this as a starting point
and here we've just got a little
animated bunch of circles moving around
with an algorithm and I can go to the
code for that by hitting a few code
it'll show me where it came from
and we've added some little helpful
hints here so saying hey try this and so
there's a background color
I don't know what that man was going to
do make some bigger you can have fun
playing around with that and then once
we when we got to this point we realized
this is actually a really great tool for
beginners because if you're learning C++
then this is what we can create and here
is it a space where you can experiment
and see immediate feedback of what's
going on so we very quickly coded up a
little example here this is a live
console component name of the class and
if I go to this one
you'll see this this is the entire code
that's the whole thing it's it's just a
UI component but at the top we've
created a little function called print
your stuff here which can call a few
member functions and if you if you so
you can see the similarity here they've
got hello world being printed then we
can see how a world here on the Left so
if I was to take that out we'd see that
the stuff on the left would change this
is just prints and numbers from North
Zed but if I change that we can see in
real time what that would do so we've
actually already had some interest from
some University departments who teach
C++ it's saying this would be a great
container classroom so a beginner can
just look at the suit work on the syntax
not have to worry about how to actually
build that stuff or run it we'll know
about you know anything other than the
very basics also in here we've got some
other demos we have there's a game of
light breathing which is quite fun cause
you can change the rules while it's
running because this is just running any
code it's there's no restrictions on
what your code does in so we have things
like over here we've got sound player
this one opens up the audio device which
you break on here and is generating some
audio
so if I go to the audio generator here I
can probably tweak a few parameters and
make it sound horrible that's just made
it stop yeah um in what we do a lot of
in the audio world is designing audio
algorithms for things it's we we've
actually got another component which is
pretty much like an oscilloscope so you
can see that playing with just one part
of your deer speed code and see the
results like live in an oscilloscope
rather than spending a long time
changing an algorithm wait for it to
recompile
fire up your app and and then blow your
speakers so internally what's actually
going on here is we've got the the clang
we've built into the app and we've
hacked around so that as it's actually
pausing the code we also do a few tweaks
to the abstract syntax tree and there
are few clever tool little tricks like
replacing all when I'm moving literals
around all of those literals have been
replaced in certainly by global
variables that we can then link back to
places within the code and then when it
sees it that the text cells has changed
a bit of code that's only within the
space of a literal then we can just go
into pokel out the global variable
without any strips in the program we've
got then we have also generous of
boilerplate behind the scenes that
actually creates the entire window that
you see over on the left with all of
these buttons at the bottom as well and
the whole thing is like it's running in
this one days actually so even
the editor around this one we we've got
some phones for doing some more advanced
stuff to this I actually first them at
this product projects about three years
ago
and we had a feedback loop in here as
well so that you could have it could
actually look at component layouts
figure out where the code set that
position and that you drag them around
the screen was going back and changing
the position in the code
very meta way and we're going to revive
that with a it's much more complex part
coat so that'll be coming in a few
months and and dance performing that's
left and there's always a lot of
questions when they demo this so any
questions yeah the question is always
using OpenGL we're not but we can if I
open another project here we've got an
example of that this is I'm hoping now
the big juice kind of kitchen sink demo
which has a whole bunch of different
demos inside it you see it compiling
here is pretty quick and this is cos is
compiling the entire juice library now
and maybe 100 compile units off the demo
but I'm confident it'll finish quickly
enough that we can actually see this but
one of the demos we've got in here is
OpenGL and it'll happily run it inside
the window well that's loading any any
more questions it's early the moment
we've got some mac version we're in the
middle of Windows build which we have
seen some problems with claims window
supporting them but as soon as that's
find out then it will be all
cross-platform juice is completely
cross-platform we run on execute on them
OS on Windows Linux iOS Android and
embedded platforms as well and we're
probably gonna have bare metal versions
too soon so this is finished compiling
out so somewhere in here we've got them
open to your demo yeah so that's quite
happily running the an Open GL window
with our open GL to the rendering engine
sitting on top of that and
yeah it's not because we have to take
control of the entire compile shame
because we have to mess around with
these insects tree but it doesn't have
to be use our editor so what will happen
is if you've if you've got your project
open in this running the live Windows
and you have your other edits are open
and you hit save on the file it'll it'll
diff it'll see the changes do this and
you'll still get all the very fast
update
yeah well be the windows on the Left are
running in a child process so if that
dies we just start it up again I think
it's died at the moment so yeah I can
restart and it should just come back
home anymore any more questions we have
one minute left
yeah can we the question is can we
integrate it into the running
application it we'd involve putting the
whole of crankin LVM into the running
application which could be done I mean
this could all be encapsulated in a DLL
which you link into your application and
throw C++ at it and run yeah that could
be done but I'm not sure what this would
give you over just using our VM itself
for that it's it depends where you want
to do really whether that would be
sensible anyone yeah when does it decide
to recompile the code um it has a few
different modes what we found most
useful is it has a little timer so if
you stop typing for more than half a
second it kicks moku self compilation
yeah you could be in the middle of
modifying it but we have another mode
you can turn that off and have like a
build button that forces it to recompile
or just turn it off altogether and so
that all of them we have a few different
modes we're experimenting with but it's
really easy to change that
thirty seconds anyone else okay good
