development and peopre financial limited
most of the author of SQL plus plus
eleven and to talk a little bit more
about that as part of the as part of the
examples I was also author of my news
project for kiss templates which is the
name doesn't have to do anything with
what we're talking about it's about text
templates not about C++ templates
alright
so the talk is about pruning error
messages from your C++ template code so
what is it not about it's not about
trying to filter out template error
messages from the compiler output after
the fact well it's about going to to the
root cause
trying to eliminate as much as possible
and what got me started was some years
ago an article by Eric nibbler why
template error messages suck and what
you can do about it this this site
expresses C++ is I think more or less
dead now the link is dead when you when
you go to to our exciter think but you
can still find the article at
archive.org and instant it's a cool
article at the time I didn't really have
much to do with template programming so
well I read it it was interesting but I
didn't do anything with that and then
two years later I started with SQL plus
plus 11 and SQL plus plus 11 is a is an
embedded domain-specific language for
SQL in C++ so that means that you can
write stuff like this you can basically
write SQL expressions in C++ or
something very close somebody who can
read SQL can probably read this so in
this case assuming that you have some
object that represents a table in this
case foo you can select a bunch of
columns from
this table with some condition and send
that to your database loop over the
results and the results friendly enough
also have the result rows also friendly
enough have aptly named members with
reasonable types so you can have the
full C++ compiler machinery to tell you
when you're doing something wrong in in
pretty much all respect so this library
will tell you at compile time
whether you're forgetting a table and
the from friends or if you're comparing
incompatible columns or I don't know if
you're if you're missing mixing
aggregate functions or non aggregate
function stuff like that so the compiler
can tell you all about that at compile
time as you can imagine this this is
heavily templated it involves deeply
nested templates and it also means that
if you don't pay attention to what
you're doing you can get horrible error
messages like in this case um let's see
in a version from about a year ago so
harmless-looking code so you select from
a table T column alpha and then you have
one tiny mistake out of out of what you
did before maybe earlier on was you you
wrote SQL expressions in C++ as strings
so the user here well wrote the table as
a string or as a character array here so
that's not expected and and the library
expects a table object here so what it
does is it answers with horrible error
messages and I don't I haven't shown
them here just the summary it's 18
kilobytes of error message
in a hundred lines for GCC the current
GCC and 38 kilobytes in two hundred
almost 300 lines with length 3.6 for
Windows users I'm sorry I don't have
access to a reasonable version of a
Windows Microsoft compiler alright so
that's the problem we want to get rid of
that or at least reduce it as much as
possible because that's unusable and in
this talk I will I will explain it a
range of techniques which go from easy
to explain hard to you are to use and
hard to explain how to use and there is
no silver bullet there is nothing that
really helps in all situations but if we
take a look again that at this thing
here the differences between the
compiler one of the first things that
you can do to reduce the pain is or you
can support compiler developers because
compilers make a difference and if you
stumble over something like this
then well you can tell the the other
teams that hate the other compiler is
much better so why don't you improve
your stuff and give reasonable examples
so that they can can work with them for
engines also the the library itself
makes difference so code quality matters
if you stumble over a library or over
something that you that you happen to do
and the library and the compiler in
combination produce horrible error
messages well consider it worthy a bug
report
towards the library ok that's important
and it's also very important because
this this book that I showed you on the
on the previous slide is something that
I didn't find it didn't even occur to me
that somebody could ever do this didn't
cross my mind so
I was relying on the bug report there
okay who knows the best way to avoid
template errors right don't use
templates and now I'm not kidding and
the reason why I'm saying this is some
I've seen so many developers using
templates just because they can right
it's it's C++ goddamnit we have to be
generic or whatever I mean there are
many reasons but yeah
many people just use templates because
well they want to or they think it's
cool so make sure that you really need
them make sure that you really need to
expose them even if you use the
templates in your own library maybe
maybe a simpler interface a non template
interface could be totally sufficient
for what your library is offering maybe
you don't need compile time polymorphism
maybe you need maybe run time pull them
off is amiss totally sufficient in that
cases or forget about the templates or
at least don't expose them or you can
maybe also hide templates behind
inheritance this is something that I'm
using so this is a struct that
represents a table in in this library
it's generated code is generated from
the from the data definition language
and the code generator well does the
work anyway so why why not let it
generate explicit types and then hide
the instance the the template that does
the real work for it behind inheritance
this way it's just a type it doesn't
have it it's not a template and if you
knew what's going on in that table you
would agree that this is a very good
thing
okay and this is just to illustrate the
difference this is if and one of the one
of the lines from that previous error if
you don't do height table template this
is if you hide it and what you still can
see this this repetitive stuff with SQL
PP column and then some something the
columns also are our templates since we
know those in advance at least in in
most cases we could also hide them
behind inheritance and it would look
like this so sounds easy it's actually
pretty hard I haven't gotten to to this
column thing yet three attempts they all
failed I need to try it again but
because I wanted just this shorter all
right so don't use templates if you have
if you don't have to the next thing is I
try to avoid recursion
especially since C++ 11 with these
variadic templates um every introduction
that I've ever read what very template
says well the key to very Eric template
is use recursion right take one element
from from the front if do something with
that and then for the rest of the next
instance okay but you want to avoid
recursion because recursion is slow in
the compiler
it's rather limited because you
basically building a stack of templates
and that stack size is limited and at
least to dreadful error messages okay so
I think there is a whole talk about for
each time I'm not going to go into too
much detail here so we want to write a
function that cause a unary function for
each of the following arguments the
introductions always pretty much stay
the same okay you have one
when closure element that has no
arguments beside the function okay that
does nothing you have then this
recursive thing that takes at least one
argument plus arrest it evaluates this
argument and then cause this call for
each function again right with the rest
okay okay let's test that and see what
happens so we write a test function and
then call for each with this test and
then 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 and 10
and well 10 happens to be something
weird right
I don't know this is a very very
contrived example um but this is stuff
that happens okay
now claim says this that is annoying
right it's always the same basically
there's no real information about this
and those on some few lines below of
this okay okay that's annoying but
that's recursion for you now there there
is a solution to that you can with this
little trick you can basically
instantiate an array of ends with with
the root with a function call comma
operator know effectively initializing
it with a list of of em's this is one of
those version at which I think also
guarantees that the that the order of
execution is like the order of the of
the arguments yes
right so um if we do the same test with
that cool that's that's nice short and
easy okay and in C++ seventeen hopefully
I'm not sure if that's not really
guaranteed but hopefully we will get
fold expressions and then it would be
much easier and nobody will really
really have to think about what's what's
going on
so full expressions will be cool okay um
oh by the way I mean jesusí in this case
much better GCC detects the recursion
immediately and basically produces in
all cases the same error messages very
nice okay so we're going to use or
disarm this recursive I'm sorry this
this for each call will appear in some
places
another thing that will appear in some
places is a non recursive all so we want
to at compile time
evaluate if a an arbitrary number of
bulls is are all true all of them should
be true okay so we want to do that right
and I'm not going to show the non I'm
not going to show the recursive version
because everybody can do that
the non recursive version is for some
people some people this year sorry it's
for some people a bit surprising so we
have this logic helper that's just a
class that takes pools and in in are all
template we compare this instantiation
of the logic help over the era with the
arguments with
another list that has the same number of
arguments but everything is set it is
set to true via this comma operator
right everybody get that here this this
thing here with the dot dot produces as
many truths as you have arguments and if
this instance of logic helper is the
same as this then everything is true ok
depending on how many how many booze you
have this is orders of magnitude faster
than than there any recursive version
that you can think of all right ok and I
hope I got right this this the C++ 17
started with expressions yes absolutely
yeah thank you okay so the the comment
by Stephan was that I don't even need to
wrap the same thing in the integral
constant I can just use it directly cool
yeah
all right
so next thing is about a tool that
appeared in C++ 11 that helps to
generate useful error messages so what
we always what we've seen so far are
techniques to reduce the amount of error
messages but they are still compiler
generated error messages static assert
gives you human generated error messages
so for instance you have some kind of
class and you want to not very elegantly
here but you want to reduce or you want
to constrain the template argument to
something that is integral and you can
just user study dessert and say well if
it's not antico then okay right I also
use this in partial specializations so
for instance I have a type set and there
are meta functions on it to join type
sets all right
so L&amp;amp;R have to be type system for this
to make sense so the the good case the
golden case is well you make a partial
specialization you see that okay these
are type sets and then you can make a
new type set from from the parameters
from then the question is on how to
proceed well one way is to just leave it
as that
then the user will get if if they are
instantiate may join type set with
something that is not a type set they
will get weird error message there's
something like missing implementation
which is a bit annoying because they
don't know did I is it a library or did
I forget to include a header file is it
my problem they don't know so I would
like to give them a study dessert which
says that L and R have to be type sets
right the question is how do I do that
because I mean basically this these
three question marks they have to be
false
always when this is instantiated because
whenever this is instantiated it's
obviously an error but I can't put Falls
there because the compiler would fire
the static assert immediately also I
don't have a type trait for what type
sets I mean it would be easy to write
but I don't want to because I have so
many of things that have similar
situations and I don't want it to write
type choice for all of them so what
would be cool would be a just-in-time
falls when ever this get gets hit it
suddenly appears and and then far as the
static sort one thing that I do is I
have this nice type that's is it's
called wrong can be instantiated with
anything and for a human is pretty much
clear that this is always false for the
compiler not so much because the
compiler has to think of partial
specialization or our first
specializations or whatever so it cannot
deduce that this is really always false
it has to wait until you really
instantiate it okay so it would look
something like this that is the the bad
case in this case Ln are armed type sets
and then we just use wrong with the
other type that we're currently in take
the value study assert that's it make
sense good and again the golden case
right we can also use steady to certain
functions of cause and as it so happens
the the code that we were testing and in
the leading example has a front method
that that delegates the homework to
another function I was because there is
an
from function that has slightly is
slightly different arguments and I
wanted to move everything into one
implementation the emitter methylation
contains acetic acid and then continues
with some with some more static asserts
and doing the real work now in the in
the case that we are currently had it's
that's reasonable right so we're
instantiating with something that is not
a table
static assured fails and it says at
least one argument and is not a table in
or a joint and from okay that's
reasonable then you can see the the call
stack which is at least one level of too
much because we have this indirection
into this implementation function and
then we see the the place where it all
originated our own our own call so far
so good but then the compiler carries on
because there is another static asteroid
which also fires because it's not a it's
not a table and whatever tests now
assumes that this is a table so all hell
breaks loose and so it continues to
carry on even though static assert is a
non recoverable error so there is not
really a point to that in my eyes but
anyway so
this there's a temp that I that I made
when I had editors studying a certain
that function didn't work out too well
right so the static sort is too far away
from from the call side the compiler
continues to run on like you beheaded
chicken right no chance of survival but
let's keep running what I what I had
removed some some time earlier because
of bad experiences what if I have a
static assert in a return type this gets
even worse right and these hundred or
three hundred lines of code of error
messages turn out to be like a thousand
or so horrible and yeah that's that's
that's it so that didn't turn out too
well so let's try something else
did anybody not stumble over an able if
during this conference or otherwise in
their life okay everybody knows what in
a belief is good that's good alright so
um I tried this so try to eliminate the
function from the from the overload set
if the arguments aren't all the tables
right now claim
yes that's cool you try to to call from
with a column in this case another
another table there's no magic number
the candidate template has been disabled
by disabled if okay cool that's
beautiful
GCC on the other hand the compiler that
it was so so cool and the other examples
now says well there is no match in
caller candidate blah blah blah and
wrong just giving you all kinds of
details that I don't want to have then
you know then carries on and this really
goes down into the basement and beyond
right so you know compile let's make a
difference right so then at that time
concept slide were were a big topic or
talks about and so okay let's try that
okay
so let's assume we had a concept for a
table which is simple because we already
have typed rate for table and so that's
that's easier writing that down and then
I wanted to use the really tourism
tation saying that okay I expect a any
number of tables here and then if if
those are given then do whatever is
required okay now it turns out that GCC
which i think is the only competitor
that does support concepts lied anyway
even to until today things that this is
illegal right this year in certain
contexts not in all contexts but in the
context of this library being in some
very big c RTP template function with
again very templates that's illegal
saying that invalid use of pack
expansion expression complete bullshit
and it and again it raves on for many
many pages
so concepts light are not really usable
but wrong let's at least try again what
it would look like if if only it worked
so I tried to the try to use the
requires form effects of adding concepts
to a function okay
or trust with you all again but it
requires okay and now GCC's has
something useful right answer the
relatively short error message into
answers well no matching function call
constraints not satisfied and that lists
constraints and that's fine okay so
that's that's good and if it weren't for
the bug I tried to so this is not not
taking from him from a life experiment
that this is what I think Jesus he would
generate if it hadn't this bug with the
the parameter expansion then it would
probably produce something like this
which is in the end rather similar so a
short message constraints once have
satisfied and very very detailed
actually saying that table consider that
is not satisfied okay right so that is
that is really not that but it's not
ready yet
right you can at least in context like
mine and we're talking about heavy
template metaprogramming you cannot use
it yet because of all these all these
bugs and there are tons of bugs and what
the one that I report it because of this
is just one of many and there are even
bugs in the in the TS that I know of
okay so what we've seen so far these are
these methods studying assert gives you
specific specific error messages but
Kampala continues and spills and
actually the studying certain the
function body is
is too late if you have problems in your
return type
so that's annoying enable it if gives
you ugly code I think or at least in my
perspective enable if is really ugly
error messages that come out of it are
ugly concept light or have nice code
often halfway decent error message but
it's not really yet ready yet and the
developers not only from for GCC but
from all compilers really need your
support because there are so many cases
that nobody can think of everything I
think and you need really good name
concepts because otherwise people will
look at the error messages with the
concepts and have no idea what what the
compiler is talking about so you have to
have many concepts problem ok alright so
let's combine messages and methods first
thing I wanted to try was enable if and
static assert so we start out with the
same thing as as before enable if and
then D the good case and add a
counterpart that takes care of the of
the bad case right so if this is um if
not all of these arguments are tables
then well this kicks in put a studies
for it here and oh yeah and the return
type is something different because then
it just makes sure that the return type
doesn't give us trouble and the error
message is well says boy it is not a
structure a union when we want to
continue in our expression here that is
good they study the certifiers
that's also good so that's not bad but
the problem is that you that you blow up
your interface when you add more
functions to it function that you
actually don't really want to
personally I don't like that very much
and one one other problem that cannot
occur here because we have very
templates that catch any combination of
arguments but you could easily construct
something where you have the variants of
arguments that don't catch everything
and then based on what we've seen before
all hell will break loose because then
suddenly everything is removed from the
overload side all of these are disabled
by by something and then you have tons
of error message so you know I don't
know I don't really like this enable if
approach so another version is some that
you do study a certain Tech dispatch so
what does that mean well you yeah I did
the function you do the static is turn
and then you call an implementation
function so you don't do anything else
in this function you do call an
implementation function and you use the
the check that you use earlier on as a
type for for dispatching to one of two
functions one takes as a first argument
to a true type does something useful in
that case and the other takes the the
false type and doesn't do anything it's
not even implemented because I mean
there's no point if that's called and
everything's bad anyway
and returns in an SQL plus 11 it returns
a bad statement which is well you could
also return a void it doesn't make much
of a difference does that make sense
okay okay
so that means well we get
the we get firstly the error message
that well with this return type we
cannot do anything of the of the rest of
the statement okay that's that's okay
I can live with that and then steady
your search fails but at least one
argument bla bla bla bla the table and
then one more line we're done okay so
then these are all the error messages
that we now get so we reduced hundreds
of lines of error messages with this
just a very simple technique of studying
a servant and tech dispatch to three
lines with a very clear error message
then there are people who say well I'm a
state you're sure there's no it's fine I
friendly and it isn't and if you run
this into your status or while
evaluating something it was FINA you
well you bad luck because it's a hard
error you cannot you cannot recover from
that in this fee night and if it's in in
an evaluative body of a function then it
doesn't even fire while you're
evaluating this so some people and don't
like this approach because of that but
I'm saying if you if you or some some
user wants to use FINA on your function
cost and I mean they can that can do it
on on the return type cool that should
be documented of course what's happening
in the error case or they you could
document the check you should do that
anyway and you can document it to check
and then they could use that that check
in there's FINA expression so I think
that's okay and important for things
like this you notice the the deco type
from M blah blah do not use C++ 14
return type deduction does anybody know
why
it doesn't spin oh yeah because well you
run into the study of certain guess the
compiler has to evaluate the body of the
of the function then BOOM
alright good um oops sorry so another
question is not related to this example
directly but to the same library is now
what if I have several different
conditions that I have to check and even
unknown checks that I have to perform so
unknown conditions well that's weird but
turns out that this is that this is a
really normal case in at least in this
kind of library so we have the a
database mock in in the library that is
used to test all these expressions and
see how they interact with databases and
when you give that a statement then it
tries to call a run function on the
statement with the database itself as an
argument and does some ping-pong anyway
and we call this with this harmless
looking piece of code expression is
correct and we will get something like
this suddenly says static assert failed
where expression required because this
library well it's my library and I
designed this way so saying that there
has always has to be a where expression
even if it's where true indicating that
you actually wanted to select everything
but if it's not there I'm assuming that
you just forgot and you wanted to select
I don't know two elements maybe so and
this has proven helpful in many cases so
this is a good error message but then
then it carries on says well it's
somewhere in a
nowwhere type and then you see this
swallow that you've seen before and some
somewhere in check consistency and that
is insight statement and that is inter
inside runtime methods of statement that
is inside the mock GB and that is called
by our expression ok so again and D and
these individual lines are much longer
so they they don't just end there they
carry on I don't know to the bug game
here so so this is actually hard routing
when you see that so but since we're
here are we just seeing this statement
the question is how do we figure out
what what to check here right at this
place here it's pretty much unknown so
let's take a look at hidden SQL plus
plus 11 statement how that looks like so
that is a very big template and for
select it looks something like this so
you have an for an for an empty selector
I should say so something that you start
with do you start your expression
building with this it's something that
that contains no whiff it has an
indicator that hey this is a select
statement it has no Flags no columns who
lets it know from nowhere and so on
nothing in there except for these types
and all of those yeah and the database
operator doesn't know how to check out
any of those in detail but the the
individual components of this of this
SQL statement they know what to check
that's where this this error measures
came from that result
so the first thing that I tried was well
let's move let's move
or let's collect the information whether
our expression or could be could be run
through the database yes or no let's
collect that from all the clauses right
so we use this implementation of all and
combine that with a run check value from
each and every individual clause okay
and then in our database implementation
we use static assert on that saying that
well if that's false then the statement
is inconsistent and then we use tag
dispatch to to carry on with the rest of
the work if if the statement is okay all
right so in the true case we do what we
did before and in the fourth case we
don't just don't do anything okay cool
so that gives us a very short error
message saying that stereo sort
statement is inconsistent and then you
see this you say you won't select alpha
from I don't see anything and there is
no problem so if I hadn't told you that
that this is that the problem is that
the library expects aware well I don't
know you probably would have filed a bug
report or dropped the library for good
or I don't know so if this is absolute
and they're not helpful even though it's
Charlie so we want to get the specific
error message back and for this I I'm
using something that I call portable
status right that's basically I for each
of the static asserts that that I have
in the library I now create a type with
some reasonable names okay so I can find
it again contain containing a an
indicator whether it's
is a it's a good or bad case any static
function a templated steady function
that whenever it's called fires studies
or a very specific static is written
okay and of these I have I don't know 30
or so in the library and I also have the
okay type that is something that was
called consistent it just contains the
true saying that hey this is everything
okay and the function the same function
but it doesn't do anything right and
then in the same manner just slightly
more complex in which we've collected
the bool information earlier on we're
now collecting these these consistency
representation classes with some
function that's not really very well
named get first if takes the takes a
predicate saying that is consistent is
inconsistent and a default value and and
a number of of these consistency classes
and if there is any inconsistent closet
takes the first one otherwise it takes
the the default value those are the
default type they're the consistent type
all right and then we can use that in
our in our database and say okay now we
call call this function on the run check
object and if it's the consistent case
then this function doesn't do anything
in the inconsistent case it fires an
assert a very specific study sir hey
make sense
okay
right and the result is one line more
than before but because we have to go
into this into this helper function in
the in this in this inconsistency class
um we get a very specific error message
saying that where expression is required
then we see this this call stack with
you with this helper function then I'll
call so that is short and helpful okay
so are we there yet well any anytime you
see such a question presentations
yeah there's no of course no we're not
there yet because what I did here I was
calling run check on on this statement
object and if this is not actually a
statement and well maybe one a probably
run check isn't even available so this
will cause horrible errors so what we
have to do is well we have to write a
wrapper for that
that basically does exactly the same as
all the other of these possible study
asserts it checks if the thing is in
fact a statement and yeah so in in the
default case it yields this static sort
runtime or prepared um which basically
says this is not a statement if it's
found and the good case is in case this
is a statement then I just use the the
run check of the statement itself okay
and with that now I think it needs
everything is harmless and we can if we
call for instance with this function
with a string then we would get again
any three liner and not something that
blows our screen just saying that okay
connection cannot run something that is
neither a statement or a prepared
statement very short and precise
information okay now we're done at least
with this library and as I said in the
beginning there is no silver bullets or
whatever I presented it's working for
for the stuff that I do I think there
are much of this is also applicable for
for other libraries as well alright so -
suggestions in summary for reducing
template error messages is also can
support compiler developers I think
that's really important support library
authors again very important library
office rely on own feedback because
otherwise they cannot improve their
library try to minimize the exposed
templates try to minimize recursion so
hard to R up there wrap your head around
that and now perform parameter
validation at the API order so as close
to the users code as possible document
your validation condition is also very
important because people will rely on
those and you study assert with great
care so don't use static a certain
return types combine it with tag
dispatch so that the carrot compiler
cannot carry on with all kinds of
nonsense that you know is incorrect
because you just made a static syrup
which is to say so and I think these
portable static asserts are helpful if
you have to collect conditions from
several areas of your code and last
point experiment with concept slide I
think that is also very important
because
that is going to change the way that we
are lighting libraries in the future and
it's important that that the language
gets this right all right thank you do
you have questions okay well I mean
especially the the recursion stuff that
which is oh okay
thanks for the end so the question is do
these techniques impact compile time the
recursion stuff does impact compile time
dramatically depending on the number of
arguments of course the most of the
other things I'm not really sure I know
that that this is portable static is
first put a considerable additional load
on the compiler in in terms of what they
can really digest I don't know about the
compile time but I've seen GCC and
client barf several times when when the
code was arranged in a certain fashion
and just by rearranging that slightly
and twiddling the code having basically
the same functionality so for a human
it's well it's the same but and they
suddenly don't crash anymore so yeah
stuff like that makes it more complex
for the compiler of course but I haven't
done intense measurements for that I've
haven't seen anything where it said well
okay something is twice as slow or
something like that
yep so is there C++ 14 um the libraries
is C++ 11 only so yeah well the few
things were indicated that is 17 but
doesn't say that yeah yeah okay okay all
right so the comment by Stefan ISM yeah
take take true or false type by my value
doesn't make really a difference
all right everyone's everyone's died or
48 okay
I'm so glad that you found that you saw
the networks in 11 it doesn't 14 yet but
you couldn't do it okay so but alright
so the suggestion is to use a default
argument in the template button does
that work with with very deep templates
okay oh okay thank you I didn't know
that so the the comment is that I could
use a a default type at the end of the
list for for doing this fillet and I
wasn't aware that this works with very
big templates but differences and I saw
several people not about that yes yes it
does cool oh cool I will try that
all right then thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
