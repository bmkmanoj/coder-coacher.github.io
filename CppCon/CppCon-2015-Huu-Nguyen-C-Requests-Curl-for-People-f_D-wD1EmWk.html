this is also my first time speaking
professionally at any kind of conference
so it's a bit rough
I apologize beforehand I wrote a library
called C++ requests how many of you in
the audience amused Python before just
chopin's and of those people who are
raising their hands how many have used
the request module by Kenneth reads okay
awesome
this is a spiritual board of that module
which is another way of saying I stole
it you find them you can find the
repository here please star it fork it
and contribute to it it's very young
it's only a few months old but I think I
believe that I have a core API that is
both elegant and practical C++ requests
is a high-level client-side HTTP library
and that requires us to understand what
HTTP is at a high level my opinion HTTP
at a high level is about verbs you know
you do things like get me this page put
this data here delete this user that's
it if that seems naive that's because it
is of course any kind of client-side
HTTP library should have support for
authentication headers proxies cookies
and sessions but if you allow me to be
aspirational and really ambitious here
and reach
I believe that HTTP should be as simple
as a print statement I believe that and
so does Kenneth reach the person who
said that first so let's try to imagine
what HTTP as a print statement would
look like if we can imagine the core of
HTTP HTTP with an example such as making
a simple get request and printing the
response text what should that kind of
API look like and so I've developed an
API that hopefully can encapsulate that
sort of essence you have a URL I'm using
the service called HTTP bin it's written
by kind of treats again we call a we use
a get request a get function and that
just pains the URL and gets you the
response and you can print it
immediately compare
this to the equivalent call in lip curl
so if you programmed in C before and
you've had to do networking there's a
good chance you've used lip curl and as
you can see at the very top there's a
void star pointer that's required for
doing any kind of capturing of the
response and that's the easy interface
this is apparently what you're supposed
to do in C the comparison is a little
bit unfair because lip curl is a seed
library so let's actually look at a C++
library has anyone heard of the library
the framework called poco it stands for
portable components is there a
maintainer of poco in this audience
anyone who works on would be offended if
I said anything about it
so poco is not a bad library it's very
well written and thoroughly tested but
the API is not written for people when I
use poco I feel like I'm talking to a
computer I'm a client there's a server I
send this request object and I get a
response object back so let's look at
the same example the simple get requests
using poco and remember this is a C++
library ignore the verbosity for a bit
and let's just kind of examine the
semantics of what's going on here at the
very start you have a URI object which
is sort of a generalization of the URL
and you pass it the string
it seems pretty reasonable to me then
you have a session which you need to
pass the host and the port from the URI
you create a request object using the
the HTTP method you want to use which is
get you have a string path you pass in
this HTTP version and then at that point
you can send the request that's one half
of using poco getting the response
requires you to instantiate a response
object to receive it from the session as
an input string or as an input stream to
instantiate an output stream and then
copy the input stream to the output
stream and then call the string method
on the output stream and print it out
that's the same reason that's the same
request that we did earlier in our
imaginary API
there are seven nouns here participating
in several different api's and when I
told you that I think that HTTP is a
verb centric language the issue you were
thinking about in terms of nouns
interacting is that the mental model
required to actually keep track of thing
is very haughty these are all the
methods we methods we use to actually do
all of these things these are several
different api's and individually they
make sense like a URI you should be able
to get a port from it or a host from it
you know a session should be able to
send a request and receive a response
but the issue is that the context
requirement is is so high that if for
instance you call send response twice
you're not sure what's going to happen
if you call receive response twice are
you copying data are you duplicating
data you're not sure what's going to
happen and so what I want and what I
built is an 18 HTTP API for people it's
client-side and I want the objects in
this API to participate in a single
request verb that means that the way you
map your programmer intent is through a
single API a single function call and
use the objects to kind of modular
modulate what happens inside the
internals of that call I also want the
steps to get the response to be minimal
so it's you shouldn't have to jump
through any hoops or do stream copying
to actually get the response that's
ultimately what we care about the most
and finally I want it to be useful in 95
percent of use cases the example I gave
earlier of the of the get request is a
little bit academic you're gonna need a
little more power and you need to flesh
out the API a bit more so I'm going to
go through a few examples of actual uses
of the API and how we handle them using
objects and parameters so if you want to
make a query parameter you simply pass
in this object called parameters it's a
dictionary like object so you just
instantiate it with these double braces
you give it a key and a value it handles
all of the URL encoding and and the
appending to the URL that you need to do
and it doesn't transparent it does it
automatically for you so you'll have to
worry about it on to Tait authentication
is easy as well you just pass in a user
and a password if you want to change the
scheme you just say I want to use digest
authentication
and it does it it does it for you
behind-the-scenes here we're seeing the
same kind of dictionary life constructor
again for headers and that's that makes
sense because a header is just a mapping
from some key to a number of values we
can do the same thing with posts so
these are URL encoded posts so these
will get attached to the end of the URL
if you have a longer post you just call
it a multi-part post and so this is not
a long string but if it were a long
string you wouldn't use that different
it would use a URL it will use a
multi-part form post to actually send
the request and adding a file should be
easy as well so you just instantiate
this file object you give it a path you
give it a name it reads it behind the
scenes and sends it up for you of course
you can send more complex requests by
mixing and matching these parameters you
just throw them into the request verb
and the objects kind of settle
themselves and handle themselves and
with some template magic we get order
list arguments basically for free so all
of these make the same exact request you
don't have to worry about the order in
which you're passing these arguments in
as long as all the arguments are there
when you're making the actual request so
we started with a very simple premise
that HTTP is at a high level about verbs
the objects that participate in that
verb help communicate the intent of the
programmer and the language that emerges
from this interaction of these objects
and verbs is the API if you can imagine
that an API is a rung on an abstraction
ladder and at the very bottom you have
electrons and neutrons and signals and
you're basically physics you step a
little bit higher you'll start to see
bits and sockets and then you get to
http which is by definition the client
client-server networking protocol you go
a little bit higher than that you get
the core API of C++ requests but that's
not the only thing my library does we
can step a bit lower and get sessions
basically for free because this is what
the core API uses to actually implement
all of these requests and if you step
higher than that and kind of go above
the abstraction because HTTP is a verb
we can do it asynchronously so we can
handle the response at some later time
when it's can be
we can also pass a callback so that when
we actually get the response we're
calling some custom function here it's
just a lambda that takes a response but
it can be any kind of function object we
can do all of this because the core API
is encapsulating a single powerful
concept that HTTP can be considered as a
verb centric language and we need an API
that speaks our language because after
all developers are people - you should
be using API so to speak your language
it makes it easier to communicate your
intent and this is an API to people this
is my library it's called C++ requests
