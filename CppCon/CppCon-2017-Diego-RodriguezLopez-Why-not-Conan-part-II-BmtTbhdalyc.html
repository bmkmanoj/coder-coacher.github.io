trying to convince you not to use Conan.
I gave five solid reasons
but apparently I didn't do very well.
So I'm trying again.
I'm giving you another five
reasons not to use Conan.
So the first one.
Because building from source is better.
Google told us this morning,
&quot;Binaries are very difficult.&quot;
So instead in our company
we have just given up.
We have a better alternative.
We are giving our developers
in the welcome pack a holy grail.
So this is the happy face
of our youngest developer
when we finally released version 1.0.
(laughter)
Also, another one.
Because supporting multiple
build systems is suboptimal.
Actually the other day my company,
I was dipping in the code base,
and I found some libraries
with a legacy built system.
So I went to my team and I say,
&quot;Hey, I want to change
to our build system.&quot;
And they were so happy.
They couldn't stop laughing.
And then I went to my manager
and he was also so happy,
that he pulled me a ticket to see CppCon.
A one way ticket.
(laughter)
Yeah, and also there
are many alternatives.
Why Conan if there are
many other options there?
I wish I could point you to any of them
but as there are no
public metrics anywhere,
where we can compare
or you cannot know about the
trends of these alternatives.
Just pick any other one.
You will be fine.
Yeah, this is evil.
This is a very bad thing.
It was been acquired by JFrog.
And you know open source developers,
they work much better
when they are hungry.
(laughter)
Yeah, that's a fact.
If he's hungry and they
are also working late
because they have another
thing on their plate.
Then the code is perfect.
So, this is a terrible mistake.
And the worst thing is
that they are dumbing down.
They are hiring more people.
So this is a recipe for disaster.
So please don't send them any CV ever.
(laughter)
Finally, the last one.
Last year, I was saying
okay it's not mainstream.
I have to confess.
I hack their internal analytics.
They have hundreds of
companies using Conan.
But, it's fine.
I'm a troll.
So a reason for not using Conan
is because it's too mainstream.
(laughter)
Okay, why not?
The truth is that I'm not that creative.
So these reasons are not mine.
They are found on the internet.
You know, the only thing of source
and truth and knowledge.
(laughter)
So, and the truth is that if we
get a barbarian and then
we mix it with a frog
we make him green
we make him jump
we will get something incredible.
(laughter)
We will get Package Manager from C/C++
And he will be unstoppable.
It will be Conan Package Manager.
Thank you.
