invisible features that
I came across this summer
with C++.
The reason I put the
features in quotation marks
is because these features
a little confusing.
There are very less cases that you
might find it actually useful.
Most of these cases will lead to a lot
of unreadable code that you
don't want in your source.
What are these features
that I'm gonna talk about?
First of all, case label placement,
assigning to ternary statement,
array operator is associative,
and pure virtual functions
with function body.
We all know goto statement is evil.
It's some of the things that
most of the programmers hate.
This is an example showing
the goto statement.
In this, we can see that C++ still
uses the goto statements,
and we can see in this example.
The next thing to ponder
upon on this thing is
the goto statement is implemented
similar to a switch statement.
As you can see, the colon symbol used
in the switch statement,
we use the argument of
the switch statement
to perform whichever
case we want to perform.
My point here is, switch statements
have the same implementations
as the goto statements,
'cause they are
implemented as jump tables.
Argument of the switch statement is used
to reference the position
of the source code that
you want to implement.
That's the reason you have a
break statement over there,
so you want to just break the code
that you want to execute after that.
Here's a fun fact.
You can also place an arbitrary
URL into your source code.
The first HTTP would be the case name,
and the colon would be the case label,
and since it's double forward slashes,
it'll be a comment.
Next thing I want to talk about is
assigning to ternary statement.
We all know about ternary statements.
Ternary statements evaluate to an lValue.
Here's an example where you can use
the ternary statement to take a value
and assign it to another variable.
In this case, whatever value
of the option would be,
you can assign that to either a or b,
depending if the value of the option
is greater than one or less.
You can also use it to select an object
and call a method on that object.
This is something that I
came across this summer
that I never used.
Array operator is associative.
We all know about pointer
arithmetic in C and C++.
We can use C-style arrays
as pointers and vice versa.
Sometimes it's useful, but
most of the times it isn't.
As we can see, array three is synonymous
to pointer array plus three.
What's the new stuff that
I learned about this summer
is you can actually represent it as
the index number slash the array name.
That's very interesting 'cause you can do
pointer arithmetic at that place as well.
You can do some crazy stuff, I don't know.
The last thing I want to talk about is
the pure virtual functions.
As far as I knew pure virtual functions
didn't have a function body,
but true, it doesn't have a function body,
but you can instantiate an object
with a pure virtual function.
These pure virtual
functions can be implemented
and called from derived classes.
As an example, I have this base class
that has a doSomething virtual function.
It is derived by the class Derived.
I am actually calling the virtual,
pure virtual function
from the Derived class.
This is a statement about Scott Meyers,
this is actually a feature
that is actually useful
about all the four features I spoke about.
Derived classes that implement
this pure virtual function
may call this implementation
somewhere in their code.
If part of the code of two
different derived classes
is similar, then it makes
sense to move it up in the
hierarchy, even if the function
should be pure virtual.
Yeah, thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
