that software transactional memory can
be more than just a research toy under
the right conditions red is lead
developer and dynamics a data collection
and analysis package were used with
light scattering instruments so he's
going to do software transactions every
four wheels so may get this to work
again so what's happening
oh yeah that's pretty yeah I have to
start slideshow ah there you go okay um
yeah software transactional memory for
realz jump right in in some circles
software transactional memory has been
accused of just being a research toy if
you search on Google you'll find this
paper and you won't find anyone talking
about using it in actual production
software except for some folks in the
Haskell world and they're usually ten
years ahead of us on everything so but
at white technology we've been using it
for the past three years in one of our
applications as Kate said it's called
dynamics it's a analysis and data
collection package and so this may raise
some questions first off how did it go
tldr great but why mbv could probably
leave now but that y MV v has some big
caveats in it why are or were you insane
no I'll get into the reasoning behind
what we did and finally what based on
the blank stares i get from candidates
and job interviews when i asked about
software transexual memory this is
probably where we should start okay so
what is it I got okay I got a pointer
alright so say we've got two variables
here and be that we want to share
between threads usually that's a bad
idea but sometimes we can't get away
from it so we've got two here's two
threads here thread one thread to
somehow on each thread we start a
transaction this varies from system to
system you might call a function you
might create an object or there might be
some new keyword built into the compiler
just ignore that detail for now so we
start some transactions over here in
thread too we write to a and B at the
same time we're reading a in transaction
one on this other thread note that for a
we get the original value one even
though we've set the two over here
none of these rights become available to
other threads or visible on other
threads until we reach the end of the
transaction and commit it for this
transaction it just commits because we
haven't done any reads so over here
we've read a one if we just ignore this
other stuff for a minute when we get to
the end of our transaction it's going to
go back and look at all the reads we did
and in this case we get scary teeth and
a conflict because we read a is equal to
one but now it's equal to two so we have
to go back to the beginning and start
over so it's a speculative way of doing
thread synchronization we're assuming
there's not going to be any conflicts
and we can just get through and if we
don't we have to go back and do
everything over again so now there's
some details we need to go into a little
bit in our system if you read a again
after this commit you're going to get
the same value you got the first time
you always see consistent results within
a transaction and but when we read B we
get the value that was written in this
transaction because we didn't write it
or we didn't read it before the
transaction committed and normally
that's fine we get a conflict we go back
and then we'll get consistent results
the next time also if we write to a
variable in a transaction and then we
read from it we get the value we read we
wrote routes you know things would seem
crazy other systems this reader be might
have given us to some systems some
systems enforce consistency through the
whole thing some systems there is no
consistency it's up to you to not read
the variable multiple times and then
some jargon for those who know what's
going on I don't really have time to get
into all this but our system is
unbounded explicit weekly atomic those
two because I don't know how without
modifying the compiler you do anything
different and it's in directed there's
some in Direction going on under the
covers we're not updating things in
place which can have performance
implications so why would you use
software transactional memory for
composability so here we've got kind of
a comparison when you're programming
with locks we've got function a we call
it we take a lock and we call function B
this is really dangerous to do unless
you know what bead
is and what everything that be calls
does because if they take a lock you've
got locks you don't know the ordering
that you're taking locks in you've got
potential deadlock makes a program with
locks in the large really painful for
small sections of code it works fine but
when you're talking about the whole
program it's a real pain on the other
hand with a pointer go well with softer
transactional memory we call function a
we start let's say we're working with a
system where we just have a keyword
atomically which starts a transaction
and then we call Trevor we call function
B it doesn't matter what B does there's
no way we can deadlock it could start
its own transaction as long as your
system supports nested transactions
you're okay all the threads can make
progress there's no way to deadlock with
this this much structure in our system
why did we use STM is probably a more
important question this is a picture of
what our program looked like a couple of
years after I started working at Wyatt
and this was probably about well I
started about eight years ago so about
six years ago it was an old program it
was collapsing under the weight of the
data we were asking asking it to handle
originally when the program was written
the instruments weren't very well
automated so it you know you had to pay
someone to gather the data is you
couldn't gather very much data and their
thread safety the pattern they used for
to do thread safety was basically do
everything in the gooey thread which of
course means when it's doing
calculations the calculations touched
the data they have to be in the gooey
thread the GUI either locks up or
stutters like crazy if it was just
embarrassing to talk to customers that
had to go through that somehow they
didn't really care that much they wanted
other features first of course but and
when I say it would lock up like some of
these data files especially when you can
only use one thread to do the
calculations we're talking 5 10 15
minutes to do these calculations so a
rite of passage for new dynamics users
was they would start up load a big file
it would freeze they would report a bug
that hey the program hang hung and we'd
say no it's not hung it's just thinking
just wait it'll come back so I tried for
a cup
years to fix this just by putting in
locks moving things to the background
threads but some of the stuff I could
fix some of it I have interests reached
a point where there was just cascading
failures and we were effectively going
to be rewriting the whole thing anyway
at the same time we needed new features
to you know have parity with our
competitors so for about three years we
had to live with this in those three
years I was playing with Haskell bad
idea the bad company to keep um they
give you bad ideas and I really love
their software transactional memory
system and I was also working on you
know I was working with this system for
three years that just our system which
was not very good and dreaming about how
I was going to fix this and every time I
was doing design work like okay I can
fix it like this software transactional
memory was just a perfect fit I also for
kicks wrote my own softer zhengzhou
memory system in C++ it's not a
particularly great one but we did some
proof of concept work with it and found
that it was fast enough for our purposes
and I'll get into what that means in a
bit so all everything pointed at STM
being a good fit so we decided to go for
it so how did it go great but your
mileage may vary and by that i mean i
think our application is sort of in a
sweet spot for the use of software
transactional memory and why is that
first off our data has an embarrassingly
parallel structure we have when you're
collecting the data you're collecting
measurements but you get these
acquisition things whichever the real
data is and when we're doing the
calculations all these acquisitions have
a bunch of isolated calculations that
are independent of each other the
measurements are independent of each
other it's really easy to fan all this
out on two different processors which
means our performance are our thread
synchronization isn't we aren't doing a
lot of tight threats or tight
synchronization between different
threads doing these calculations
furthermore our actual calculations are
basically of a form we read some
parameters we read the data these are
done transactionally and then we put
them through a numerical meat grinder
spits out some results that we then
right into
some transactional variables so all this
is done in one big transaction but only
at the very beginning at the very end
are we doing just a few transactional
operations and these calculations the
the amount of time we spend doing these
completely Dwarfs any overhead from the
transactional system plus we're not
trying to hit 60 frames per second beat
other BOTS to market or you know we
don't have hard real-time constraints at
least in this part of the code so you
know if the researchers have to wait a
few more seconds for the results they
aren't going to care they're not going
to notice mostly it's keeping things
responsive so the part that went great
has an easy learning curve we've had a
few people come on board since we
started using this they come up to speed
fast and make some mistakes at first you
catchment code review after a month or
two they're working with a great even
though they've never seen it before and
it's just much easier to reason about
the code especially compared to locks
let alone lock free programming it's not
all roses though there are problems this
was something I was really concerned
about at the beginning ended up not
being a big issue but you can have
what's called starvation or live lock
where you have a long-running
transaction another thread keeps writing
to a variable that that one reads that
long running transaction just gets
conflict after conflict and can never
finish in our system you can actually
set openings you can actually set the
number of the maximum number of
conflicts a thread can rub transaction
can have if you hit that it takes a lock
that prevents anyone else from
committing until your transaction does
its heavy-handed it seems to work okay
we don't really I don't even think it
actually fires ever I need to go back
and check that but it hasn't been an
issue there's more elegant ways to
handle it but we haven't needed that yet
a bigger problem is you have to be
careful about where you do your side
effects in this one we're so in this
example we read a variable and then we
display a dialog we have a conflict it
goes back repeats and you can have a bug
where a dialog will display one time
like it's supposed to or fifty or
hundred times the proper way to do that
we actually have a way to schedule side
effects
call a function called after give it a
function object and when your
transaction commits the side-effect gets
run then generally this is pre it's
pretty obvious when it happens sometimes
so that's subtle but even when it is
subtle it's not any it's easier than
debugging a deadlock or race condition
so another problem inconsistent reads so
before when we were talking about back
at the beginning we have a transaction
that writes a and B we read a we read B
we get the read of a happens before we
commit our transaction so we get the old
value the reader be happens after the
transit that transaction commits so we
get the new value we do stuff with a and
B normally that's not a problem we get
the conflict we go back we start over
everything is consistent everyone smile
is something weird will happen like
because an be are inconsistent with each
other you'll try and allocate I don't
know 500 gigabytes of memory or
something and everything crashes that's
only happened a couple of times it is a
possibility once you've seen it once you
learn to recognize it right away in our
case the way to fix that we have a way
you can call a function validate which
validates your transaction at any point
and if it's invalid you get the conflict
right away and go back so we after the
Rita be we would do a validation and
everything would be good ok so before I
mention our system is weakly atomic most
people don't know what that means that
basically that means when we pull
something out of one of our
transactional variables if that has
mutable state we can just use that
mutable state wherever if you do that
it's a race condition a strongly atomic
system wouldn't allow you to use that
mutable state outside of a transaction
to combat that we require either that
the stuff you store in a transactional
variable is immutable or it's what I
call internally transacted which means
all of its mutable state is also a
transactional variables and or some
combination of that this is one example
if Chandler Carruth was here he'd be
rolling taking his head and disapproval
because there's links in here it's a
tree but we basically use immutable
links in the tree and then the stuff
that's stored in the tree is internally
transacted this allows us you get the
head head node of the tree and you can
walk the tree all you want in
outside of a transaction it's not going
to change but then when you want to use
something that's stored in the tree you
have to start a new transaction and it
keeps everything thread safe okay so
icing on the cake is this thing called
retry which is something I stole from
high school system say read some
variables and then you you check some
condition on those variables and things
aren't right for you to proceed you call
this function retry it puts your thread
to sleep when one of those variables
changes you get woken back up and your
transaction starts over it's basically a
replacement for condition variables and
it works it's really flexible and it
works great the one thing I mentioned a
caveat earlier that there's no deadlocks
with the structure I'd shown you so far
once you add retry you do any sort of
waiting in a transaction you can get I
just learned this recently you can get a
form of deadlock not because we ran into
it because someone pointed at a research
paper to me you can get a form of
deadlock that would be akin to say
having some interlocking condition
variables it hasn't finished yet I'm
still exploring all the implications of
this but like i said it hasn't been as
yet i don't understand why i think it's
just that you have to write pathological
code to get that to happen so the
stereotypical response to your testers
is it works fine on my machine in this
case replace machine with application it
works great fine for our application but
as I said we don't have the same strong
deterministic performance requirements
that some other systems have and in the
well there's one place where we do which
is where we're getting the data from the
instruments and we don't use the
software transactional memory system
there that's at a lower level and then
it comes into the system at a higher
level did we really need it probably not
we could have gotten away with locks but
it's made our life immeasurably
immeasurably easier and we're small
teams so we need all the help we can get
which brings me i guess the at the
bottom of that we're hiring if this STM
system sounds fun like interesting to
work with but also there's more details
my blog backwards and compatibilities
wordpress com i started writing about
this but the glacial pace i update that
thing at it'll probably be a year or two
before i get through everything I have
to say about it
there's also give me an open content
session thursday at eight thirty
somewhere in the matin Bauer Center so
if you have questions or you just want
to tell me why I what I did was insane
you know come on over that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
