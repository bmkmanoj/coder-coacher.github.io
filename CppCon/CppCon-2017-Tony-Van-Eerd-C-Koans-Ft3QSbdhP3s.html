stories
you should get enlightenment at the end
of them this is I'm not gonna explain
you can't explain cones to people you
have to understand them yourself usually
they take an hour or more to figure out
but there's 83 people here so between us
all we should be able to do each one in
less than a minute okay so like I said I
don't do mutexes and stuff just yellow
thoughts as soon as you get them and
then we'll all be enlightened at the end
of each one okay
must ux fit X first but why Master says
check yet and you spend a week looking
through the archives and you find
nothing no nothing explains that comment
and then you are enlightened some of you
heard a few of these things before this
week but these there's some new ones too
so come on is anyone understand why how
did we get enlightened this one's really
hard because you actually need to spend
the week going through the pain like so
what would happen if you spent a week
trying to find why this thing this
comment is there how would you feel hmm
there's no reason come on we have to be
quick careful there's historical reasons
of what are they well yeah someone got
fired yeah the history got trimmed yeah
that's the thing you spend a whole week
and can't find it but now what's the
answer where's the enlightenment of what
what do you learn from this nope got to
go on can't be Alain Locke free master
we need a cue this happened actually and
I searched the codebase that was the
master in this case not usually and gave
them a cue which wasn't lock free and
said there you go anyone enlightened by
that am I already like two minutes in ah
master explained the rule of zero I tell
I study the pointers of master unit and
DeMuth but they don't follow the rule of
zero so why would you study those
pointers for the rule of zero
there we go enlightenment if you use
those pointers you can follow the rule
of zero we get a winner
all right near Sprint end master found
them arguing end versus log in on some
algorithm they are writing these are all
140 characters so they just have to like
the exactly hundred forty carats I have
to kind of add some words I'm down then
so the master typed the solution and
which was N squared so one of the people
left and discussed that the ends where
the other was enlightened the N squared
wasn't the fastest one n was ten maybe
or it was near the Sprint end does that
help done now is more important yes
there we go yeah just was this good
enough did anyone measure yet right
that's okay so the junior dev said I
went through all the code and changed
all vectors all lists of vectors because
that's usually a good thing but one
crashed and then the master said well
who is to blame for that templates need
concepts and headers need headers what
what does what did what does template
sneaked away why how are templates and
concepts related what come on loud they
constrain yes other word I'm looking for
requirements yes templates concepts core
requirements what's the headers and
headers you have header that requires
another header has dependencies
dependencies yes so what's this what
happened to that one line of code when
choosing a container remember vector is
best leave a comment to explain if you
choose from the rest
I will just tell you the the blame goes
to the person who wrote used lists and
didn't explain why a list was necessary
there was a hidden requirement that
wasn't mentioned master I found all our
leaks I fixed all our leaks by using
SharePoint are everywhere when you lead
a plow horse who holds the reins
who else holds the reins is that is that
clear
the horse no no well yeah that's true I
guess the horse is the reins on the
other end but that's not that's not my
question
I like that we could have there's also
often more enlightenment than I planned
so I'll let you guys think of that one
for shared pointers for ownership thank
you
we're on we're on the right track how
many people are holding the reins when
you're you know using a plough horse and
how many people are holding the reins
when use a share pointer
[Laughter]
oh it's awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
