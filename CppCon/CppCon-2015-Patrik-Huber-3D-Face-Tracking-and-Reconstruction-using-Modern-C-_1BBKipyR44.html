student from the center for vision
speech and signal processing of the
University of Surrey in the UK and I'm
going to talk about some face stuff and
C++ so I just have a couple of slides
about our Center and then I'll get into
the interesting stuff so we're located
in the southeast of England we were one
of the largest UK centres for like
vision speech and signal processing
around 30 years old at the center we are
120 people 70 PhD students and yeah we
have quite a lot of projects running so
we do all kinds of stuff like medical
imaging detecting abnormal ease in
medical images segmentation of like MRI
images CT images analyzing of breathing
motions we do sound stuff so for example
here how can you bring like the
listening experience from a stadium to
the comfort of your home then we do a
lot with like 3d video we have a
recording studio like for example record
actors from different view angles and
then reconstruct the whole actor or the
whole scene in 3d we do sign language
recognition tracking face tracking
obviously people detections all kind of
these kinds of computer vision and all
your signal processing stuff so I'm a
PhD student there I'm working on faces
and I'm mostly interested in how to
reconstruct face in 3d from a 2d image
or 2d webcam videos so like no no 3d
camera or 3d information just like pure
2d 2d video I'm very interested in
modern C++ obviously and I'm also quite
like I really like open and reproducible
research and
so if you work in academia often like
you read a paper and then when you
really want to re-implement that paper
there's really so many detail and not
details not clear so I think if we put
like our software online that's a lot
better so we've recently open sourced to
libraries and I'm only going to talk
about that and like some challenges and
problems we had with C++ so face
tracking and reconstruction usually you
have some kind of video or an image and
what we do first is we detect the face
of a person in the image and then we
detect some facial and mark points these
can be like eyes or the nose or hear
like around the face this kind of
interest interest points and from these
points we have a very very accurate
location on where the faces so from
there on we can do more processing and
for example reconstruct the face in 3d
from from the 2d image and this has all
kinds of applications from getting a
frontal view of the face somebody might
look to the side we wouldn't want the
frontal view of the face face
recognition obviously like expression
analysis we use it in human robot
interaction so it's running on a robot
and so the robot knows who is talking to
basically and where the person is
looking to get all kinds of applications
so in the first part I'm going to talk
like about our landmark detection and
the library we developed in the process
I'll spend a few minutes on the
algorithm so you know a little bit what
what it's about and then some
interesting C++ bits and just towards
the end I spent like two minutes on the
second library on 3d face reconstruction
and our main goal with this is to make
3d face models and research with 3d face
models a lot more widely available if
you work in computer visions or faces
you might know that like a lot of Agora
are based on simple two-dimensional
models you might have heard of like
active appearance models active shape
models these are kind of the most used
algorithms and 3d algorithms are like a
lot harder to use
they require first they require a lot
more effort to build a model a 3d model
that's a lot harder and then also to use
that model is a lot harder as well so we
kind of want to fill in that fill in
that gap so recently there has been a
class of algorithm that is based on
linear regression that is very
successful for 2d landmark detection and
how they basically work is we have a
face box which would be the blue box
which comes from a face detector and
then we have trivial initialization so
we just put the red point somewhere the
red point might be a mean face or
something that we just put inside the
face box and from these red points we
would then like to go to the true
location so to tutor to the green point
for each point obviously you would find
the true line or application and so
these algorithms are called a regression
based method supervised learning and
basically what happens is you have a
bunch of training data and from this
bunch of training data you learn from
the image information how to get to the
true location and we've already had some
MATLAB code of this but all our 3d face
software was in C++ so we kind of chose
to re-implement this in C++ and also it
turns out that these algorithms can do a
lot more than just to the landmark
detection so we kind of wanted like a
very sustainable implementation of this
that doesn't just work for face a facial
at mark detection but for a lot more
applications as well
so you might know linear regression
basically the formula y equals MX plus B
so we have some kind of input variable X
and we have a linear relation between
the input variable X and the output
variable Y I think this is by the way
the only formula in my talk so don't
worry and we want to find find an M we
want to learn am basically from training
data so that when we input like a new X
we can predict the Y that's basically
what we want to do and if we change this
formula very slightly we get this which
is basically what we are doing and
learning so we have this matrix a that
we want to learn from data and we have
we have this F and this F is basically a
function that takes high the image as
input and s would be the current
location of the landmarks so basically
the current shape and from that this
function f in this case basically
extracts the red neighborhood so the
neighborhood of the landmark location
and from the information in this
neighborhood we would like to predict on
where to put the point so on where to go
with the landmark point to eventually
converge on the true location and this
is based on the method mentioned in that
paper so we have like a few hundred or
thousand training images that are like
hand labels so we know the true location
and each of these images will basically
be one row in in a linear system of
equations and then we solve that to
basically get our matrix a so as I said
before it turns out that this algorithm
can actually do like a lot more than
just optimize for 2d landmark locations
because like the parameters on on the
left sides which were like the shape
locations they could be anything so if
we were working with a 3d model we're
probably not interested in like
finding some 2d pixel locations but we
would be more interested in finding the
3d rotation and translation parameters
of the 3d model and how to how to be a
basically because these parameters they
tell us where to put the model so it
matches the face in the image and of
course in this case the function f would
be different as well because it would
need like access to the 3d model and in
this case the F would basically be kind
of the whole render rendering or
projection of the three 3d model to 2d
so we wanted to implement this in a way
that that it works in all these cases so
we are getting into some kkona so
basically this this function this
function f that that models this
basically going from that parameter
space to the to the space where we
optimize we model this as a function in
the code which is pretty cool because if
this function is like a trivial thing we
can we can just define it as a lambda
function like in place and it's very
easy to use and if it's something more
complicated like 3d 3d stuff to the
landmark detection we could make this
function object with some state it could
contain the 3d model and it works
exactly the same way so to go to some
code in case of the landmark detection
we would have a we would have a function
object and if I can get the mouse okay
we would have a function object that
takes all the images on creation because
during runtime it needs access to the
images and then the generic part is
basically the parameter input and the
parameter input would be our 2d land or
locations of the face and then this
function here
it's very simplified would basically
extract the neighborhood some kind of we
don't directly use the RGB information
there is basically something called
local image features or hoc features
they basically do something smart with
the RGB information they calculate the
the gradient of of the image in
different directions and then this
function returns a descriptor of this
neighborhood and from that we can start
a learning process and I'll show you
some other examples of that later
so you there may be some things you
don't know for example this mat could I
maybe get a quick show of hands who has
used OpenCV before okay that's a lot of
people because so for the people that
don't know this mat is from OpenCV and i
thought as this is like a civics class
conference and for the people that don't
know yet it's probably interesting to
quickly have a look at that
so cv mat is basically the the matrix or
image class of OpenCV it behaves like a
smart pointer like a shared pointer
basically and it contains a header that
has that has basically the dimensions of
the matrix or image and some flags and
to use it is pretty easily so the first
row would create a five by five matrix
of floats and then on on the second line
we could we can get like sub range of
this matrix so here we would get only
the first two rows of that matrix and no
data is so basically just that we create
a new header but the underlying
information is the same we just have a
header that points to a different
location in memory and the last line is
if we want to get to get an element so
and images are basically matrices so
there's no difference between images in
and matrices so we have this
transformation function and the other
things we need is a learner basically a
linear regression class that solves this
system of equations and then we have a
optimizer that takes all these things
and puts them together so this is
optimizer it takes the learner to
regressor and it takes this projection
function which is which which it applies
to to each image basically and from that
we can start the learning process so in
code it basically looks like this we
have a bunch of training images we have
a bunch of training landmarks which
would be a matrix with one row for each
for each image we have initialization
values of of these landmarks we have we
have this function that extracts the
neighborhood we say we want to learn
five regressors so we actually not only
learn one but we can learn several that
will be applied in series which will
increase the performance and then we
have the optimizer we can specify a
function that gets called after each
iteration so basically we can say okay
after each iteration we would like to
calculate the training error and it will
print that it will print it out and then
we can start the training and afterwards
store the model so to use the model is
equally easy we use a serial serial as a
serialization library I will get to that
in in a minute
to store and load the model and then to
run the model is just loading the images
and run the detect detect function which
will return the landmarks and that will
give you something like this and as I
said before our goal was to have like a
very generic implementation of this so
after we finish that what we actually
did is we could just
switch out this projection function f
basically buy another one that uses the
3d model and replace the 2d landmark
coordinates by these 3d parameters and
we just recently got a publication out
of this that I'm going to present next
week so it turns out that that this
works pretty well so some c++ challenges
with that how many of you have worked
with MATLAB okay
Oh quite a lot okay so to solve this
linear system of equations we might have
a lot of images like a few thousand
images and we might have like a lot of
landmark points so our neighborhood is
pretty big so so basically the the
matrix that we we get can be pretty
large like fifteen thousand times eight
thousand and to solve a linear system in
MATLAB you can just do like a backslash
B and it will give you the result and
this function is incredibly good it's
like fast it's parallelized it
automatically chooses which algorithm to
use to solve this system of equations so
there's like you are decomposition Lu
decomposition or all kind of algorithms
that you can apply it just to chooses
like the best one and it also warns if
the system is not well conditioned so
what obviously can happen is that like
the system doesn't have a solution or
that it is under determined so we have
like less equations than unknowns and
all this kind of stuff can happen and so
to solve a matrix of this size in MATLAB
takes like three minutes and when we
first write this in C++ with various
libraries it was more like a few hours
and I thought at first that there was
something wrong but there wasn't so
there's in C++ obviously like you have
to choose a library which library are we
going to choose to solve our systems it
turns out that OpenCV is horribly slow
for matrices of this size
it's good for matrices of like 200 times
200 but not for this kind of for this
kind of stuff
there's Lib eigen which is pretty good
there's other things like boost plus AG
u plus I guess we chose live eigen but
even live I can have like five or six or
seven different algorithms that we need
to choose from so the first one I chose
I chose the best one of course it turns
out or like the most accurate one it
turns out that the most accurate one
takes an hour to run so it took me a
while like to figure out which one is
good obviously the ones that are fast
have some drawbacks for example one
drawback is that they assume that the
system of equations is invertible so if
you give it something that's potentially
not invertible then i guess anything
could happen
but luckily this is not a big problem
for us because we calculated the
training error in each iteration so if
our system gets like not not solvable
then we'll know because because the
training error gets gets really high
also not all of these run in parallel
and it turns out you really want to have
something that runs in parallel so yeah
this was kind of one one bit that took
us some time to figure out now that we
know all this it's pretty easy but like
compared to MATLAB where it's just a
one-liner I think we would have wished
that it was a bit easier in C++ another
thing that was that we wanted to import
some our models from from our MATLAB
code and and this is not fun
MATLAB has has this MATLAB compiler SDK
which is I looked at it last like a year
ago maybe they have improved but I don't
think so it's like this ugly hard to use
C API and I I just said I I'm not going
to use that so the second solution is
like text files and manual parsing and I
kind of
I've tried that in the beginning but it
turns out that somebody changes the
MATLAB code and then you need to change
all the writers and the parsers and
everything and it's just like a real
hassle so so we actually we haven't
really done that we we train all our
models in in C++ now because it's it's
just so inconvenient to to get data from
from MATLAB to C++ so I'm very open for
suggestions here anybody has a good
solution but even like storing the
models in C++ we had some problems the
task seems pretty simple we train a
model in C++ we want to to upload it and
have other people use it we tried and we
won't don't want to do this by hand we
want to use a serialization library
obviously so we tried some XML and text
formats but it was kind of out of the
question because our models get too big
and most serialization libraries don't
generate the best XML if you have like a
lot of floating-point numbers so it
would generate like one tag per number
so it means you have a huge overhead so
our models get like a few a few hundred
megabytes in size and and that's not
what we want so we try to boost
serialization library first which is
really really awesome library but we had
some problems I work with a fairly
recently boost version on my laptop and
if you and like a lot of my users and on
our lab computers have older boost
versions so if I train insert the model
they can't load it and so now you could
say I could just install an older boost
version on my laptop but first I don't
really want to have several boost
versions on my laptop and second the
problem is that the old boost versions
actually don't compile in Europe visual
studio versions so that's also really
not an option
so I found serial which is a pretty cool
C++ 11 library for serialization its
header only and we can embed it in our
own source code so we basically get rid
of all all these problems
what is and the syntax is really similar
to boost so it took me like five minutes
to change it what's not so nice is that
this library has no update guarantee so
they say like if you update our version
like all or your previous models might
not work anymore but I guess you can't
have everything
so yeah the result of this is this
supervised descent library which which
we open sourced yeah which is basically
the first part of my talk so very quick
to the 3d model stuff now we basically
did the same what I described with 3d
models we have a library that thinks we
have a library that handles the 3d
models so we have this really face model
and moving yeah so basically the the
model is trained from example 3d scans
so we can adapt this model to two
different people so if you look closely
you can see that here it's mainly like
the size that increases here it's like
the width of the face that increases and
here there is some more local details
that are modeled I think more up here so
basically we can we can adapt this model
to to to a specific person which is what
we want to do during like face detection
and face tracking and 3d reconstruction
I'm not going to go into details here we
have a simple representation of the
model in the code we we can fit the
model to a new image I will show you an
example of this pretty soon we release
that as well as a library and we include
the low resolution shape model so
basically we give the users a low
resolution model so that they can
immediately start start coding and and
using our stuff so let's get to a demo
basically the demo shows these two
things combined after each other and
I have to switch to the external monitor
so basically what you see here is the
detected landmarks here you can see the
3d face reconstruction and that's
basically some internal information here
which I'm showing because it's
interesting to explain so basically this
guy is looking to the to the left right
like from from his point of view and so
what we do here is basically we we don't
use the information from this side
because obviously we don't know what is
happening here and if I run the video
now you can see if he turns we start to
fill out information here as well
because we get some information here we
merge this information and here is
basically just a 3d rendering of the
current 3d model and let me quickly show
a second example that's a bit slower
because the resolution of the video is a
lot higher and I think currently we
don't like rescale the image so it just
runs a bit slower what we can do we can
press a button and then it saves an obj
to the harddrive and then and then if
windows does what I want to do we have a
sorry I'm looking for my mouth we have a
3d model of that face basically okay
let's get back to representation so to
sum up we think we have we have created
like two simple to use modern C++
libraries which really fill a fill a gap
looking at what's out there
there is quite a lot of alternatives out
there for 2d landmark detections some of
them are really good but without source
code some of them run like only either
on Linux or Windows
and most of the open-source ones that
are available are kind of really old C
code like or C++ code that is really C
code and it's not really that easy to
use there are of course a few notable
exceptions and some really good other
libraries as well in other in other
languages one of our main open work
package is to make it work better with
facial expressions if you had a very
good look at the video I showed you
probably noticed that like when he opens
the mouth it doesn't track the landmarks
we're very well when the expressions
gets wrong header only libraries are
great we've actually actually switched
one of the libraries it wasn't a header
only library and then we switched it
because header only libraries are really
a lot easier to deal with for example if
you want to run stuff on like exotic
platforms like I've tried I've tried to
make a wet demo with e/m script and M
script and I'm not sure how to pronounce
it and there it's just a lot easier if
you have header only libraries you you
can just make an app include the library
and yeah so obviously it increases
compile times but I think if like the
libraries are small then it's kind of
its kind of really good one thing we
thought about is is if we should it it
would maybe be nice to integrate some of
the stuff into open Sooey
if they're interested of course on the
other hand we've also have opinions that
are like white on the other side of the
spectrum getting rid of open CV would be
nice as well because it turns out that
in some of these web and mobile
experiments we did that it was a bit
hard to get to run open CV there so I
don't really know where where to go from
from there open CV is doing a lot of
efforts to run like on Android and iOS
but it's still not all perfect so I want
to thank the whole team there's a lot of
people a lot of people involved that
were worked previously on the model and
have contributed to the software and yes
some references
and thank you very much for the
attention okay questions yeah please we
don't have so much problem with
elimination because if you use something
like hawk features or even learned
features they're quite invariant to
light changes of course if you have like
a really hard light gradient sometimes
there's problems but in general these
image features are quite invariant
regarding light and I think I have to
repeat the question right so the the
question was if we have problems with
varying light so if you have a strong
varying light yeah yeah your first
partial pivoting Lu decomposition yes it
was it worried was the one that had the
orange bar because it's one of the only
one that runs in parallel if you compile
you you have to add minus F open MP and
then it paralyzes automatically we had
the constraint that in the equation
system we solve our right hand side
basically the B is a matrix as well and
also not of all of these algorithms run
if work if your right side of the
equation is a matrix and so the partial
pivoting Lu the conversation it doesn't
check for invertibility but as I said
before that's not so much of an issue
because we see that in a training error
and the question was which the
composition we used with eigen yep did
you have a question
in clean education so the question was
what method we used to learn the linear
regressors and that inverting the matrix
is not necessarily something we have to
do yes there are some iterative
algorithms I haven't really looked into
that because we basically came from the
MATLAB side and in MATLAB all we ever
did was solve the system of equations
one thing to note there is that we don't
invert the matrix so inverting the
matrix and solving the linear systems
are two different things so you can
solve the system more efficiently
directly for your right-hand side of the
equation instead of inverting the matrix
so that gives you some some performance
video but of course there are iterative
methods I think you first okay not
really because so I actually like MATLAB
a lot and I'm I'm a student so everybody
at the Uni has it for free that's
obviously a different story in industry
yeah what was your question sorry
okay so performance of octave versus
Matt Levin no I haven't used octave so
one option would be just to use lip icon
one problem is that we need something to
load images and OpenCV has just like I
am read so I I've had a look at image
loading libraries most of them are like
C or can only load like one type of
image like or using lip PNG manually or
something like that I don't think that
would be a lot of fun loading the images
is a problem yeah it would be awesome to
have that in the standard library right
but regarding the opencv type so they
don't they don't template their type at
their matrix matrix on the type one
advantage of that is that you can
convert between all of them and if you
work with images this is kind of an
advantage so you load like a three
channel image and then you can convert
it to a four channel image with alpha
Channel you can convert it to like a
floating point image to some operation
yeah but I yeah I mean they made some
design decisions that you can agree or
disagree with or even say it's not the
best C++ maybe also the overhead of the
the mat header is actually quite large
so I think it's 96 bytes or something
so if you have like a few thousands of
them or a few 10,000 you have to watch
out can take a lot of RAM so but I think
it yeah it works so this one or next
next one I think maybe previous on this
one earlier okay yeah I think I think
that was not really I think I think it
was it was this one right this one was
the one where we've looked at some
methods for solving the system and no
the solution was that we use the partial
people Lu decomposition from I again
because it paralyzes it's pretty fast
and it doesn't check for invertibility
or something like that but we are okay
with this so this turned out to be
pretty good I think it yes so the
question is if it's any close to three
minutes from MATLAB and yes it is it is
I haven't measured it but it runs within
minutes as well yes for very large
matrices I think it's I think it's
probably a bit slower but not not that
much that was not that successful
because I had some problems with open CV
and a little bit with boost so I yeah I
haven't finished that but I think I'm a
pursue that further it's pretty cool
okay I think I think that's it and we
run out of time so thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
