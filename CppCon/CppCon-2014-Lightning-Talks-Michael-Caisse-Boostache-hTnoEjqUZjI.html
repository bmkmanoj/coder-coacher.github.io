right it's kira kira consulting enjoys
teaching others about c++ writing
template metaprogramming he's going to
tell you about mustache okay so boost
dash is a library in a week that was um
sponsored at this last CPP C++ now wrong
conference s2 plus plus now C++ now has
a zero track which is called library in
a week and started with buscando 2008
and for people who can figure out how to
get to the conference center early
enough in the morning we argue about how
the libraries to be developed and then
we spent a couple days trying to develop
a library and the concept this year was
something that eventually became named
boost dash or boost ish or depending
upon where you live it might even be
boost ache so yeah the idea of this was
if you've seen template and not like
templates like we think about templates
but templates like maybe web people or
other people who are trying to generate
text output or other output it was a
template engine and so you provide to it
some description and I'm it was modeled
after a mustache and then it would take
a data structure in and it would apply
the two and then and then put something
out and what we came up with is
something that actually looks like this
the the the idea is that we have a
template and some user data coming in
the the template was going to be
compiled into an AST and then the user
data and the compiled template data
would be ran through a vm engine and
then there'd be some output and so let's
just look at this one this one side for
a moment which we wrote that week
basically the template is a text
description and it goes through boost
spirit the output is an abstract syntax
tree that absent abstract syntax tree is
then
grovelled over with some modern
techniques that allow a very declarative
description of how you transfer this AST
into the AST that you want and that is
the engine primitive a stn you might
think why in the world would you want to
do that you already had a perfectly good
AST and the reason is because kate wants
to write her actually own template
language and so we support then the k
template mustache template in Django
template and you can just keep adding
templates beyond the grammars to write
for spirit are very very simple the
declarative rules to write in order how
to describe one AST into another a str
very simple to write and now we have a
common AST that describes the
instruction sets for the compiler the
the other side taking user data and
apply it into the vm that a lot of
questions come up with this like what
does user data look like wow sometimes
it does look like that so like what
structure should you use for this data
and you know should be JSON should it be
some variant that's a recursive data
structure should it be maps vectors what
are you going to use and really what we
wanted to use the design goal was to be
able to use whatever the user had inside
of their native C++ program you probably
have some recursive data structure we
would like to take that and throw it at
it ends up that that's hard so we didn't
accomplish that by the end of the week
but I had a long plane trip from
Virginia back to California last month
and so I spent some time on that and you
can he'll throw just about anything at
it and it uses something called
categories in order to figure out at
compile time what a recursive data
structure is non-intrusive lee and and
can work with that so here is for
example I just threw this together it's
using something called extended variant
it is something in spirit that just
allows you to treat variants like their
objects so you can declare them early
and use them recursively as opposed to
all the ugliness that you have to do
with non types that are variant so here
maps and lists and whatever's and you
just throw that at the data side
or any recursive data structure that you
might have and it will understand how to
grovel through that and pull the data
out as as its processing so we now have
the data AST instruction AST at some
point goes insight to the virtual
machine engine and in and we have an
output so this is useful for a whole lot
of different things the our company here
is taking and moving this on and i'm
going to continue to work on it we
actually have something that would call
kira labs where it's our open source
things that we've been able to do
internally for either clients or
ourselves and we move on and an open
source ax you can find more information
akira labs org including lots of
tutorials about spirit and the
techniques that we're using the modern
set c++ techniques were using and I'm
github com care labs you'll find that
source code for boost dash we actually
wrote a vm engine yeah it's very simple
to write using you know modern
declarative techniques you can write BM
engines very quickly we in our company
the last two years have written three
four very significant large languages
it's not part of me yeah beans on github
a don't don't be thinking something
amazing since the video that's supposed
to process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
