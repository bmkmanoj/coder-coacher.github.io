the maniac I am a student at verse 12
university of technology that's in
Poland I also work at nokia networks and
this is going to be a talk about
functional programming in every way okay
so we are going to start with an a short
introduction that will actually tell us
what I'm going to talk about and there
then we will meet some of the ideas that
govern functional programming so purity
of functions functional data structures
avoiding shirt state you table shrek
state of course composability and kind
of laziness trying to design your
interfaces for success so and not for
the exceptional cases and of course we
will talk about writing generic code and
noticing patterns in the code we write
and creating abstractions from from that
and then at eight-thirty there will be a
session about functors and mona's and
I'd like to invite you for it ok so
functional programming is a is a
paradigm so a set of ideas and
techniques and the techniques are not as
important as the ideas that are below
them and techniques are just means to
express the idea to implement it and
ideas are applicable in almost every
programming language especially where in
C++ which is as we all know
multi-paradigm and should take the best
parts
every paradigm that is usable in it so
we will talk mainly about ideas and not
as much about techniques so the
implementation of the those ideas what I
mean about code what I mean by code
design it's all the steps from the
initial idea about an application or a
library to the implementation deep below
including the implementation of specific
functions in the interfaces okay so I'm
going to talk about some guidelines
about how you can design and write code
to kind of follow the functional
programming paradigm and I would like to
give some explanation for choices you
have because you cannot make it make a
decision about about design about the
way you're writing code without knowing
the possible possible choices this is
not a talk that consists of do and do
not so we had talks like that this week
already so this is not another one and
this is not very talk that religiously
follows a paradigm d paradigm so there
is that following following anything
religiously without any kind of
reasoning usual probably makes no sense
okay so the first of the ideas is purity
of functions what does it mean for a
function to be pure a pure function is a
function that does not cause side
effects and that for every that when
cold with the same set of arguments it
always returns the same value
and it's the value that matters not the
state of the object that is that is past
so it's easier to reason about them we
don't have to think about implicit
inputs for a function when it's pure
when we know it's pure and as long as
the function is named correctly we can
usually from the set of arguments in
from the name like understand what is
happening below in the implementation
without even seeing it they can be
optimized better so the compiler if it
knows that a function is pure it can
optimize it more aggressively and make
for example a single one call to a
function instead of multiple ones as a
written in code and thanks to the
definition they do not cause side
effects they are not affected by side
effects of other functions they are Fred
safe which is more and more important as
time passes due to how processors are
being built these days ok so there was a
proposal in 2013 by Walter brown I am
not sure what what is the status of that
proposal and it proposes an attribute
that says you cannot throw an exception
if you throw an exception your function
is not pure and I don't exactly agree
with this approach I believe that in
this case if an exception is always
thrown for a given set of arguments the
function is still pure so a
my argument kind of follows the fact
that exceptions are monadic which i
invite you to listen about in the next
stop and so in C++ we have the proposed
attribute kind of i'm in the exceptions
part we have contacts / cost extra
functions if they are used in a constant
expression context must be pure
otherwise your code will not compile so
that is one of the ways we kind of have
pure functions in C++ right now it
connects to also follows the idea that
frog an exception makes a function not
pure and there is ignorance tension for
this attribute pure it's supported by
GCC it's supported by clunk and it's
supported by icc so it's quite widely
available and one last point here is
that the the intuition would be that
mathematical functions should be pure
but one frequently overlooked property
of floating point numbers and their
implementation as it's you're probably
executed in modern hardware a one
overlooked thing is that they are not
exactly mathematically correct so
floating-point functions will often not
be pure in the general sense especially
since there are hardware registers for
example controlling how a floating point
is rounded which will cause
floating-point operations sometimes give
us different return value for the same
input arguments okay so
we would like our functions to be pure
because it's easier to reason about them
the compiler in idea world understands
them better can do smarter things simple
with that but usually when we have a
data structure at some point we would
like to change it you have to have a
different structure for whatever reason
we cannot do that in your way with
normal data structures and once we know
usually immutability helps of course in
this case so immutable types which we
can in C++ did probably the best way to
get them in C++ is declare a type with
all of its member const of course this
may be walked around with const cast
which causes an undefined behavior which
we don't care about because it's an
defied and this way we have a type which
cannot be changed in any way as long as
the code we are calling is safe or
tested and cons member functions cannot
be really guaranteed to be pure even if
we are considering only purity in the
scope of an object so just seeing that a
member function is constant doesn't tell
us much about it a we can mark members
as mutable which means we can change
them even if when we are operating an
icon stopped this of course causes such
such types to be incompatible with for
example standard containers but they can
still be found in the wild of the C++
world so but how is that really useful
because if all the member fields are
marked const we cannot do some
operations with them for example when we
have them in a vector
we cannot call erase because erase moves
or copies but moves some some objects
around and you cannot move into a object
that is composed only of constant
members so we need something else we
need data structures that are designed
to operate on such types and this is
usually called functional data
structures and they usually the only
case where they make sense is not based
containers because for we can sure
ownership of individual nodes between
multiple data structures I'm I'm
consciously not touching the topic of
performance caused by cache misses
whatever this is not in the scope of
this talk so nodes can be shirt and we
can use less memory and we would use if
the nodes were individually owned by
each instance of a data structure and
the functions that change something
about the data structure don't really
make a change in it instead we return a
new instance of the data structure and
by the consequence those functions are
pure so even if we are constructing
multiple identical copies of an instance
of a data structure the compiler can be
smart about it and can figure out that
we are really creating an identical
think multiple times can optimize
and it's also automatically thread-safe
the data is immutable we can't possibly
run into data races by definition so
when talking about purity and functional
data structures we want to avoid getting
into situations where we shared mutable
data and we want to avoid doing
synchronization manually we would like
to have that by default automatically
and this is possible with functional
data structures nobody likes global
variables except when they are constant
constant global variables are pretty
useful sometimes and are free of most of
the shortcomings of mutable global
variables so ideally you would like to
design most of your functions to be pure
to operate on inputs do something inside
return a value and that also excludes
functions that mutate an object they are
called on and yes so when you are
sharing data try to share immutable data
do not force anything sometimes sharing
mutable data is the correct solution due
to various circumstances and sometimes
even implemented synchronization
manually will yield better result
and using immutable data structures this
can be for example caused by a data type
that has identity so we refers in a way
to itself so the particular address of
the object is important you cannot
really have that with note mutating
algorithms or functions because the
object that will be returned will be a
new one and will not be related in any
way with to the previous to the old one
and also when you're writing an
interface which is supposed to do
something for example you have an input
a string or a file and you won't want to
parse it in general you want to create a
function that will do just that so will
parse the file parse the text instead of
creating a parecer so an object that
will do by manipulating its internal
state parse the data you are parsing so
we want to parse and not create a parser
and do additional things with it okay so
the next important point is
composability functions that follow
value semantics so take values as inputs
return values are composable pure
functions generally follow value
semantics
a lot of mutating functions but not all
of them of course a follow reference
semantics so for example standard sword
takes de facto two references into the
same object and mutates the object based
on those references that's not
composable you cannot return an a
container and pass it to standard sort
and expect it to do the right thing
because you need two references into
that container so we have to save it
take those two references pass it to the
function yeah so this was of course
noticed a I guess not many people really
like operating calling functions with
iterators there was boost range there
were there is a proposal for ranges that
would kind of operate in this way but
not not entirely not always some of the
algorithms are still not pure still just
mutate a range instead of taking it by
value and returning a new value and
which one feels better the first one or
pieces of the first piece of code or the
second one because i personally much
more prefer the first one is not not
really i'm not really a fan of the of
having to create a copy and then
mutating it i would like to have that
and be encapsulated into a single
function that is my preferred interface
because it's composable unlike the
second one
so when your algorithms or your
functions are composable you'd have a
way to impose laziness of their code you
don't have to when you have an algorithm
for example sort you do not have to you
do not have to return a container you
can return an object that represents a
computation other algorithms can be made
aware of that kind of an object and can
do something smarter about it okay so
mutating is fine and breaking the rules
locally even if we set them ourselves is
fine the same case as is with type
invariants as long as the invalid state
doesn't escape a local a local scope so
no one outside of us can see d an
invalid state we are okay so we can take
a function we can take a value mutate it
locally return a new value and no one
will see that we mutated it so we are
pure even though our implementation uses
impure functions and yeah mutating
algorithms are not lazy and a simple
example if we're half a range and we
first sort it then we filter some
elements out or some elements in a we
sorted too much too many elements we
sorted elements we sorted the parts of
the range that we do not care
about which we are throwing away right
after that and if we first filtered and
sort that is all right but if our
algorithms are lazy they may have a
chance to figure this out for us and we
could not care about the particular
order of operations or the particular
way we write we describe an idea we
describe any sequence of computations
and the code can figure out the correct
one for us okay so we want to write
generic code and we want to know what we
are doing we want to do that for a
reason not accidentally and suppose plus
has this weird weird thing where
different elements of the library
different features are designed like
they look like they they've been
designed to be incompatible with
themselves by design for example we can
get a pointer from sharepoint ER a row
point and we can get a value from a
future but in one case we get a pointer
in the other case we get a value and for
optional we caught we can also get the
value but the function is not called get
it's called value as like
if somebody wanted to make them
incompatible for whatever reason it the
same goes for operator dear friend
sapporo dereference operator and i think
that this might may follow from the fact
that some pieces of code that we are
still using we're kind of over
engineered / / generalized and we look
at them and we have a feeling no no no I
will I will not do that I will not go
that way I will consciously not go that
way and it will not generalize my code
that is not a really good way to write
code maybe some people are just afraid
of writing generate code like because
they may not understand it I don't know
which which cause is true here or maybe
it's something entirely else entirely
different but we have this problem right
and it's really good to have simple
identical interfaces unified interfaces
between types dart are in some ways
similar sometimes we may not see that
similarity when writing code for the
first time but at some point we will
notice that there are some common
operations we can do on different types
like future and optional and the good
thing here would be to unify the
interfaces and of course we can do the
local locally in in a library that will
use those types but then again for every
such library
there will be wrappers around function
calls which will be redundant and they
were all sit in the same place instead
of sitting where the type is defined
which would be beneficial from the code
structure point of view even if not from
a nail spine and a slight digression so
portability so they are like they seem
to be like two understandings of the
world of the word in the programming
world one means that okay we write code
we assume that the platform we are
writing the code for is compliant with
some standards and we not care about the
platform at all and there's a different
understanding people tend to use the
word portability to describe this so we
have this these defined methods to port
a piece of code to a new platform so we
know how to do that we know how to deal
with incompatibilities we will slap some
if depths here if the star and we'll
everything will be good and the first
case we can just build it right let's
compile link and be happy in the second
case like everyone here used to
configure at least once in their life
like right it speeds tons of tons of
information of what it is checking it's
checking what's the size of this integer
type why would you do that we have since
1999 we have a header that gives us
well-defined integer types of sizes that
we may want why would we check if
integer is
if int is 16-bit or 32-bit that makes no
sense and something similar happens when
people talk about right in generic code
some people want to just write a
template that will either use a concept
or beat explicit concept with either in
a belief and type traits or with
concepts light that are incoming or an
implicit one so just rely on the fact
that if we have these these functions
available our function will compile and
there are people who like look at code
and say ok my code will be generic I
will specialize my function for this
type this type this type in this type
and I will be generic that's not really
the case not really the point so we want
to write code that will behave similarly
or in the same way for types that are
similar and of course again do not force
an interface ISM hear it do not some
people like to make Singleton's out of
everything that they think will never be
used more than one at once in a program
and that's forcing a pattern and we do
not want to do that sometimes code will
have just one use sometimes there is no
possibility to reduce a piece of code or
to say ok there may be some other data
type that is similar to
our data type in that is fine and as I
said there are types called abstract
singleton factory up there sometimes you
can find a type where they will spin at
the end this is got this has gone too
far we want to be generic but once we
are too generic we start having problems
and sometimes you will write a type and
after sometime it will look look at it
and say oh hey this fulfills this
concept I didn't think about when I
wrote this type and I have a use case
for that and instead of trying to create
a library of rappers or of additional
utility functions somewhere else far
away from the type try to add
functionalities to the type beat using
member functions or better using free
functions or but better yet free pure
functions okay so we would like to
design code for the successful cases and
this is basically designed the same
principle that says that will our code
should not be full of try catch blocks
we should just assume that it works we
write code where we do not check for
errors and we only check for them when
we actually want to handle that so
primarily the primary goal is to write
an interface for the situation where
something we expected happened there was
no problem and you want to of course
handle the problematic situations but
who
do not design your interfaces thinking
primarily of them there is one such case
currently being let's say processed by
the committee and its standard filter'
dot data so basically it to summarize
the big quote from the proposal out
there we do not have a single base class
for every exception in c++ so that means
we cannot take the approach of passing
that the exception by value to a
continuation for the error knows case so
we will just pass a future to then and
then people can we throw it by calling
get on the future inside the
continuation so I don't believe this
really makes sense because suddenly we
have a function a continuation for the
future and we want it to be cold to
continue the work that was done before
and we really care about the value not
about the future itself and you can pass
any you can you could pass like
exception pointer the standard type
exception pointer to the con
continuation in case where we want to
handle the error if you don't know it
you can you can call reflow exception
with exception pointer and then the
original exception will be thrown in a
given context so this gives us basically
a the same way of handling the exception
inside the continuation as passing a
future into it because if we get a
future we have to call that get and we
get the exception from the same way that
we do not have to write this line in
continuation we have because this is
basically what we will have to do we'll
have to extract the value from the
future every time and every time and the
exception will be really thrown for
every one of those so will if we have
five continuations attached and only the
last one handles the error we will have
the exceptionally thrown five times
instead of having it really thrown just
once for example by standard reflow
exception and so this doesn't solve the
case of exceptions that are inert
derived from standard exception but we
will in all cases with such exception so
if we are not expecting them we will
also have to write catch dot dot dot to
cotton to catch them even do something
with we do not like this case but it is
not different for futures than it is for
regular exceptions and all this doesn't
matter when the functions are not from
Inc exceptions so in the successful case
we kind of pay the price of of the case
where the exception wasn't thrown so I
believe this is not a correct way to
design an interface so the guideline
here would be try to think about
successful cases primarily right
interfaces that will work for them and
then if you cannot find a way to handle
errors with interface designed in this
way try to find another one but again
with the same same guideline and I like
writing designing interfaces by first
writing the user
of them usually my use will assume that
nothing bad happened or I will just
catch everything and lock this situation
so when it actually happens I know what
happened and not having to care about
our nose cases when prototyping for
example a prototype can very well become
become the final interface if we find
that it works well so we don't really
want to care about errors at all stages
of writing code of creating an interview
of creating and interface ok so again
about writing generic code because I
believe this is one of the more
important things to talk about and we
want to see patterns we yeah some types
have common operations that's a pattern
and people tend to look at the known
patterns the patterns they've been
taught the patterns they did not observe
themselves and try to say ok so this is
will this will definitely be a single
time without thinking about about
possible about possible uses of the
interface other than their primary one
and we do not like design interfaces
because when we try to design an
interface oh I have this bright idea it
will write it down then I will implement
it that doesn't work that's how all the
high
design design documents look like the
ones that are shown to the management to
say this is a great system this will
work this will work we didn't prevent
right to implement it but this will work
so the most useful patterns and
abstractions you will come across you
will notice them because you've written
the same code in multiple places and
your brain will be like okay I wrote
this before this may be an useful
abstraction but if you will try to say
okay this will definitely be a useful
abstraction and it will not you will
lose it once twice but not not many more
times and often times those abstractions
will be quite generic and they will open
the algorithms that operate on a on a
data structure that follows an interface
and we'll do something with them in a
generic way often by passing a function
to them a call back whatever so this
gives us higher order functions so
functions which take other functions are
arguments and of course we saw that in
C++ oh wait that was seen that was
noticed and we got sto algorithms and in
C++ 11 it of course that easier we
lumped us and even easier in 14 with
generic lambdas we knew this for a long
time
and then somebody said okay so this is
like a function but kind so this looks
like a function so maybe the factor is a
nice word i think i will use it so yeah
this is kind of an example of trying to
make a let's say interface so we say
it's a functor but we different people
will see a will see different
abstractions when they hear the word
functor functional programmers will see
a term from the category theory C++
programmers will see what is basically a
function object so this is a case of a
name clash we do not want that we want
when trying to write an interface we
will want we want to think about
function names as much as we think about
the actual code we write because
sometimes a type will accidentally
fulfil a concept and code that should
not compile with complete we will
compile without us wanting to so be
careful okay so to kind of summarize the
guidelines which are not absolute which
are meant to be broken when it makes
sense do not follow guy in high slightly
this is also a guy like breaking a
guideline is completely fine as long as
we know what we are doing and a good
sign to know whether we should break a
guideline
is if we are heavily thinking about
about breaking it so in many cases when
people are sure okay so this is this is
one of those places this is one of those
places where I want to break a guideline
I'm sure about it it usually is not one
of the note of the places okay so
immutable data is always fine to share
route or almost always mutable data is
fine as long as it's not owned by
different different scopes as long as it
stays in a single scope it's pretty much
always fine and there isn't really
anything that can go wrong about it
explicit flow of data is easier to
reason about when we see all the inputs
and all the outputs of a function in
code written explicitly we see what is
going on if there are some magic inputs
implicit inputs hidden somewhere in the
implementation of the function it's
harder to determine what is really
happening what is going on and
abstractions are discovered and it's an
iterative process so we will not see
them immediately we will go go through
different versions of an abstraction
that is fine just do not artificially
create abstractions because you think
they will work because they want okay so
that's it
ok any questions what what I meant was
memory efficient in the media okay so
the question was a what I really meant
by the memory efficiency of immutable
data structures I meant memory usage so
not like the performance which I as i
said i explicitly did not talk about but
when you have shirt nodes between
multiple instances of the same data
structure you will use less memory that
was my guess so the clarification was
there will be some notes that appear in
two collections yes there will because
for example with a function the probably
the most frequently mentioned functional
data structure is a list so when you
have a list an instance of a list you
you can create a node in you note that
says okay so the next note is over there
you can point a new new node into the
old list so by pointing into the new new
note you will point to a new instance by
pointing to the first one of the
original one
we'll have the original instance of the
ok so the comment was that if we are
passing immutable data this way we will
have stale data so of course this
approach doesn't really work for types
where we want to modify data so the case
we are talking about we have stale data
here it's because we modified something
conceptually we didn't actually modify
bytes that represented but we have a new
data structure with new value so of
course you cannot use a functional
functional data structure that way in
this case you would have to yeah you
basically need this is one of the cases
where identity is important because you
want to refer always to the same data
structure not the same value of the a
data structure ok thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
