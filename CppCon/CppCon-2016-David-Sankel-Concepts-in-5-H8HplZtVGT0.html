Bloomberg and I'm gonna do an
introduction the concept of five minutes
running over very fast so if you want to
get you got to pay attention cuz you
gonna fall the bus if you don't crud
boom okay first thing I remember what
concepts is that they're fun that means
- F concepts if you want to use it just
- F concepts just think fun concepts is
how you deal with GCC F concepts
download lease version of GCC you can do
it and play with it it's pretty easy to
do alright the first thing the thing we
want to sell with concepts is that you
have a template not all template
parameters work with that you try to put
with an in my not compiler whatever get
this crazy error message would be nice
be able to specify without getting a
crazy error message exactly what it is
you want to constrain your template with
that's what concepts are for so requires
requires that's how you do it
use - requires I know this syntax is
absolutely insane but that's what it is
so you say after your template you say
requires of course what you put in the
parentheses over there and that looks
like a function declaration at the top
that's saying given an affable type func
given an eye that's of type int this
expression F of AI needs to be valid
that's it so this is an example of like
some kind of function that needs to have
a callable type so another thing you can
do is because a lot of times you care
about what the return value of that
expression is they introduce a special
syntax you just take your expression put
it in curly brackets put an arrow and
that's the expected return type so like
if you have an iterator you want to make
sure the I plus plus is also returns an
iterator you use something like this
it's really convenient syntax another
really convenient thing is if you want
the return type to be like a vector of
something you don't want it to be
necessarily vector of int or a vector of
char just a vector of anything you just
put auto in there and it just uses that
as a placeholder for the return value of
whatever that expression is so you can
use that all over the place it's kind of
cool next thing about it so here we use
requires require so user to do your your
what are we talking about again concepts
yeah you put your concept in line if you
want to take it out line and give it a
name this the way you do that you just
do like template type name func
concept bool who knows why but concept
bool in function equals requires and
everything's the same
now remember this is case we do where
one requires okay the other one was
requires record as a person lands is
just one requires okay that's how it
works if you want to use this thing now
now you have a named concept you just
use one requires and then you put the
concept okay because if two requires is
it enough you want to have one require
but that wasn't enough either because
it's kind of our most so you have
connect 0 requires as well if you want
zero requires instead of putting type
name in your
plate parameter you put the name of the
concept that you want to constrain with
so template in function func
that's the equivalent of what we saw on
the previous slide but some people
thought that this was way too verbose so
there's another way that you can make it
less verbose I call this negative one
requires you just take it and put it in
the function declaration itself like
where you'd normally put the type you
put the concept there they're
automatically recognize this thing as a
template and constrained with this
particular thing so that's concepts of
five minutes but actually I've only been
2 minutes and 18 seconds you know what
that means
bonus slide so bonus slide this is
something that's kind of weird so if you
have a requires requires clause and what
you want to do is you want to constrain
this particular concept with another
concept like here we're using in
function like we did had before like for
example if you have a concept what you
want to be a callable object which takes
a callable object as a parameter this
actually you cannot do it this is
completely impossible with the current
concepts yes which is extremely annoying
because this was the first concept that
I tried to write and apparently it was
impossible so yeah there's no plans to
actually do this and make this work
although would be extremely useful so
I'm not too I'm not too sad about
concepts not making sepals 17 seems like
it needs some more work and there's a
lot of requirements as you can see
that's the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
