go and get a coffee refill Lior is a
principal of a Biddy software in Boston
he does modern C++ training and he wants
to focus on one particular modern thing
type traits and yes it is before 9:00
a.m. and we are going to have template
metaprogramming so if you need to hold
the hand with someone near you
be prepared ready
ready and I'm not a morning person and I
have you haven't even had coffee this
morning so this should be really
interesting so to talk about it's a
tutorial about type traits it's
specifically one aspect of titrate type
traits in conjunction with some new
features in C++ 11 so going back type
traits were first introduced in boost
they were in T r1 and during that time
traits use was mostly buried in
libraries so clients and libraries
didn't really need to understand how the
type traits worked that we're powering
some of the magic going on inside of
their library but the introduction of
wind specific feature in C++ 11 our
value references and when they act as
universal references as Scott has coined
that term kind of changes things and I'm
going to strive to explain why all of a
sudden traits become more interesting
more important to understand directly so
before we do that little review of
function overload function call overload
resolution because that really plays a
key part along when I talk about so when
the compiler sees a function call how
does it resolve that basically a
three-step process if there's an exact
match of the call to an existing non
template function then it just uses that
if there's not an exact matching but
exactly I mean almost exact because
references and constants can sometimes
be flexible but essential exact if
there's no exact non template it uses
looks for a template that can be
instantiated and if it finds one it uses
it and if not then it reverts to the non
template and considers conversions so
that's basically the rules and
it's gonna be a key here what we're
going to talk about so for example
here's two over loads of F an ordinary
function it takes two floats and a
function template in the main function
the first line is a direct match for the
non template it uses it the second line
is not a direct match for the not in
template because those aren't floats
they're int so it considers the template
it works great the third line there's a
mixture of two different types it
doesn't match the non template directly
it can't match the template either
because the types are different goes
back and uses the non template with
conversions of one of the arguments so
that's just those rules in action now
enter universal references when a
universal reference appears which by the
way as Scott defines universal
references that say our value reference
as a template parameter in a deduced
context and this is very important
compiler has to be able to be in a
position of means to deduce that type
well such a parameter tends to be greedy
it hijacks any corresponding parameters
for other overloads of that template but
only for other templates still if
there's a non template that's an exact
match it'll still win but with that one
exception the universal reference will
end up resolving for just about
everything for example we have a
template F of top that takes universal
reference another template that just
takes reference to con so that one's
actually never going to be selected and
an ordinary function f5 calls down at
the bottom the call of F of 10 is the
direct match to the ordinary function so
it uses it the other four are not so
they end up being matched to the
universal reference version and the one
that might be a little bit of a surprise
is the last one where it takes an
unsigned 10 you because that's pretty
close to an int you'd think it would
match the end overload but no the
universal reference is greedy and and it
grabs that one and so that's kind of the
crux of the problem here's an example
with a class here's a class widget the
salient thing about the widget is that
it's it's a class type alright it has a
little inserter that displays its value
and it just holds an integer in it so
here's two overloads of a function used
Val the first one takes universal
reference this
second one the idea is it takes a long
long and it's kind of supposed to handle
all in two types right that's that's the
idea anyway that somebody had writing
that so for calls whether it's an
l-value or our value widget it matches
the universal and universal reference
version which makes perfect sense
widgets aren't an integer if I pass a
long-long directly ten ll that will
match the ordinary function because it's
an exact match but plain old ten again
ends up being matched with the universal
reference which might be a bit of a
surprise so how do we avoid the problem
well don't overload the function pick
different names for all the functions
sometimes that works sometimes not if
you're trying to overload constructor x'
that won't work
replace the universal reference with
different types reference to Const or
pass by value that may give you the
right behavior but you might lose some
efficiency and also you lose the ability
to perfect forward arguments which could
be a problem so sometimes you just need
to have the universal reference version
how do you make that happen here's where
type traits and metaprogramming come in
we can use tag dispatch here to
disambiguate so the top the top function
template uses values just one use Val
now it takes a universal reference but
it dispatches to an implementation
function and I supply two versions of
the implementation functions one of
which both of which takes the universal
reference as the first argument but one
takes a true type which is a type that
is conceptually true for overloading
purposes and when taking a false type
and then we make a decision of which of
these two is going to be used with this
tag dispatch technique so what we're
asking is is T a widget basically is
what all this says to do it kosha 'we
have to spell it all out and if this
about if this same expression evaluates
to true
it ends up resolving to this first
implementation and if not it resolves to
the second so if it's true it's a widget
otherwise it's not a widget
example of running that use vowel of w
is a widget widget of five is an r-value
widget 10 ll not a widget and finally
plain old 10 also not a widget good and
we've done that with a technique called
tag dispatch so here's a reason to use
that kind of a technique sort of a more
mainstream code not just in library
implementation necessarily C++ 14 lets
you shorten the text a little bit so
this text in white becomes remove
reference T T a little bit shorter so
limitations of tag dispatch tag dispatch
is of course based on decisions based on
tags and it requires extra
instrumentation these helper functions
have to be added there's another way to
sort of get the same result and that
requires understanding SVA so a quick
review of SVA which is substitution
failure is not an error let's say we
have a widget class here and again the
salient features of this one is it has
nested types or nested members so it has
a nested result type type and it has a
nested member function process and then
we're gonna show two overloads of a
function called crunch one on this slide
one on the next the one on this slide
assumes it's working with something that
has this structure it has a nested
result type so you can see the return
value of this function is T colon colon
result type obviously this will only
make sense for a type T that has a
results type and then we have another
crunch that just works with unsigned
long long integer types again so the key
here is to look at this call to crunched
n using those resolution rules I
mentioned earlier first it looks for an
exact match there's no exact match so it
considers templates now when it tries to
plug that call into this template it
immediately runs into a problem the type
T is int int it doesn't have a nested
result type that's illegal
but instead of getting an error you get
the compiler saying okay that's won't
work and moves on to some other template
and it keeps looking that's SGA it's not
necessarily an error unless it never
finds a match and then the error is
there's no match it's not necessarily
the error is here in this particular
piece of code all right so that's as
feigning and the library component that
will leverage this is called enable
so this is a little meta programming
component that's used to turn code on or
off based on some compile time logical
condition the basic structure is enable
if some boolean compile time expression
because it's a template parameter and
then a type if the boolean expression
evaluates at compile time to true then
this whole thing evaluates to this type
and if it's false then something
interesting happens this turns into bad
code on purpose that becomes an illegal
construct and it basically causes any
piece of code in which disappears to
become illegal and to disappear from the
face of the compilation which is what
you actually want so let's see how this
will work so applying this to our crunch
example earlier now I have to crunch
function templates and I want the top
one to be enabled for type T's that are
our what am I looking for here class
types that's all I'm just checking for a
class type if the class type doesn't
happen to have a process member function
we'll get an error but just to keep this
simple I'm saying if it's a class then I
want to enable this thing and notice
where the enable if appears it's part of
the return type declaration so that's
one of the two ways it can be used and I
wanted to show you both so this is one
of them and when crunch is called with
some parameter that's not a class type
this will not be considered for overload
resolution the other one will and by
rather than doing not class type I just
chose is integral so this one is enabled
for any integral type of T which is kind
of the effect we've wanted all along
where I wanted to work for longs on
signs etc and so examples of calls
processing with ten or with a short will
use the integral version oops sorry
actually I don't have code that example
that shows an example of that this is
actually a simpler example this is just
a single processing function which I
only want to enable for integers so I do
that by using the enable if as part of a
second parameter declaration that I
default initialize to zero and clients
never actually use this parameter it's
just there
to either cause the function to be legal
or illegal at compile time so when I
instantiate with any integral type this
thing ends up producing that integral
type enabling this piece of code and the
function exists if it's not an integral
type then this code is rendered illegal
and it won't compile so we get an error
when we try to pass a double or a
pointer but it works fine with an
integer or a short and here's the actual
implementation of enable if just just
showing it because I find it interesting
the primary template is an empty class
and that's why any attempt to take call
and call and type on that is gonna yield
a syntax error there's nothing in there
and there's a specialization for when
the first temporal parameter is true
which actually does put that type in
there so you can select it and makes the
code legal so that's it this was
inspired by an item in Scotts effective
modern C++ course and book I having to
teach the course as well and I just
thought I would share that because I
thought it was cool thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
