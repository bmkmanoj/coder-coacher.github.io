compile time and contract checking and
generally using C++ this type system to
provide interesting guarantees in this
case around pointer no ability second
outline background what we did how we
did it and then some of the lessons
we've learned so hi I'm Jacob I'm on the
pot comes in libraries team at Dropbox I
actually come from an embedded systems
background I've been at Dropbox since
2012 and that's pretty much when I
started getting heavily into 2012
they're heavily into c plus plus I've
been involved in most of our
cross-platform mobile efforts like sync
data stores more recently carousel and
I'm also the maintainer of Jeannie which
we gave a talk on yesterday so in the
past I've been deep down in the trenches
of embedded systems and such but more
recently moving into larger scale stuff
so some background first of all and
motivation on what we're trying to do
here one of the interesting things about
C++ is that there is a lot of
flexibility in what your program means
so consider this line here f open friend
x + y z well what does that mean right
so first of all f could be a function
with a bunch of overloads it might be a
template we might be doing try
production operator + itself might be
overloaded it might be doing a complex
addition or contaminating strings or
something even more deeply there might
be a dl if f is not in this namespace f
might be a type in which case this
probably doesn't do what you wanted to
do it all makes a temporary and throws
it away we've had bugs around that also
the parameter on the left is an r-value
and the parameter on the right is an
lvalue which may also affect what gets
called so c++ is very customizable and
sometimes that's a curse I've heard of
people with C++ environments with rules
like you know templates but that's
basically throwing the baby out with the
bathwater right you can do extremely
powerful things to make your code
cleaner and better and simpler with
by customizing what your types are and
what exactly primitive operations on
them do and I think unique pointer and
shared pointer are the best current
example of that all right when you have
a shared pointer and you copy it you
actually increment a ref count and
that's great I've converted code that
manually caught manually called in crap
and Dec RAF to use shared wider and it
was amazing it shrinks by like a third
and we find bugs that were there that we
never noticed because if you know you
pulled out the flash drive here we never
closed the yada so you have this ability
in C++ to customize what you can do and
what you can't do also with unique
fighter you can't copy a unique pointer
you just can't so no well null hitter
it's a little bit easier to deal with
now there are quite as many horrible
problems but the null sucks and it can
creep into your program in various ways
can anyone tell me what is wrong with
this line of code well the compiler can
potentially assume that because you have
this this is not null and it will
exactly optimizing right it's it's
perfectly reasonable to write this and
your compiler will go oh well this is
always true or you know converts to true
so I'm just going to get rid of it it
might warn you about the fact that it's
removed or redundant comparison the
problem is that by the time you're
hoping that you're a certain this will
trip the world has already ended demons
are already flying out of your nose it's
too late it's just too late and there's
a similar problem with references
usually references mean this isn't no
but if they are then too bad so null is
a pain we can use our type system to
enforce contracts an example of a
contract a unique pointer that we
enforce with the type system is you
can't copy this you can only have one
unique pointer that points to this thing
so we can use the type system to check
our null as well
one of the the principles that I've been
trying to follow is we want to catch
problems with code as early as possible
right there's this whole sequence of
things between when you write a line of
code that doesn't work or doesn't work
sometimes and when it actually blows up
the best thing is for if you're using an
IE that does this a little red squiggly
line to show up and the worst thing is
it makes it to production and causes
undefined behavior and your name is in
the news or there's a CTE or or slightly
less bad you get a bunch of crash
reports from your users and so the
faster you can catch things the better
this is one of the key differences
between what we're doing and then not
know in gso let's talk about monday
tuesday we want to move this all the way
forward not just a few steps not just to
asserts not just to static analyzer
which maybe you run every time you build
your program but probably not let's put
it in the type system in the compiler so
enough about the problem that we're
trying to solve which is no happens and
we don't want it to here's well first of
all here's what we're not doing we
haven't built a non malleable pointer
that just a search on dereference or on
construction that's pretty easy to track
down we can do better we're also not
interested in annotations because an
annotation that isn't part of the type
system can very easily get lost I've
written this type a couple times and it
does not do what I want it to do this is
syntactically valid it's fine you can
make a student function with a no except
annotated function parameter it has
absolutely no effect it's exactly the
same type as de function void because no
except one of its many problems is that
it's not actually part of the type it's
part of the head of a function it's not
part of the type of a function pointer
so for null ability clang added null
ability annotations mainly for
objective-c and Swift and they're kind
of nice they will detect hey you're
passing a literal and ull or n ull PTR
to
function call that's nice but I can say
whatever star x equals no f of X we can
do better so here's what we built it's
on github it is a rapper type called NM
which is like tea and it behaves like
tea in as many ways as I could possibly
get it to do so except it can't be
default constructed the way you get an n
NT is either by writing an explicit null
check when we have macros for that that
either assert or throw or take your pick
you can write your own or by having
something that's not null from the
beginning when we found when we started
using this in our code base that a lot
of times a given point herb yet a member
or something that's being passed no call
backs etc there's just no way that this
ever could have been no we don't ever
come from a nullable pointer so we have
an NN make unique top it threads all the
way down through the type is annotated
everywhere and it means that every time
I write this type I know what that
annotation is it's not though nnn can
implicitly or explicitly convert the
underlying type we can compare it we can
hash it we can stream it choose to there
if we want some debugging and it also
has the implicit and explicit
constructors that match the implicit or
explicit pneus of the type that rafter
at it so this is sort of a whirlwind
tour of making a type that's almost like
this other thing it's of not quite so
here's the constructor event n we put in
so I promise I checked for an ulti is
just an empty struct it's a tag the idea
is you can't write this by accident but
we provide you say ok I I solemnly swear
I checked this for null and it's not
enough or I'm relying on the contract of
make unique or such and then we also
have helpers make unique make shared
check a search check throw that do
whatever check and let me try to use n
and make unique r in and make sure we
don't use the assert and throw things
nearly as much as we thought we would
so let's say I have a function it takes
a non null pointer I have a nullable
quicker okay well I wish I didn't but I
can write that explicit and in a cert
and the right thing will happen this is
actually a macro that expands to a
lambda that has an assert inside it and
then does a return we also have a type
converting constructor which basically
says and then behaves like the
underlying type when passed a non
malleable version of the underlying type
this means that implicit up casts for
example work we had both shared pointer
and unique pointer and also wrap lighter
we also have an explicit constructor
which has to be enable lift only if the
other constructor isn't allowed
otherwise it would be ambiguous and so
this lets us take a nominal annotated
raw pointer and explicitly handed over
to a unique quiter we don't do that very
often but if you want to you can when
trying to build this the goal was
completeness then finally there are all
the things that you cannot do with a
non-null butter for one thing you can't
convert it to bull because if you think
you want to do that then you're confused
in our test harness we actually wound up
writing a truth a helper function that
does let you that does return true for a
nominal type and operator boo for a
nullable type because sometimes in
generic code that's useful more often
than not this helped us find dead code
where we annotated something as not know
because we were pretty sure it was
supposed to be non-null and then found
that someone in some cases it with me
had written just to be sure you know if
this is no return doll or if this is
null throw an error and deleting this
operator will let us in the type system
find that dead code obviously you can't
construct this from a null pointer t one
nice thing is the compiler if it finds
an explicitly deleted constructor you
and both GCC and klein do this will
print out the entire
containing that constructor and so we
have a comment at the end saying very
specifically you can't do this without
that explicitly deleted constructor this
would be hid exactly the same but you
would get a page of confusing well we
couldn't find a constructor these are
all the ones we considered output and
then finally a constructor from the
nullable version of the type and for an
assignment operator from the noble
version of the type that says hey you
might want to use one of these macros
they actually put the names of the
macros in the comment but that would
write off the end of the slide past that
it just works you have an implicit cast
we have an explicit as nullable operator
and you can use operator star operator
arrow that just forwards on so an
honorable pointer behaves just like a
nullable pointer in every way we could
possibly think of Shazam okay real life
gets in the way it actually doesn't just
work and we run into a number of bugs in
tool chains and compilers first of all
sea lion I'm not trying to dunk on sea
lion here parsing C++ is really hard but
it got confused by what we did with
deckle type it also got confused by
trailing return type for some reason so
we wrote a little trait as a workaround
we wanted nn to work with raw pointers
this is not a non-volatile version of
sharepoint area it's a non-mobile
wrapper around whatever i haven't tried
it withstood function but it might work
or exception fighter might just work so
we heard a trait to get the underlying
thing we also found a clang bug if there
are any client people in the room please
fix this it stinks if you have a
nullable shared pointer and you try to
assign it from an r-value naam na level
pointer clang can't decide whether it
should implicitly convert to an r-value
and then use the r-value constructor or
implicitly convert to an lvalue and use
L value constructor I think this is a
client by the GCC and msvc degree
um but that's one of the reasons why we
added the as new level helper was to
have a workaround it turned out there
were a few other cases where for clarity
it's really nice to be clear this was
not nullable but I'm taking the nullable
version because I might want nulls later
on so I can write that in the code so we
added that and things work better and so
we built this probably a year ago we
started incorporating it into the
codebase slowly mostly because it was an
experimental thing we wanted to see if
it actually one helped and two was
usable more recently we added support to
Jeanne or coach n so that the interface
is that it generates will also have
annotations and we found that it helps a
lot every time we and then convert a
swath of code there's some little bug or
there's some little piece of dead code
that can't actually have been there
there's some place that would have maybe
probably didn't caught by the assert
this that doesn't actually work we had
to do some restructuring there are bits
of the c++ standard library that very
deeply assumed that anything can be
default constructed usually that's a
good thing this kind of messes with it
unfortunately most things do have a
sensible default constructor right it
makes sense to default I can construct a
string you get an empty string make
sense to default construct a map again
maybe not stood map instead unordered
map square bracket operator require that
your thing be default instructable
nothing else in map does but if you want
to use square bracket it will construct
it if it's not already there so we did
have a few places where we had maps from
something to nom malleable whiter and
that was fine we just changed them to
not use operator square bracket equals
and instead do a place or what other
else the other interesting interaction
is with move semantics there is as far
as i can tell still debate over what
exactly are you allowed to do with a
move from object right should you
should be wrong to touch it all should
it be well-defined and that really
doesn't work with nonno so yes the
emperor has no clothes and not null
pointer is know if it's been moved from
I think this is a case that sort of
shows that move from objects should be
considered dangerous you can't do
anything with them we should have robust
tooling around that I would love it if
all the major compilers yelled loudly if
I tried to use a move from object maybe
someday that would help that would make
me feel much better about having this
there right now it's sort of it's a hole
but I think that's resolvable if we have
this is sort of the one place where this
does depend on static checking until we
can get in the language some sort of
move from detection which probably isn't
happen stood move is dangerous though
and then finally integration so we work
across three different languages see
floss floss Objective C Java objective c
and java have had some level of null
annotation for quite some time its
advisory java has lest i looked three or
four different sets of annotations that
you get to pick from standards that's
the wonderful thing so Jeanne if you're
familiar with it generates code based on
an ideal in C++ Java Objective C now
python and gives you translation between
them so we spit out the null ability
annotations for an interface whether
it's optional or not there is some
future stuff that we found that we would
really like to be able to do the biggest
one is implicit casting and I was
relieved to see that this is a problem
that gsl is not null hasn't solved here
right now we can't just say please
replace all of them make shared in your
code with NN make shared because if you
have for example a function that returns
a draw or return to base there's a
pointer to a base and at the very end
your right return make shared
derived whatever then that works great
there's an implicit cast from shared
pointer to derive dr. sherry pointer to
base but if we replace that with an
index shared then you will get an NN
shared pointer to drive or and I'm sure
pointer to derive which could implicitly
cast to a knowable shared pointer to
derived or a nominal share pointer to
base but you don't get to implicit casts
in one so it fails I started working on
this I think it's also blocked by the
same compiler bug because it involves a
very scary implicit conversion or
implicit conversion operator convert to
t-50 has these properties on it so maybe
someday and then the other future
direction that we might be able to go
with this is integrating with or
overlapping with or interacting with
static analysis tools like DSL the
question is can there be common ground
here so that's what I've got next up any
questions yep yeah so not know is
implicitly constructible from a null
pointer and our NN is not you have to
actually write out and go back to the
devil slide easily what we do is require
that you be explicit about your
boundaries between this is a nullable
thing and after this plank it can't be
known with gsl that's written down in
the type but it's not written down at
the call site which has its pluses and
minuses I think it's probably easier to
adopt gsl is not null because you can do
it piecemeal much more easily it's much
more like a precondition check than a
type change
and so here by putting it in the type we
move we make it so that you have to
express this malleability guarantee all
the way through you know magically go
from one to the other that's the main
difference all the invariance of the
type that they were originally yep why
did you decide to violate that invariant
so we don't really have an option if we
could make a if we didn't violate down
in burien we could still work with
shared winder there would be an
efficiency hit because we would have to
keep the reference until the move from
thing disappears unique pointer would be
hopeless so it's a trade-off between
making this usable versus keeping the
invariant for a situation that hopefully
won't arise so the analysis I want to
see is is there ever any cut death we're
in an object can be moved constructed
from which is sort of subtle because the
move from is actually some other
constructor taking it as an hour value
so the semantics we have to be boiled
down clearly but can't object be
modified in some way by the assumption
that it's moved from and at any point
after that do we do anything to that
object except for destruct it or
assigned to it so that's sort of a
dataflow thing I haven't put enough
thought into it you know precisely what
the rules would have to be but it seems
pretty good
yeah that's sea lion also does it since
EDT I don't know the workaround is not
that bad so they just get it and we've
done we've checked GCC and clang we
mostly use GCC and clang and I've done
some looks at the generated code because
it's so this n n check assert it is a
lambda that we constructed that
immediately call so it's all very local
and goes away I haven't looked at
whether and what mscc produces for this
or any other compilers I know msvc is
happy to come pilot but I haven't
confirmed that it it optimizes away how
easy was it for the research team
members how prevalent is it so it got a
lot more prevalent it started overnight
when we landed the genie change that was
the hardest part before that it was a
slow growth people picked it up he will
liked having the extra guarantee and the
extra safety but adding it to an
existing code babies it's the sort of
thing that happened slowly but it was
not that there were no big fights over
whether we should do it or not it was
just sort of a slow hey let's write this
but the genie change let us and required
us to do a simultaneous refactor of all
of our implementations of Jeannie
classes that was cookie that was the
biggest driver in me wanting to have an
implicit up cast from NN derives to null
base yes I'd do that then we could just
change all of the making a stand in
mechanics and a lot of code wouldn't
have to change
too so that's all
