Minnesota you gave the keynote about
quantum computing which was really
interesting because we're talking about
bits that can be 0 and 1 simultaneously
so we were talking about what you can do
with that so first of all how do you
have a bit that is 1 and 0 at the same
time so that's a very strange thing
about quantum physics so the quantum
physics has these weird predictions so
sometimes something can be two different
places at the same times you could be
sitting here and you can be at home
having breakfast all at the same time
and quantum physics is actually possible
and with little atoms you can actually
really observe this you can actually see
that that happens and so what we are
doing now is trying to change these very
strange quantum effects to build a new
type of technology quantum computers and
it's very hard to kind of intuitively
see but it actually really happens and
what we do now is to make use of these
quantum effects in order to to really
make this technology happen ok so you
need to look at the awesome level and in
conventional computing you you have the
constraint of Moore's law which he said
to me is ultimately constrained by
design how small can a transistor really
that's that's the question and it can't
be smaller than individual atoms and so
and so that's where kind of wars law
more or less rule and when he just can't
make things small anymore so if this
mostly I'm trying to defend this to them
as you've gathered struggling to craft
quantum parallelism you could be looking
at harnessing this theoretical proxy of
AB something being in simultaneous
States so in parallel universes
that's right ok so we have a constraint
of conventional computer chips on which
ultimately comes down to how small can
you build a transition and then you have
your lasers and your electric field now
right now with atoms
trying to
you harness the effective and acin being
simultaneously in multiple places and
turn that into a computer process that's
right as I design as I sew so quantum
computers are very very strange beasts
they are used machines there's nothing
to do with a conventional computer so
quantum computers allow you to make use
of these colors legs how do we do that
we take individual atoms actually charge
at in Sakhalin ions and you hold them in
free space using spinning electric
fields and now these electric fields and
whole levitate these atoms above a
microchip and now traditionally people
use laser beams to implement quantum
gates and the same as classical gates
using transistors core engage people
traditionally use laser beams now if you
wanted to go to billions of quantum bits
that means you need billions of periods
of laser beams all aligned with the
accuracy with other hundreds of a
millimeter now imagine the engineering
required to achieve that kind of thing
so what we until recently the University
of Sussex has invented a new method we
can take away with all the lasers you
previously need it's Clemente's quantum
gates and instead apply voltages for
quantum microchip in order to implement
these is column gates and because of
that because we simplified this nine
insects or why I think it's fair to say
that nowadays if there's a real
perspective to build a large-scale
quantum computer doesn't make it easy
but it's it's not possible
if inside the smallest step as I the
most important step we simplified we
took there the hardest thing I would in
my opinion one of the hardest things we
took out of required engineering and
replace' which with something which is
inherently much much simpler so now you
have your step closer to building your
large-scale quantum computing what can
you do with them what they what do they
allow you the conventional computing
doesn't so don't think of quantum
computers as fast computers think of
quantum computers as a very very
disruptive to college
technology which can do certain things
you could never dream of before so you
could do things there even the fastest
supercomputer in the world right now may
take billions of years to calculate a
certain problem a quantum computer could
actually calculate it maybe in a day or
a few weeks so this is this is why this
is so fundamentally different a quantum
computer won't replace conventional
computers for all the problems there's
only you have to write quantum
algorithms first so in order to solve a
problem with a quantum computer you need
the right first the appropriate quantum
algorithm to do so so there's already a
quite a number of very very interesting
quantum algorithm out there and today
allow us to add applications from the
financial sector over a whole variety of
sectors designs but the coolest sinfully
personally is X kind of a thing
it's not the existence of eat algorithms
and now they're going to change the
world they're going to make a bit
different but but the biggest thing to
me personally is the fact that quantum
physics is the underlying theory which
predicts everything around us so whether
the conductivity of metal the color of
the sphere the process and biology
chemica reckons that that's the theory
which we succeed can explain all of
these things what a quantum computer can
do it it actually can properly so these
equations solve these problems and by
doing so it's going to completely change
signs the way we solve problems and only
that's obviously the most exciting thing
because they'll be able to do certain
things you could never even dream of
doing before so one thing that I thought
was really interesting that we talked
about earlier was us talking about the
games going back to those basic units
from from the possibilities in the
financial sector background purposes
chip so once the better words of content
chip so I find it really interesting Lee
said you can have if you have two bit
one bit you can be doing one
simultaneously and with two bits you can
be 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 0 it's so
good so do you have a kind of
exponential computing power or just it
is if the level of run
no it's an exponential computing talk
for certain problems so you have to
write an algorithm and then each
algorithm will provide a certain speed
up and so fundamentally I mean let's
start by explaining first how quantum
computer works on a very basic level
because I'm not gonna immediately just
twelve right into the physicalities
converter and soon see as you said like
in in in a classic computer you have two
bits which can we have to pick one
number and you write it in there so for
example 0 1 now quantum computer into
quantum bits you can write in 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 or 2 more Danish Lee now that
scales 2 to the power of n so with a
hundred hundred quantum bits you can
encode sorry hundred classical bits you
can encode 100 the number one number
yeah with with with 100 corner bits you
can encode so many numbers I can
actually not say that number such a big
number I can have a huge number it goes
through to the power of the number of
bits so many numbers you can encode in
the corner memory so that's that's why
like one computer is fundamentally
different to a creative computer now you
need to use that ability to make some
kind of quantum algorithm with it and
and the key thing about all the quantum
computer is that the scaling things is
how long a problem set takes to solve
right let's factorize 9 yeah we both can
factorize 9 it's free times vary right
you know that's not very hard if I were
to give you a large number then not even
the fastest supercomputer in the world
could factorize that large number that's
why your credit card details are safe
when you put them on the internet
because that's the principle of RSA
encoding that's difficulty effect
arising a large number makes your credit
card details safe when you encrypt them
now a quantum computer because it's that
they it scales differently how long it
takes to factorize a large number now
suddenly a quantum computer can just
write that and that's in a way the
amazing thing about a conical future and
and even more so it it doesn't even need
a fast clock speed you know the clock
speed of a quantum computer might be
three or four orders of magnitude slower
and of a classical computer nevertheless
it can do things
a conventional computer may take
billions of years to calculate hello
well that's really exciting I the first
thing what you do next
yes absolutely will be fun time so we'll
now in the next two years we are
constructing a prototype which is based
on a construction plan you recently
published so that there was a very first
time somebody said with current
technology we can now build a logical
new computer and we've published this
and people are very excited about this
but now we need to actually shout it
works reloading a prototype and we do
that the next two years and beyond that
we actually going to build a large-scale
quantum computer so this is going to be
a huge machine and we'll need industry
partners for that and and you're looking
right now for the right people that's
going to be a really exciting time
because then we like should be able to
solve some of the most interesting
problems or not on the consistent where
again it's make it do it makes it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
