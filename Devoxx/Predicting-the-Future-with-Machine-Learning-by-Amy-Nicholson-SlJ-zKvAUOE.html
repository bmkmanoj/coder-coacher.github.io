Evangelist at Microsoft and I earlier on
this year I spoke at DevOps UK it was a
wicked event I really really enjoyed
being there so actually they invited me
along to speak in Belgium now so
absolutely lovely country never been
before so thank you for inviting me and
today I want to talk a bit about I've
got quite a wide title here predicting
the future with machine learning
basically I once thought to you about
how machine learning is now available to
sort of all of us and how you guys can
literally leave this room and start
building your own machine learning
models there's less of a barrier to
entry there's less of you know having to
have all the infrastructure and stuff
like that so it's a really exciting time
for machine learning so so this this is
machine learning over here this is
machine learning and this is actually
called the hebbian rule it's a linear
model it's used in neural networks some
of your looking a bit concerned am I in
the right talk right now is this
actually what I want to do don't worry
I'm not gonna talk through this what I
am gonna taught some machine then is
like this so he can handle that equation
we're all good so basically what what do
I think machine then is well I think
it's where computing systems become
smarter with experience so experience
let's let's break that down a little bit
so past a surplus human input we have so
much data now we have data you know we
have web blogs we have social data we
have data from customers we have data
from devices we have data from so many
different places can't are we actually
using that data properly are we using it
to its full advantage and is it
completely efficient the way we're maybe
doing it so again we have loads and
loads of data from the past that we can
actually start to you know use for the
future and then the humanum it's sorry I
didn't realize that's kind of white
sweater things over there I human input
what do I mean by human input that's
kind of the machine learning part I
think two forms we can have supervised
machine learning you guys some of you
guys in the room might have heard of
that
it's a supervised machine learning is
where
we're involved so I might say okay I
have some past data and I have I have
the right answer I know what happened
when that line of data happened so for
example flight delays I mean doing some
work with flight delays have pulled
together flight data and weather data
and I've been able to say you kind of
okay can I predict whether a flight in
the future is going to be delayed and it
might depend on how visible it is
outside and might depend on the wind
speed
it might also depend on the carrier
which is a 1 so you know who you flying
with maybe that makes a difference so
having that answer that true-true ounce
of what happened in the past can start
it you can pass that data into the
Machine and actually get to see what
might happen in the future the the
second form of human input is called
unsupervised learning so the opposite
and we're not involved in some sensors
and the machine then now then kind of
takes pieces of data it looks at them
and it goes ok and erst and that piece
ok and it takes another piece of data
and it takes another piece of data and
actually that's when we can say it
starts to tweak itself so each algorithm
probably has many many different
variables many things it can change and
actually it starts to tweak itself so
that's that's really good
but I think sometimes the best way to
talk about machine then exactly through
examples because this stuff is is there
now machine learning is kind of come
across as a big talking point at the
moment and everyone's like all you know
what do we do machine learning and then
there's the whole kind of dark side of
machine learning as well that people are
discussing but actually this kind of
stuff has been is already built in
systems and so I've got a kind of
explosive icon here at predictive
maintenance is an exciting one we've had
lots of customers I've spoke to that
have wanted to start to be proactive
around maintenance rather than reactive
so we worked with a lift company they
have they've sort of put devices and
sensors on all of their lifts all over
the world have got absolutely millions
of them and what they've been able to do
is actually get lots of data from those
lifts and they've started to actually be
able to predict when things are going to
break
so they can have the right person at the
right time with the right part in the
right place I mean that that works for
everyone that works for the business
they're not losing money they're not
putting people in the wrong place
I mean how annoying is it when you go
you know you have something broken at
home and then someone you get a handyman
around and they go oh yeah that's broken
yeah yeah no that's why I called you
here and watch it and then they go oh
you know it's gonna be a week until I
can get that next part
no no more what if we can start to
predict what's going to go wrong so the
person can just come and fix it
straightaway so predictive maintenance
an exciting one another one where
everyone in this room has I thought I
was gonna be affected by this actually
in the last few days at credit card
fraud so when you go abroad and maybe
you're not using your card as you
normally do so you know I'm normally in
around London so in the UK so I'm tend
to spend in there I'm drinking coffee a
lot still or shopping get a lot of
trains so you know that's my usual
pattern so they're taking my pieces of
data and they're starting to build a
model around how I spend my money and
actually then when they see something
that's not quite right it's kind of like
a little red flag in the air and they go
something is a bit unusual here this
might be someone else using her card we
should flag it so that's kind of credit
card fraud that's how it works with
machine then and behind it and and again
this is you know this is used by pretty
much everyone's banks and it's been
quite a while since this has been put in
place so again not new stuff necessarily
wait a wavy hands I found it really hard
to find a symbol for this one so bear
with me but the the wavy hands there was
a really interesting project that
Microsoft Research did recently around
using a Microsoft Kinect sensor which is
based around machine learn in any way to
understand where different parts of your
body are and actually they were able to
have someone come up to the camera and
actually do sign language in front of it
and then the computer was able to
interpret exactly what the person who
was signing was saying and this kind of
computer vision speech-to-text kind of
thing but with sign language so it was
really exciting because they were able
to see all the different we have really
complex hands
showed me I was like wow we do don't we
who knew but and yeah so you know we we
have complex hands that they're really
understanding how we're moving them how
we're twisting them how we're pointed
and ever and people have different hands
as well I mean I have really really thin
fingers I've really long nails so
actually that my hand might look
different to one of your hands so so
that was a really really exciting part
okay so a little recommender basket this
one's throwing my favorite one so I they
get me every time with this so you you
buy something online you put it in your
shopping basket and then basically
forever in a day you're gonna be
recommended something that goes with
that item you buy one thing and you'll
be recommended you will be emailed they
will send you discounts and everything
that's a recommendation so basically
they're saying you've got I know I
bought four so I got my phone and then
actually they they recommended me a
phone case so I was like yeah I need a
phone case it's actually cracked and but
yeah so they were camilia throw case if
you buy a laptop they'll recommend you a
laptop bag if I buy one dress they
recommend me exactly the same dress but
in a different color probably which I
did buy in the ends so it exciting stuff
recommendation the engines are built
into your favorite search engine to your
favorite online shopping sites but if
you guys have a website and maybe you
have an e-commerce one maybe you want to
implement that kind of stuff why why is
it just big business so it should be
allowed the other to use this and but I
wanted to point out is out machine
learning it's not a right answer it's
not something that is a true north and
it's it's a probability it's something
that we're saying oh I'm trying to point
you in the right direction in some
senses so sometimes it can go a little
bit wrong so um has anyone has anyone
got like a home automation system you
can turn your heating up and down with
it from your smartphone if we got pop
some hands up if we've got some yeah
okay yeah you guys are really good
sometimes there's like no one I'm not
off button so a home automation system
and
those people with their hands up can you
tell me how many of you bought a 76
centimeter inflatable dinosaur with it
and fear of an odd one so but this is a
guy in my team and he was like hey I
wanna get on these hive home automation
systems I think it'd be really cool and
then he sent me this email saying I'm
not sure they've got this quite right
what ever heard they got this this
dinosaur from and but basically someone
out there has buzz bought this
combination and and maybe there's a bit
of a data scheme maybe they didn't have
that much data at the time machine
learning can start with a very very
small amount of data and it can give you
some some unusual answers but then over
time as you add data to it you can
actually start to really get to the
really pinpointed decisions and you know
maybe in the in the future that maybe
actually if I went back now I bet this
wouldn't happen so that's the thing it's
a time thing and but yeah that's yeah
that's very funny
but yeah so I kind of said this stuff
already there we've got loads of
examples of it but why is it now that
we're getting sort of excited in
industry about it what why does why is
this room so full it's very good asking
I'm really glad you're here though but
the exciting thing is this is no longer
in research this is no longer just for
big business and personally I think it's
down to three things that are kind of up
here so first one the cloud cloud
computing has allowed us to borrow
compute and borrow storage and borrow
certain new services that maybe some
other vendors have built and and
actually start to you know build some
really cool stuff without having the
initial investment on infrastructure and
okay how am I going to sort out all my
different pieces of data how am I going
to partition my data how long the shard
it and it all gets really confusing and
actually all you want to do is develop
cool applications you want to be
creative and actually sometimes that
initial barrier of all the sets up kind
of puts you down a little bit and maybe
it it squashes you know creativity and
and I think that's something now that
there can be you know really
it's out of its bubble and the second
one is I've kind of got like a little
RSS feed this is the data again this is
the kind of the data I talked about
earlier we have loads of data we moved
it everywhere and it's kind of it's
interesting how much social data's
coming up right now but also you know
things that I'm that I may be wearing
things that are in my phone things that
are on my laptop things that I carry
around with me everyday are now
producing data and and we with all of
this data we can start to learn patterns
so there was a time when we didn't have
enough data to do machine learning there
was a time when we didn't have enough
compute to do machine then and and there
was attack and actually these things on
our that people use the word inflection
point yeah so things are coming together
at the right time and that's making it
more available for everyone and then
finally the last one kind of agile being
agile being creative and being able to
develop quickly you know not not having
to say okay this is now gonna be a
three-month project to make one initial
proof of concept and and that kind of
thing you know how about we do it in a
day how about we have a two-day
hackathon with the team and we start to
build something that may be small now
but actually could become a lot more
than that that's the kind of thing I'd
like to I like to think machine learn is
becoming why how can we build quick
models how can we build sort of test
cases and say can we find something
useful from our data so yeah I think
Moschino here now so and what what what
do we offer I think as might as part of
Microsoft we offer something that's
quite exciting and we have first
something called Azure machine learning
it's it's completely in a modern web
browser there's no heavy downloads onto
your system there's no there's nothing
like that it all sits in the cloud and
you can pull data in from various
different places once you have your data
there you can actually access working
and in an IDE logistics in your web
browser any modern web browser that
supports html5 and stuff can actually
start to run this stuff
and you build it in there also you're
borrowing again like I said that compute
in that storage so you know you're
paying pence you're paying like nothing
for it it's a really exciting service
and so being able to use there's like a
click-and-drag I'm going to show you a
really cool down though but and there's
a click and drag option it's very it's
less about the code and more about okay
how is our data moving through this
model how can we build something pretty
quickly with you know an interesting
machine learning if someone said to me
okay could this would be quite dangerous
in the wrong hands and I was like
dangerous there's a bit of a strong word
but and I think an interest in machine
learning an interest to look up all
those different meanings and these
different phrases that come up is enough
that's that's enough to kind of get you
to build a model and maybe you know get
a get a few consultation hours with the
data scientists and actually start to
build some really interesting stuff
around your data one of the most
exciting parts and when I talk to people
this is absolutely the key part of this
is if it's actually when you build a
model you create a web service so we
build a model and we do something called
publishing it and actually it just
creates a web service for you you don't
build it you don't write it you don't
throw it the documentation for it does
it all itself but I think actually the
the exciting part of that is if it's a
web service you're simply calling an
HTTP request and you can do that in most
languages so this makes it totally open
there's less barriers to say oh well you
don't program in this language and I
don't use this IDE and like it's not
about that it's kind of like okay I've
built this really cool model and now
it's in a web service so I can just send
a piece of data via HTTP request and
pull a piece of data back and get some
intelligence so you know that that's
kind of exciting and again on the sort
of client side what can we say there
well again if it's in a web browser if
it's in an application if it's a web
service we can call it from any device
we can call it from any operating system
and actually that's that's a really
exciting part of it so
so I wanted to talk a little bit about
actually I didn't even ask her how rude
and if we got any sort of people who are
really into machine then and working
with it and what pop your hands what
maybe-date scientists call a couple a
couple of you yeah and welcome nice to
meet you but yeah it's it's quite
interesting I was talking a little bit
through the machine there in process
model because I put in the abstract you
didn't need to know anything about
machine learning before this talk so I
oh I personally think you start with an
idea
lots of people maybe try and start with
a dataset not the best idea if you start
with an idea you start with a question
that you think is gonna be useful for
your application or a question that will
be useful for your customers or a
question that were useful for your
business and then actually go from there
so can I predict slight delays will a
flight be delayed or not I'm asking a
specific question so then I get my data
together so I go hat what will be useful
for that I'm gonna need the flight data
I think the weather effects loads of
things actually every loads of customers
I speak to it like I think we should
pull in the weather data and and
actually that's when you go okay let's
pull this data room we've got an idea
I'm gonna pull some data in and now I
think there's almost a need for the
business knowledge as well and there's
many times that you're you can create a
model and and then at the end you kind
of go is this is this really that useful
and and if it is that's that's great but
sometimes it's like oh yeah it tells us
something but how can we act on that so
actually having the business knowledge
to say this this question here that
you've proposed it's far more important
than this question over here so if we
can get back to work that'll make loads
of difference so that business knowledge
is key and the data understanding as you
sort of get to know the data sets and
the problem and the question you'll
you'll understand your dates and more
probably as well and you'll end up sort
of going oh I didn't even realize that
within that date is that oh oh I didn't
realize and these things correlate it's
so closely I didn't they affected each
other so much and we tend to have a
human bias sometimes I'm actually what
affects what
which is exciting then I'm gonna I'm
gonna say it data preparation it is
though it's it's not the most exciting
part it's not the you know the nice
shiny new stuff but actually it's
totally key data preparation some people
say oh it's like 70 or 80 percent of
your project to spent like preparing
your data into the right formats and
it's probably true
but actually getting it into the right
format with sort of rows of data you're
then able to say okay it's all clean
there's no missing values my machine
then algorithm will be able to learn so
many different patterns from really rich
data and sometimes that's big data big
data what's big data and sometimes
that's lots and lots of data but
sometimes that's not as much data as
people think it is and it's actually
having that sort of pure really really
good sources of data that tell you a lot
about your problem that matter more
finally on to the exciting parts and the
modeling bit so that's a bit where you
pull in an algorithm you put your
personal data in and actually you can
start to learn stuff from it so with a
machine then algorithm which is its
Kanaka it's not it's not a raw it's kind
of it was a mathematical equation that's
what it is there's a mathematical
equation kind of thing going on over
here and actually you pull your data
into it and you say go and learn the
patterns going on all those different
patterns are in that data and see if you
can learn the question I'd like you to
answer and then finally we often sort of
keep some data back and we don't we want
to know whether it sounded good it's
kind of like a bee testing we want to
know whether our model is any good so if
we keep a little bit of data back what
we can do is start to evaluate how how
good how accurate how precise that model
is and that's always a quite an exciting
part sometimes your first one comes back
in oh my god it's literally sort of
flipping a coin in some sensors so we
need to improve it how do we improve it
and and that kind of comes around to
this this curve so we need to repeat
this cycle it's all about
experimentation and that kind of takes
me back to that agile point you know if
we're really agile if we can build these
things quickly we can experiment
we can go okay that didn't quite work
but what if we did this okay let's
quickly do that okay that was a bit
better what if we do this now well if we
swap different bits out and we can start
to you know improve our model you know
that that's this kind of agile idea and
finally to publish I mentioned the web
service slightly that's that part really
previously you might have had it's kind
of like this DevOps scenario almost but
with data scientists and developers and
you have a data scientist and he's got a
huge like burning machine going on over
here and he's built something amazing I
think like an orb of intelligence and
like okay this this thing's really cool
it can like answer a really cool
question and start to put it for us and
they actually pass it they go okay don't
mind on my bit they passed it over the
fence to the sort of application
developers who already maybe have
systems in your business or already have
a website running or an application
across three different platforms and
they go oh my god what can I do with
this like it's it's so complex it's
maybe an hour and Python and actually
you've got a website or a or a java
application and you're going oh how how
do I go about doing this now
and with that kind of web service you
can go a piece of cake no problem if
you're a web service you call the HTTP
request you pop it into the applications
you already have and I think that's one
of the key things so I wanted to do a
very very quick demo just to show you
the azure machine learning studio how
you think guys can quickly get hands on
and actually start to build different
models and we're gonna I'm gonna
introduce a scenario for you oh sorry
yet very very quickly it's on github
please do go and find it there's lots
and lots of resources on there including
sort of presentations I do and documents
that you can get started with so I want
us to all be on the same page here so
I'm going to introduce the scenario and
we have this really popular dataset it's
used a lot in self image processing and
it's a whole load of letters and numbers
so all part of the data we're just going
to use the numbers from 0 to 9 and
they're all handwritten so I think
immediately people are kind of going
okay I see where this is going this is
going towards sort of like when you send
a piece of post and you know and
envelope with an address on you write it
everyone has different handwriting and
sometimes it's hard to read people's
handwriting and actually you can start
to say okay this is zero this is the one
this too let's find out the postcode
let's find out the street name and the
street number and stuff like that so to
think of it in that sense that's where
it's kind of applied so we have the four
it's a forty two thousand images but our
date has been broken down I don't have
the image data what I've put into the
studio is actually the broken down
version of it so each image is 28 by 28
pixels and that has color values from 0
to 255 and what I'm able to do is
actually have it in a row of data so
that each pixel is is in a row so you
can think in the corners of each like
image it's gonna be like a zero so but
then in the middle when it starts to see
maybe I write a number 7 differently to
how you guys are at number 7 then it
will start to understand that because
it's all in the data so each each row of
data is a story is a handwritten digit
and with that row we're going to do
something called supervised learning and
I mentioned before so we have that
answer we have that label and that
actually says okay this row of pixels is
a number two and this row of pixels is
number four so you know being able to
say this is what happened in the past
this is data from the past can I then
give it new pixels and it will tell me
what number it is
so let's if I switch over to my screen
and just open up a web browser and let's
get that too so I don't know if any of
you guys have used Microsoft Azure so
Microsoft sure is Microsoft's cloud
computing platform we have various
things from infrastructure as a service
platform your virtual machines storage
we also have some really sort of
exciting software applications so
applications that you guys can tap in
services such as machine learning that
enables you to start building inside the
web browser so machine in six is one of
the services down the left hand side and
actually you can start to create
workspaces in there so I have four
different ones including the test one
that I really need to delete but and we
I always think of a workspace as like a
folder so on your file system I don't
know if you value it as me but my
fascism is a nightmare and black tea you
have folders and you might have a folder
for a certain project or a folder for a
certain customer and then that's kind of
thing here that's going on so I have a I
have a digit recognition demo workspace
and that's where I keep all of my
experiments that relate to this digit
recognition app so if I go to my
experiments now you might have noticed
it looks fairly similar but we've
actually moved on to a new tab so we're
actually now in the Azure machine
learning studio so it's it's again in
that web browser and you can make stuff
from in here so so I've got experiments
all down the left and in Web Services it
supports our own Python so for you guys
who are day scientists if you if you
have code in our imply that maybe and
some sequel transformations that we
might you know be familiar with you can
actually bring your code if you want to
and use our compute and storage which is
exciting but I always quite like to use
what some of the modules that they
actually give you so if we just pop into
this experiment here you'll notice now
we're kind of sitting in a workspace and
I usually like product design and
there's something called Pro desktop and
reminds me like exactly of that some
people say Visio some people say all
sorts of different things but it's kind
of this idea of on the left you have all
your different sort of modules so all
these building blocks that allow you to
build machine learning algorithms and
then in the center you have a big space
where you can actually start to build it
and you connect all your different
pieces and it's quite exciting to see
that each sort of arrow is showing the
data flow through your experiment so we
start with some did
data at the top and if I right-click and
visualize that data it'll give me a
snapshot of the day so that I've got so
I mentioned to you guys we had one like
forty two thousand images and 785
columns so 784 pixels and that label I
also mentioned that the corner of the
images is all zero so that's why there's
all zeros there but if we actually look
at the label column you'll be able to
see that we have a variety not all the
same number of but a variety of
different numbers from 0 to 9 available
to us in this dataset and again this
kind of idea of rich data so if I had a
whole load of number ones it would often
predict a number one more than it would
predict anything else so being able to
have a fairly similar amount of outcomes
in your test days in your training data
sorry allows you to make a better model
so if I just close that very quickly
okay so I have how many how many modules
that I have six modules on the screen
and this makes a total machine learning
algorithm so this top I have my data I'm
actually able to search for data sets
over here so if I go to my data sets you
notice that digit data sits there and
actually if I wanted to date input
output I can actually click and drag a
reader onto the screen and then I can
start to read from different solids
storage spaces it might be from the web
it might be from a database it might be
from table storage or something like
that right actually I can start pulling
in my data from all different places but
we just uploaded a static piece of data
so sorry I think that I mentioned in the
sort of evaluation part that we we don't
always trust our algorithms so we want
to test if they're only good on that so
that split data module actually splits
it into two so you'll notice there's
sort of one arrow import and two coming
out of it if I then click on that we'll
see that there's sort of a I've just
gone split rows and I've put about 80%
of my training data 80% of my full data
sorry into the port one and then I've
put 20% of my the rest of my data into
port two and that's kind of saying okay
I want the majority of my data to pass
through the algorithm and go okay go and
learn all the different patterns in that
data so that you can predict what
numbers gonna come up and actually that
other 20% I'm kind of holding back it's
almost like a pack of it's like a game
of cards so I'm like holding my cards up
and and the machine then algorithm has
learned it something and I kind of go
okay well what have you got
so we've split our data and as I said we
passed that 80 percent to a train model
but on the other side we've actually put
in and something called a multicast
neural network now this is our algorithm
that and this I haven't like coded this
or anything and this is literally been
provided for you so if I just go down
here the machine learning and initialize
model you'll notice there's lots and
lots of different categories in here so
what I can do
is I going to classification this
problem is multi-class classification so
what what is that that is where I have
numbers 0 to 9 so that means I have 10
different buckets kind of to put these
numbers in so I look at some pixels and
I go ok that's number 2 so I put it in
number 2 book it and look at some more
pixels in it's number 8 so put that in a
number 8 book it and actually
multi-class classification means exactly
that you the machine there noggin looks
at something and it goes what is the
probability this is a number 8 and if
it's quite probable it'll go okay I'm
going to put it in that I'm gonna say
this number 8 and the neural network
part I don't know actually one of my one
of my colleagues gave me a really funny
quote he was like I think neural
networks are like unicorns I was like
sorry what and he says everyone knows
what that everyone's heard of them but
no one's ever seen one like no one knows
how they work sort of thing and I was
like actually that's a really really
good analogy because and your network
kind of comes up a lot and your network
is been designed around how our brain
works so how our neurons connect and
when they do connect they kind of
remember a pattern and they light up so
you know really really exciting
algorithm very very powerful confin'd
really deep patterns and data but
actually it takes a long run quite a
long time to train so if you have a lot
of data it take a long lot longer to
sort of process this model and so you
might want to choose all that algorithms
now I'll show you something that help
you do that but just bear with me that
this one's a good one for this problem
at the moment so and you might also
notice on the right there I've got loads
of different like numbers and fully
connected cases in my hidden layers and
well and so basically what these are
these are the parameters so you know how
I said unsupervised learning they sit
the Machine there now them starts to
move its own parameters well that's kind
of what those parameters are they have
like nodes and learning rates and in
them in other algorithms they have like
trees and that number of trees and then
really
gives and stuff like that and most
people come in they go oh my god someone
told me this was gonna be easy like
what's happened in here and actually
what's been really nice is actually
Microsoft Research do a lot of research
around these kind of machine learning
models so what they've been able to do
is actually package these models up pass
them to Azure machine learning so you
guys can use them and actually put in
some sort of default parameters that are
gonna mean that you can just run it now
it's not necessary gonna optimize for
your data but this is kind of a generic
set of parameters that going to work and
then you can start to tweak them and
there's various modules as well in the
jour machine learning studio that can do
that for you automatically based on your
data which is exciting so now we've got
we've got it we've got an algorithm and
we've got a whole load of sort of data
that's all these different images and
basically here I'm gonna say in that
train model I'm just saying okay go and
learn what that label is look at every
pixel row and tell me what the label
isn't and go and learn all those
different patterns next we want to score
the model so we just call the model it
has no properties the score model one
which is which is good and basically all
it does is sort of this simple
arithmetic so you'll have that deck of
cards kind of thing so I have my trade
my test data and I go OK for these
pixels what do you get and Machinarium
goes okay I get them four and then I go
ah you were right because I have I have
that label I was that right answer in my
test data it's it's really simple to
just go you got that one right
okay you got that one misclassified that
wasn't quite right you said number two
it's actually number eight or something
like that and then finally we do we
provide a nice little evaluate model
module that if I right-click and
visualize that it gives us some
statistics on how well we're doing and
just the I mean you guys gonna look at
hangar wall 97% accurate she's like a
machine-learning god no not quite this
is a test dataset so I like it to look
really good but no it actually did a
fairly really good job with them
the state test dataset but if we just
have a quick look at what's going on
down here this is a confusion matrix and
basically what it's telling us here is
down the diagonal we have all the right
answers so where the Machine an
algorithm put the number one in the
number one bucket and where it put the
number eight in the bright book it and
actually down that middle bit that's why
we want it to sit and actually it's got
some like you know some decent numbers
in there you're 90 yards percents and
you know okay not too bad so the
predicted class so the one that the the
algorithm said is at the top and the
actual classes are the one that I've got
in my test data is down the side but
it's quite interesting to see for
example this one here a 1.8 percent
which is one of the largest errors there
is actually where the Machine and
classifier has said it's a number six
and actually it's an illness area number
five and actually it's a number three
and so you can kind of see why that
might happen and a three and an eight do
the same thing because when you write a
three if you write it like really really
curly it might look like an eight
because you're just missing bits on the
side or maybe if you write a number nine
but you write a really really tiny
little like head on it and just a state
may be on this classify it as a number
one so you can see why it might do those
different patterns and but this this is
quite good to just sort of spot sense
check how good your algorithm is okay so
if I so we we've got a model that we've
got a model in six different modules
connected together so that's quite good
but I mentioned that we want to kind of
deploy this we want this to be usable we
want a web service I want to be able to
call this with a whole load of pixels
and it passed me back what number it is
so all I need to do now is actually
click on this train model box and say
set up as a web service and a predictive
web service so if I click that I'm gonna
do a here's one I prepared earlier
kind of think so if I go to this one
here what it actually creates is another
tabs
it's at the top now we have a trading
experiment we also have a predictive
experiment so training is where we're
kind of building the model we're
experimenting and we keep going around
and checking it's gonna get better and
in the predictive experiment we actually
sign say okay I want this now to go into
production I want this to start to
predict for me so how are we gonna do
that well you might notice it's actually
changed it slightly we've lost some
modules and we've gains them so some of
the thanks for that so we've got a web
service input and a web service output
and basically we're saying okay our user
of our application is gonna come in at
this point and actually we want them to
leave at this point so what what are
they passes as the data and what do we
get back as the user at the end so we
have our digit data still up though we
recognize that but I split modules gone
well that's because they're gonna pass
us the data so we no longer need that
bit and you might also notice the Train
model and the classifier is gone and
that's actually all now been packaged up
into this digit recognition demo module
so it kind of like merges it all
together for you automatically and says
okay you've now got a model that I've
built into a module for you that is a
multicast neural network and it's got
your data in it so that's what's so
specific about it this is actually your
model it's not generic it's not got a
generic set of data in it this is
exactly what you passed it and actually
they sit now in this trained model boxes
so if you wanted to say use this in
another experiment you can simply click
and drag it on instead of building it
all out again so it's kind of reusable
which is nice we're still gonna keep our
school model module because what we want
to do here is actually when that user
passes in the data we actually want it
to go okay here's the data here's our
algorithm put them together and give me
an answer
and actually out of the school model we
get some scored labels so that's my
algorithm saying okay this is a number
four and but we'll also get a score
probability and the probability is
saying how confident is it
number four now it could be really
really confident like nights like this
is definitely a number four I'm
absolutely certain but when you start to
air around sort of like you know in a in
a binary classification so it sort of
forty to sixty percent you might want to
go oh okay it's not too sure it's given
me a prediction but actually I might
want to intervene here so think about
scenarios where the answer really
matters health care health care the
answer is absolutely paramount you're
dealing with people and you know in
people's lives so actually when you say
from all your symptoms we could maybe
predict what what treatment you need or
what simply or
what what might be wrong with you and
actually that is really paramount that
you can't tell someone that they're ill
if they're not or you can't tell them
they have one thing if they haven't
because they'll get treatment for it so
that's where we need to intervene that's
where you know the the human sense and
we make you know decisions this kind of
machine learning is making decisions
just on data it's just making decisions
on patterns and it has kind of almost no
semantic understanding of what it's
doing now there are all machine learning
things out there that are potentially
gonna have semantic understanding and
I'll try to show you an API that might
do that so and very very quickly we've
got a project column module here and all
we're saying is I want to pass back to
the user what that number is so if it's
predicted it's number right I want to
say okay pass that back to the web
service I pass you a load of pixels I
get a number back and then you have a
web service output now that is now built
it's ready to deploy so what I was able
to do is just say deploy as a web
service and it actually creates me a web
service page that sits in Azure machine
learning studio and it gives you your
key and actually youth it also builds
you some documentation pages which
everyone can that go yeah we don't have
to write documentation so that's always
really good it gives you sort of sample
requests it gives you data endpoints
where you post this kind of stuff and
this is actually quite a bad example cuz
it has like a million different pixels
so you would like pass this from an
image but actually if I am to do
scroll all the way down to the bottom so
if we scroll all the way down to the
bottom we basically have sample code
there so some of the sample code we
provide is in c-sharp or in Python so in
case your data scientists want to kind
of have a look at it and check that you
know they can use the language that they
understand and or you can let you do is
click select sample code control coffee
pop it into your projects that you
already have an application that you've
already built and all it does basically
is give you a whole web service output
you'll notice here this is completely
personalized from my experiment here so
it's saying okay you have 0 to 784
pixels and you have a label and also
it's got scored label and score
probability the only thing you have to
remember is basically the key and four
we put abc123
this is on the web so studio does
romanette and then a whole load of sort
of long numbers but if someone was to
crack that they could take it if the key
was in here so we don't do that the key
is in the place where you have to sign
in so you can use sort of directory and
security services itself around this
stuff there's lots of options to say
okay do I want it request response so do
I want to pass one piece of data and get
one prediction back but actually if it's
sort of a lower cost scenario so you can
run a whole load of data in batch maybe
overnight you might want to do that and
you send the whole load of data and it
gives you a whole load of predictions
back so that is an end-to-end machine
learning model and that she I was able
to build it into an application now
again that this could be if you think
about it kind of anything and so this is
my phone and someone from Microsoft is
email me and so basically what we have
is lots of different app spin but
there's this guy with kind of like a
white beard down here it says the joy ml
digit recognition
so if I open this app it's built using
that example using that experiment and
what I'm able to do now is write number
two waiting for results it's call enough
to my API and it's pulling me back a
piece of data and it's just so it gets
number two so this is how it gets risky
when I'm in public I like shake a little
bit but so we're sending it off again
it's pulling us back a result and it
says number three so I mean this is kind
of trivial and everyone's going why is
the point of this but actually you can
see how this kind of thing could be
really useful if you have a website out
there maybe it's an e-commerce website
and you want to give a user some
recommendations you can build a model
you can deploy it and you can simply put
it into the application that you already
have and we've built an application
around this to sort of highlight its
features but this could have been put
anywhere there's there's no reason for
this to have to sort of build a whole
new thing and so if I just cancel that
so that was sort of building our own
classifier and so that was building our
own classifier and we want to know I
mean we've done a fairly good job there
we were learning lots different things
but there was this kind of issue around
goes in your own network which one do I
choose there was a whole list of
algorithms there and well actually look
we've read a little we're algorithm
cheat sheet so it's oh you can see it
okay that's not too bad but and it's
actually at a kms /ml cheat sheet and
you can go to this and basically it's
just kind of point you in the right
direction for the maybe the problem
you've got
so say you wanted to do well what we've
just done we had predicted three or more
categories we have tenth we had ten
categories of physics so we go into that
little blue box at the top we used a
where is it multicast in your network so
it says yeah it's super-accurate but
actually it has really long training
time so maybe that was kind of why I did
the so here's what happened earlier kind
of scenario but actually if I'd maybe
used
a multicast decision jungle it would
have been super accurate it would have a
small memory footprint and it would have
trained faster so there's all these
different things and again if you have
this kind of curiosity around machine
learn and you go and look these things
up it's really exciting to see actually
which one is useful for which so do do
check that out do have an explorer
around it if you start to use the studio
so that was all spilled in them that was
we built a digit recognition app we
don't algorithm we use the neural
network but actually this that's kind of
been done before
well the Postal Service has done that
the Postal Service is obviously got
every letter and it's able to interpret
words and it's able to learn so send
letters to the right places
automatically and that's really good
because it's efficient so if it's
already been done before maybe maybe
there's something out there that we can
call and actually Microsoft have built
some machine learning api's a suite of
them and we've called them Project
Oxford and so yes W do we got Project
Oxford
AI and I wanted to talk to you a little
bit about some of these so did anyone
see this website it was called how old
dotnet yeah really it did you put your
face into it take a selfie good stuff
and basically how old Donna is we built
it as an example when project Oxford was
launched at build which is Microsoft's
developer conference and they kind of
didn't expect it to kind of go anywhere
it's like oh we'll use it for you know
an hour and then our employees can use
it afterwards to show people and stuff
like that and actually as it does with
social media the minute it goes on
social media and someone can get
involved it starts to go out of control
and we ended up having like millions and
millions of images being put into it and
people trying to rate what their age and
gender is so that's what it does it
gives you your gender and your age there
was some exciting anomalies someone put
like a leak like a vegetable in front of
it and said can you put it my age and
gender so that's always good fun so I'm
put the Mona Lisa in front of it someone
put a picture of Jesus in front you know
there was all sorts of really really
good fun stuff and it was like okay can
it predict your age so I put my face
into it and it got me pretty spots on
actually I was very very happy so it's
I was a female if it said I was a male I
would have automatically closed it and I
wouldn't be here today and then and it's
I was 24 I'm actually 23 so that's not
too bad and I do think I look quite
young now so I was quite surprised but
it was it was good fun my my boyfriend
got heavily insulted and was I know no I
don't wanna see that again but this was
this is a success and that and then we
we wanted to show people the actual it
was really good fun to build this kind
of stuff so we had to developers in in
one the machine learning teams built
this in two days including all the
backends including lots of dashboards of
you know different devices that these
things have come from whether they'd
access via the web or the app and stuff
like that so lots of different data
which was for so we made we made many so
we made twins or not so you were able to
compare yourself to a celebrity and I
look I don't know if you guys watch it
so I didn't put it in but something
called the IT crowd you guys if you guys
watch that yeah you know yeah so you
don't the the girl in it yeah so I used
to me and my friends at uni used to get
called the IT crowd because there was me
in three lads and you can imagine which
one they thought I was so I put it in
and actually was like 40 percent so 46
percent similarity between me and her so
that's cool
so actually more recently we announced
my moustache dotnet please do go there
now and put yourself in if you have a
moustache it will rates how how good
your mustaches
if you don't have a moustache it will
you can actually get to put a mustache
on you so it says I don't have a
moustache luckily again if it said I did
have a moustache I would have closed it
and and actually I can just go okay put
him a stache on me so it's all good fun
and actually it was built around of
November so for male health awareness
and again you know a good fun technology
for good causes is always always
fabulous so so I thought I would show
you that and please do go and use my
moustache net but and the key point of
this is basically what is project
it's a project Oxford is a set of SDKs
and api's that you guys can tap into to
put intelligence into your app and these
things are kind of fairly regular
scenarios that we might be seeing now
and and you guys don't have to go away
and build your own version of it you
might be able to tap into some of our
versions and so we have a whole load of
different ones we have vision api's and
they have different options in there we
have face API so they're the ones that
were used on how old net and my mustache
net that we have speech API so being
able to do speech to text TV now to get
intent in speech which is exciting and
again on the side of intent I mentioned
that our Islands found patterns and well
Lois is a language understanding service
and he's able to sort of understand the
intent and entities when you baby past
some sort of relevant domain data that
you might have to it so do do go and
have a look at these ones actually I was
at a conference called future decoded in
the UK over there and the 10th and 11th
and what we were able to announce we had
our CEO satya there and he was able to
announce with Chris Bishop from MSR that
we've got some new API to come in so I
was really excited about this and so I
pop them into the slides so it was
totally up to date and we have an
emotion API come in so you can pop a
picture in there and it can say what
kind of emotion it thinks you've got on
your face so you might be smiling and if
someone had taken a picture of me
earlier when I was prepping my slides I
might have looked worried and and also
we have spellcheck in one and some
really exciting stuff I found out it's
totally relevant hopefully to you guys
is actually on github if you go to that
project
Oxford link now and we have lots of all
the github examples and stuff so you can
start building really quickly with these
and we have Windows Phone and we also
have Android so if you guys are Android
developers please do go and have a look
at those so I have yeah yeah I've got
time about eight minutes so what I'm
going to do is I want to show you very
very quickly and an example of using
some of these API is how I've built them
in
something so I have this website you
know how I said like before I always
think of like a machine no no I'm like a
glowing orb
well I asked one of the guys who's on
like the web dev team to make me a
glowing orb so he did this for me which
is really cool and basically what I can
do here is if I open some of this code
and just get these run in I've actually
started to do this for the dev ops hash
tag so as you guys have been tweeting
hopefully if you tweet now as well that
we were really useful and so that's just
running through some of my old ones
there we go so someone has just tweeted
now it comes up in the top one oh you
can't see it very well but and there's a
tweet in the top one there we have a
funky
in terms and panache lag on my mouse so
at the moment the DevOps hashtag has a
sentiment value of 81 and so this
actually uses the text analytics API is
that project oxes provides and what it
can do is it I send off a tweet so each
each one of your tweets gets sent off
and I when I get it back I get a
sentiment score and some keywords so
this is always good so basically what
I'm able to do is send that data into
the cloud I do some processing over it
in real time and I push it back down to
a website in another API and actually in
they're able to display it so every 10
seconds this is refreshing with an
average sentiment and when I've been
testing it where are the dinosaurs
exactly that's actually a really good
idea I'm gonna now put a dinosaur
picture on this because I tend to do
these two things together so and but yet
so basically it on the bottom long we've
got that every 10 seconds it's coming
back with my average sentiment so that's
all coming from the clouds that's going
device the cloud and that's a device
again and and what's really nice it's
just kind of seeing sentiment analysis
an interesting one it's very very
popular don't build your own there's so
many out there including Microsoft's
offering so please do go and try out
these things and just go actually if I
have a hello dove event feedback or if I
have a load of verbatim reviews on an
e-commerce site maybe I could start to
sort of go through these a bit quicker
and do something interesting with them
so just a little bit of fun thank you
for participating it always makes it
much better when people tweet in real
time so if I just close them very
quickly so just this is very very quick
but I just wanted to kind of say that
you might notice that the machine
learning part was actually just one part
of a much bigger problem so in the
sentiment analysis one we had a website
front-end we had some web jobs running
we had the machine learning part we had
some storage we had some you know
there's all these different parts of the
jigsaw and we actually have something
called Cortana analytics suite and now
it's quite recently as well and all
these different services
sit in the cloud and I just wanted to
highlight the fact that you can build a
model but please do consider that end to
end solution because that's the exciting
part of it when you can give someone
sort of a an end to wet ins that does
things automatically so for the for the
one I just showed you I used as your
machine learning but I also use as your
stream analytics and as your vent hubs
so event hubs are just like maths
ingestion of data so it's just tweet so
doesn't matter is that out of order or
anything like that so that that's it
from me thank you for listening and some
of the next steps I'd like to state
basically build build something
innovative let me know when you do
because I'd be really interested to see
what you build with it and so do go to
project Oxford stay I and and check out
those api's investigate those other
services that I've looked up real quick
on on the data platform because actually
pulling these things together is
exciting and as I said if you build
something please tweet me let me know
because it's just nice to see technology
companies create technology and actually
it's what you guys do with it that makes
it far more exciting because we always
see that people use it in completely
unusual and unexpected ways and we
really like to see that so thanks a lot
for your time and I think if there's any
questions feel feel free to ask them
thank you
yes yeah yes so the question was I send
off some pixels and it brought me back a
three can it do anything but numbers
absolutely so with the Twitter sentiment
one I called an API but actually I've
also built a model around Twitter Suns
in that analysis so it can pull me back
values it can pull me back billions
texts and anything really so yeah it's
very very good at handling lots of
different data types yeah so you can you
add logic to what it returns absolutely
so I just sent back the score label but
if you won't say okay I won the scored
label then you can start to add you know
underneath that score model you can
start to add all different stuff before
you put it out the web service so if you
wanted to do some data transformation on
it afterwards or like say the logic
transformation or something like that
you can absolutely do that and then send
different data back to the user
yeah no problem yeah so that was a
question around coughs so as it's a
service
it sits on the cloud and when you're
designing in the there's actually a free
version of it so you can go and get a
free workspace right now and it cost you
nothing it's slightly it's not limited
but you can't deploy web servers and so
far so when you want to put it into
production and you sign up you pay like
a seat per month so it's like five
pounds a month for like a seat and then
basically when you start to process data
in the studio you're paying like pence
basically per hour of processing and so
if I if I give you a sort of idea of how
quick it processes so I'd in another
example I have like two and a half
million rows of data and I'm able to do
it in a demo situation so it takes like
30 seconds tops to maximum sorry to
actually evaluate that so really over an
hour for only a few pence it
it's very very very good at that so
thank you yes yes yeah no so and I I
wouldn't know that at the moment I'd
like to think so
at the start there wasn't really much
support for languages but over time
we've been adding to them so our Python
c-sharp sequel and I'd like to think it
would one thing that I wouldn't ask you
guys to do actually is and in the studio
there's a little smiley face at the top
and that allows you to give feedback
Microsoft work very much in that sense
now when Windows 10 we've done exactly
the same thing and we want you to give
us feedback on when you're using it we
put technology out early so that you
guys can tell us that what you want to
use it for so if you guys all go and say
we want Java we want driver in this
because Java is actually useful machine
that the machine learning so it'd be
nice please do give feedback
it actually means more from you guys
though it does for me so please give
feedback and I would yeah it would be
nice to see lots of languages in the
future any more questions yeah based on
real user input yes so we have a
retraining part so and sorry the
question was can we sort of relearn
given real user input so basically the
Howell net site was a good example of
that we actually never gave the
opportunity to give feedback so when my
boyfriend got heavily insulted it was
quite interesting because he was like
you know I'm not 40 years old he's like
25 so he he basically he said it would
have been nice to say I'll actually no
I'm 25 please use my pit you know little
tick boxes and I please use my picture
to relearn not to you what you can do is
set up something called retraining where
you can then feed that data back into
the model and maybe with an answer that
the user has provided so that
crowdsourcing the problem in some senses
so yeah that's absolutely available and
there's some blog posts online if you
type in as your machine then in
retraining yeah
so recommendation on on in production no
sorry
yes yes okay so we we chose a
multi-class neuron Network what why did
we do that is there a way that it can
recommend which model to use right
okay so interesting part of it is you
know how we had that evaluate model at
the bottom and because we were kind of
clicking and dragging and it was really
agile what we can do is we can have we
had one side of the classifier we could
literally copy and paste that attach it
to the other side and just replace that
module so you can literally just take
that out and put another one in and you
can directly in that evaluate model box
you can directly see the comparison
between the two and so if you use that
machine then in cheat sheet and you go
okay I have a choice of four of
different algorithms you can test them
against each other and whilst sort of
looking into what they do and stuff like
that another interesting source so it
doesn't do it automatically for you but
it has options where you can compare
very quickly the accuracy of two
classifiers which is which is great and
yeah so it's it is absolutely possible
and a little bit work from you guys but
if you can read into the each algorithm
also has a little help page button at
the bottom and when you open that if you
scroll down a bit so it's like a wiki
page and at the bottom it says how have
people use this algorithm before what
kind of problems has it been useful so
there's little examples in sort of plain
English not machine learning talk around
what how this algorithm has been used
before so how's of using recommendations
has it been used when the data is linear
or the data is numeric or something like
that and it will give you those examples
okay and I think I have to go because
I'll hold up the other people I'm around
and I've got another talk on as well so
please come and see that and for yeah
