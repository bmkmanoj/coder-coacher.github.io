capital of Austria where apparently the
first snow globe was invented by
accident in 1900 some was trying to make
a light bulb ever feel so on the
subjective history i'm here with
alistair he gave the keynote today he
saved peter programming so you start off
with a language on the mark one computer
in the University of Manchester I
actually start off much earlier in that
a start offer in the early 18th century
with a loom that was programmable so
programming history goes back a long way
but yeah the mark one that was Glenys
auto code you're referencing and that
was the first compiled language to ever
exist and that was well difficult to
read but very very interesting as a
concept and of course as an influence to
what would come soon after with a huge
influence because from year's tuition
moment that I read earlier that at the
time nobody paid a lot of attention to
well nobody paid that much attention to
that specific language I think the the
influence was less that specific
language and more the fact that it was
compiled and that you could compile
languages to run at reasonable speeds
prior to that it has been a language
called short code which was interpreted
and compared to machine code that was
something like 50 times slower so
compiling in that case made a huge
difference so I thought the first
compiler was an event of each I'll grate
hopper it was it 1956 yeah well think of
it earlier don't have to hear what's up
my head well it kind of depends on what
you define as a compiler languages like
like cleaning auto code were still
relatively close to assembly code and
you can see that if you read the
languages Grace Hopper invented a
language called flow Matic and that was
very much inspired by the English
language so it took something that was
very different from what the computer
would understand and translated it to
something it could understand so it will
certainly the first compiler which did
such a huge translation in Europe
research which must have been quite
expensive for the talk what would the
standout moments in programming history
for you well one standout moment was
certainly that ended 1960s four
languages emerged which had a huge
influence on everything to come as those
languages being COBOL heavily inspired
by flow matic algal Fortran and and lift
and all for these languages are have
been very influential three of them are
actually still in use today which for
fast live the world as we have in IT is
amazing yeah it's shocking as well and
getting people to actually work with
COBOL or fortran code today's difficult
i think normally very expensive yeah i
had an example last week foxface be
pressed over a large bank but still
needing a mobile developers there's a
demand out there if you know how to do
it absolutely I mean these languages are
still being developed one fact I
mentioned the next version of Fortran is
set to come out next year is this was
developed in something like 19 in 1950
something I don't remember the exact
year and it's still going strong it's
changed a lot over the years of course I
have a book on Fortran which among other
things explains how you can pro
gram or transfer punch cards hello
little bit out of date so so maybe so
relevant a lot of people you never know
I think so I mean Fortran was stronger
in the scientific community COBOL was
strong in the business world and Lisp
has been strong well initially in AI and
since then in many other areas and we
still have modern lists of rounds
nowadays so yeah I mean things have
developed but many things have stayed
kind of the same why do you think things
are going with programming languages do
you think we are getting closer to this
idea fourth-generation languages though
well one thing I think is going to
happen I finish my talk speaking about
quantum computing the basis of this was
basically IBM has built a quantum
computer and they're offering access to
it in the cloud and I think that's going
to strongly influence what's to come but
I don't think that will end up
programming solely on quantum computers
what I think is going to happen in well
probably the next decades to be
realistic so it will have some kind of
programming language which merges the
traditional binary style programming
with the functionalities you have under
possibilities you have with quantum
computing and that can bring forth a new
a new era of programming but that's just
my guess is as good as anyone elses like
she's back in 10 years looking forward
to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
