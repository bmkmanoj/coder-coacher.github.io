one of the Gradle engineers part of our
German team and today I want to show you
one of the latest productivity features
that we added in Gradle 3.1 which is
composite builds and before we dive into
a demo of that cool new feature I want
to explain how we arrived at that and
which problem it solves so who uses
Gradle just raise your hands awesome
some of you might know that our motto is
build happiness and that is not just
some fluffy marketing term we actually
think that this can be measured because
we developers ourselves and we're happy
when we're in the flow when we're
solving a challenging problem without
being distracted by boring or annoying
tasks so we analyzed what our developers
facing every day what's what's in their
way
what's making them wait what's taking
them out of the flow and one thing that
we identified was that the repository
structure that projects have is having a
big effect on how developers work so
many of you are probably familiar with
these terms multi repo and mono repo
who's never ever heard of that
distinction
okay so awesome I'm gonna give you like
a short overview so multi repo means you
have your libraries and applications in
separate repositories they have separate
release cycles probably have separate
teams they might have completely
different tool stacks that are very
isolated from each other and if you want
to integrate them then you publish to an
artifact repository and then pull those
dependencies in another project
another's many advantages and
disadvantages
the advantages are you get a lot of
isolation by default so
your apps and libraries tend to be a
little more modular because you're
forced into it you're forced into
modularity it's also very easy for a new
team member to come into one of those
relatively small projects and get an
overview of what's happening here what's
the structure of the code what's the
bill doing what can I change to fix this
bug it's usually a small manageable size
of code which also means it's pretty
easy to work on it in the IDE if you
have a handful of projects then every
IDE will handle that very easily the
problem comes when you want to integrate
these projects so let's say you want to
fix it bug in a library and that bug
only manifests itself in an application
that you have so what do you do well the
current state of the artists you check
both of them out you make the change in
the library that you think will fix the
bug and then you install it into your
local repository then you go to your
application you if necessary add the
local repository to your application and
then you also change the version number
of the library to match the thing that
you just built locally because usually
they won't match up because the
application is probably using an older
version of the library and you're
currently locally building and then
finally you can build the app and see
okay test so green or Tesla red and when
you're red well you're gonna go through
that whole cycle again build the library
install it into the local repo and then
build your app who's who's gone through
this hell yeah
we all have it's annoying and it's a
tree huge time waster another problem is
with compatibility so you build a cool
library and let's say it's version
wandered oh and now you want to build
1.1 and your team makes a change and
what they don't know is this change is
actually a breaking change for some
downstream application how will we find
it out
current state of the art is you either
notice after you've released it and
somebody updates the app to use the new
version they tell you oh hey you just
broke us so please do a pet release and
tell everybody that this version is bad
or which is arguably even worse you
force everyone to use snapshot versions
so all the builds are non reputable by
default and these problems have let
people into another extreme which is the
mono repo let by the example of Google
mostly so some of you might know how
Google works they have a huge repository
that contains all their code all the
libraries they've ever used and even all
their build tools and everything it's
all one big repository and everything is
built from master and that has some
charming advantages there is no
versioning issue like everything is in
the same source tree so when you change
the library you immediately see the
impact you just say ok Gradle built and
you see oh I broke my application
because it's in the same build
you also don't need to worry about our
defect repositories or anything like
that but it comes at a price it comes
with the price in performance so when
you do a build you don't just build what
you're interested in you're also
building everything else and even if
it's up to date you're still paying for
the up to date checks at least and
you're paying for the configuration time
of those projects that you're not really
interested in it's also a usability
issue if you import such a large project
into the IDE at some point you hit the
scaling limits of the indexers of
IntelliJ or eclipse and it's also just a
discoverability issue it's very hard to
find your way around the codebase with
let's say a thousand modules and then
there's also the problem of creeping
dependencies between those modules if
there's no repository boundaries nuclear
version boundaries forcing into molarity
it's very easy to go back to just
tangling AB
thing together so it has some big
disadvantages too and this is why we
wanted to find a solution that allows
you to get the benefits of both
and that's why we build a composite
build a composite builds very simple
allows you to combine multiple
independent Gradle builds into one big
one and that means you can take your
library and your application and combine
them into one big build and say hey just
run all the tests with these two
together and what Gradle will do is it
will determine that oh this dependency
that my application has this orc my
company my utils is actually provided by
this other build that's also in the
composite so I'm going to use a project
dependency instead so with one command
you can just say Gradle build and it'll
first compile the library and then the
application and once you make a change
in that library the application will
immediately the application built will
immediately picked it up and you'll know
if you've broken something or not so
this gives you like really quick local
experimentation you could import that
into your IDE and do cross repository
refactoring it also allows you to move
from let's say a monolith to a multi
Reaper build so you have your big build
and you want to bust it up into smaller
pieces and it's much easier if you first
start out saying okay let's keep
everything in one repository but let's
split this big build up into smaller
builds they still live in the same repo
but they're more isolated
we're actually forcing ourselves to make
it so that we can build each piece alone
and together and once you have that you
can then go and say ok let's take this
one built take it out of the monolith
put it in its own repository publish it
and use a binary dependency instead so
it's a very smooth migration path away
from monolith if you need that
and another use case that I personally
love is plugin prototyping so who of you
has built Gradle plugins before I'm very
proud of you guys very productive crowd
here so when you build a Gradle plugin
of course you write lots of automated
tests which is great so you get fast
feedback if you broke something but in
the end you often just want to do some
quick experimentation you want to write
an example project and try out the
latest version of your plugin and with
composite builds you can finally do that
so you can take the latest version of
your plugin you can take the example put
them together into one build and run the
example build and it will immediately
pick up any changes in your plugin so
let's see how that works
so if here three applications the first
one is a very simple very simple example
that I talked about earlier the I have
an app and I have a library so I'm gonna
go into that example and now I want to I
have a dependency in my application that
says I depend on or example number you
tools and or example string utils and
these are provided by the my utils
project so imagine you have checked both
of them out into your git repository and
now you want to fix some bug in that
library while testing it against that
application and what you can do now is
say Gradle include this other build
called my you tools and run the
application and you'll see that I'm not
just compiling my application I'm also
compiling the library and I get an
answer than I'm expecting which is minus
4 um because if we look in my
application what I was actually doing is
printing numbers add in 1923
so that doesn't match up so let's go
into our number you tools and fix it up
yeah
simple mistake replace that with a plus
and say run again and there we go our
bug is fixed and without any publishing
to a local repository with any pain I
just immediately could see the result in
my applet
now you'll see when I say Gradle give me
the compiled dependencies that our
dependency to number you tools I should
say offline
that my dependency to the number utils
library is actually replaced with a
project dependency and similarly the
other string useless library was
replaced with the project dependency to
the project in my number utils built and
this is not just some dumb replacement
so we're not just taking that one
dependency and replacing it with the
project we're replacing the whole graph
so if I were to go into my string new
tools built and for instance changes
transitive dependencies and we have a
dependency on Commons Lang here if I
changed that it would also be picked up
by my app so any change I make to that
our build is immediately picked up
conflict resolution works everything is
just as if those two were always
together now after a while it could
become a little tedious to say include
build include build include build right
so what you can do is you can make this
persistent this is what I've done in
this composite project so this is a
project that just lifts next to the
other two and it has a setting start
Gradle file that says include my app and
include my you tools so if I go into
that project and say Gradle run I don't
need to do any include built anymore and
you can see both my app and my you tools
are built and I get my answer so you can
imagine this way you could for instance
have a composite that just iterates over
a folder for instance your git folder
and just includes every Gradle builders
in there it just says hey um I want to
include all of them and see if
everything still builds together or I
want to import all of them into my IDE
and do cross repository refactoring and
this immediately leads to another use
case that you can do very similarly
which is when you have a mono repo and
you want to break it up so F taking the
same example called it the mono repo app
and this time instead of these projects
being independent and living next to
each other
I've actually nested them so I
my application and it contains number
you tools and string you tools as
independent builds inside one repository
and what I've done here is actually for
my for my colleagues convenience I've
made this a four loop I've said for any
folder that's in the modules directory
include as a Gradle build so my
colleagues no longer need to worry about
the settings configuration they just add
more modules to that mono repo and it'll
just work together so let's step in
there and see how that application works
so let's just say Gradle run we should
get the same result again we're having
number you tools string you tools and my
main application and when I say Gradle
dependencies for the compiler
configuration you'll see that these
dependencies are replaced but I could
also CD into one of the smaller builds
down there into number.you tools and
build it alone so when I'm just working
on number you tools imagine it's a
relatively big build in itself I can
import just that into IntelliJ for
instance work on it make some changes
run some tests without building
everything else like my whole other app
on all the other libraries that I have
and now we want to bust up our our multi
our mana repo we actually want to move
number.you tools into its own repository
and we want to go towards binary
dependencies I've added a simple task
that simulates this by publishing to a
local file repositories and just gonna
call that one say Gradle publish these
two libraries to a local repository and
then we're going to move number util
somewhere else so literally somewhere
else and then run our build again look
at the dependencies and you'll see that
string you Tools is still replaced by
that project dependency we had before
and number you tools is now taken from
my binary repository so it's that easy
to switch between local or binary
integration and you could for instance
also combine it with get sub modules
make it convenient for your colleagues
to check out a number of other projects
that they might want to work with
locally but if they're not there just
use the deployed version instead so that
ah the difference between an included
project and an included build becomes
very fluent and my favorite use case as
I said is the plugin development so I
have a little greeting plug-in here it's
very simple it just says hello and I
have someone that uses this so I say I
depend on the greeting plugin wonder
though I apply it and I create a
greeting tasks there that says greet Bob
and I have my plugin next to it and now
I want to make a change to my plug-in
and I want to see the result on my build
immediately so let's go there and say
Gradle greet Bob and we'll see okay our
plugin is built before the rest of my
build is executed and then our grid bob
task is called and if I now go into my
plug-in and say hey I don't like that
reading I want to change it to hello and
also get rid of these exclamation marks
and I can immediately see the effect on
my build so this allows you to really
rapidly prototype a DSL for your plugin
see how tasks up-to-date checking works
etc using an example built and then
maybe using this example built as a
basis for your test cases that you're
right later so this is in Gradle fluid
one you can already use it it's stable
and
you could use it for even other things
than just local development for instance
one of the things I talked about is it's
very hard to find out if a library
change breaks downstream applications
basically the only wave currently is to
use snapshots which is a problem in
itself so what you could do with
composite builds is you can have a CI
job that takes some of your libraries in
your application puts them into a
composite and then runs the check task
and says hey duties all work together
still because by default composite
builds will not take the version number
into account so as long as group and
artifact ID match up the dependencies
will be replaced you can customize that
of course so you could customize it to
use semantic versioning and only replace
it if you think it's compatible but the
default behavior should suit most of you
I think and so this way you can give
your library your office really fast
feedback they commit make a change
nobody else is yet using it but they
immediately get a message from the CI
server saying hey you broke that
application that we have you need to fix
this library before you release it there
are some limitations currently on some
of which we've already addressed so the
biggest limitation in Gradle 3.1 was the
missing IDE support you couldn't import
composites in to build ship or IntelliJ
this has been fixed in Gradle 303 which
is kind of go out in mid-december you
currently cannot target tasks in
included builds so when I have a root
built and I include the my app and my
you tools I can target tasks in the root
built but I cannot say my utils built
from the command line this is a feature
that we'll add in the future definitely
and we will also make it easier to
target a subtree so let's say I want to
run the build tasks in all sub projects
of my app and this will benefit
composites it will also benefit normal
multi project bills I think who has had
that use case that I just want to build
a subtree of their project
so currently the solution it's not
really nice is to either CD into that
subtree or use the - piece which to
select the project directory but this is
kind of awkward it requires you to drop
down to the physical structure of your
project whereas we won't really want to
talk about the logical structure so we
want to talk about project names and
task names so there's gonna be kind of a
wild-card syntax where we say build
everything that's called jar below this
project we currently cannot substitute
custom publications so if your if your
library has let's say a main jar and a
test jar we currently only can
substitute that manger can't depend on
the test jar in the composite yet this
is also something that we will improve
so this dependency substitution API will
become more powerful to support custom
publications the included builds aren't
built in parallel at the moment it's
kind of an obvious improvement but I'll
still needs test coverage of course and
still needs some fault so we haven't
gotten around to that but it is an
obvious improvement that we will do
continuous builds currently won't detect
changes in included builds so we will
warn you if you use continuous build
together with composites and tell you
like hey this might not work exactly as
you expect so
this automatic change detection and
rebuild that you are used to from
continuous build will not work for
included builds at the moment there is
also currently no support for nested
composites so composites of composites
this is also a natural extension of the
concept take the mono repo example you
have a big mono repo you split it into a
few builds and then these builds are
still a little too big maybe you have a
thousand modules and you want to have
two levels or even three levels of
nesting to get like really small pieces
that individual teams can develop so
this is also something that we're going
to address and at the moment all builds
will be built with the same Gradle
version so the what you saw
I said Gradle built in the root project
and the root
and all the included builds will be a
sub build of that so they will be
executed in the same demon with the same
context as the route built so you cannot
have mixed Gradle versions at the moment
this is something that's I would say a
little further down the road um I think
having everything used the same version
is probably the 80/20 solution there
might be use cases where you want to
have projects that are just completely
incompatible version wise but it's not
on our priorities right now and last but
not least um there is currently no
support for producing build scans for
composite builds this is mainly because
we need to come up with a good UI
metaphor because composite builds or
builds which contain other builds so we
need to come up with a good way to
visualize that so here's the tasks that
were executed and then there was a whole
build that was executed so nothing we
can't solve on this list but some
limitations to keep in mind while you
use this feature now as I set our IDE
support is solved on the master branch
so we added support for composite builds
to the tooling API and this will be
released mid-december built up to that
already has nightly builds and I'm suing
a milestone build that you'll be able to
use so if you're an eclipse user you'll
be able to import composites if you use
the build ship milestone and the latest
Gradle Knightley's IntelliJ IDEA already
started some basic integration that is
in the 2016 3 early exit program so you
can check that out and full integration
integration with Gradle 3.3 so that you
can import composites defined in a
settings that Gradle file will come in
2017 dot one so keep an eye out for that
there should be some early access
versions coming up soon there so let's
have a quick look at how working with
the IDE work with a composite so I'm
using build chip here which is the
Gradle Eclipse plug-in the
we develop ourselves and I'm going to
import the plug-in development example
and you can see I'm pointing Gradle to
that consumer project which had an
include build statement to include the
plug-in itself and the consumer project
as well as the greeting plugin are
imported into build ship and I can run
tasks in the consumer so I can say hey
greet Bob and then get hello Bob now I
can go into my plugin in the same
workspace make a change change it to hi
rerun the task and get an up-to-date
result and the same works for libraries
so I could import that application and
library example refactor them across
repository boundaries I could take the
mono repo example and just import one of
the parts of that mono repo just work on
that as if it wasn't completely isolated
build or import the whole mono repo to
make some big sweeping change if I'm the
architect of that project and have that
kind of power to make these decisions so
that's the repository structure no
longer determines how you work all right
and the other thing that I mentioned is
build scan support so who of you has
heard of build scans already all right
so build scans are a way for you to get
more insight into your build and this is
why it's really important for us to also
support that for composites it allows
you it takes all the things that are
happened inside your build like the
tasks that were executed how long they
took which dependencies were resolved
how long that took which plugins were
used which Gradle version which platform
you build on and so on and makes that
available to you as the build master by
uploading it to a central server so you
see all the CI builds all your local
developer builds
everything that happened in your
organization and you cannot analyze that
and make decisions for instance you see
oh my developers are calling clean all
the time
that shouldn't be necessary Gradle has
great incremental build support so you
could get in touch with them and say hey
why are you using clean all the time and
they will tell you all there's this one
task that doesn't work with incremental
build and you wouldn't have found that
out otherwise and then you can fix it
and they are more productive or maybe
you see oh that task takes like 10
minutes and everybody's waiting for that
every morning it's a huge productivity
waste let's make that one task more
efficient and we'll save a bunch of
money and also it helps your developers
get feedback so they have a problem and
what usually happens well they write you
an email they call you up and say well
doesn't work okay can you give me
distracted raise then you get the stack
trace okay which system are you on and
which Java version to use and which
switches that you use and so on so that
goes back and forth probably four hours
until you finally find a problem with a
build scan you can just tell the
developer give me the URL of your build
scan and you can have a look at
everything that was happening in their
build and tell them oh yeah you're using
the wrong Java version and then maybe
add a check to your build that makes
sure this doesn't happen again
so if you want to see that in action you
can stop by at the Gradle booth or just
go to Gradle calm and check it out
yourself there's a free public version
of it so you can use that for your open
source libraries and produce build scans
for those try it out and of course if
you have any other questions I will be
there and some of my colleagues will be
there at the Gradle booth to answer your
questions show you more about the latest
Gradle features and Gradle Enterprise if
you want and of course after this
conference you can always go to Gradle
org or ask questions in the forum we
have a big community as you probably
know that is very helpful and will
answer all your questions and with that
I would like to get your questions now
please
okay so the question is how does
compositor
prototyping plugins with composites
relate to the build source project that
we already have the build source project
will probably become an implicit
included build as soon as we support
nested composites
so basically we're just gonna get rid of
this concept of there's this mat this
one magic folder that works like a
composite and instead you were much flex
much more flexible you don't need to put
it in builders you don't need to put it
inside the same project you can put it
in its own repository and then connect
them to prototype when you want to now
so you don't need to like many users
have been doing that they've been copy
pasting stuff in to build source to
prototype it and then copy paste this
the fixed solution back into the real
plugin yeah so you're basically getting
rid of that you're welcome
any more questions go ahead
okay so the question is argued
sub-modules the only way to include
builds no that was just an example so
it's it's the one you checked out so the
one you have locally you could of course
build something you know that finds the
correct repository branch and checks
that out for you but the way it works is
currently either you have a mono repo so
like several builds in one repository or
you have some kind of other
orchestration like you checking out
projects locally or your build server
checking out a bunch of projects next to
each other and then making a composite
out of them yes so one of the next
logical steps would be taking the
knowledge that build scans have about
how your projects are connected together
and feeding that back into the build
server and saying hey I've built this
library now build all the dependence
with this library together now so making
build servers smarter all right so for
any more questions you can find me at
the booth I'll be there all day and
tomorrow and Thursday - thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
