angular session at this Java conference
that's weird
before we start I just wanted to thank
those people who liked the old angular
sessions during devoxx so thank thanks
forever and that means a lot for us and
for me especially so during this session
we will talk about state management in
your UI in angular us our in-app UI
using angular and rxjs who knows us
about rxjs rx Java everyone yeah okay so
yeah reactivity sections for Java
scripts so my name is Wasim Sheikh am
I'm a developer advocate engineer force
fair in Paris so I work mostly with
front-end technologies not much Java or
coadley unfortunately I'm also GD for
the angular team so if you have any
issue with angular come talk to me after
the talk or tweet at me at manekineko on
twitter so before we talk about angular
let's just see how angularjs worked with
state management anyone knows angularjs
like the older version of angular
everyone yeah ok
so in angularjs we had this mvvm model
which is like the view get updates every
time that the model changed with this
thing called data binding so the data
binding implementation angular was angry
jealous or it was made thanks to this
digest loop so that was something like
some magic inside the angularjs
framework that try to update like both
ways your data on your own and the view
so with this comes some sort of issues
because your angularjs application was
some sort of graph like a
bi-directional graph because every time
a component get updates and because you
have two-way binding some sort like some
other properties inside another
component get updated and angular like
the core had to check again many times
you're the whole application instead in
in so it can like update all of you
right
so with this come comes some like
performance issues who has already like
who had angular like a performance
issues with angularjs applications like
everyone all of us we had this sort of
performance problems so that was mainly
because of this implementation of this
digest loop right we had all some
complexity because we had to like deal
with every component make sure that like
we use some immutability implementation
and come up with weird solution to that
plus all the side effects for for this
so and they did the most really
complicated thing is this black magic
happening inside the framework and you
don't have access to it so if you want
to know more about the dirt to check in
and how angularjs made like possible
this two-way binding a friend of mine
called taro has written a deep dive
article about this so please give it a
shot so now about angular so the good
news is in angular the new version of
angularjs it's not you don't have to use
MVP have a vm if if i'm use MVC is up to
you if you wanna use Model View intents
you decide but the inner framework the
anger itself is written using this thing
called FRP functional reactive
functional program or fractional
reactive programming so because angular
the core of angular is reactive
yeah who knows FRP functional reactive
programming
okay so wikipedia can give you the
answer but what we really care about in
this definition is how to use like how
to program in a synchronous dataflow
using functional programming and model
this complexity through time so in other
words this resemble two streams so we
all know about streams and I like to see
streams like this like a stream of gas I
can watch this the whole day we don't
have time so in other words a stream is
basically sequence of ongoing
asynchronous events and which is like
more importantly ordered in time so a
little quick animation we have this is
like time the blue blue line we can get
events so here you are in your app UI
app you can like click on buttons on
keyboards wherever so all these things
like trigger events so you can get all
those events even like when you make an
exertion request to the server that's
also an event arrows also so events and
then you can like end the stream so this
is basically stream so how do we work
with streams so that's thanks to rxjs
reactive extensions for javascript so
arcgis is basically one implementation
for this in the JavaScript world we have
many others so please click on the link
to like to know more about the
implementation because it's getting into
the JavaScript stander I mean like
talking about observables not ours yes
so quickly observables are I like to
define them like they are like promises
like features for Java developers so we
call them promises on the JavaScript
side but they are not promises they are
just like them but for sure they are
asynchronous and observables they are
all
like arrays but like meaning that we can
iterate over them but they are not
arrays so with observables we can create
stream combine it transform it subscribe
to it or we can call it or react to
changes also so we have methods like
many many methods to that we can use in
order to perform some sort of
computation over on these values for
instance MapReduce filters zip and like
there are tons of of methods functions
so here we have a like a javascript
sample code with a simple simple like
function that that does some reactive
stuff using three operators we create a
stream using the range operator from 0
to 10 and then we transform those values
and then get the result in the
subscriber so by the way this is before
rxjs
5.5 so the newest version 5.5 on plus we
will use this sort of of API which is
called the label operators so just
import the operator you want and then
combine them using the pipe operate so
it's like a compose function in math so
yeah this is funny because you can even
put it in the tweet and it it fits well
so how does angular use observables
because this is like an angular talk so
again the good news like when you write
your angular app by default is a
reactive app everything is angular is
reactive like if you use HTTP if use
forms the router or even like some sort
of core api's everything is like streams
everything is reactive for instance here
I have a sample code for like a model
driven form
I'm not going to explain all this and I
like only HTML part but basically you
can create a form using this this new
API in angular 2 and then you can use
this MDF property which is your form
called the the value changes property
which is a stream actually and then
since you have a swim you can pipe it
and compose it and like work with your
your controls inside your form the way
you want even like more advanced sample
here we can listen you can subscribe
sorry to the ng submit stream and before
we can like transform we transform some
some controls for instance here I'm
getting the email input from form and
then I'm using the flat map operator to
send the request to the server for
instance to validate the email or some
sort of like things like that again with
HTTP I mean we all use HTTP all of our
angular apps the HTTP API is by default
streamable it returns an observable so
here we call the get method you can even
give it a type here I'm using typescript
by the way so I have static types and
the get method returns an observable so
I can for instance use this kind of
stuff I can here create this is another
example so I can create a command stream
using the interval observable Creator
and then every time like every one
second for instance hit the server with
the flat map operator gets some sort of
data and then randomize some facts for
instance here so that this is the kind
of code you're right when you when
you're like reactive in your app so
three
feel free to move to this kind of
approach is it's a different way of
thinking I know but it's it like makes
the code more readable and also since
the introduction of this pipe operator
it also makes your bundle size lighter
because the compiler the angular
compiler angular like bundler that
bundles of JavaScript file will only use
the operator you are using like included
into bundle instead of including the
whole arcgis library so just one last
thing you can also like if you are
angular developer you've also like
created control components compose
components and then make a third
component that talk to a child component
for instance what i mean by that is here
you have a parent component that has a
child component and this child component
triggers some sort of event so you can
like define a function that reacts to
the own child event for instance and
inside the child event the child
component this is how you construct this
event using the event emitter with a
type for instance string here and then
just make some silly code here just
triggers an event foo sorry triggers an
event output event with a value foo
every time it creates the getting new
instance alright so that's how angular
loves observables so thank you everyone
and if you have any questions just use
my Twitter handle or just catch me
outside thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
