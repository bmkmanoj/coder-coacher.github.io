about the blockchain so how many of you
don't give a about the blockchain
just here because I saw some light ok
that's that's reassuring
by the way our goal is by the end of
this talk that nobody raises their hands
in this question so yeah the title of
this talk is why the hell should know
sorry why you should care about the
blockchain yeah so very quickly before
we get our hands dirty with the real
material a quick presentation about who
we are
so my name is Sebastiano guest I am a
developer for over eleven years now
mostly Java back-end stuff and also
convinced agile practitioner I also
coach startups on everything related to
lean startup mythology's I'm an
entrepreneur creating my own business a
couple years ago and also do some
development on on smartphones and smart
TV so by the way if you do if you have
an Apple TV you can use a t-box
application to watch all the talks from
devoxx shameless plug and I also blog on
futurologist go because I like to view
the future like you know ear must have
crystal ball and all that and indeed of
course the reason why I'm here I'm also
blockchain enthusiast
so I'm side anyway and I've started my
career in 1992 I was young and thin and
developing on page starts yeah exactly
so I'm an agile coach I love scrum and
I'm also reading some some guys so and I
learn programming two to two kids with
device for kids initiative
kargh organizer of the the whadjuk an
organization located yes I'm an
entrepreneur and from time to time and
I'm developing some application mainly
on Android I have developed the the
Android wear app for my devoxx and also
tea Vox the counterpart for Android TV
and I'm I'm a father ologist I have
pretty predicted to have three kids and
I have I've succeeded for that and also
sometimes I try to to develop for the
blockchain so just a few disclaimers
before we start you might have heard of
the blockchain via Bitcoin and all the
cryptocurrencies and so on and most
people use it today as a as a
speculation instrument we are not
interested that much in that part
clearly we are developers so we are
looking at it from the angle of a
developer as a development platform so
we're not trailers with developers and
also we are not experts we don't pretend
to be experts we are just learning about
it and I'll go today is to share what
we've learned if there are if there are
experts in the room and you notice some
inaccuracies and so on feel free to tell
us and we'll improve our contents can
you enjoy kitten yeah okay with blue ink
okay so semester we have read a lot of
article and posts for gathering in the
blockchain block change here and there
so it's really hype could you just
explain us what is watching that's the
most fundamental question and thank you
for asking it because oh you know
something slide amazing as if it was
prepared anyway so most of you might
have heard of the blockchain via Bitcoin
okay we all know that the blockchain is
the technology behind Bitcoin bitcoin
was born in somewhere in 2008 right
after this a prime problem issue and a
guy by the name or guy or group we don't
know yet by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto
came up with this white paper and a code
base for a basic system whose goal was
to basically replace the banking in the
currency the fiat currency system with a
completely different kind of currency a
digital currency a cryptocurrency that
could be maintained without
help of nation-states and banks in a
completely decentralized way and Kev
shook up a whole lot of things and
indeed it was
I mean the blockchain was not even a
concept back then in in the white paper
they it just talks about a chain of
blocks and and later on it's only later
on that we realized that this concept
this architecture really was really
interesting for a whole lot of other
problems than just creating a currency
okay
cryptocurrency architecture lost could
spend the difference you're right that's
that's clearly a problem right now is
that on the Bitcoin everything is mixed
up because I mean it was designed to
solve a very specific problem but it's
very important to differentiate those
three different layers so you have a
conceptual layer a set of design
patterns if you want to a set of generic
concepts that can be applied in
different ways and then you have
implementations and each implementation
can choose their own concepts and
implement them in a specific way and
then even for each implementation you
have different instances so it's really
important to differentiate the three so
let's start with the concept first okay
so let's go back to the problem that the
Bitcoin was supposed to to address smile
and very natural as you said so if you
if you put yourself in a very simple
model for a banking database if you want
you have this database that stores a
balance for each bank account and then
you have transactions that are applied
to it so in the first scenario we could
say that after this state we do a first
transaction we transfer five euros
dollars whatever it's the same from
Alice to Bob and then ten from Bob to
John and then five from John to Alice
and we end up with this state 1500 15
now we just change the order of
transactions and we put the second one
first okay start from the same state
this one won't work because Bob doesn't
have enough euros on his account
and so then we apply the other two
transactions and we end up with a
completely different state all that just
to illustrate the fact that of course
transaction order is really related to
the state and that's the main thing you
need to agree on an order of
transactions in order to agree on what
the final state looks like okay so
that's the first key element when you
have just one database everything is
centralized it's very easy to find this
agreement and even if you have several
databases there are somewhat replicated
it's pretty easy to find okay but then
it comes with a whole lot of problems
the first one is okay what happens if
someone who has access to this database
finds a way to change the order of
transactions or even to change the state
directly of course is a very big problem
and that's why most banks work with
those mainframes that nobody likes but
it's very secure it's very safe so
basically how do you deal with
mutability the second problem what if
the database fails what if the central
system falls apart then nobody can
access their accounts the whole system
is down so how do you deal with photons
and the third problem with that kind of
centralized system is who can see what
or the problem censorship basically so
in a centralized system the way we deal
with those problems well mutability
basically we set up a complex
authorization system and audit logging
in order to know exactly who has the
right to do what and who does what
at which time of course so this is
basically how you deal with it it's very
complex very heavy and we all know that
when you've worked in a bank you know
what I mean
second aspect for tolerance well you
start by setting up redundant to
replicate your servers somehow so that
even if one falls apart then you can
switch to the good system but then you
end up having to deal with how do you
maintain a transactional context across
those servers and you have to set up
complex middleware and maintain it and
all that had some complexity to the
system and the third aspect for
censorship well you have to set up some
access points some api's and of course
you need to secure them again adding
some complexity of the problem yes but
but today we live pretty well with these
kind of constraints what's the
alternative so basically again the
motivation of the Bitcoin was really to
turn the system upside down somehow and
build an alternative that was
decentralized meaning that we need to
solve those problems in a different way
so in a distributed and decentralized
database the first thing we we start
with is we distribute the data on the
nodes of the system itself we don't keep
it in a central place we distribute it
across the nodes of the of the network
and not just the data but also the
control of other data the governance
itself
thanks to those things well the fault
tolerance is pretty much built in okay
you have a network in which even if a
node fails then the data can basically
work around it and everything is good
and it's built in to network it comes
for free second aspect transparency so
to solve the censorship issue if you
want well everybody can audit everything
that happens because everybody can see
all the transactions now of course this
this comes at a cost and to ballon kind
of balance things out you need anonymity
as well so in other in other words you
can see every transactions you can see
every change in the network but you
don't know who is hiding behind it you
just see numeric identifiers and then of
course the most difficult part in this
how do you agree how do you agree on
that on such an important aspect as the
order of transactions and how to find
this agreement between all these nodes
that are distributing in distributed in
the network especially because the older
data is distributed in all the nodes and
the problem is how do you agree and
that's really the key innovation in the
blockchain how do you reach consensus so
I won't go into too much detail now
about the different implementation but
during the general concept is the
following basically what you do is you
build this ledger is the same thing as
in traditional banking system you have
this list of transactions and they are
ordered but here they are ordered and
packaged bundled if you want into blocks
okay so they're billed only two blocks
and then those blocks are chained
together starting to see where I'm going
with this block sham indeed but they are
chained cryptographically again I won't
go into too much detail about that but
you you the only thing you should know
is that there are mathematicians who
worked really hard to make sure that
nobody can break this chain nobody can
change the order of the link in that
chain it's very very safe
so those blocks are chained together and
then you have what we call a consensus
algorithm that is used to determine one
specific order for those transactions
and especially for those blocks okay and
this runs on the nodes and it's
replicated on all the nodes in the
network so you have a specific algorithm
that changes depending on the
implementation again but every node can
verify that the order is
cryptographically valid okay that's okay
for the concept but you mentioned
implementation could you just mention
some solutions that implement these
concepts so again these are general
concepts and there are several ways to
implement them I'm just gonna go over a
few criterias here but there are many
more criterias that we we could mention
just to give you an example and
illustrate the fact that each
implementation comes with their their
own interpretation of those concepts so
we're going to talk about the the
algorithm to determine the consensus
also another important aspect is what we
call the mining reward in other words
how do you incentivize nodes to
participate in the sakura sakura zation
and yet the safety of the network if you
want and the kind of impact that it has
on the the way the whole system works so
let's start with a Bitcoin first in the
Bitcoin the consensus algorithm is of
kind what we call proof of work okay so
you might have seen that somewhere
basically the idea is that there are
special nodes and every every node can
be that kind of special logo a miner and
miners basically invest electricity and
hardware in order to calculate some
cryptographic puzzle to build the next
block in the chain and they compete to
do the
and and of course when they compete in
that that's how they spend a lot of
energy and electricity and they have to
invest in hardware to do that as I said
in an open blockchain like that you need
to incentivize the miners somehow to
participate in this security mechanism
in this consensus algorithm and the way
it's done in Bitcoin is using this
crypto currency the Bitcoin as a way to
reward miners so every time a miner adds
a new block to the chain
he's awarded with right now it's 12.5
bitcoins and this amount is actually
half there before years that's one of
the rules of the protocol that's the way
it's built and there are different
reasons for that but that's one of the
reasons why the total amount of bitcoins
is is capped at the end and also there
are transaction fees so every time you
want to make it make a transaction on
the network you have to incentivize
again the miners to include your
transaction in a block and the way you
do that is by paying a small transaction
T and the miner that finds the block
gets to two to go with the transaction
fees as well because of all the way this
is done and to keep a certain level of
security a new block in the Bitcoin
blockchain is produced every ten minutes
or so
so that's just one implementation
Bitcoin now about two three years ago I
think a guy by the name of Vitalik
beuter in figured out that this system
was nice but it was really specialized
on financial transactions and just for
managing a cryptocurrency you could do
some fancy stuff with it but to a
certain point and so he decided to build
something new called aetherium it's just
another implementation of the same
concepts that we talked about earlier
but in a different way
the consensus algorithm is of type proof
of work as well at least for now I'll
mention it later but here the the reward
for the miners is not half that we for
years it remains constant is just five
ether so by the way on ethereum you have
another cryptocurrency that's called
ether instead of Bitcoin and and again
the miners get rewarded in ether you
have another concert
called uncle's I won't go into details
in that but it has some important
implications about the security and the
speed of the network and you also have
transaction fees but in addition to that
you have a new concept called gas
because the main purpose of aetherium
was to be able to run more generic
programs on top of the blockchain and so
that involves processing time and memory
storage and so on and you have to
somehow pay for that it's like when you
pay AWS to host your application it's
about the same thing so you pay some
amount of cryptocurrency to make your
applications run yes but hold on
10 seconds to generate a block yeah
other than 10 minutes so it's less
secure that it's not less secure partly
because of the uncle mechanism and yeah
there are different reasons why it's a
but indeed the blocks are produced much
faster and it's just to illustrate the
fact that just by choosing different
ways and different rules different ways
to implement the concepts that you
mentioned before then you can get
completely different results in terms of
how the network works ok and just to
give you administration right now
aetherium works like that but there are
some very important research projects
going on especially a new consensus
algorithm called Kasper and what the way
it will work is instead of working on
the base of proof of work it will be a
proof of stake consensus algorithm so
basically instead of investing and
electricity and hardware in order to
calculate what the next block is going
to be you bet so you own a certain
amount you prove you can prove that you
own a certain amount of Earth of ether
you put it on table and you say ok I'm
betting this amount that the next block
is going to be this one and then of
course you have all the way the interest
in the world to bet on the right block
and and ok this is very complex
mathematics stuff but basically the main
goal of that is to stop wasting energy
electricity because you know the polar
bears and the dolphins and all that
really so yeah that's that's one of the
reasons why they're doing it now it's
very controversial because it's not been
proven yet but it's very promising and
here the of course the mining rewards
are completely different you don't have
the this static mining reward anymore
you
have just the rewards of the bets but
you keep transaction fees and gas as
well and thanks to the way this system
works we estimate right now it's not in
production yet so we don't know how it's
gonna work exactly we estimate that the
blocks are going to take about four
seconds to produce so how long so I will
create my own instance of the blockchain
generate crypto currency so I will
become rich indeed because all of that
of course is implemented in code and you
can instantiate it as many times as you
like and by the way some people have
done that there are a lot of instances
of whichever code base I mean the
Bitcoin code base is particularly
instantiated in a lot of places last
time I looked at it there were like more
than 700 alternative coins so alternate
instances of one blockchain or another
so it's it's a very promising concept
but again you have different instances
of the same implementation basically a
blockchain is like a code base okay
and it's the code base for the software
that runs on each node in the network
including the mining algorithm so the
the consensus algorithm now you can
decide to activate this algorithm or not
depending on it whether you have the
hardware and you have you you want to
increase your electricity bill to some
extent you can decide to participate in
the consensus or not but it's there and
all the nodes should have the same
version of this code otherwise the rules
are not the same for everybody and then
you're not participating in the same
mining process so blockchain instance is
identified by a Genesis block so the
very first block of the chain can
defines the the basis to do rules is
pretty much like the DDL script in the
sequel database if you want you have you
also need a network identifier this is
used for all the nodes to participate in
the same network attached to the exactly
to attach to the other nodes and pay and
by the way of course if you create your
own blockchain your own instance of a
blockchain you create your own
cryptocurrency that goes with it
and the cryptocurrency created and one
network cannot be used on another of
course
and of course you build this famous
chain of blocks because of the software
that you run on your nodes
what that also means is that if you run
a different version of the software with
a different set of rules you're
essentially creating an alternate
version of reality an alternate chain
and that's what we call a forking chain
ok let's back to to the cryptocurrency
why it's so important in the blockchain
that's a good question because I mean
the Bitcoin was created for the
cryptocurrency for the for the currency
itself but clearly the the objectives of
ethereum was just to be able to run any
generic program on top of it and so the
new question might be ok why did we need
to associate this concept of a
cryptocurrency to it again
it's very important to understand that
in a public blockchain the the
cryptocurrency plays a key role in
everything because the main reason it
exists is to incentivize nodes
especially miners to participate in a
consensus algorithm ok if you have no
way to incentivize them then you end up
well counting on their goodwill somehow
now this is the kind of thing that the
banks and some private chains are trying
to do but it works only in a specific
context and again the goal of those
networks is to work in a in a very large
number of nodes where you cannot trust
everybody clearly so you need to find a
way to incentivize the nodes to
participate in a consensus algorithm and
all that is based on game theory it's
very elegant I really encourage you to
read the white paper by the way to
understand video but this is another
advantage of that another goal of this
cryptocurrency is to discourage Forks
and build trust why do I say that well
basically as I said you cannot use the
cryptocurrency as creating one network
in another one so you have all the
interest in the world to keep your value
in I mean in a place where there are a
lot of people if you start creating your
own cryptocurrency where there are only
three people mining and you're just in
your own corner then your cryptocurrency
is basically worthless it's like monkey
money you know monopoly stuff so clearly
the goal here is to build some build up
some value and encourage people to stay
in one
so this cryptocurrency are not monkey
monkey money can we compare
cryptocurrency Bitcoin or atrium to euro
and dollars yeah it can be I will will
see that later but also it can be used
here and that's also one of the interest
is that if you build some services on
top of the of the blockchain then you
can make people pay with it it's
basically like as if you had a credit
card processing facility built into the
network
so you might as well use that so any
need since you can buy cryptocurrency in
euros or in dollars or whatever then you
can really pay for stuff and on etherium
again since the goal was to be able to
run generic software programs on top of
the blockchain you have to somehow pay
for the execution of those contracts and
this is also done in in cryptocurrency
so as you said as we said it started as
a currency and right now you can
exchange a lot of those cryptocurrency
against regular fiat currency like
dollars and euros and so on you can go
to marketplaces like cracking there's
Cohen base there are plenty of politics
between X and so on you can sell your
dollars and buy Bitcoin or ether or some
other coins in exchange and you can sell
them as well and there's a there's
marketplace but it seems volatile now
it's very volatile here we consider the
the value here it's very volatile
somehow so it's too risky to to do that
kind of investment how did you check it
today with the election no effect yeah
of course it it has some big effect I
think the Bitcoin like took 30 dollars
overnight anyway and another important
aspect is that it's not just a
speculation currency somehow especially
for Bitcoin since it's been around for
quite some time you can even buy stuff
in Bitcoin so you can buy pizza for
example it's a very common example but
you cannot mostly buy online services
like hosting VPN bounty
of the French provider they accept
Bitcoin payments so that's the kind of
things that you can do but again we are
not interested in that financial aspect
even though it started there what's
really interested in what is really
interesting is the the concept behind it
and the architecture that comes with it
and because it opens way for way many
more applications than just the FinTech
applications basically show us the other
usage of the blockchain
indeed so in order to understand what is
it useful for let's come back to trying
to understand the basic logic so if we
come back to the logic of a payment
transaction it's almost as if you have a
state s1 okay with two accounts and each
account as a given balance and bitcoins
for example okay and then you want to
transfer an amount X from account a to
account B so what you do is you run a
transaction with a very simple bits
piece of code that checks if the balance
of a is greater than X and if it is then
you transfer the amount you decrease f
of X and you increase B of X and you end
up with a new state okay so it's
basically going from one state to
another yes but you say that a block can
be generating generated in several
minutes so how do you avoid the double
spending problem that's indeed a big
problem because this kind of
transactions you can create them on each
node in the network and then we need to
find some agreement and make sure that
if I spend a certain amount of bitcoins
for example in the transaction I cannot
spend the exact same amount on another
transaction later and have both these
transactions and in the network that's
what we call this double spending
problem and the way this is done is
really with this blockchain system okay
with cryptography and with the consensus
algorithm the goal is to really avoid
and completely prevent the possibility
of of reusing the same Bitcoin twice so
that's the payment blockchain now if we
try to take a step back and make the
concept a little more generic
and consider a more generic transaction
here in state s1 each account is not
associated with just one variable but
potentially many variables okay and the
transaction itself can be much more
complicated than the simple test and
more viable modification that we saw
earlier it can be any combination of
tests variable modifications and even
loops to implement some complex business
logic and the goal is to reach another
state where the variables have changed
value now compared to the case that we
had before of course this has some
important implications mostly that those
variables take up some space some memory
space okay and also that the transaction
itself is somehow more complex and it
and depending on the transaction the the
code is going to be more or less complex
so it's going to take some processing
power as well so if we translate that in
the new blockchain you could say that
each transaction has a different size if
you want and takes up different amounts
of memory and processing power so that's
really what transaction block chain more
it looks like so it's like a wall wart
computer indeed what we saw here is that
since the transactions become really
generic it's basically like a giant
Universal global state machine human so
it's a world computer and we have some
use cases that that could benefit form
from this generate transactions so as we
said these are really general
transactions so basically everywhere
there is a registry of all the
transactions that nobody should be able
to tamper with that's the key element
there is an opportunity for a blockchain
really so for example of course the
FinTech industry is really interested in
that and not just for currencies but for
the related products for securities for
insurance there are plenty of cases
where this can be interesting but you
can think of plenty of other examples
for example in an election oh just
random example you can make sure that
when somebody registers on the registry
of voters he cannot do to it twice and
places of our in the vote in the ballot
in the ballot box it cannot do it twice
as well so you need to keep track of
everything that happens so it has some
very interesting applications in in the
democracy sector I would say we can also
think of health care so for example
organ donors you don't want two people
to be able to change their order on this
list of organ donor of organ patients I
would say patients needing an organ
donation and there are plenty of aspects
here as well as medical records and so
on another application is in everything
related to innovation like patents and
so on it's also the same thing what you
want is to be able to prove that others
get at a given date you registered for
you described an invention and you are
the owner of this invention and all that
can be guaranteed by the the blockchain
as well another example is in everything
related to contract and document
notarization every especially so
contracts like marriage contracts land
ownership of course you want to keep
some some order in that and and make
sure that you cannot I don't know marry
two wives at the same time or yeah sell
the same piece of land to two people
anyway
it's possible plenty of applications
there of course in governance and when I
say governance I mean government but
also in organizations in companies in
NGOs whatever whenever there is a record
of decisions when laws need to be
written and some and so on then the
blockchain can be interesting as well
and you have applications in education
as well so you don't want to be people
to be able to say that they have a
diploma they have graduated from a
university they didn't and and this is
the kind of things where the blockchain
can be really interesting and these are
just a few examples by the way of
potential applications but everywhere
you have this notion of a registry of
transaction that needs to be ordered and
should not be and should be kept
absolutely safe then there is a
potential for for abrupt change your
luck change can we play this
I'm not convinced sorry yeah you're
right because those applications they
already are implemented you already have
a patent office you already have
notaries who who notarize documents you
already have governments and elections
and so on
so what's really interesting to
understand is what the blockchain brings
to the table here so basically those
transactions are business processes
okay they're the makeup business
processes and right now those business
processes are either run by people or by
complex computer systems and sometimes
by a combination of the two of course
and in order to run those transactions
and secure them and keep them safe and
and keep the integrity of the data
somehow you need to put to setup some
very complex systems okay and what the
blockchain brings is to automate all of
that and provide a lot of features that
normal in in normal computer
applications you have to provide you
have to build custom or to build the
middleware and plenty of tools and
frameworks and so on it replaces all
that with features that are built into
the network and especially on the
security side of things so basically all
of that in the blockchain world is
implemented with the concept of a smart
contract okay so a smart contract is
essentially a piece of code but a piece
of code that is secured and that secured
by meaning it is stored in the
blockchain itself so at the moment it's
stored in the blockchain it has it's
given an address and you can check at
which date and by whom it was submitted
you know exactly when you run this code
you will know exactly which version of
the code it is and you can potentially
link it with a source code you can know
what it does exactly you can monitor it
very easily and whenever you interact
with that smart contract when you
basically call services in a contract
they run those transactions they run on
in transaction sorry those operations in
running transactions that are themselves
secured and logged into this giant
ledger if you want and those
transactions they run on network and
then they are replicated in every node
of the network again very securely very
safely so that the same
runs on every node on a network giving
exactly the same result
and is it similar to the notion of
distributed application so indeed that's
basically what you are building here is
you you could you could say that smart
contracts are micro services somehow
okay just to put a buzz word in there
anyway and so really the notion of a
distributed application or what we call
so the app is a set of smart contracts
with the user interface because those
smart contracts are just pieces of code
but we need to find it to have a way to
interact with them to call them somehow
and so the way we do that is first of
all we deploy those smart contracts so
again when you deploy them they are
given a specific address pretty much
like when you instantiate a variable it
has it has a memory address of the same
concept here and those contracts they
can collaborate with one another they
can call one another again like micro
services and also those contracts they
expose api's okay that you can call and
the way you call them usually is going
through a UI so you need some human user
at some point to say okay I'm gonna
trigger this business process basically
and then you let the contract do its do
its work now what's really important is
that as we said when you call a smart
contract you essentially create a new
transaction so if there is a new
transactions there are transaction fees
so this kind of application needs to run
in a specific context and if especially
in a new kind of browser if you want in
the same way that the first world wide
web applications needed Netscape and
everything that came after it we need a
new kind of browser to that for that
because we need a special thing in the
browser itself it's called a wallet and
what this wallet contains is two things
first of all it it contains all the
cryptographic keys that you need in
order to authenticate and interact with
the network and also it contains the
stock of some cryptocurrency that you
can use in order to pay for the
transactions that you trigger and of
course this new browser is connected
with the network in order to replicate
the state across all the nodes and to
have some example of
so this concept again is implemented
already there are plenty of examples of
apps of course the most obvious one the
FIR the very first the app ever was
Bitcoin and you could say that the smart
contract here is very simple there's
just one and it does what we said checks
the balance and there's some transfer it
can do some more fancy things but the
essence is here there are others for
example be proof they do document
notarization like we said so you can
register a document and say okay this
data registered this document with this
hash so of course you don't store the
document in and the blockchain will see
what why later but yeah basically you
can authenticate documents another
application and that's kind of a new
kind of application so there are plenty
of ways that the the blockchain can
solve existing problems better but it
can also create solutions for problems
that couldn't be solved before and this
kind of thing so the augur is really a
prediction market so what a prediction
market is is the key you can make a
prediction okay and any user can say for
example I made a prediction that in 2020
there will be autonomous cars on Belgian
roads and I bet some amount on that and
it's easy to verify we can check on the
first of January of 2020 and if I win my
bets then I get the rewards and
everybody you bet the same thing or
against it well you guess it's a it's a
betting system what's really interesting
in that is the transaction here are
really really small so it's not really
interesting in a in a traditional credit
card processing world I would say but it
becomes interesting on on a blockchain
where the transaction fees are so small
and also it can be used by politicians
and governments in place governments in
place sorry - yeah check what people bet
on and get a sense of where the the
future is going somehow so that's really
interesting application is still very
early but there are some interesting
aspects to that
another one is lo3 energy so this these
guys what they are doing is that they're
experimenting with the concept of smart
grids and micro grids for electricity
distribution so basically how do you
organize transactions between
individuals in a neighborhood who each
have their own
windmill or their own solar panels on
the roof and how do they transact and
interact with one another regarding the
electricity relation the notion of
prosumers exactly good consumers are
also producers indeed and there are
plenty of applications like that there's
provenance to trace goods basically
there is that's an example of a Belgian
application by the way than by KBC they
did a crowdfunding platform and yeah I
think that's pretty much it by the way
this one they were kind of limited
because legal issues I mean they
basically created like a secondary
marketplace for a start-up shares if you
want and those shares are not really
recognized as an official and legal
financial instrument so technically it's
working it's perfect but the government
said no so do you mean that the
blockchain can replace all all the
solutions well right now all of that is
very experimental so it's still a little
bit early but still it's very promising
okay
so indeed we saw a few applications here
but the next question here comes okay
what is it applicable to everything that
you said is it a silver bullet ah I
don't know can I do everything with that
can it solve the Trump election problems
today we have to make at least one to
about something a representation
otherwise just to remind people that
they are not dreaming so indeed what we
said is that the blockchain at the very
basis is a set of design patterns it's
really a set of concept and as we saw
for all those who read the Gang of Four
book if you try to shove every design
pattern in a given application then
you're in big trouble
everything basically when you have a
hammer everything looks like a nail so
the first rule of the blockchain is that
you don't need a blockchain that's the
very first rule of engagement it's a
same thing for distributed computing and
that kind of thing anyway so
that's already true because of the
limitations that we're going to talk
about but also of course it's very early
we said it's still very experimental so
be careful with that let's start with
the notion of unanimity because I'm
really scared by the fact that the data
is everywhere so indeed it's part of the
concept at least for for for the public
for public blockchain is that all the
data is distributed across the nodes in
a network and you have some specialized
websites like ether scan for a theorem
or blockchain I've done info for the
Bitcoin where you can actually see every
transaction in a network and you can
even see the balance of each user
account you just can't see who it is
direct behind it and that's the whole
point the way you entered you the way
you enforce security is by not knowing
who's hiding behind the identifiers so
it's kind of to balance out this fact
that you need the data to check that is
consistent and that is to be able to
audit it somehow but you don't know who
is behind it and you also mentioned the
notion of transaction fees that means
that I have to pay something that's
another important aspect so indeed as we
said the the the miners need to be
incentivized motivated to participate in
the the consensus algorithm and all that
is done with cryptocurrencies and there
is some amounts again for on Bitcoin is
24.5 bitcoins are created there are
mined on every block but at the end the
miners will only be rewarded with
transaction fees so it's very important
that there are some transaction fees and
basically the amount of transaction fees
that you put on a transaction is what
decides when it's going to be integrated
in the next block so it's very important
to consider the fact that you need to
pay some amount with each transaction
now just to give you an idea I took this
transaction that's for an amount of five
Bitcoin which right now is about three
thousand euros and the transaction fees
is about sixteen cents dollars I do I
have to pay to read the data from the
blockchain you have to pay to modify the
data to do the transfers themselves but
if you need for example when you check
the balances on those websites or when
you just read the states of the ethereum
blockchain then you don't need to pay
it's just when you modify the data
itself and how many transactions are
processed by the blockchain yeah that's
a good question because of course when
you do all that in a distributed fashion
it's it has some very important impacts
in terms of performance so just to give
you an idea for example the visa network
if we take a point of comparison right
now they process an average of two
thousand transactions a second and
that's just the average they can go much
higher than that there are some peaks
they already have some been some peaks
at above forty thousand I think so
technically they can support a lot more
on the the PayPal system which is also
centralized by the way they process an
average of above hundred transactions a
second on Bitcoin it's seven
transactions a second maximum it's not
an average it's the top capacity of the
network it's gonna exchange a little bit
in the coming months thanks to some
improvements and in the algorithm
normally but that's pretty much where
you are and on theorem it's a little bit
more it's about twenty right now but
again very very the speed of the network
is much slower than traditional
centralized system so you have to take
that into account when you decide on the
relevance of the blockchain for your
application how can I create synchronous
application that's also another
important aspect so basically when you
create a transaction on on the network
you need to wait for it to be confirmed
to be spread across the entire network
and that takes some more time on the
distributed system than a centralized
system of course so on the Bitcoin
blockchain the the general rule of thumb
is that you have to wait at least six
blocks to be sure that the diversity
your transaction is integrated in the
main chain and that it's gonna it's not
gonna go away anytime soon anytime at
all and so since each block is produced
every ten minutes
you basically have to wait for one hour
in order to be sure that the transaction
that you sent is actually validated on
the etherion blockchain is a little bit
faster because the blocks are produced
faster every 17 seconds on average and
you need to wait for 12 blocks so let's
around to south
100 seconds still very slow but we made
a progress and of course when you when
you do a call on a REST API on a
centralized system to insert some data
in a database for example well it takes
a few hundred milliseconds maximum so
that's also something that you have to
integrate if you want to do real-time
synchronous applications or almost
synchronous and it's going to be a
challenge okay so the blockchain is
still created by humans or not may I so
I can imagine that you know happens
if we have to to upgrade the blockchain
how hard how do you do that's also an
important limitation because we said one
of the key aspects of the Ledger's that
it should be immutable and if we want
the ledger to be stable immutable that
way it means that means that the
software that decide how the blockchain
is built should be stable as well and
indeed on the blockchain the system
devolution of the system itself is very
slow the reason for that is that
basically as I said each node runs a
version of the of the software okay and
if you change the rules by which nodes
blocks get added to the blockchain then
you you you you run a potential risk of
created a fork in the chain itself so
there are mainly two kinds of those
Forks there are soft Forks okay that is
a special kind of of modifying the rules
by which you accept the blocks and it's
kind of complicated but the consequence
of that of those soft Forks is that they
are I would say less dangerous because
you mostly need the miners so the nodes
that participate in the consensus
algorithm to upgrade their software if
you have a majority of the miners then
you're good to go but there is another
version some modifications of the of the
the system can be done in software with
some require actually a hard fork it's
another kind of change on the rules and
this time it requires everybody to
switch so for example recently there was
such a case on the if you're in
blockchain there was a big problem that
was noticed there was a big bug
somewhere and in order to fix the
problem they had to do a hard fork and
because of that now you have basically
two version of
theorem the same cryptocurrency has
split into two different currencies
there's aetherium main I would say ETH
and then you have a theorem classic et
Cie still being mined and you have two
versions of reality basically so that's
a risk that's very that's very high so
because of that yeah we tend to avoid I
mean slow down on the upgrades to the
system and that yeah I mean you have to
be very careful because before pushing
something into production so we know
that size matters so what's the size of
the database indeed because since every
node on the network as thin as every all
the data basically has all the
transactions stored you need to be
careful about that just to give you an
example on the Bitcoin blockchain in
last June the whole blockchain when you
really stall the transactions it's about
70 gigs and it grows by 4 gigs a month
the ethereum blockchain is a little
younger it's like 2 years old and it
already has 22 gigabytes and it grows by
about 2 gigs a month and that is because
well you have all the transactions so
that has two important impacts first of
all you don't store all of data in a
blockchain you try to minimize the
quantity of data that you put in every
transaction and the second aspect that
is important is that it limits the kind
of device where you can run a full full
node so for example right now if you
want to run a full node on your smart
phone well you need the big ones with a
lot of storage if I have to create a
brand-new application how to decide if
the blockchain is suitable for me that's
a good question because right now we as
we have seen there are quite a few
limitations and there's a price to pay
if you want you to choose the blockchain
as an architecture and and you need
somehow a decision model now the I would
say the easiest one is this one oh okay
it's a one question it's in but if it
was the only decision model then we
wouldn't be here okay dan so of course
there are others we put the link here
and basically the questions are roughly
the same okay do you need a shared
database do you need it to be secured
how many nodes do you have
how much do you trust them there are a
whole source of questions and it's
really an active field of research right
now so there are plenty of alternate
versions of those blockchain decision
models that's the one from I think IBM
for the hyper ledger blockchain that's
another one I really like this one that
works pretty much like you know a test
in a Cosmo magazine you just check the
boxes and the more boxes you have
checked the more likely you are to be in
the case that's relevant for the
blockchain okay I left the link here I
really encourage you to have a look at
this art I'm convinced
yeah it's me I'm ready to start mine
your application on blockchain so I have
to to download IntelliJ for blockchain
that's correct
No well well first of all you need to
gather some information you need to it
because for now we just explained the
concepts and I hope we indeed convinced
you that it is worth having a look at
but the first thing is that you need to
take some some information and really
it's a very very dynamic community and
you need to participate in the in the in
the in the discussions and there are a
lot of them so I just put some links
here a lot of discussions happen on on
reddit for other Ã«there 'm of Bitcoin
or all the other versions you have some
special special news sites as well some
magazines there are of course a version
of versions of Stack Overflow for these
kind of problems you have some websites
or some very interesting news there are
even some slack groups where the
discussions are somewhat interesting
somehow and and of course you have the
network monitors that I showed earlier
to really monitor how the transactions
work and understand the logic behind it
so those are the communities that are
really interested no JetBrains so again
just a few before we dive into that
there again I just put the slide here
for you had you to have the links feel
free to to have
and we focused on VidCon if anything
because those are the two main I would
say public blockchains right now and
they're really interesting and there's
some really interesting documentation
here there so indeed a few pieces of
advice since we've started developing on
the blockchain is ourselves well first
of all if you want to go to production
quickly if you have an idea that really
need needs to go live soon have a look
at the Bitcoin blockchain as I said it
was designed originally for financial
transactions but you can do some more
fancy stuff with it and to some extent
when you're smart contracts are really
simple and especially if they don't
require loops because there is no
concept of a loop in the Bitcoin
blockchain itself well you can use the
Bitcoin blockchain
it's very more it's much more mature
than the Bitcoin sorry that Nia theorem
blockchain so it's a very important
aspect to have a look at now if you have
something more complex then you need to
read some documentation and get into
more generic block chains now be careful
the documentation goes out of date very
fast because everything is moving like
crazy it's like the Farwest and you've
new build tool appears pretty much every
day's almost like JavaScript no anyway
and did you you asked about intelligent
for for for the blockchain well if the
is there a JetBrains
person in the room please please have a
look at it oh I mean we need some more I
mean the development tools are really a
nightmare right now it's basically
sublime text and your comment line not
killing and it creates a lot of problems
regarding validation bug detection and
so on so we definitely need to improve
the development tools around this and as
I said forget about mobile apps for now
if your client needs really needs a
mobile interface then you're pretty much
screwed for now things are moving there
are some ways to lighten the note
somehow but it's it's still very complex
so even if it's an early technology do
you see any kind of opportunities for
developers watching developers there are
a lot I mean of course you
you've heard of it otherwise you
wouldn't be here I guess and you've seen
all those announcements by banks working
even MasterCard released the blockchain
API last week I mean everybody is
working on it especially the banks right
now but it's not just them just
insisting on that it's not just for
FinTech and and indeed there are more
and more projects that are launched
sometimes most of the time there are
proof of concepts but there are some
really interesting applications for the
for the years to come and most of those
companies I mean they're looking for
blockchain developers whatever that
means so there's a big opportunity to
train on those technologies and also to
make yourself known if you if you know
them so for that we have one more thing
so you've made I've noticed this chain
skills logo at the bottom right corner
of our presentations site and I we have
started working on this thing called
change skills for now the main goal is a
network for people who want to learn
about the blockchain and share the
resources that they find so if you go to
change schools comm you have this blog
where we share other resources that we
find right now we're working on two more
initiatives the first one is the online
training especially on aetherium
development so if you would like to
train and discover how you develop real
distributed applications on the big on
the ethereal blockchain feel free to
register and also what we are creating
is some kind of a network for blockchain
developers to find projects and for
companies to find blockchain developers
and I'll let you guess the technology
that we are going to use to implement
that network anyway so if you're
interested in any of those two
initiatives
feel free to register on their added
joint chain skills calm and we will keep
you posted about the next steps and
that's it for us thank you thank you
and we didn't even hope that you would
have five whole minutes for questions so
are there any questions there is a
microphone there there's a microphone
over there if you want otherwise you can
shout really loud
I will repeat yeah bingo we found the
quality first question I was expecting
so the question is we mentioned the
difference between private and public
blockchain so right now as I said the
the the industry that's the most
interested in the blockchain revolution
is the banking sector and the banking
sector as you might guess they really
like the distributed aspect of things
because they see some potential for more
efficiency and lower costs especially
compared to things like I don't know
Western Union Swift
and all those networks they try to find
some alternatives but the decentralized
aspect now they don't like that any and
that much so they it's like they are
buying Ferraris but they're taking the
engine away so we're still trying to see
how it's going to go but so that's what
the private blockchains are basically so
they remove the decentralized aspect of
it and instead of having this consensus
algorithm that is based on mining and
and and proof of work or proof of stake
or whatever they have a more
permissioned consensus algorithm meaning
that you have special nodes that are
very well identified and certified to
have the authority to say this is going
to be in the next block in the chain and
this way they kind of avoid all the
problems that come with the public block
change if you want but they also lose a
lot of the advantages so there are some
alternative like that have a look at IP
Ledger for example they are looking a
lot into that so the private blockchain
sector there's basically a hyper ledger
is an interesting implementation of that
and then the banks are trying working on
a consortium called l3 especially on on
one technical coda we don't know what it
does yet it's completely opaque that's
the problem I mean okay anyway and
they're they're really working on some
private blockchains
I'm not big fan of it but okay that's
where the industry is going for now yeah
sorry how do you prove your identity so
well basically you don't really need to
because for I mean at least for most
applications you don't really need to
especially I mean even for Bitcoin for
example you could say okay but we have
to identify who's behind it no we don't
the only thing we need to make sure is
that you cannot spend twice the same
amount and so on now if we don't know
who is behind a specific account that's
not a big deal it's about ownership but
then that on some application is going
to be interesting for example on the
line on the land ownership case that I
mentioned before indeed in that case
you're going to need some some way to
link a blockchain address so an
identifier with a real person and for
the for that for that for now we don't
have any solutions for that that's one
of the ways that some people think that
the role of banks could evolve just to
maintain this link between the real
person they know your customer basically
and the identifier some other people
think that nation-states should play
that role and build that kind of
identification but clearly when you have
new skills where you need that kind of
identification it's a problem but in
it's interesting to think if you really
need it to wonder if you really need it
in some cases you think it's it comes of
course it's it's obvious but even in
industry like the banking industry where
you have all those know your customers
rules and so on well you didn't really
need it and it works right now without
being able to identify users yes
so it's the remark is that we should
have started the discussion by
explaining the difference between the
private and a public blockchain and
especially the fact that on a private
blockchain you don't necessarily need a
cryptocurrency you don't need a token
value and you can exchange without it to
be honest with you we are very
opinionated we don't believe in the
concept of private blockchains for us
it's not even a blockchain anymore it's
an interesting concept
the fact that you distribute the data a
little more but for not for for for us
the real interesting aspect is the
public blockchain and everything that it
plays with game theory and so on and we
think that there are already a lot of
interesting application in that field
again I think most of the the current
there the way we see it there are
basically two approaches you have this
New York architecture this new enabler
of solutions basically you can either
try to shove this solution into existing
systems or you can try to build a new
kind of organizational to around that so
for us I mean the the jury's still out
and we'll see where where it goes but
indeed there's this difference okay
thank you guys time is up we will be
around so don't hesitate to feel free to
come to us thanks a lot thank you very
much all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
