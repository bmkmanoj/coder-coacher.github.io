talk about cutting your giving you talk
about cutting in productions yes I am
for those of you who don't know Kotlin
is a language that was unveiled by
jetbrains for the JVM which specifically
works really well with Android
development yeah so it works very well
with Android development because it's
compatible with Java 6 and it's given
that it's kind of concise and cuts down
boilerplate code we've had tremendous
success in the Android Market but it was
never originally developed for Android
so it's an industrial language that we
created primarily at the beginning for
ourselves and we don't do Android
development we do desktop when we do
server-side development so it is it's
broad in terms of usage and it's saying
it's much easier I found I was playing
with it last night it's a lot more
intuitive than languages like Scala for
example because it's very like Java yeah
and we've done that on purpose we try to
make it very similar to languages
well-known such as Java C sharp
JavaScript and kind of get rid of some
of the boilerplate code of those aspects
it is you could say some people say it
it's very similar to Scala as well and
in fact it is because it's been inspired
by Scala as it's been inspired by many
other languages but we're more
restrictive in that we don't allow many
things that Scala allow so we try and we
believe in that way it kind of helps
prevent complexity in code bases by
giving too much versatility into what
you can do with the language so one
point one is in beta it was I mean we
don't have a timeline yet do we for a
release but I'm to be honest I mean I
think it's going to be sometime in the
next quarter in this quarter hopefully I
don't know how official that is if it's
unofficial though then I just didn't say
that but yeah but we've hit beta now so
we're kind of polishing it up now
what can we expect in one program so
there's a bunch of new features I think
one of the biggest things are
co-routines which we're tagging right
now is experimental so it's it's there
we've developed it and we've got library
support for it but we've there's kind of
like a compiler or a flag that says this
is experimental because we really want
to see people use it and then decide ok
we've gone the right way and one of the
aspects of co-routines I mean you know
about a synchronous programming and how
people are trying to avoid that all the
blocking so instead of going down one
specific route like for instance a chef
has gone down a sink await keyword route
what we've decided to do is basically
implement the generic general
co-routines and then provide library
functions on top of that so you have
like we have bindings to our X we have a
sink a weight we have yield all of these
things however they're not keywords as
part of the language but they're just
library functions and the way that
Kotlin is as a programming language it
actually allows you to have very success
functions that often feel part of the
language but they're actually not
they're just functions what else can we
expect so we've got type aliases
basically you can say like one type is
the equivalent of another in terms of
name it's like giving it a different
name right so I can say if I'm using for
instance a string to represent a
customer name I could do like string
equal you know customer name equals
string and that runtime is still a
string but during you know as you're
writing the code for clarity you it kind
of gives you better understanding of
what it is that you're dealing with
gives you more context we have also
we've been working very hard on the
JavaScript side so Kotlin when we first
shipped 1.0 main target was JVM and
JavaScript was experimental and now with
1.1 you know with removing the tag of
experimental on JavaScript so you can
also target JavaScript what else we've
got
a little bit more things in terms of
deconstruction of lambdas and variables
so you can kind of like deconstruct them
in multiple variables to again increase
the
readability of it targeting more JDK 8
specific so if you given Carlin has a
standard library now we're saying okay
if you're going to target Java 8
we will optimize some of the things that
we're using with with your code right
you tell us you're not using Java 6 so
we won't use like anonymous classes or
representing lambdas will actually use
Java 8 cut down to the most used
features well it's kind of saying that
if you don't require backwards
compatibility then we'll take advantage
of that ok so it's like making instead
of having one standard library we're now
providing you the standard library with
the target that you want to hit so yeah
so those are some of the things that
we've added there's also some
improvements around sealed classes so
Cortland doesn't have the concept of
abstract data types where you know a
type can have B of one type or another
right and so we sorry abstract algebraic
data types so it's it's yeah I know it's
like you know but they're always ADT I
keep saying abstract so we've the way
that you would do it in Cortland is you
would have classes and then inside those
classes you would have kind of like in
our inner classes but class contained
that inherit from your outer class it
that's still possible and then you would
add the sealed keyword which would
basically close off all of the hierarchy
saying that you know that you're not
gonna get another class that inherits
from this upper class right so then you
could kind of simulate the algebraic
data type so that is still possible but
it kind of people were saying you know
this doesn't look that great having all
of this code inside a single class so
now we allow you to separate the classes
into a single file and then just it just
makes it nicer to read and kind of
maintain in a sense because in cut-in
1.1 you could have functions and classes
in the same or different files is that
right yeah you can still do that and you
can do that and you can or you could
always do that what we're saying now is
that if you you trying to create sealed
classes all of those subclasses don't
have to be part of the outer class they
can be outside of
after class but in the same file that's
restricted to the same file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
