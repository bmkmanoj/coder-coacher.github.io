welcome everyone thanks for coming um
we're gonna be talking about a tool
called the checker framework that can
help prove your program cracked or find
bugs in it so the reason we're all here
is that your code sucks and we're here
because our code sucks too and we're all
gonna try to work through this together
I'm Michael Ernst this is very nerdy
--dl so software fields are a huge
problem they cost over 300 billion
dollars a year
one particular bug cost over three
hundred dollars three hundred billion
dollars just the y2k problem but it
doesn't yeah I don't have to wait a year
to see the problems the night capital
group which by the way doesn't exist
anymore lost half a billion dollars in
30 minutes due to a bug in their trading
software and both the US and European
Space Agency's have also blown about
that much money in just a few seconds
dude again due to a software error now
these are the cheap failures these are
the ones that aren't that expensive
because they can also kill people people
have died in airplane crashes because of
faults and radar radar software the
Patriot missile system targeted a an
Allied barracks a blackout on the east
coast caused by a software fault caused
at least 11 excess deaths and cancer
therapy machines caused many deaths at
least eight software's now the costs are
about 25% of all medical device recalls
today so we want to try to figure out
prevent these so we have a solution or
at least a partial solution we'll type
checking and a tool called the checker
framework that's or so you can download
and use it today and we'll tell you a
little bit about that so the fundamental
problem with Javas so it's a tool for
java the fundamental problem with java
system is that it's too weak it prevents
you from putting hello world into an INT
but it doesn't prevent other types of
errors for instance here's a piece of
code at the bottom of this slide and it
can actually fail with an exception
do people know what
yes so it might fail with an IO
exception that's a good guess this one
doesn't actually fail in that way so it
may hang waiting for input that's not a
failure that's just waiting for input
that's what it supposed to do but this
can actually throw a
nullpointerexception
system that console can return null for
instance if you're running on an
embedded device or an essentially
anything that's headless the type system
doesn't tell you this the type system
lets you compile and run your code fine
but then it fails at runtime here's
another example this will always fail
every time will always crash do people
know why
so sorry yeah it that's correct
Thanks it will give you an unsupported
operation exception
why empty list is unmodifiable it
doesn't support ad but the Java compiler
doesn't know this and so it lets you
write this code run it and have it fail
at runtime again these are the cheap
fails in the easy cases the hard cases
are ones that are silent for instance if
you create a map and then side-effect a
key in that map you'll corrupt the map
who knows what will happen after that
another error is a a sequel injection
attack so if you execute a some string
that comes from a user then your in you
they could get access to all of your
data or destroy it and there's lots of
other prior errors I'm sure you've seen
them as well so here's an example of one
particular type system so the property
that we want to enforce is that our
program never sends unencrypted data
over the network only encrypted data
should be sent over the network so we
want to distinguish two different kinds
of information encrypted information and
unencrypted information so here's a
simple example where we have an
operation that takes some input string
and sends that input string over the
network and then we have some user of
that operation that uses passes and
unencrypted data as the input to this
method does anyone see what's wrong with
this operation with this example does
this hold up the property that we want
to enforce or is a property violated
the property is violated in this example
but where's the defecting in this code
is the defect in the invocation of
center network or in the invocation of
the operation the thing is without the
specification we cannot decide both of
them could be the kind of the defect in
the software because you don't have a
specification you don't know what is the
intended behavior if you use these
annotations you can make it explicit
what to expect the behavior is so one
specification is that the operation
should always take an encrypted string
as the input and then this
implementation of the operation is
correct
you always take an encrypted string as
input and you can send an encrypted
string to the network but then the
invocation of the operation is invalid
because you pass something that's
unencrypted to the supposedly encrypted
operation the second possible
specification is that the parameter is
unencrypted then invocation is valid but
the implementation of this method is not
you cannot just pass this unencrypted
input string to the network because the
network operation should only get
encrypted strings so by using these
specifications you can make explicit
what the intended behavior of your
application is instead of having only no
knowledge about what to refine behaviors
you use these annotations to specify
what the intended behavior is so now the
implementation of this method is
incorrect now let's look at an example
of how to do this so could you switch us
to the demo please so I want to show you
an example of a demo about sequel
injection so this is some code that I
it's called personal blog I unloaded
from the internet so it's probably and
the this blog lets people make accounts
and sign in add comments search for
comments so it's backed by a sequel
database and here is a routine that
executes a sequel query
so this is supposed to take his input an
untainted string if if it just used data
from the user then you could have a
sequel injection attack so let's run
something called the tainting checker
that determines whether or not you
really this program is really only
passing on tainted data to this execute
routine executing and the answer is it's
not so here's an example so it says it
found a tainted string where it required
an untainted string and in particular
that's right here category so this is in
a routine called get post by category if
you look at the rest of the program this
is really supposed to be untainted to
everywhere that it's called it's
supposed to be your an untainted value
is supposed to be passed so let's make
that change and let's run the type
checker again to see what happens so
there's still a problem here's a call to
that routine we just changed get posts
by category and again we're passing in a
variable called request category here
and the type checker says although it
requires an untainted string that
procedure is is specified as taking an
untainted string request category is
actually a tainted string so let's see
where request category is defined is to
find right here so this get parameter
takes data directly from the user query
and then it carefully ensures that it's
not null because that could cause a null
pointer exception somewhat and it passes
it straight into a routine that
eventually calls execute query in other
words a malicious user could exploit
this what's missing is validation in
fact everywhere in the entire program
except this one line proper validation
is done
so I've just added a call to validate
right here and we can run the tainting
checker
and time and this time it found no
problems so this is cool because it
found a bug and we're able to fix the
bug but I think there's something even
better about this and that's that we
have a guarantee that there are no more
sequel injections anywhere in this
program that's the kind of proof that we
want to be able to provide for programs
can you switch back to the slides thank
you so now let's think a little bit
about what these pluggable type systems
are so to express your security property
or your property about the program and
in a formalized way and you put it into
a type system you formalize it as a type
system you annotate the application with
this specification so you make explicit
what assumptions you have about the
behavior of your program and then as a
third step you use it a pluggable type
checker to enforce the correct usage of
your application so in our case the
pluggable type system is a plug-in to
the java compiler and an annotation
processor that you can run like any
other annotation processor the other
output is standard java ever format
messages so it's very easy to integrate
them to other tools let's think about
the workflow in standard type-checking
we make the chavo compiler happy once
the java compiler is happy we get the
executable but we don't have all these
additional guarantees that we would want
from the executable if the channel
compiler gives us errors we need to fix
them without fixing the others we don't
get the executable and there are two
kinds of fixes either it found a real
problem and we fix that back or we just
need to make the type checker happy so
sometimes we need to add additional Java
types to make the type system happy
these additional optional or pluggable
type checkers had a similar loop we add
an additional type checker that checks
these enhanced properties and there are
two answers again so we either get a
warning from the optional type checker
and then either it found a real bug or
we need to make the type checker happy
so we need to add additional annotations
to make the type checker happy once the
optional type check is happy we actually
have a guarantee about the behavior of
the application if no no more warnings
that the property that we all want to
enforce actually holds the nice thing
about this is that the executable gets
generated as soon as the Java compiler
is happy you can perform manual testing
or whatever and then you run the
optional type checker to get the
additional security guarantees another
nice thing is that you can run multiple
optional type checkers you decide what
properties are interesting to you and
you enable only those type checks so you
can pick and choose what properties you
want to enforce but a sequel injection
attack so important to you or whether
you care more about now point the
exemptions so you have free to choose
this tool the so-called checker
framework is a plug-in to the Java
compiler that you run as an annotation
processor the nice thing here is that
because it uses the standard Java
compiler message format it's very easy
to integrate into all the different
built tools we provide an eclipse
plug-in it's easy to integrate the
NetBeans and intelligent similarly we
provide instructions for how to run it
from maven Gradle and a few other build
systems and finally we have a website
from which you can run small snippets
and just play around with the different
type systems so if you want to just get
a feel about how this behaves you go to
this website and play around with
examples for the different type systems
so you really can just make an
experiment with the mountainous checker
and see how the annotations behave so
let's look at another example this
regular expression example can you
switch to this laptop
so here we have a small application a
main program that takes two parameters
we call pattern dot compile and then we
match against the content string that we
have then in the end if we found the
match we output the first group so who
knows what might go wrong with this
does anyone see any problems in this
code you don't know how many comment
line arguments there that's one problem
exactly so you still see the pattern
syntax exception one problem is that the
input that the user provides might not
be a valid regular expression there's a
third kind of problem so let's try so
here the first parameter is the regular
expression I didn't find a way how to
make this font bigger unfortunately so
this is AP star star matching against
the string ABC if we run this we get the
pattern syntax exception so now let's
fix fix the regular expression and make
it a B dot star matched against ABC now
we get an index out of bounds exception
so the problem is the regular expression
matched against the string but we didn't
have any capturing groups in this string
and in this code once the code once the
regular expression matches we just
access capturing Group one but there's
no guarantee that the regular expression
contains a capturing group so we have a
tight system that helps you enforce that
all regular expressions that you try to
compile our valid regular expressions so
that you never get this pattern syntax
exception at one time and the second
property that we enforce is that you
always statically know how many
capturing groups are in the string so we
do this so let's show how the regular
expression checker works
so we run this checker from eclipse and
we get two warnings the first one is up
here complaining that the pattern got
compiled with a string where they
statically don't know whether it's a
regular expression excuse me the second
one down here weather checker complains
that we don't know whether it is at
least one capturing group in that stream
so the regular expression checker
complained about both both problems in
the code and you didn't have any false
positives or any annotation effort so
how do we fix this problem we fix this
problem by adding a check to make sure
that the string is actually a valid
regular expression so before we compile
it we make sure that the string is a
valid regular expression so we have a
utility method that make sure that the
string is compiled is a valid regular
expression and if it's not we output a
user-friendly message so if we run the
checker again the check is now happy so
we don't get any warnings anymore we
make sure that the string is a regular
expression and has at least one
capturing group the nice thing here is
that we don't need any explicit
annotations in the source code all the
annotations are automatically inferred
by the type system can we go back to the
slides sorry
so we've seen that type systems are a
great way to build a program analysis
they have a bunch of benefits one is
that they can find bugs and we saw
security bugs we saw regular expression
bugs I think it's much more compelling
that they can actually it's a
verification technology so it's not just
a bug finding technology it can actually
guarantee that your programs have no
errors of particular types it also
improves the documentation sometimes you
don't have to write any annotations but
when you do that's telling the
specification of your code which is
something that you and other programmers
are going to need and furthermore it's
machine checked so you know it's correct
you know it's accurate it can also help
compilers and other tools for instance
to make systems run faster now those are
the positives every tool has its
drawbacks as well one negative is you
have to write the types you typically
don't have to write too many it's
usually less than you write for Java
generics and we have some type inference
tools that will automatically determine
these for you and the others that false
positives are possible the system might
say I can't prove this code is correct
maybe it's correct for some really
subtle complicated reason and in that
case you would need to suppress the
warning so another advantage of type
systems is that they're really familiar
to programmers they run as part of their
standard development environment and
programmers are used to it they
understand how type systems work
they're also modular so you can type
check one procedure at a time which
makes them fast and it makes them easy
to interpret people sometimes wonder is
this gonna really clutter up my code
we've run this on tens of millions of
lines of code and we found that for the
worst is usually null Ness if you want
to prevent null pointer errors you have
about one annotation 475 lines and we've
seen much fewer with other type systems
like guaranteeing that in turning your
that values are interned and the quality
checks are right we saw a hundred
annotations in 200,000 lines of code and
for format strings making sure the
percent s's and % d's are right we saw
100 annotations and three million lines
of code they revealed one hundred and
four bugs you can also just look at part
of a program
so aren't there are some false positives
as I mentioned not too many and first
year computer science majors preferred
using these two not using them these are
being used at here in Silicon Valley at
big companies and at startups as well
they're being used a wall on Wall Street
lots of places that there are
programmers who really care about their
craft and want to get their code right
so here we we shown you several type
systems the system actually ships with
about 20 type systems I'll go over some
of them very quickly for you one is her
preventing Naldi references and we
actually have a talk tomorrow morning at
10 20 in this room actually the it's
been moved and we found hundreds of
errors in programs like like Google
collections in Java see another one for
making sure that a quality tests are
right again hundreds of we found
hundreds of errors in Apache code for
determining that you always hold a
proper lock to prevent race conditions
we found over 500 errors especially in
server programs sometimes programs use
integers instead of enumerations and
they can get those how do you know
you're using the right numbers we have a
type system that guarantees that use you
can also think about the values of
strings often people Jam information
into strings we saw that for regular
expressions I mentioned you can also
verify that printf format strings are
correct that they're consistent with all
the arguments the JDK has at least four
different ways of representing a method
signature and sometimes people use the
wrong ones we actually found errors in
open JDK and in azzam related to that
and we found errors in our own code we
built something to make sure that the
checker framework itself was using
compiler message keys right and we found
eight errors eight bugs that we had not
known about until we ran this we've also
built a bunch of type systems for
security
you saw one we also have ones that for
command injection at vulnerabilities for
instance when you use
user user supplied data in a
command-line we found five missing
validations in Hadoop and one for
information flow privacy that detected
malware in Android apps so you probably
just want to use ones that people have
already provided as I said it ships with
20 there are dozens more that other
people have written you can download you
can also build your own if you want to
be a type system of designer it turns
out the checker framework makes that
pretty easy to do it's not that scary I
want to to talk a little bit about the
difference between verification and bug
finding so far what we've talked to you
to you about is a verification tool
that's what the checker framework is
it's trying to give you a proof that's
quite different than bug finding tools
and complementary to them the goal of a
verification technique a tool is to
prove that there's no bug the goal of a
bug finding tool is to find a few bugs
at low cost in a verification tool the
user has to provide a specification and
you do that by writing those at signs
that the type qualifiers in a bug
finding tool the user doesn't have to
provide anything it guesses at what the
program's supposed to do in a
verification tool the goal is no false
negatives it's if it says I can't find
any problems in the code the code is
right there are no problems in it
and a bug finding tool it's acceptable
for it to say I can't find any problems
maybe there's some more and a
verification tool can have false
positives where it says I can't prove
this code is correct
but you can see there's some subtle or
complicated reason for it and bug
finding tools have a lot of heuristics
to focus on the most important bugs and
avoid irritating users so their
downsides the downside of verification
is that there's a user burden the user
has to write this specification the
downside of a bug finding tool is that
it misses some bugs it doesn't find
everything I can really see these two
approaches of complementary neither one
is better than the other each one is
appropriate in certain circumstances you
should choose which one is best for your
situation and then use it maybe you'll
use bug finding tools sometimes or in
some parts of your code and maybe it'll
use verification and more important or
central parts of your code
so the checker framework is an
open-source project its source code is
available at this URL we release every
month 75 people have contributed commits
to the repository and we close a couple
of issues every week send us send us an
email ask us questions and we'd be happy
to help you out so the main takeaway
that I want you to leave with is that
pluggable type checking is a way to
improve your code and to prove facts
that you care about the Trekker
framework is this tool that lets you
create a type checker you probably want
to use the ones that are already
available but you can make your own as
well and they have all the features of
the java language they're effective
they're pretty easy to use and they
scale up to big projects this allows you
to prevent bugs at compile time rather
than discovering them or on time or
worse having your customers or hackers
discover them at runtime
so we encourage you to get started and
improve your code this is the URL and
we'll be talking about one specific type
checker and showing you a lot more
examples of code tomorrow
at 10:20 again in this room so we've
left a few minutes for questions and
we'd be happy to take those and thanks
very much for your attention
there's a question here yeah okay so
great question the question was Java has
a number of defaults so for instance by
default
references are allowed to be null but
wouldn't be better if they were non null
by defaulting yet to say something
specific to make them allowed to be null
and likewise variables and fields are
allowed to be reassigned by default
unless you write the final modifier
would it be so the question is could you
reverse these defaults could you create
a type checker that treats it the other
way and gives you a warning if you
haven't written nullable or haven't
written reassign abble and the answer is
yes that's actually exactly what we've
done for in that we'll talk about
tomorrow in the null miss checker whew
we've made the default be non null it's
safer and it highlights it's more
concise and it highlights the really
dangerous cases and likewise there are
checkers for immutability that you can
download we don't have one specifically
about reassign ability but that's the
sort of thing that could be added great
question
yes
sorry how do you type check code that's
not owned by you so we provide
mechanisms for me I repeat the question
is how do you provide annotations for
third-party libraries for well you don't
control the source code you just have a
jar file and you want to use that jar
file how do you specify whether the
method returns null or not so we provide
two mechanisms for you to specify that
one is a textual representation where
you provide additional annotations for
that Java and you simply specify what is
the behavior of that third-party library
the other approaches we have a rewriting
tool where you just rewrite that library
and add the annotations so that's a
little bit more efficient because you
don't need to pass that extra Java file
you just modify the char file and have
the annotations in there so both of them
allow you to specify annotations for
third-party libraries and the checker
framework ships with annotations for
some libraries like parts of the JDK and
a few others but you're right if you
want to verify your code you have to
know what the libraries it calls do and
we provide ways to do that
yes
the one tomorrow is specifically about
the null nest checker so it focuses on
all the situations where you can get a
null pointer exceptions in Java and
walks through all the annotation
mechanisms we provide to circumvent them
so to specify what your initialization
behaviors and things like that so it's
more focused on the null point
exceptions on our website you find
tutorials for how to write your own type
system so if you interested in how to
make your own type system we have
tutorials online
hmm so in the example we had a we have a
so the question is in the regular
expression example how did the check a
framework know that this can you go to
format that this is Vega X method has
particular behavior so in the checker
framework we have peon post condition
specifications where we specify what
happens after particular method call and
in this particular situation we know
that this maggots util that is maggots
method verifies that the first argument
is a valid regular expression and if
that condition doesn't hold we analyze
the control flow to see that you exit
the program execution
so we specify a post condition to - this
is rank X method if the input spring is
not a regular expression we terminate
execution so afterwards we know if
you're still executing that input string
is definitely a regular expression and
has at least one capturing group so it's
not so in this case in this case I think
it might be implemented in the check for
other type systems it's really as P
impose condition specifications one
thing that's kind of cool about every
type system supported by the checker
framework is that they're all flow
sensitive a variables allowed to have
different types on different lines of
the program after you do a test you know
more about the the type the type system
should know more about the type 2 so
that's built into all of our checkers
and this was just one example of how
that works so that after in in the else
Clause you know that it really is a
regular expression and so those it's the
same lines of code as before but now it
type checks or write the the checker is
now able to validate to verify it good
question
maybe one last question
so I was inspired so I'm a I'm a
programmer and I'm an academic I like to
build new type systems but every time I
build a type system I also build a
compiler because I want to run it on a
million lines of code to see if it
actually works rather than just you know
writing a paper and and proving a
theorem and so after doing this three or
four times I found it really tedious to
write a new compiler every time so I
decided I would build a framework that
makes it easy to build a new type system
in a few hundred lines of code even a
research type system there are other
research languages that have
capabilities like this but none that are
in any mainstream languages so the
theoretical concept is called refinement
types so if you looked at the Fineman
types you find about a lot of papers
about how to implement them and
different language designs right okay
well thanks again we really appreciate
it we hope to see you tomorrow and we're
around if you want to talk to us Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
