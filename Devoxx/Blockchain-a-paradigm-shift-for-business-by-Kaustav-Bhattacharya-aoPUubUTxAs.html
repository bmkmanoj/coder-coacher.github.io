going to be talking about launching it's
a really interesting area that
practically every tech website magazine
news agency in the world is talking
about right now but typically when
people talk about blockchain they're
always talking about crypto they're
talking about Bitcoin or aetherium or
any number of the thousands of crypto
currencies out there but today I'm here
to not really talk to you about
cryptocurrency but about the fundamental
structure of blockchain take the lid off
the technology and dig deep dive into
how it actually works
from a fundamental level for me
blockchain is not really a disruptive
technology as maybe artificial
intelligence and machine learning it to
meet blockchain is more of a
foundational technology it's akin to
perhaps what tcp/ip did for the internet
and the early days blockchain is so
early in its journey that for me
personally that's where I see blockchain
existing today as that foundational
layer under which or on top of which all
of the other emergent technologies
solutions will emerge from so a little
bit about myself I'm the executive
director of technology at IgA in one of
the platinum sponsors here at Fox days
so thanks to boxes for that if you're
tweeting that's our twitter hashtag of
their IgA Jupiter orbit as me and
don't Fox blockchain so if you are
tweeting fee to use that if you're
interested in Nigerian finding out a bit
more that's our website as well my
background is in software engineering I
started life my professional life in
machine learning the software
engineering space I've always been
involved with the web development mobile
development space and more recently got
into the blockchain technology area and
hopefully during this talk you will get
an appreciation for the underlying
elements of our team here today from our
GA is Dan who's sitting here in the
front row with Matt over here at the
corner wanna as well is basically review
press done and as our basement London
Fog down and pavo are fading somewhere
in the audience over there and then
there's my colleague Eddie now you know
Eddie being a software developer doesn't
really like to sort of show pictures of
himself my client but I managed to find
this picture of mainly from 2014 well
there you go if you see any audience to
say hi so a little bit about ITA so
you've got a bit of context of who we
are so our journey started in 1977
headquartered out of New York we're
about 2,000 people globally across 19
different offices where one agency
working as a integrated network so work
that we do in London
maybe source from other parts of the
network around the world Bucharest is a
special case in the haji anul a good
roast is our technical development
center it's where we bring all of our
deadlines
from across the network there's a lot of
work from our European officers as well
as from Tokyo New York and so on we
started in 1977 as a graphics special
effects company if for those who may be
old enough in the audience
hopefully you may remember the first
original Superman movie or alien the
movie and ghostbusters so our GA started
life producing the special effect for
the credits the beginning of those
movies so if you remember Superman the
bigger net Superman flying through the
3d that technology didn't exist in those
days have both Greenberg and his brother
set up the company to do that fast
forward to 2018 when our full service
digital agency doing some fantastic work
for fortune 100 companies around the
world four key areas that we offer is a
venture program we are one of the most
successful and long-running venture
programs of the world
that's agencies speak for an accelerator
so we've loved it we're running our
second venture program at the moment in
the area of Internet of Things IOT we
also have a very interesting consulting
practice we not only you did for my
consultancy in a number of different
areas of digital but we also employ the
use of rapid prototyping test and learn
break it as fast as possible and build
it up again so our consultants work with
our technologists very closely to create
that kind of mix our agency offering is
our core that's where our design
technology and communications
capabilities come in and then we have a
Studios capability which for us is
really important so when we design a
solution for a client and then we make
it for them using our agency
capabilities we also have the studio
facilities to actually help them market
that and put the message out into the
into the into the world that a new
product or a service has launched
we can we can do all of that advertising
for them so it's in a sense of what we
do breaks down into consultancy
engineering infrastructure data and
quality assurance here in BIM press
we've got a really good team of people
this is our tech stack fairly
representative of a lot of the work that
we do a lot of our focuses on the area
of react react native rector as
javascript in general we've quite a lot
of really interesting work going on in
the area of better reality limited 3d we
have a small capability in our London
office if any of you at McDonald's and
you're familiar with happy studio the
games for kids that's built out of the
London office for the global rollout of
that application and here are a couple
of our facts that we've been working
with over the years and there can't be
an RDA deck without an award slide so
the work that we do is recognized
globally by organizations my campaign
cam lions Forester and so on so what am
I here to talk about so it is a rundown
of what I'll be covering so I mean at
first going to a definition of what is
distributed ledger we want to unpacking
blockchain in a bit more detail and then
I think the really interesting part is
going to be looking at the text up so if
you were to take the lid off love
chairman actually drill down into the
different layers of love chain and
figure out how ever the parents actually
built from the ground up from the
protocol level we'll go into that we'll
talk a little bit about consensus I'm
not really going to go really deep into
that area
I could seriously stand there talking
some next five hours if I did but I'll
hopefully give you a little flavor of
where consensus algorithms are today
what some of the challenges are and how
some of those challenges are being
resolved and then we'll take a look at a
couple of examples of current applique
so real-world applications of where
blockchain is being used today our GA
has been working with blockchain for a
while now and I'll give you an example
or something about that we're doing as
well as a particular passionate area of
my own which is around using butcher
block chain for identity I shall get it
to shortly and then to close off I'll be
covering a long chain strategy so many
of you in this room are probably here
because they are interested in the
subject be you may be building something
on blockchain whichever blockchain you
may be choosing a theory but as
technologists sure you can cut cool code
and you can create solutions of
blockchain that's that's also but how do
you actually figure out whether that
solution has a market how do you in fact
figure out where the blockchain is even
the right thing to do
so at r/ga we've formed a framework a
strategy framework that allows you to
figure out whether you should be taking
your idea to market on the basis of
blockchain and then I'll go through some
examples of how we've been getting into
the coding side of blockchain as well so
blockchain is essentially a shared
database rate it's it's something that
enables an indelible and beautiful
record it's a record of truth over a
period of time so block trends and
cryptocurrencies they fought the key
sort of basis of distributed ledger
technologies now when you when you look
at this technology it's it's nothing you
really write so letters have been around
for a long long time you started off way
back going back hundreds of years
thousands years where Ledger's were use
to record transactions that could have
involved the record of monetary
transactions or property of our other
assets right so the concept of a ledger
would
literally a book in which back at the
holidays people used to write an entry
every time a transaction took place is
is something that's been around for a
long time but in a distributed ledger
transactions recorded across a network I
think there's a key thing here to note
you'll hear the phrase distributed and
decentralized used quite a lot
interchangeably when people generally
talk about blockchain and if you if you
listen to say Vitalik who set up who
created ethereal he always talks about
decentralized and I think there's quite
a distinct difference between
decentralized and distributed and I'll
go into that in a bit more detail later
on at the talk so I think it's quite
important so each participant in a
network holds an identical copy of the
ledger so traditionally if you are say a
banker you would follow the centralized
record of every single transaction that
goes on that's a centralized model for
areas in the blockchain model you are
making effectively a complete copy of
that record of that ledger across the
entire network of all the nodes of the
network so as a result when a change is
made to the ledger its propagated or
it's reflected throughout the entire
network that all the copies are held by
all the participants across the network
the security and the accuracy of the
ledger is ensured through systems such
as cryptographic keys and signatures the
hash function as you've already heard at
the previous talk given by
Societe Generale
morning and that this effectively
controls the access and permission to
the shared ledger that everybody else
across the network so let's dive into
the sort of the innards of blockchain so
what can effectively is a special type
of distributed ledger
it's what underpins many
cryptocurrencies that we all know love
or maybe hate today
so bitcoin is a classic example of
serial there's hundreds of potentially
thousands of them out there right now so
in a blockchain transactions are
organized into blocks so when when the
pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto came up
with the original idea they're wearing
his white paper did he actually
mentioned blockchain he mentions blocks
and chains separately but the phrase
blockchain really started to become
popularized much later on after that
white paper got released so every block
is boundaries linked with effectively
exchanged together with the previous
block using a cryptographic hash
function so there's two types of lock
change that almost all of us who are
working in this space will encounter
there are effectively public and
permission block chains so what's the
difference between the two so starting
with public so a public or a
permissionless blockchain it's
considered trustless of the main reason
why that is is because anybody can join
that network Bitcoin and a theorem are
examples of that type of blockchain
where there and though it can exist
anywhere in the world is completely
permissionless
you can independently go it set up your
own Bitcoin node and join that entire
network on the flipside so so so sorry
it doesn't as a result because of this
random nature of people joining these
open networks you have to yeah you've
gotta have an incentive
mechanism ray in order to reward the
behavior amongst the participants and
try and reduce the amount of bad
behavior I suppose you could say so
actors who are trying to manipulate the
network and change records on it without
the consensus of the masses so that's
where we preserve integrity through the
strong notion of a minor or so-called
minor who effectively receives a reward
or a profit on every transaction that
they verify and put onto the blockchain
so the flip side we have a private or
commissioned blockchains
so these block chains are really
different right so bit kind of theorem a
public they're out there in the public
domain whereas these permission
blockchain environments are much more
locked down in a number of different
ways so on one level you could consider
them to be relatively secure for us the
main the main distinction here is that
the participants are known and vetted so
that eliminates the need for that
incentive mechanism they did for a
public blockchain then Center mechanism
typically being systems such as proof of
work and so on this whole concept of a
private commission blockchain was
written about quite extensively by
Hellman and Roche it's well worth
reading their paper if you google them
look it up it's a really deep insight
into the whole area of premiership
private object so block test could be
further broken down into a number of
different permission models I think this
is where it starts to really start
getting unpacked and really interesting
so on what level you've got block chains
where you have a REIT model so this
permission will effectively includes
anyone who can view the transaction so
if you go to any number of the public
Bitcoin or crypto
monitoring websites that are out there
where you can literally list hundreds or
thousands of different block chains of
all of the different transactions that
are going through those different block
chains those are effectively allowing
you read access as a member of the
public you can read and access that
information then you have right so
that's all the participants you can
create new transactions that fall under
the permission model now there's a
distinction between right and competitor
right so an entity can create a record
that needs to be reported on to the
blockchain but it's not until it's
committed on to the blockchain under
that the commit permission model that
you don't you get an actual entry into
the ledger and again children and rich
go into that quite a lot of detail so if
you had to break up visualize the whole
total Commission model of blockchain you
know there's this really nice way of
representing it here where on one side
you've got open block chains that are
public and permissionless they're open
effective effectively to anyone for
reading in most cases most both of the
slam for writing as well and I think in
terms of the examples of the right-hand
side these are some of the areas that
are we going into later on during this
talk sovereign in particular is a really
interesting blockchain that's out there
it's a public blockchain that it's
focused on our public identity and I'll
go into that a bit more detail on the
closed side you've got two organizations
like hyper ledger fabric and the many
different components
to enable you to create private
permission blockchains and then as well
there's a really interesting one anybody
in the audience have heard about that
penny hunt yeah okay so that is really
really interesting if you're into the
area of actually coding and developing
love change yourself it's highly
recommended to check them out they have
a very very powerful consensus algorithm
that's very different to proof of work
or proof of state and I'll talk about
that later on they're also an extremely
accessible platform they have really
really good documentation but also
support as well and RJ has been working
with them for a couple of months now to
help them out on a number of different
areas so blockchain there's a tech stack
so effectively when you talk about any
block chain is broken down into three
different layers you've got the protocol
there networking there and the
application there so let's let's unpack
those starting from the bottom so the
principle there so it's fact effectively
the protocol there is what makes
possible it's perhaps the area that has
the most focus in the market I would
probably guess 95 percent of you in the
throat if you are coding and creating
object a property focused on that area
of the protocol that it's it's really
where the language of the rules exist of
blockchain whether it's you know whether
you're using solidity to program an
ethereal solution or fight them to come
up with a blockchain the protocol layer
is where it's all happening it also
helps the nodes come to consensus which
is a critical part of any blockchain
especially public right and I would
summarize by saying it without the
protocol there you know you wouldn't
have logic it's one mate logic possible
so moving a lot of the network layer
this is where the men provide
access to the principal so on one level
you've got all these different entities
creating different modules around the
world but effectively you need to be
able to then join that blockchain that
network together and that's what the
networking there
provides it's what runs the note that
the protocol sits on top of and it
provides immutability and that's a
really important aspect of not chain
you'll hear this being talked about time
and time again effectively when you're
writing a record to a blockchain it's
there permanently it can't be changed
they can't be manipulated theoretically
although there are ways of means around
it you have to be very rich to be able
to do it but it's effectively an eatable
record of a transaction that may be
taking place and at the application
there and this is an area that many of
you may be working on as well it's it's
effectively it's what serves the users
needs right it's the it's it's the
interface between the consumer and
underline complexity so let's say you're
using a wallet application that's based
on the net blockchain that's effectively
operating at the application there so in
terms of the key components of
blockchain and there are five major
components of it I'm going to focus on
consensus primarily so the five main
areas are the validity rules the whole
aspect of peer-to-peer networking and
how that is orchestrated the ledger
itself which is the record the consensus
mechanism which I'm going to be talking
about in a bit more detail and the
cryptographic nature of how it's all
held together so I mentioned before this
distinction between decentralized
history
that works so we're all familiar with
this model right the centralized model
you could take either plug any company
off the internet and pointed a fictive
Lee will be working in a centralized way
thinking about it from a Vortech
perspective you think about the whole
client-server model right you've got the
central server
you've got your clients that make
requests to the centralized server and
it responds you think I'm a bank you
think of a loyalty scheme you think of
any kind of major institution of the
world today and they're all pretty much
centered on this whole centralized
notion where that one key central hudner
controlling body is what decides what
gets recorded in the ledger or their
database it's also a central body that
can really connect and change that data
completely unknown to any of us as
consumers of the services and their yeah
so so that's that's the ball today
now whether italic came up with he
called it the decentralized Network and
for me there's a big distinction here
between this decentralized distributed
which you can see here so it is a
decentralized network for me is still
effectively a centralized network except
you're delegating the responsibility to
to sort of super nodes of the network
whereas prepared to distributed it's a
complete match no one central point of
control exists every node has a
capability of communicating with every
other node on the network I think this
is a fundamental thing to wrap your
heads around if so if you're just
getting into the whole area of
blockchain this is a really it's an
important set of concepts to bear in
mind so let's talk about consensus so
there's a lot chains of distributed or
the based on peer-to-peer networking
tiddly the fact that there's no central
or sort of centralized controlling
authority means that reaching consensus
on the state of the ledger is it's hard
but it's also crucial if that consensus
pectin ISM wasn't there effectively
anybody could write any old trash to the
ledger and people would have to take it
as truth so it's the consensus algorithm
or the model that allows this kind of
authority to ensure that the right
information is being written to the
ledger so I've got an interesting story
for you so back in 1982 there was a
thought experiment that was conducted by
by these four ministry people here so
Lamport szostak and peace had this
scenario where a Byzantine army had to
decide so all these armies around these
baptized outside armies and each army
had generals the Germans had to decide
whether or not to attack or retreat from
the city that was of their interest and
the only way that they could communicate
with each other was through these
messages that would pass messengers
between the generals and the idea was is
that if they were to attack or if
they're going to retreat they how to do
it at the same time right and the
messengers were the main carriers of
those messages between the general
between the generals and armies now so
it's obvious one great what happens if
there's a traitor at the mix right one
of those generals is trying to screw
things up and is trying to you know
double cross all of the other generals
of the army what do you do then what
happens if that general that traitorous
general sends a misleading message up to
the general there which then gets passed
on to the entire network you're screwed
right so there had to be a way of did
all the generals
irrespective of whether there was a
traitor at that meant to actually come
to a consensus and actually decide
whether they were going to attack or
their gate to retreat so if we were to
switch this over to our blog chain
context the Army General are effectively
the nodes on the network that you saw
that distributed mesh on the right hand
side idea the traitors were the
malicious nodes right and the messengers
were effectively the communication
channels between the generals or between
the nodes
so this problem was eventually solved in
1999 dr. Prince I must say sorry Patrick
it was my two guys Castro and let's go
they cracked this problem way way before
a tomato came up with his wet paper but
and they called it they call that the
practical lies my fault tolerance
algorithm very sexy anyways that was the
first manifestation of of a way of
coming to consensus so the first
practical implementation of of that was
in 2009 which hopefully everybody in
this room is familiar with when the
either a single person or a group of
people call satoshi nakamoto came up
with the white paper and the whole idea
behind proof-of-work which is a first
practical implementation of the web of
the practical by that time fault
tolerance algorithms so proof-of-work it
solves a hard cryptographic puzzle
effectively so in order to solve this
puzzle one of the world two of the key
challenges of the proof-of-work method
is what it is a lot of compute power and
as a result of lots of electricity and
this is perhaps one of the biggest
things that's holding back blockchains
are about based on proof
such as Bitcoin and atheria right now in
terms of scale so the proof-of-work
algorithm is effectively based on this
the solving of a hash problem and it's
slow it's pretty much a slow or it was
as slow as seven transactions per second
right so that's if you think about that
rate several transactions per second
scaled up to at the local business is
going to be crippling and that's why
those of us here in the room who have
invested in crypto currencies recently
or in the distant past have problems
quite often so when there was a market
flip and the price pressures and
everybody's trying to bail out myself
that's where most of the distribution
networks they got holding messages on
their websites without saying sorry if
we're down at the moment or we can't
cope with the load for a lot for a big
reason there's a good reason for that
that's because the transaction
processing speed of blockchain theory
and many of the crypto currencies out
there are actually quite slow because of
this whole challenge around
proof-of-work now if you compare that to
visa for example there regularly
transacting where like 50 to 70,000
transactions per second right so going
from seven to this is one of the big
challenges of most of the crypto
currencies blockchain in general out
there so there are a couple of other
consensus algorithm so you've got things
like proof of elapsed time anybody know
that that consensus algorithm any hat no
proof of importance there's another
really interesting one I think when you
look at what chains such as net they're
interesting because of the consensus
what will be based on proof of
importance so for example I have
investments and bikes of my colleagues
who have more planes on the network net
network are part of this proof of the
importance consensus mechanism they you
have to buy into a certain minimum level
of currencies of 15,000 that in order to
become a super node the longer you hold
on to your in among purchase of 15,000
coins the more importance you get on the
net Network and combined with a number
of other factors the whole proof of
importance consensus algorithm works
really well especially within a
commission private blockchain so current
applications of blockchain so this is
where it starts getting interesting so
one of the first things I'm going to
talk about is both clean I can guarantee
nobody in this room probably in the
world apart from about 2000 people's
head above both groan actually probably
not even those 2000 people talking about
that the guys and gals will work out no
RGA
so so we we wanted to really go beyond
proof of clock setting of theorizing and
people like me standing in front of our
audience talking about theory and
actually do something hard for with with
with a blockchain so we started with the
theorem and because it was fairly
accessible for us we came up with this
notion of Bob quite right so first of
all beautiful so Bob greenberg is our
founder continues to be our chairman and
so we named it off the pot thank you Bob
so we wanted to figure out how can we
incentivize employees with nrga
to do certain actions so there are four
examples so if if as a techie
company or as a marketing person or
produce whoever it might be if you have
strong opinions please publish your
thought leadership asking somebody to
write a blog or startup on stage if you
have a talk like that it's not a very
easy thing to do I don't know if you any
of any of you guys have tried to
convince your colleagues to stand up on
stage or write their 20 page blog it's
pretty difficult right not many people
like doing that kind of stuff
so could how could we incentivize people
have doing that but also as an agency
we've got this skirt achill timesheets
the dab timesheets we're going to do
them every week otherwise we don't make
money so like yeah I don't there I'm
probably one of the worst people for
doing my time sheets and I'm probably
not the only one there's people who
leave them for days for weeks that's
lost revenue for idea so again is there
a way of rewarding people a claim krypto
point Caldwell Quentin certifies them
and then their program right as as it's
kind of the current and future
generations those of us who have
children right we should we should care
about the world at the government we
live in and so could we find a way of
avoiding or incentivizing our employees
to use reusable cups or as a president
paper cups in the UK where I'm from we
use over 2.5 billion paper cups a year
in coffee shops and other corporate
bases and less than 1 percent of them
are recycled most of them go to landfill
so how can we change that behavior and
finally it's up to help of well-being we
all know we should do exercise right but
where's the incentive to do it so we
came up with this whole idea of in order
to carry out any of these actions you go
insert device to receive both point you
would approve a certain number of Bob
point and then you could exchange them
for workplace benefits so that could be
for example additional vacation paid
vacation or it could be additional
benefits on the company Benefits Scheme
and then we wanted to extend that beyond
internally within our GA and actually
work with our clients all of the brand
around the world to actually give them
an incentive scheme to bring more work
to us so the more work they bring to us
the more both coin that they can
exchange and potentially get a discount
up to a certain maximum amount of course
on that work that we do for them so
that's been a really fantastic internal
product to us we presented this whole
idea to the Singapore government a
couple of months ago so the Chief
Minister from Singapore came over to
London office as well as our Singapore
office to take a look at what we did and
we took the lid off we showed him the
code not sure he may be understood much
of it but he could go he got an idea so
it was pretty impressed then another
area which is a big passion area of -
the Magnificent it's the whole area of
identity so I don't know if you know but
there's about 1.1 billion people alive
today on this planet who officially
don't have a recognised identity so
these are people who you know they can't
access banking they can't access public
services they can't access private
services because they literally don't
have an identity right they only deal in
five cash and they haven't built up a
risk profile of themselves anywhere so
then effectively barred from accessing
all of the protections the services the
basic rights that everybody in this room
myself included we enjoyed every second
of the day so there's a number of
organizations out there that are really
trying to address the whole area of
identity - crisis around identity for
the underserved and the underbanked if
you think about it there there are some
major issues and problems there let's
take a - recent disasters that natural
disasters that have happened in the
world if you look at the storm that has
a very v storm that went past through
the core
last year I was it not sure the year
before Haiti for example that entire
island was wiped out the entire
infrastructure of the buildings where
people live but totally 100 percent flat
it looked like a nuclear bomb site now
so so what right so in a country like
Haiti or in many African countries
you've got subsistence farmers or your
farmers who produce some additional
surplus right to sell to the market now
you own a plot of land which is recorded
in a ledger somewhere stored in some
dusty room in a government building
that's gathering dust and it sort of
sits there for decades until you move
move on or sell the land so a lot comes
a tsunami in Sri Lanka and wipes out
your man it wipes out the building that
parts that dusty record of that file
that kept your record that you burned
this piece of land so what the hell what
do you do now who do you go to who do
you turn to in order to claim that land
back and prove to them you know
unequivocally that it's your lab thank
you going for years there's no way I'm
doing that right so blockchain is one of
the areas where it can really enable
populations that don't have an identity
so a get an identity B have a completely
provable record in this case and that
records that they owned the land and how
long they're both allowed for and how
much land they own it's a great example
so some of you may be familiar with an
agency called I do I do have a lab
called collab them collaborative
offering for mosaic and this is an F I'm
a digital identity sandbox which I've
been playing around for a couple of
now it's really it's really really
interesting it's a it's one of those SAP
boxes where most of you probably use
Amazon Web Services right
being able to spin up an AWS environment
for the free tier and just play around
with tech is awesome
great so you could do the same thing
with mosaic you can go log into mosaic
and you can actually set up an identity
profile and an identity system and then
test it against certain rules so for
example if you wanted to do create an
identity system for those farmers and
put some constraints and rules as to how
the identity can be used by whom and
what situations and what for mosaic is a
buffer we can model that identity and
actually test about real life there's
also the decentralized identity
foundation so these guys are talking
more about standards more than anything
else I think standards is a big area of
it's a problem in blockchain in general
right now there are universal standards
out there right now there are bodies
like Mesa who are trying to come up with
the universal standards but it's very
very early days think back to the late
90s or the mid 90s when the web started
to really become more more known the
snap that's back then were pretty shaky
so diff are working on the standards for
identity specifically based on
blockchain you've also got ie 20/20 and
they're an alliance that that as a
mother says they're they're committed to
improving lives through digital identity
so these guys have the kind of number of
different areas and one of the key
focuses for them is the refugee crisis
so most of you probably familiar with
the Syria crisis that's going on there's
those men and women children in part of
the desperate situation they are in the
fact that they're they're running away
from conflict in their country when they
leave the border of their country
they're effectively identity less most
of them don't have a passport and
therefore they can't prove their origin
where they're from people treat them
like trash and they don't go
to any of the services within the
country that they've moved to sovereign
for me is a really interesting one so
sovereign started up about two years ago
and they are there our platform that
provides self sovereignty for me this is
really interesting I think for you all
of you in the room it should be
interesting as well so the whole idea of
self sovereignty is today we don't
really own our own data there's there's
this notion that we do because after all
the data that we produce comes from us
right so therefore we open it but really
we all know in this room right the
Facebook's of the law of the googles
that was ours they own all of the
identity information that we provide the
other challenges is that open your
mother how many forms of identity do you
have in your wallet right now maybe four
maybe five maybe ten you got your
driving license you've got your maybe
your bank cards you've maybe got a
national ID maybe you've got some tax ID
but this goes up right so with these
eight forms of ID our creative think of
any website that you go to right now and
you fill in a form in order to access
that service say setting up a bank
account or setting up applying for your
driving license they ask for a lot of
information right I sometimes wonder
whether they really need all of that
information now with the whole idea of
self-serve sovereignty is that you not
only earn the identity information that
you produce but you also provide the
gate of the control which enables you to
reveal only the absolute minimum amount
of information that you need to talk
with to that third party in order for
that third party to operate its service
so platforms like sovereignty no sub
sorry like sovereign and under the
similar to sovereign are providing these
self sovereign mechanisms for people
like us to be able to prove our identity
but also protect our privacy on the
basis of blockchain
really powerful so I wanna just close
off with to two other areas so
blockchain strategy
the strategy framework so when you talk
about any kind of business that you want
to create based upon blockchain thank
you I mean if there's a lot of hubris
around blockchain right now right
everyone's talking about it
everyone in this room is probably
developing on they're trying to create
something out of blockchain but it
speaks you know we kind of need to
figure out whether our idea is going to
fly as a viable business proposition
that's going to grow through the months
and the years of provide us yourself and
others that you employ with an income
ultimately a business that doesn't fail
so how can you do that what's the
strategy framework that you can use to
come up with a solid business so there's
a number of key criteria stuff that our
GA we've come up with that can help you
as a developer has occurred or working a
blockchain actually figure out whether
your business is going to fly online so
if you're going to answer yes to any of
these questions then you go further down
this criteria less to stopping it so
firstly number one is there a
predictable repeatable process that
lends itself well to automation right so
think about think about the application
that you're producing whether it's in
gaming whether it's in financial
services whatever it may be it must have
something that's repeatable primarily
and it's also fairly structured and
predictable ie it's open to automation
number two is there an ongoing or a look
running transaction or process rather
than the process that only occurs a lot
so if you're applying for
if your business is allowing the public
to apply for some service where the
process just happened once and they
probably don't touch it for another two
or three years locked is probably not
the best way to go about doing it
there's a lot of other solutions out
there that can help you number three so
are there multiple stakeholders in the
press
or the value chain for is the role of
reconciling disparate data usually
played by one party or a limited number
of parties and then finally you know
value doesn't always have to be one a
true value can be held in the number of
different exchanges many could be held
their property can be held their
contracts it can help be held in a
number of different forms it doesn't
have to be funny
sorry and there's no mistakes so you
know is is there value in an immutable
record so when you when you're creating
of logic you're effectively at your
you're adding to your adding to it
you're never going back and making an
editor or a change so is there any value
in actually having an immutable record
in the business that you're trying to
create or is or is it immutability even
a requirement so if you say yes to any
of those above questions that's where
the framework really starts to come into
its own so we take each layer of the
protocol that you looked at earlier the
protocol there and network now on that
vacation there and you unpack each one
of those if you said yes to any of those
previous questions so if you said yes to
some of the questions the first little
affair is prosopon there so you need to
decide whether you're going to create a
public blockchain or a black private
blockchain that's one of probably the
fundamental things you need to figure
out first and then one of the designer
expectations right we spoke about proof
of proof of work and all this meta
consensus algorithms you know what are
your speed requirements transactions per
second what are your program have a
little requirement for example do you
want to have a massive developer Network
and able to be building on top of your
platform what about the payment
functionalities and so on and then do
you have developer resources available
right if you're doing something esoteric
on a weird blockchain like well then
that's not so weird anymore but it was
in the early days
if you are used to using solidity for
the last two years doing a variant blob
chant you know and you're switching to
something else do you have is that kind
of labor market supportive from the
network level perspective you know who
needs to run run that mode
who needs read access who needs right
actors who can commit to it what are the
technology integrations that you need so
let's say you're setting up some kind of
identity platform maybe you need to
integrate with the crm platform maybe
you need to integrate with the payment
provider there could be many different
integration points you need to consider
and then what are the data storage
requirements regarding the archiving
regulations with other countries so
because of this distributed nature
public blob chance to run into a massive
problem when it comes to regulation if
you look at the Bitcoin blockchain there
are nodes in practically every country
in the world I theory I'm probably even
better example of that you probably all
familiar with GDP are the general data
protection regulation when GDP are kicks
in in May this year I think it's going
to impose quite an interesting challenge
for a lot of blockchain solutions it was
effective you're distributing people's
private data PII
across the globe now there's solutions
you're not dealing with that you can
help call PII off chain in a side chain
for example or completely off tray and
then obfuscate that information through
creating tokens so that the data that
you only the PII that you're holding in
different jurisdictions isn't otherwise
but that adds complexity that adds to
slow the slowness of the network and
it's difficult to handle so that's going
to be a big huge area for any business
setting up a blockchain to consider
really really carefully and then finally
from the application there is you know
who's going to use the application what
are the implication
the user experience one of the things I
invented about any application that was
built on blockchain about two years ago
was it was a complete it was a complete
nightmare to figure out how to use you
had like these hash addresses where you
have to set points to or it was just it
was just complex just you know setting
up was complex so when you look at
modern blockchain based systems so for
example in London there's a business
called Club ooh colors help communities
local communities create their own
currencies in order to support local
economies when you download a recommend
you will check it out to see both value
you can use it anywhere in the world but
right now the use case is quite sort of
restrictive to London right now but
they're also expanding up to other
countries internationally at the moment
but when you look at the user experience
and problem it's really really good
they've thought about the comp the
lowest common denominator the average
person on the street who doesn't give a
 about blockchain who doesn't care
about how it works and doesn't want to
deal with its complexity and then then
put all of that on the ground and
they're created a user experience that
we all love in applications like uber or
taxi fire or Facebook or Airbnb whatever
it might be so think about that
application interface really closely and
then finally you know you're gonna kind
of think about the behavioral change
that you want to bring about if people
have been used to doing things in a
certain way for years and years
how are you disrupting that flow that
they've been used to that kind of memory
muscle autopilot that people go into so
that's a really important piece to think
about so on a closed off by talking
about coding and decentralized
applications this is something a couple
of us krta
been doing for a couple of months now
it's really interesting
so crypto zombies is pretty awesome
these are other crypto zombies anyone
yeah cool I know there's another person
of the audience call Eddie for sure so
so crypto zombies it's a free
interactive code school it teaches you
how to build games in ethereal it's
probably not the first thing you think
of right to use ethereal not chain for
but if you think about it if you take
games like MMO is like if even like the
multiplayer space game or any of those
multiplayer games Eve for example has a
has an entire economy that exists within
the world of EVE you're exchanging real
wealth fear and you're converting it to
currency without the EVE universe
you're literally spending your hard cash
that you can make your summaries every
day now the application of
cryptocurrency within that space or
blockchain or generally is really really
interesting and crypto zombies helps you
actually get through that thinking and
actually use solidity which is the
programming language for a theory and
build applications it's a step-by-step
process let's apply lesson it's really
really easy to get your head right you
don't need to know anything at all about
solidity or about a theory above not
chain in general it takes you right from
the beginning all the way through to
advanced levels I I did I created my
first game pretty toes avi is about
about five or six months ago and it took
me about four days to get my head around
that pretty awesome so if you want
something that's interesting and
engaging to actually apply
blockchain to track really game of logic
it's pretty awesome
then I mentioned before so I suppose I'm
slightly biased we've been working with
that for
but what we don't own any shares and
then although I have a few that I've got
I think a few a few of us an idea have a
feud that but jokes aside I think that
was really interesting so it's a method
market themselves a spot asset
blockchain
so there a permission primer content
platform so for me you know if you are
looking through their website there's a
lot of information that I had to pull
out the formal key things that really
stand up for me
when it comes to them is the efficient
consensus algorithm so they use this
thing called proof of importance the
super node notion to really pump up the
volume of transactions per second make
it faster now up to the currently in the
hundreds as soon to be within the
thousands they've got strong security so
multi-sig for example and they're going
to really really active develop a
network so if you're on Telegraph find
them them through joiner and just just
chat there there's people from all over
the world of Telegraph developing and
talking about them and in fact their
website also has got some really good
documentation but I always find myself
turning turning to the earth to the
Telegraph channel and just chatting up
that it's just far more immediate
there's literally like you post a
question and about 50 people arts over
there 30 seconds with your on display
amazing and then finally you can even
develop on their on their using a number
of different of your favorite languages
whether it be no Ruby Java etc so it's
pretty open
so in conclusion for me the keep the
four key benefits of blockchain are its
ability to create its ability to create
trust in a trusted environment you know
in a world where you need to create
assurance its security mechanisms for
value transfer pretty obvious its
efficiency and streamlining business
processes particularly between different
entities either across borders or
between a country a company like a large
bank that has different regional
entities having multiple block chains
that cross over is really powerful and
then ultimately the enhanced
auditability and transparency of
blockchain is what really sets us apart
and for me is the game changer if it
wasn't for that transcribe transparency
and the auditability blockchain would
probably lose a lot of the value there
