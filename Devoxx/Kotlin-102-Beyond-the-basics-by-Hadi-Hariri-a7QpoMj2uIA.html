not called call in advance it's call in
a little bit modern basics but we'll try
to cover a couple bunch of things how
many of you using an introduction just
play with it and write okay right on so
I'll go through a bunch of different
things we'll look at some things around
the higher-order functions BSS how to
create dsl extension functions generics
how they differ a little bit from java
inlining where inlining is useful we'll
look a little bit at co-routines
sequences for lazy evaluation and a
couple of other features that have been
brought in 1.1 that's a lot we'll try
and get through them as much as possible
also I've given we're running late with
sessions a little bit so I'll try and
speed up okay if you have any questions
feel free to just keep them to yourself
don't ask me joking obviously interrupt
me and ask me any time and the way we go
so we'll start with the DSL stuff and if
there's I'll go through some things
quite quite fast if if you honestly if
you do have something that you don't
understand just just taught me right
with this maybe you know some most of
the things I'm guessing that you're
familiar with so you're all familiar
with the concept of higher-order
functions right where it's a function
that takes a function of function
returns a function and just to get
familiar again with the syntax of Oh
Kotlin so here I declare a function of
higher-order that takes a parameter of
type string and then it takes another
function that takes a string and returns
a string and I'm executing the operation
by just calling up and a value that's
passed in right so here I have the
similar sin here I just have a lowercase
ignore that well this is the function
that matches the signature up here so it
takes a single parameter and returns a
string to call it I just do higher-order
hello and in this case I'm passing in
the function name by reference
obviously here I could also pass in a
lambda expression so you know I could
say
eggs eggs plus whatever I could also
just use the it reference when there's a
single parameter in a in a function I
can just use it and not have to
explicitly refer to the parameter when
I'm declaring the lambda okay everyone's
good with that right if I don't hear a
no I will assume everyone's good with
that
right good so you don't have to
constantly say yes Heidi we're good move
on
what are you Swedish you know Swedish
people are very very quiet
are there any Swedish here no very quiet
only we only beat them by the finish
we're more quiet anyway all some people
but very quiet and talks right so we've
taken this higher-order functions we've
got a lot of higher-order functions
built into the standard library and
Kotlin you've seen some of them like
width which is part of the Santa
continent that takes a function block
with a given receiver as its receiver
and returns a result there's another one
that quite often used which is let which
allows you to use a object inside that
scope without having to declare it
externally so a bunch of these are built
in and you can also create your own so
here's an example of me creating a using
statement right if you're familiar with
c-sharp I have the using which is kind
of similar to try with resources I do
something and then I something that has
to be disposable something that has to
be closeable I do something with it and
then free the memory right so I could
create that same kind of structure in
Kotlin by you by creating a top-level
function that is a higher-order function
that takes a closer Ballabh jecht and
then it does something with it with the
with the code that's being passed in and
then closes that object given the fact
that Kotlin allows me to have
a lambda or multiple lines it gives it
this kind of like little structure in a
sense right so this really kind of looks
like a keyword of the language but it's
not a keyword it's just a function that
I've declared okay now with extension
functions one of the key aspects of
Kotlin we if you're not familiar again
very very simple concept is I can extend
any class via the Java class or a
codling class with new functionality so
here I have a string to title case and
what I'm doing is basically extending
the class string with a new function
which is to title case ok and returning
the value and then you can have you know
take that so for example func string is
is the same as for instance and then I
pass in a value here value string and
then I can say this equals value right
single line you don't need to open up
curly braces and all of that
this is referencing the instance of that
class that object that I'm creating an
instance of for class I'm creating
instance of so this allows me to do
something like this hello is the same as
hello right and you can make this even a
little bit more nice and say hello is
the same as hello right now that gives
you an error but this is what I call
IntelliJ driven development which is
essentially fix that for me and it just
adds an infix modifier to that function
right so functions that allow you to
have function extension functions of
member functions that have a single
parameter can be called an infix
notation by prefixing it within fix and
you can still call it in the same way as
you can see up here okay now i'm showing
you all of these because we're going to
eventually combine them there's another
thing that you can do in Kotlin which is
operator called invoke in Kotlin
difference to scala you can't create an
operator out of every symbol and its
mother here you can only create
operators or over overload override
operators that we do
a series of conventions that we have so
one of them is the invoke operator which
essentially means that I can now create
an instance of a class in this case foo
and then invoke that object passing in
some practice okay now all of these are
very similar to concepts that you have
in other languages but one thing that is
unique to Kotlin to date is this concept
of lambdas with receivers and we call
them lambdas with receivers because we
kind of create invented them
some times they were also called like
higher-order extension functions but I
think we're settling on the names anders
with receiver
essentially this is a higher-order
function as you can see here right but
what this is is a higher-order function
that doesn't take a normal function it
takes an extension function okay so that
means that when I pass in this lambda
this is an extension function to route
handler meaning that I have access to
everything that the route Handler
provides me okay so you'd say why do you
want to do that well because it looks
cool I'm joking
here is why you want to do something
like that okay let's scroll this up here
I have a class request and a class
response write the request class has a
method property a query property and a
Content ID the response has a content
and a status code right now I have this
class route handler that ignore this I
mean this is not even relevant to it I'm
just giving you an example it can have
any code there that takes a request and
we sorry has a request property and has
a response property now I declare a
function that's called a route handler
that takes an extension function of the
route handler class
and then all it does is just return that
function okay so I can now do something
like Ruth handler and this is a lambda
expression right if we do route handler
here you see that the ID gives me the
completion directly there this is what
we're expecting
we're expecting here a function right in
Colleen like groovy if the last
parameter to a function is another
function you can just drop it and go
outside right but here's the key thing
this isn't an ordinary function it's an
extension function which means that I
have access to all of the properties of
that class and I'm extending so I have
requests and then from here I have
content type etc so why did we do this
this is how you can create those dsls
right this is how kobold has created a
dsl for building this is how you can
create if you've ever seen the groovy
HTML builders that's also part of this
way of creating DSO okay so it allows
you to create nice-looking DSL and of
course I can you know I can extend this
with other things I can say request
request content type and then inside the
request have a response and then inside
the response have like status code
equals 100 right
this one is that would need to be a bar
but this it says oh let me create a
member function you see you can even
have do this or without even knowing
what you're doing like me and go back to
where I was right
so well you get the good so what I just
showed you is it's using that invoke
that I just talked about to allow you to
combine these and create this kind of
dsl flow okay if you look up HTML
builders culinary ml builders you can
see that we have this Kotlin
HTML builders this is the type safe
groovy builder so you can see that all
of this code here is basically HTML but
it's all statically typed
each of these are functions properties
of classes etc and as I said Gradle does
this cobalt does this all of these have
created their different yourselves
there's another project called tornado
tornado effects which is a wrapper a DSL
around it's actually not only DSL it's
like an application framework for java
effects so you can create your views
using a DSL that tornado defines as
opposed to using XML or actually
decoratively creating all of the
different objects ok so you can see that
here I have with moved sent to the table
view have a field set a field etc and
all of this is translating obviously
down to Java effects under the covers
right it's all inter art so it's just
calling it's not reinventing anything
it's just calling all of creating one of
those Java text controls itself any
questions
no nothing okay are you still following
me
no nothing okay do you want to leave
well I would say go out early for lunch
but the lunch here isn't that great
anyway so at least them that's it's
always it's got it um common with a so
just a box
how many of you have been to democracy
Belgium so you know that it's got Fame
for not having the best lunches to the
point that they actually create their
own videos saying how bad our lunches
are at devoxx no I'm not saying it they
are okay
No
so inlining now in the higher-order
functions when you pass in another
function what is what's going to happen
is that it's going to you know it's
creating a call stack right so you might
question like how does this impact the
performance you know what is the what
what happens here when I have a lot of
functions and you know I want to all of
these are being passed in and it's
creating in India targeting Java 6 is
creating anonymous classes and you know
this might have performance issue what
you can do is inline some of these
higher-order functions right in line
which basically means copy paste the
code anywhere that function is called
right and if you look at the standard
library a lot of the functions that are
part of the standard library are inline
ok so if I come here and I say inline
right what this is doing is now in
lining this so every time this operation
is called it's going to inline the code
along with the function that it is being
passed in now of course this means that
every time I do this it's going to copy
paste that code everywhere in my code
base right essentially I mean but you
know once it trying to compose to
Michael so you've got to you know see
whether it's worth it you know if I'm
having very long methods that is it
really worth for me to do that it only
makes sense to inline functions that are
high order functions because otherwise
it really doesn't make sense in fact if
I were to do something like inline here
it would say you know expected
performance impact of inlining is
negligent it's insignificant it's it's
of no use so why would you want to do
something like that sometimes you have
multiple parameters that you're passing
in multiple higher-order functions and
multiple functions that you're passing
in and maybe at times you don't want to
inline a certain call for Interop
reasons or whatever and you have this no
inline directive right so if I have
multiple lambdas one of them I can say
sorry multiple functions one of them I
can say don't inline that
now I've added a knowing line here with
a single function being passed in and
I've got this inline directive so again
it's going back to what are you doing
right you're saying to me - inline but
the only thing that I want to inline is
our function so what's the point of that
if you've just told me to not have that
knowingly now this gives way to a bunch
of different things that we're going to
take a look at and in particular returns
which affects the behavior okay so let
me ask you a question here is a function
that says containing function numbers 1
to 100 then it says go through them and
when you find someone that's dividable
by 5 return if I run this what do you
think the output of that would be so if
I come here and say containing function
what do you think the output of that
would be 1 2 3 4 okay what else
what will it print hello or any snuffing
nothing so let's see what it does we'll
run this
and it doesn't print anything okay who
expected it to print return print hello
anyone right
that's a non-local return because what
it's actually doing inside the lambda
it's returning outside of the containing
function okay
now you can change this behavior now
let's say this example okay instead of
using for each I'm going to do my for
each right and I'm going to write a
print line hello here what's the result
of this if I were to uncomment this line
what would the result be hello no
compiler error right and that's because
return isn't allowed here because this
only works for functions that are in
line okay so if I inline my for each
then it works because it makes sense
right it's inlining and the return is
acting on that code that was copy pasted
and it's going out right so what happens
when I want to actually print hello how
do I do that right what you can do is
you can say to return at the lambda in
this case the lambda is the for each so
I say we turn at for each so in this
case what it's doing is a local return
it's coming back outside of this lambda
so when I actually right here return you
can see that completion provides me with
the ability to do it at for each because
the function is called for each if it
was called Jo we would do return it Jo
right so if we go to containing function
3 and run this you see that it does
print hello okay
now you can use the label as the name of
the function or you can even define your
own kind of labels right so here I'm
giving this lambda label and I'm saying
it's returned pouring the label I'm
saying my label and then I get
completion to my label okay now what yes
go ahead
invert yes all okay I see I don't think
so
I think that there's reasons behind that
that it wasn't initially done no it just
comes out comes out so it's returning
outside of this lambda don't say that
word don't say that word containing
function five what do you think that
does okay now you'll like her head this
is why let's see what it does print
hello because this is not a lambda this
is well it's a lambda because lambda is
anonymous function but is the anonymous
function it's not a time this anonymous
function so you can see that there's an
actual function here okay so if you
don't want to use labels and you want to
pass in you know you don't want to
explicitly call that function you can
just create anonymous functions which is
a different way to create anonymous
functions so that's one aspect that
inlining also it impacts the other one
is for in terms of type erasure so from
those for those of us that came from the
dotnet the JVM is this horrendously
horrible place where
what do you mean I can't query on my
types at runtime on my generator you
know when I have generics and want to
see the type
well JVM suffers from type erasure
suffers it's the architectural choice
for for the benefits that it has with
Colleen we also have we inherit that
type of Asia but when you have inline
functions you can add the really fight
really fight to it to then get some
information about that type of runtime
so here I have an inline function and
notice that this is giving me it again
not warning it's saying there is no
expected improvement remember I said the
only reason you want to do an inlining
is because if you're passing on a lambda
I lied sometimes you want to do that
when you want to use reification okay so
here I can't say if input is of type T
because it says cannot check for
instance of a race type however if I say
that this is reified I can now do that
and that warning also goes away because
it understands that the reason I'm doing
this is to try and get information at
run time okay so there are certain cases
where you will be able to use this
reified to be able to query information
at run time here's another type right I
print line the type otherwise I wouldn't
have that information and adding reified
allows me to get that okay now another
aspect of Kotlin is delegation how many
of you use delegates in Collin okay so
delegation is basically essentially you
can do delegation of functions so one
class delegates functionality to another
class in a typical scenario what you're
doing is you know you've got the concept
of dependency injection where you have a
class that's passing in another class
and then it's delegating that
functionality to that class we kind of
build that into the first-class
delegation where you can just say it's
the class the functionality is delegated
by some other class and you don't have
to have that private field which there
is unfilled in call in property private
property too
an instance of that object right
basically composition but you also have
delegation of properties so I can create
some code that I can reuse over and over
again in different places and have the
implementation a single time and
properties using that implementation so
here I have a delicate and and the car
and the standard library again ships
with a bunch of out-of-the-box delegates
right there's a lazy delegate so here
you can see that I have a lazy property
so what this is going to do is a lazy
evaluation
it will lazily evaluate when the first
time that property is accessed and I'm
saying evaluate it using you know run
the function in it late and this is
going to be run and you can set the
threading model here so this is built-in
if you go to lady you can see that it
allows it uses a synchronized
synchronization to say if you know do
you need any kind of locking on it and
this is built-in the other one that's
built in was this bunch built in but
another one that's built in is called V
towable right there's an observable one
built-in that fires off something every
time the value changes and then there's
V table which basically says if a
certain condition is met then change the
value if it isn't don't so here I have a
lambda that the syntax of veto wall is
an old property that sorry the name of
the property the old value the new value
so I say if the new value starts with s
then change it if not don't so if I run
this you can see that string string
strange because it was string I set it
to change it doesn't start with s so it
still prints out string I then change it
to strange and then it sets the value
right so there's a bunch of of delegates
built in that you can take a look at and
see all of the different ones that are
built in ok observable veto or not now
let cetera
now I think that property delegation if
you want to go one step further you can
also create your own delegated
properties right not just use the lady
in all of that and so here I have a
class service that has a property
delegated property string and I'm saying
delegate that to a custom delegate right
now what this basically means is that I
have to create a class it's not an
interface I have to create a class that
implements two operators get value and
set value okay that the class has to
have this signature and then here again
I have the property and I can you know
access the values type the name of the
property and if I need to have a backing
field then I can just create a private
property to have that back in field etc
okay so you can use the built-in ones
which probably for the majority of cases
works and if you want something a little
bit more advanced you can just create
your own delegated property okay now
let's go to uh actually I'm that means
leave this one to last let's go and see
some quick things so how many of you do
look Haskell right so you're aware of
like type aliases in Haskell
so this is not the same thing because
you're going to ask so I'm going to be
something it's not the new type it's
basically a being it's basically an
alias literally an alias like when you
go to the command line what you can do
is you can say a type I've created a new
type and it's actually an alias for
another one so here I have customer name
so I say customer name is an alias for
string meaning that now when I declare
my data classes I can just say name is a
customer name right at run time it's a
string when in composite it's all string
it hasn't created any new type it's just
a string but it does provide you with a
little bit more semantic meaning
sometimes I just want to reuse the same
thing over and over again and give it a
better meaning and I don't have to
create a class which is essentially has
a property of that value
it's a very simple example of when to
use it let's go to sequences so here if
I run this right you've all seen things
like that in colon which is an array of
numbers and then I go elements filter it
everything that's lower than 30 and then
map that to a pair for instance this is
going to go through the entire list it's
going to go through the entire list and
it's going to print out the ones that
are less than 30 what do I how can I do
lazy evaluation I can just add the ad
sequence so now what's going to happen
is that it's going to lazily evaluate
this so it's not going to go once it
hits that 30 well in this case it will
because it doesn't know that you know
that it's going to be 31 next or
whatever but it's essentially doing a
lazy evaluation from this point on right
so essentially a lot of times what you
can do is take any collection and then
just do a sequence and then it will
convert it if you want to do something a
little bit more complicated you can just
write generate sequence and then that
takes a lambda and from there create
your own mechanism to do lazy generation
so to speak initially this was called
streams but then Java 8 came out with
streams so we decided to rename it to
sequences
okay now variance and covariance and
contravariance and all of that wonderful
thing how many of you familiar with
variance and covariance and
contravariance and okay so essentially
you've used a super extends question
mark all of that horrible things yes
so we Colleen has covariance and
contravariance for generic types it's
different from Java in that in Kotlin
its declaration site
not use sight which makes it a little
bit nicer to use because you just
declare it once not every time you use
it okay what does that mean so here
first of all this is invariant right why
doesn't this work okay because I have it
I have elements which is a mutable list
of any object and then I have strings
which is a mutable list of string and
then I say element equals string right
in principle logically you would say
well string is a subtype of any so in
principle this should work the problem
is that it doesn't because this is
mutable so you cannot guarantee that you
can essentially add a string to it or
add it in or add whatever right in order
to be able to if it if it were then it
would be covariance speak right but in
order to do that you need to have some
sort of guarantee that it is that I'm
only going to be able to like producing
or consuming from here am i generating
my reading and my writing so in call
them what you can do is this this
specific one is covariance because it's
list and the difference between list and
usable list is that the list is
immutable right so in this case it is
immutable now if we go to list you see
that it has the declaration out II okay
which is that's what the declaration
sight variance is about it's saying that
this one is only going to be producing
values right it's not going to change so
it's fine in fact and again the IDE
helps you here because let's say that I
create a class something which is of
type generic and I go ahead and create a
function that says generate something
some things and that's going to create a
list of T okay and just add this okay
you see
get the little squiggly because it says
well in principle this can have out
variance right because you're not
modifying anything it's an immunity it's
an immutable list so I can add that now
let me go ahead and do fun like so
example consume something and I take a
list of T it no longer offers me that
option right the opposite of covariance
is contravariance which is represented
in column with in some sort of outfits
in and it's saying that well this
doesn't work but now that does work
which is consuming now there are cases
where you want to be able to there are
cases where you want to be able to
declare something as the variance or
contravariance but you can't do it as
part of the declaration essentially
doing a use site and Colleen also does
support that but generally the way that
you work with their covariance and
contravariance is Konnan Kotlin is using
the declaration side which makes it much
nicer because every time you use again
you don't get all of that noise of the
super extends I can't even remember that
I don't write Java so please excuse my
really really crappy Java okay so last
thing we're going to look at today are
Co routines so how many of you have
played with the co routines okay how
many of you are familiar with
co-routines think of them very simply
put AZ or lightweight threat
kind of right so let me show you a
typical simple quality now the idea
behind co-routines is a you know how
what do we do to bring a synchronous
programming to cotton and very early on
the Andre team made the decision that
they're not going to build in building
anything specifically into the language
in the sense that they're not going to
do something like what c-sharp it which
was a sinker weight right so sous-chef
has this
in Kuwait and then JavaScript has kind
of there's a JavaScript library that
kind of copies the same concept of a
single weight so essentially in c-sharp
you would do you would have a function
that is a sink
declare the sink boy or you know in blah
blah right and then when you were
calling that you would say a weight x
equals blah blah right why don't I get
completion here there you go
did you know that you can get text
completion while you do because I showed
in my tech tips and tricks if that's
called hippy completion for a write B I
get blah blah without that right we
don't build that in so there's multiple
options you can use you know Rx how many
of you use rx which is fantastic the
promises future's all of these different
things
what we did is implement generic
co-routines suspended all computations
and there's actually only a single
keyword in Kotlin which is called
suspend all right that's the only thing
that's been added to to call it all of
the other functionality that co-routines
provides in Kotlin is actually part of a
library and it's not even part of the
standard library it is part of a library
called Kotlin X so that's why I'm
importing here it's called Linux right
so if you come here and say called Linux
that it's got multiple things that's got
Colin XHTML etc and one of them is
co-routines
ok so here what I'm doing is I'm
launching co-routines
right and we'll get to the common pool
and all of that in a minute and the
first thing I'm doing is I'm delaying
1000 seconds and then I'm going to say
print line world and then continue down
here and say print line hello and thread
sleet mm right first let's get rid of
that and if you rerun this the result is
going to be hello why because it's
launched this co-routine this
lightweight thread
and it's immediately continued from here
it's printed hello this co-routine
didn't have time to complete because it
was on a delay of 1000 right so that's
why you only get hello so in order to
actually see the result I'm going to add
that thread sleep at the bottom so that
the main thread can sleep so that you
can see the result right so now you see
hello world okay now this is not the
clean you don't want to be having these
things in your code base right you're
not going to be having so it sleeps in
in places the proper way to do this is
saying that you're returning a run
blocking or wrapping this and what's
called the run blocking so run blocking
is a function that takes some code and
then runs that code and is basically
waiting until that co-routine finishes
and put dumps it back on the main
straight right so essentially what I've
done is remove that a thread sleep right
but I've wrapped this in run blocking so
my main is now part of run blocking and
by default this is returning a unit
which is boy which is nothing so if I
run this now will also see hello world
right okay so that's what the run
blocking is and you're going to see that
quite a bit now I told you that this is
lightweight thread let's do a thread
comparison in fact here I have the same
kind of thing that we just saw right
with the co-routines run blocking and
I'm creating list is a function that
takes an integer or size and some code
of function that takes that an integer
and returns a T and essentially what
this means is that it's going to do this
a hundred thousand times okay by the way
did you know you can do that in cotton I
don't like it but you can if you want
so launched common-pool delay 1000 print
and then jobs for each IT join join us
like from the same concept of thread I
don't think it's the best name nor does
Roman that wrote this but he opens
welcome to suggestions but it's
basically going to wait and then print
the result
and I've got the threaded version here
which is jobs 1 to 100,000 jobs for each
create a thread sleep a thousand and
print okay so let's run this with
threads
and we get unable to create native
thread out of memory error okay and then
we just get something printed not a
hundred thousand now let's run this with
the co-routines done okay so essentially
it is not the equivalent of a thread as
such right
the idea of suspended computation i
suspend at some point i do something and
then i come back so this is and we'll
see what this coming back and where i do
this is part of this parameter that
we'll see in a second now these are
sequential so if I come here and see
these are my suspended points so I have
suspend first functions suspend second
function right and what I'm doing here
is saying this measure time milliseconds
it's just a poor-man's or layman's
version of performance testing right
when does it start when does it end this
block of code so here I have a first
function call and then I have a second
function and I'm going to print the
result of adding those two and then I'll
see how long it took to terminate to
complete okay so this is return 13 it's
going to delay for one second it's going
to delay for one second and it's going
to return 29 so you see that it returns
42 and you see that it took 2,000
milliseconds right because it is
actually doing it in a sequential order
right because these two functions are
part of the same running block it's
going to do it in a sequential order so
how do I make this concurrent how do I
make these co-routines be able to run
concurrently so to speak
there's multiple ways but the first
thing that I can do is say a sink right
and say run this in a synchronous way so
don't wait for anything else now this
goes back to I just said that we didn't
introduce a sink oh wait no we don't
introduce those as keywords as part of
the language will you introduce those as
functions as part of a library you can
create your own co-routine you can
create your own helpers and we'll see
that there's a bunch of different
helpers so this one if I run you see
that it completes in one second
essentially right now with co-routines
then you could do sometimes these stuff
for example you can cancel co-routines
here as well so you know I can say job
cancel and that basically what it's
going to do is cancel all of those
co-routines and this common pool thing
that we've been passing all the time
this is where the kind of like what
thread this is acting on now if you're
familiar with rx you know that you have
the observer observe on or subscribe on
and you can pass in the actual thread
right which thread is this is this on a
worker thread is this on a main thread
so you can in fact subscribe on a on a
main thread and then observe on a on a
worker thread and then end up in a
deadlock but it gives you that ability
and and this is essentially the same
thing right I can run on different
threads so you have common pool which is
the normal standard one that you use is
just get a common pool from the thread
and run on that unconfined means that I
can run on anything and I can skip back
and forth context is on the actual
thread that it is so it allows you to
also have control but the main key point
to take away here is that really the
co-routines is nothing more or nothing
more I mean in terms of what it's added
to the language is suspend nothing more
that's the only new keyword under the
covers yet there's a lot more because
there's a state machine that's
implementing all of this and making you
know managing all of this but the rest
of it is delegated to library
other way you see that all of these are
highlighted with like a little block
right and that is because it's saying
that this feature is experimental
essentially and to make this clear it
doesn't mean you shouldn't use this it
means we think we've got it right but if
people start to use and give feedback
and say you screwed up we might need to
change but if we change we'll make sure
that we provide you with a migration
path right so essentially means hit out
enter and convert it to the new version
right which is the same thing that we've
been doing throughout the milestone
releases if you're tired of watching
these warnings you can just hit disable
co-routine supporting car model or
enable it and then that will add
something to Gradle if it actually
worked
that would add something to great
illegal so it adds the parameters Gradle
that you can add it to maven you can add
it to IntelliJ build system everything
and then now it's enabled it's basically
a complier
comply compiler flag right which is
saying that this is highlighting this as
experimental or not and coming down here
you can see that you know there's the
core library of co-routines right and
then you've got co-routines for jdk for
niño if you're doing reactive rx
there's also helpers to kind of combine
the concept of code routines with rx
right because remember that the
programming model is somewhat different
Rx is always talking about streams which
are observable and then you're piping
the results through different phases
whereas with colu teens it's more about
you can go back to that imperative model
of programming but there are times with
actually it is necessary or it would be
helpful to combine both have this
pipeline of calls and then get those
results from multiple places and combine
them in a single one so you can create
you can use the RX utilities here for
qualities to wrap this as like an
imperative call okay there's co-routines
for android which is targeted around
android UI development that's for JavaFX
your swing roman
is the riders behind this and the geyser
is amazing I mean he really is like he
not only does all of the work he also
writes the documentation and the samples
so I don't know when he sleeps
I mean he's got help as well but you
know he's really good okay so yeah those
are most of the things that I've shown
you here are now available in 1.1
variants generics has been always
available but high value s is the
co-routines
yeah those are the two main things that
are now available in 1.1 but if you if
you're using 1.0 most of the other stuff
that i've shown you is is working okay
any questions yes
in terms of targeting JavaScript I
believe it's in works yeah because the
1.1 release is essentially will so like
JavaScript was experimental for many
years is what Mark is experimental and
it wasn't finished 1.1 we now made some
adjustments we've cleaned something's up
and we ported the standard library to
JavaScript but Kali Linux is part of the
you know it's it's its own library so
there is no target yet for jobs
ok well then thank you for coming my
email if you wanted is Heidi at
jetbrains calm or you can find me on
twitter at h Hariri and yeah thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
