talk probably most of you have seen the
wall running down there in the
exhibition hall so this is the second
year we're doing this and I thought
would be my stew to give you some some
behind-the-scenes informations and how
we did this and who did this and how all
this started so first day that will be
me doing a space things for my day job
and doing other Java things and the
night so the history of the tweet ball
started about like last year was a
challenge Stefan send out like they have
those two big walls and there is this
javascript HTML 5 well nice looking
miserable tweets thing for displaying
tweets from de box and methought Mel you
could do javafx view community and yes
sure we took the challenge so this what
what he wanted to do us and so well yes
javafx nest it looks like very very
simple so um I got together a a nice
team Jose from Spain he's like a really
good 3d javafx guy very very good Jason
postini he's a commuter as well as a
foster Pereira on the F X Y Z 3d
open-source javafx 3d extension library
was very nice and very additional things
and Johan so helpless getting in here
and getting the twig things running and
provided the first keys for the tweet
wall at me so that was the founding team
what we did was well we did the first
sprint so you saw the day probably if I
didn't skip the slides too fast was like
two weeks before that box last year so
we came up with well you know Judy's
boring her so we got 3d so you see those
nice story up there
rotating so we could do demo if you were
like and but well Stefan didn't like it
so major point was with the Tory
rotating sometimes no tweet was visible
at all so you just had the colors of the
Tory so long well he said no well you
see I put those requirements out there
just like copy what's out there so okay
good second sprint so we thought okay we
will meet the requirements so like train
coding and down in the hacker garden
this was the first shot life of a of the
cloud running second one so yeah I got
better and then in the end what we had
running last year looked like this so
yeah we had saying images from the
tweets and we got the tweet things
running so yeah it was quite nice nice
nice achievement so every time
everything so both prototypes done in
less than two weeks probably so another
2015 addition so think it looks even
better so we got better in doing styling
and managing CSS for the application so
I think yeah it was a good was really a
kind of challenge of getting the very
colorful background running so on and
yeah thanks to the team so my jag really
did an awesome job people on my jock
jerk and Martin and the whole jerk try
to keep this project alive about the
whole time for the for the year and we
try to add all this life stuff get the
coat cleaned up and make it public
available so yes so that's where we are
now so now let's talk a bit more of a
software so I think the major thing of
the tweet wall was the tag cloud layer
thing so anybody ever seen those tech
lower things somewhere in the network so
in the net yeah some
some blog sites like it so like taking
your blogs and then lay outing things so
uh yeah that's a hard problem so in the
fact that comes down to how to arrange
where it's in a two-dimensional space so
we got the limited space we got the
words we just like pick from the tweets
and then you have to lay out the streets
so how to do well there is the thing
called wellville the source code is
unfortunately not available publicly
because it was written during some time
at IBM from some guy but he wrote a
chapter and how he did it so this is the
good news the bad news is well if you're
reading the saya chapter from the book
you figure out that this is the layout
algorithm so well for each word you get
you try a placement strategy whatever
that may be and if the new place word
intersects with a word you already
layout it only on the area well you just
move it a little bit along a spiral path
that's not so much to go with it so but
well that's the magic so everything else
you have to figure out on your own so he
does more he's talking about like how
you can fill every every area and every
shape if you get enough words and if you
can use them multiple times and if you
can resize them as you like like bigger
font smaller phones so but for the cloud
it's like yeah you want to have the
third waiting for the words like an more
more often tweeted more often use well
you get the bigger found things you have
well not seen so much get the smaller
font so well just resizing based on
funds to fill the space it's not an
option so this was a hose no go but and
then we will figure it out yeah we just
use the the world logarithm in a way for
doing this so we can dig dig a bit
deeper further down the road but um well
there are definitely improvements
visible so like a we are using a lot of
space and we had used speed so if you
want to have a compact layout you have
to be very clever and detecting
intersections you start with
intersections between rectangles like
the boundaries and you do typically and
intersect between two of those
rectangles and we figured out no it's
still not matching then you go further
and you do a two by two matching so you
have pairs matching and this ends and
the lot of white space things definitely
so um you could more do more compact
appearance so it goes out there so if
anybody's interested in doing this stuff
well you're invited to to try to do
things and send the pull request so the
implementation implementation in pure
javafx as the name suggests to equal
access and javafx we're using great loss
build system and it is on github where
else and you find it well short after
the talk at this URL so it still lives
under the jack bodensee a repository
area but don't we move it to the top
level tweet water effects thing yeah so
this has been running on different
different conferences already so we had
different Hardware we're running on so
um just a like a two weeks ago I ran in
the jar one and it ran on this so this
is like a raspberry pi and that works
quite well and in contrast to that we
got the devil software so i'm not sure
if Stefan will like what they see if I'm
showing now so that's the behind the
scenes so this is say the magic driving
the wall so you just can't probably see
the real the real a computer so it's in
the end the cupboard there so hiding
between all
the other lighting and other stuff so
yeah so this is driving the wall so how
do you do it if you want to do it
yourself well the do-it-yourself tweet
wall of X some very short steps and then
we will dive into the code and do really
tool in action so you clone the
repository you add a new branding
project I tell you about a little bit
more about this in a couple of minutes
you add the special resources you need
for your project once you have this you
decide on the hashtag you want to follow
I want to do this you need some alt keys
from Twitter so micro exercising Twitter
API special process that I think it's
developer twitter com or deaf twitter
com or similar well where you can I get
an account associated with your Twitter
account and you've got a key city
probably better not share with anyone
else so I will be very very careful on
putting my keys up here on the slides
and another video stream you put them in
the file and then you're good to go and
you're running so run on display ok so
so for slides so now let's look at some
demos so let's look at the how it looked
like in like about I the first version
we did for a netbeans day I think what's
uh boss here this year whatever so we
did napping spriting so you can see the
difference we already got a kind of a
gradient background completely started
with CSS we got an appt beans logo so
logo is say kind of replaceable in the
first bridge we just had the background
image in a way from the mother green and
we have different coloring for the for
the text and you can see it just happily
moves along probably if we are lucky it
shows probably some
we from the box as well so if anybody
wants I has tweet to show up later on
maybe just tweet about the session put
hashtag that walks in and you might be
up on the big screen okay so first stage
then we went for a for gel one so let's
see like tweet wall and jar one look and
feel looks like hopefully network yeah
network if Stein so cj1 branding the
logo Darwin logo the coffee cup they're
steaming and you get all occurring Reich
like a typical Java colors yeah so I
supposed to draw one version and I gotta
put that box version just for comparison
so I think it looks it looks better on
the big screen here then on the small
presentation walls in the exhibition
hall so yeah probably so it's not like
exactly the same version as it's running
out down there so I'm added some
improvements hopefully improvements so
you see I increase the number of tags
that are shown and change the font size
is a bit so there's more more text but
it's probably too much text for the
small walls but you can adjust this with
CSS as well good so one of the
challenges was the the colorful
background image what to do with it so
in this case we just did a kind of opac
thing so make it more transparent so
that's not less very colorful will
believe the see the other texts we
consider be the text and yeah and I put
the the dev ox logo in full color down
there as well although they're Devils
logo is already in the in the picture
good yeah on the screen someone right
very cool good so let's have a look at
the code so you ought before we look at
the code maybe I can show you the the
very original project if it still works
the original original original 3d master
version so hopeful it connects and if it
connects to see now no tweets so that
was a no go so it's still the the first
tweet image hopefully it swaps three two
one gets one yeah it seems there yes so
you see we even do a Russian kurelic
yeah Lucy it works but I think I a
variant of this was running a java land
but I think I never got the the coat
back so I have to to ping the guy so yes
so there was the original version like
very 3d ish very colorful very but well
not meeting the requirements good ok so
i hope you can can read the a bit the
the goat is better than but on the left
hand side is probably a bit smaller they
can increase this a bit so CC we try to
structure all the code a bit so we did
they the 22 we separated the 2d things
and the 3d things so we got the the
controls this is the the world with all
the CSS styling and there so they took
the tag cloud thing everything that's
moving around we separated out the
twitter for japi so we're using twitter
for j but if you want to try and go
testing and you're offline and you need
some datasets you're probably better off
just encapsulating everything so we are
still a to try to get this running and
so we added a kind of abstraction API to
do this and we got this generic 2d
project there that's the base for every
animation you just saw besides the last
one okay so let's have a look at the
litter box erosion so what do you really
need free for a version is okay so get
the backdrop picture say okay and we get
the logo to resources two files probably
and we get some fonts and the country
properties I bunch of this there are my
keys in there so and the the CSS so we
can just skip through the CSS you got
the font faces so loading two fonts sort
of ensuring that I well so yes like like
last year so we did this on my mac and
then we put the software on the windows
machine running down there in the
exhibition hall and we figured out well
ooh those fonts are well not really
matching so one thing I fixed through
this year was to I say yeah okay you can
bring your own font and put it in there
and that works way better so this is
just like rub out early the open-source
front so status line is just for
debugging purposes catawba afterwards
again and then you got the the world of
configuration so you say okay here for
we got a white background since the the
image is like only sea eels fitting the
aspect ratio so we need some some else
some glue outside so we do do white in
the background we get the background
graphics that's the the jigsaw cake we
get the logo that's the FX graphic tag
here and it would try to display up to
100 taksim
cloud so then we have the the opacity on
the background image so if you would
like to see it I more colorful or not
colorful way so it could go like like
this I'll run at this again you can see
very easy playing very easy to see very
colorful but let's say way more it costs
way more effort to read the the text so
although it works somehow good so you
can style this just by by adding by
changing those values here in the CSS
then and effects opacity is a default
CSS value while the background graphic
and display tech enum those things are
like new style properties we added to
make it more easy to do this ok scaling
in translating the the logo is like to
move it around so the the world layout
algorithm or the the not the algorithm
but the implementation here is like
looking where the logo is and ensuring
that it does not lay out over the logo
so it knows where it is located ok so
for the tax you see this is the this is
a DevOps color I took it from the from
the dead box logo so if we put on the
other color in here like let's say let's
say red I'll run it we should probably
get rare text yes a small black stroke
outside so very quick to change so very
easy very easy to handle all right ok so
then we have a with the tweet is
displayed to read the tweet not
out you get a you know the possibility
to well to set the color and the fund
for their for the name that's the handle
and for some other things as well so you
see there were favorite counts and they
were okay there likes now so probably
have to change that too hard but you can
all set all this and see it as well so i
think the i want to show you is to how
easy it is to to get one together so i
just will highlight the changes i did so
i thought we already had a tweet ball
for that work so i thought i do some for
box days as an example so i added to my
build script just a couple of lines down
here so you see i add my gradable script
to tweet well for box days copying all
this generic main stuff is like just
copying existing project description
here and they in the file once you have
this you need resources okay so i put in
the funds again so probably makes it
bigger I put in the funds and I put in
the Box today's logo let me see there it
is and I put in the country properties
with like the hashtag in it and the to
correct our keys and so let's see so
we'll start like how about we all do it
all this in so we load the font faces
and how about we'll just leave out the
logo first and can set the enum and we
don't need a movement of the logo and we
could style that they tagged later on
and pro you can do the same for
for the name and the handle and we can
do the tip oh we could even get even
yeah I could go this and start this and
you will see a very generic so you
already see the boxed color its gradient
so I just picked it from the from the
logo once more and if you don't provide
your own logo it just shows the tweet
ball FX logo so you see I'm not very
good at a graphic stuff so now let's put
in the logo once you have the logo
running just adding the logo but somehow
so liberal looks nice i think but i
think the the color of the tax is not
that good so 22 bluish not not the light
blue from from boxed so let's see if we
can fix this one so so i got this value
again from my from the logo and well
let's let's just try with without a
without additional stroke line so there
you go oh that's not good something
missing sorry ah the black and front yes
most experimenting with a with moving
around the colors so yeah thanks thanks
for picking it yeah so you see it's now
they're probably the good color but well
very hard to read on screen yeah so
let's try to be a bit creative and we
put this in see this better so five
month looks quite good looking at my
screen so yeah that's better so um so
you could do like a drop shadows and in
our borders and whatever effects you
like so um well you just need to be big
bigger the graphics probably but I'm
typically those conferences have some
guys who are and we can put this in
there as well so on we get a slight
different experience of the name tags
once it moves around say wait yes so now
I see the great gray color for for the
name for the handle and for full of
later bit of the tweet okay so that was
the do-it-yourself version so um yeah we
got four minutes for questions if you
dare to ask anyone questions wishes
enhancement requests no nothing okay
thanks for showing up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
