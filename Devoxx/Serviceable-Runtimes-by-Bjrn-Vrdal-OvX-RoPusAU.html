everyone and glad I managed to fill the
room I will be talking about serviceable
runtimes specifically j9 and Omar
related but we'll see if we can get past
that first a little bit about myself my
name is Buren bore doll I worked for IBM
on the run times developer I work on the
j9 VM team I'm on Twitter so Twitter
handles there
I mostly talk about runtime stuff or
related so don't worry about getting all
kinds of spam things I've worked on I
came in a bit on the tail end of method
handles did some enhancements and
they're a little bit of the Landis work
I worked I implemented var handles in
Java 9 for for the IBM SDK and I'm also
working actively on project Valhalla so
back to serviceability I like I think
this is true most things die young
especially if you don't service them
true for cars true for humans true for
runtimes so you can think that it would
be important to get a runtime that is
really performant and and because it's
so fast that any of course everybody we
want this but I think reality is that if
you can't service it if it's not
reliable and buy reliable it means it
won't crash and if it does crash well at
least you can be relied upon to provide
a fix they're not gonna pick it up
before I go any further don't trust
anything I say that's basically it
so the tool I want to talk about is a
direct dump reader it's we call it DDR
of course it's a an advanced core reader
or a core dump analysis for 4j9 we our
service team uses that our developers to
use it it's a tool that aids everything
we do so that it just knows a lot about
the about the runtime DDR Interactive is
the front-end so I will be talking about
a few different parts and I hope I'm
able to introduce them properly to you
as we get to them so starting with DDR
Interactive just to take a look at the
front end first hopefully you can read
that there's this there's a command line
just to get it started if you run the
dejar file which ships with with j9 so
Jana and DDR jar is in there
provide the core file and it starts up
and immediately says they noticed that
you have a j9 Java VM in here I found it
and anything that starts with the
exclamation mark as you can see in the
green there is is a command in DDR
interactive so it suggests that a if you
want a starting point Jana and Java VM
with this address which is where I found
it is a good starting point it also
suggests and read their j9 help which is
where we gonna start which will give me
a lot of commands that I can use so the
running train on help I've modified the
output a little bit here but it suggests
hey you can run the threads command and
we'll give you a list of all the VM
threads you can run the stack command
and I will tell you the stack of that
thread you can run the stock slots come
in and I will give you the the stock
trace and a lot of extra details about
the actual state of that stack do we
have anything else ok it's the ones so I
will be talking about the ones above a
little bit the ones further down here
class 4 name is another one you can run
and you
we get the the class internals class
structure for for a given class name and
some over here
dumped class bytes for a for an internal
representation of a class file find any
pattern or what is at this address so
those are some of the things that the
tool can do so we are going to run the
threads command nice dump of threads
start running conveniently names them
for me so I know for example which is
the main thread and on the other side
there you can see that it again suggests
a notice that this is a thread a good
way to explore a thread is to run the
stacks command or stack command so we're
going to run the stack command and we
get this and you can see it gives us a
little stack trace not too much
information in that but at least we have
the stack trace you can see from the
bottom that we have this class X with a
main method calling em calling print and
you can see what arguments we should
expect to those methods but if we do run
the stack slots command which is the one
that has more details so run it on the
same address I get some initial output
here but starting with the yellow ones
you can see those are the ones that are
actual actual sack frames so I have a
stack frame here which is some internal
one first and here I actually have a
bytecode frame and you can see in red
the actual method that that represents
this is the print method and in green
you can see I can actually explore the
arguments on the stack and they keep
coming the different bicode frames and
some j'ni frames at the bottom so this
this allows me to explore any java stack
in my core file in a way that no other
tool would allow me to do
so we can show one more thing that I can
do if we do explore that argument if you
see in green there's the argument to the
to the print method and I expect that
argument to be a string and the internal
representation of any object in our VM
is a j9 object so and any internal
structure the name of it I can use as a
command so I can call bang j9 object on
that address and it gives me a nice
output saying yeah
here's your object this is what it looks
like and yes here's my string as I
mentioned other tools couldn't really
give me especially for example the stack
slots out but if you do a comparison
between gdb and DDR first a conceptual
comparison where ddb requires that I
have intimate knowledge about the
internal VM structures DDR already has
that intimate knowledge so it can help
me explore it
gdb would require some debug symbols to
get things right or at least a gives
they make it easy for me to explore
things DDR doesn't require debug symbols
at compile debug time and where gdb
would require it's quite fragile when it
comes to matching the what I'm exploring
to what actually what actually was there
in the application that crashed or in
that core file DDR is crossed JVM across
version supports cross version and where
gdb will be platform-specific DDR is
completely clapton platform independence
so I can take core file from our that
came from Windows and explore it on
Linux output difference if we look at
what gdb would give me if I try to
explore the same stack slots so if I
basically give it this address of the
stack this is all I get right I have to
explore that myself try to figure out
which what points where and what means
what
compared to ddr output which neatly
gives me all the information with the
right labels to tell me what it actually
is so just a couple of things that
people have said in our team about the
tool first thing is it's a tool for the
service team it's a tool they use the
most on the safe some the most time
obviously from the previous slide you
can see they there's a lot of is a lot
easier to explore the internals with it
the other thing is what what we all can
also do is we can write plugins that can
or extension stacking where we can add
in knowledge about common symptoms that
we have seen and then we can that we can
just run that and we get a core file we
can say uh let's look if let's check if
any of the common things are a problem
here and we can easily find out quickly
if if we're actually dealing with a
problem we've seen before okay staying
there why does it matter to anyone here
what we do internally with our debugging
well open j9 we're open sourcing the j9
JVM DDR coming along for the ride you
can explore more about open j9 on open
j9 org on the topic of open source
eclipse om R is also involved in this
and I will show more like which
components belong where later but
Eclipse om are gives you the runtimes
components you need to build a good
runtime so something's for that there
and now that I've spent a lot of time
talking about different things that will
actually give you some sort of agenda my
file my real goal here is what I want to
do is I want to put DDR in a new runtime
I it's in Jane unsure but can I put DDR
into a new runtime to do that we need
something that will generate the DDR
resources for me so I will explore that
but before before we get to that I will
show you a little bit more how DDR it
works in j9 and
how it is implemented so we already
looked kind of by example what DDR can
do but to structure a bit more it can
print the structure and an address as I
mentioned for example j9 object or j9
method at a given address there are
other printing commands which are more
j9 specific and have to be programmed as
the extensions that I mentioned so stack
slots is an example of that there are
other utility functions like finding a
class finding a pattern finding the type
of something stored at an address so
those are the utility functions and then
we also have some data analysis
extensions like GC check which is able
to analyze the heap and find out is
there a problem is it something go wrong
here are there any pointers that are
pointing to the wrong thing also some
deadlock detection where I can it will
look at the monitors and see if if
there's a deadlock for example GC check
output where it will scan everything
this is successful output so nothing to
see you really so how does it work so
you have your run time we have ddr
interactive did our interactive was the
from the j9 ddr jar that i showed
earlier and then your run time in our
case the j9 JVM we put structure layout
information inside the run time so at
run time so in the memory one is running
we put this ddr blob which contains
information about the structure of
everything and and other information as
well into the into the into memory that
information comes from a DDR data
generator which will also talk more
about later the ddr generator also
generates code to read those structures
which is what we put inside DDR
interactive and then what we do also do
is we put a some detectable pattern so a
structure with the detectable
in it inside the run time so that and
then we point that to the Bob so we can
always find this if we get a core dump
from it so in the core dump because it
was in the memory at runtime we still
have the ddr blob we still have the
detectable wrath structure so separating
things out a bit to give you a better
overview overview the ddr generator is
currently in the source project Eclipse
OMR so you can get that there you can
already run this on your software open
j9 is coming soon
the j9 JVM and the ddr interactive tool
are both in there the Rath structure
that I mentioned let's take a closer
look at that one so as I mentioned you
have runtime memory you have a there's a
VM structure so there's always some kind
of core structure at the core of your of
your runtime in our case the java vm
structure there a structure then points
back to that simple normal structures it
just points back to that but also at the
top you can see it has this eye catcher
in this case j9 dmrs which is what ddr
and interactive will look for to find
this I also has some confirmation bit
patterns after it and then at points as
I mentioned before the wrath structure
also points to the ddr blobs so now we
have everything we need and DDR
interactive to to explore the rest of
the memory let's take a closer look at
the DDR blob and where it came from so
switching to Omar there's a DDR gen in
the Omar project it can read so you can
pile with debug symbols so you need your
debug symbols at this point you don't
need it later but you compile with debug
symbols and then DDR gen is able to read
the structures out of the the dwarf
structures so it pulls in the Lib dwarf
to do that for you and then it also
scans the source for for build flags and
macros and and adds that into the
formation that it outputs as well so
there's a script get macros in in OMR as
well that helps you do that you give
give that input the DDR gen and it will
output blob dot and that's your DDR blob
which you can then read into memory at
runtime
it also outputs super set which is
another thing that we need to explore so
superset is what we use to generate the
classes for DDR interactive to read the
blob information so we we generate
structure structure classes that map
back to the structures in the in the
source and then we also generate pointer
classes which basically then will be the
pointers to those structures in the
source so we generate the Java files and
we drop that into DDR interactive to
allow it to to load these classes and
and use them to point to the structures
so those are all the classes it would
expect to find so then at DDR
interactive start up there's a DDR class
loader in it that will load the
structure structure and pointer classes
so it pulls in the generated java
classes as a template and then it takes
a blob data and populates the field
offsets from there
so just summary of what we've done so
far we looked at some of the DDR
capabilities I looked at the res
structure and how that points to the
core and to the blob it looked at Omar
DDR gen to see where we get the data
from
and then DDR interactive how it uses to
blob in the superset to get you what you
need at runtime to explore all the
memory so DDR in a new runtime that's
where I wanted to get to can we do it it
was a very real question for me if you
add a month ago so the one I decided to
go with is something related to Omar
where we try to use
baseline is this new runtime we have
four for playing with om are like the
jet builder and and other components so
it's very small it has ten off codes
very easy to deal with so I want to use
it for demonstrating DDR functionality
there's a link to my fork of the project
there so you can see the work actually
to get this working and I just want to
mention that what I got out of this was
a very quick prototype it's about an
hour of hacking and most of it was
copied from jayne-ann JVM which when you
want to do the same thing will also be
available so back to this razz structure
graphic that we had before we have the
Rath structure in the middle the DDR
blob image and the Java VM structure and
in the j9 case so all I really have to
do is just copy the same structures over
and point to the execution context which
is the core of of base 9 instead so I
kept everything else the same I say my
catcher just to play nicely with DDR
interactive and then of course the ddr
blob I got from running DDR gen on base
9 in terms of code changes not very much
I threw in this structure here that's
the route structure I expected so it has
the eye-catchers you see highlighted at
the top and appointed to the VM or to
the execution context highlighted close
further down there I initialize I added
a couple of methods one to initialize
this structure just throw in all the
information that I have and another one
to read that DDR blob file and just get
that into memory it nothing magic about
that just allocate enough bytes same
size as the file read the file right and
done and then in the execution context
which is the core structure of base 9 I
added a feel for it and added a call to
the constructor and that was all I
needed to do to ddr enable my base 9
runtime so now it looks like this I have
appointed to the blob a pointer to the
execution context DDR enabled
DDR interactive a little bit more
complicated has definitely a bigger this
bigger project a lot more to it than the
ddr gen portion of it so what did I have
to do to get DDR interactive to work
with base 9 I first I disabled all the
j9 specific functionality that includes
for sample stack slots because the way
the stack is set up in Java in the j9
java vm
is of course not the way it's set up in
base 9 so basically anything that
depended on certain structures was out I
told her to look for the b9r a structure
instead of j9 rice or a structure
nothing big there and I have to add a
bunch of build flags manually so I
forced it to always go to 64-bit and a
few things like that but in general not
many code changes at all it was mostly
just disabling disabling the dynamic
portions of ddr interactive but again as
I said before it was quick hacking was
by one hour so the result it works but
not very advanced functionality but
let's take a look at it I'm gonna switch
to live for that and see where I am here
so the benign that I have here is DDR
enabled so I'm going to go ahead and run
run b9 with some some program and I've
injected a hang at the end here just to
give me a chance to get a core file so
so here I have my core file and that's
my input - DDR Interactive so if I now
run the see DDR Adar and run in track
DDR interactive with that core what did
I do
and immediately it finds let's see if I
can where am i okay at the bottom you
can see it finds the execution talk of
context immediately because again they
just looked for the Rath structure and
found that so it knows where the core
element is I also outputted the the Rath
structure above there so you can see it
finds the expected bit patterns and
things like that so the suggested
command is to run execution context I
will do that and here you can see it has
the structure and pull the structure out
of the debug symbols stored it into the
blob file which I read into memory so
now I am able to print that structure
again from any core file that I get
handed from benign just want to do one
more I got this it said it found the
Rath structure here so I'm gonna see if
it's willing to give me that so I I know
the start the name of my structure is
b9r as I gave it the pointer that's
where it said it would be and as you can
see you maybe you can't tell from the
eye catcher but but from the bit
patterns they are exactly what we
expected so then I can explore all of my
memory from here with suggested commands
for what I should find where
see
it's not giving me my presentation back
there we go
so what's next for DDR I really want to
make DDR plug and play so basically not
have to do the changes I have to make to
to get DDR Interactive to just work so
if you have a DDR enabled blob file I
want it to run or if did er enable core
file is what I should say it would be
nice is simplified the DDR generation
process and of course we need to release
DDR interactive and the generator so
generators out get DDR interactive out
as well so quick conclusion here we
looked at DDR and j9 the capabilities
how its implemented DDR gen is what
gives you the resources the data the
blob file the superset to be able to -
DDR enable your runtime and then we were
able to make it work in base 9 where we
can now explore the internal structures
and that was my presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
