talk is a I think titled micro profile
for micro services so probably I guess a
lot of people in this room have already
heard about micro profile I don't know
quite how much you know about it but I
hopefully will explain a little bit
about that today this is going to be my
perspective as a member of the payara
team so those who they don't know there
are a lot of vendors of micro profile
and pi r is one of them so I'm going to
talk about micro profile in general and
then one or two bits that are more
specifically about the stuff that we've
been doing so let's get straight into it
so what is micro profile can you show of
hands like how many people are still
kind of unsure okay that's a reasonable
number then so that's good that you're
here so my profile is at its heart a
specification it is separate from Java
EE it is separate from the JCP it's not
completely apart and come it's not like
it knows nothing about Joffrey because
it uses at the moment api's from Java EE
but the aim of micro profile is really
to be at its heart very very
collaborative and that's not only
collaboration between vendors and people
that are in involved from that
perspective but also you guys the
community try and get you guys engaged
in the things that we're doing and the
things that we want to say we also want
it to be very open so all of the stuff
that we talk about is not done behind
closed doors it's not done in a place
where you won't see it because we've got
things like Google Groups and we share
everything that we do very openly so
next who is this way that I keep talking
about the people that are involved are
the people on this slide this is really
really similar to a slide that you may
have seen before if you've seen any of
these sorts of talks you can see there
are some names of vendors there we've
got IBM Tommy tribe PI R and red hat all
of whom do application service and all
have kind of come together since June to
create a new if you like approach to
doing microservices with their own
platforms but we've also got hammock in
there as well which was a little bit of
a later edition that's where you don't
see anything in our demo app including
hammock I've also included sujatha and
the ljc to community efforts that are
really really heavily involved with
micro profile so that we can actually
get the developer the developer
community helping to shape the direction
of micro profile and where we want to go
so why should you care I always think
this is an important slide to have on
these sorts of talks and at the end of
the day this is my opinion but I think
probably the fact that you are at this
conference means that you care very much
about technology you care very much
about the tools that you use and that
they actually help you solve your own
problems so that in solving your
problems you can then solve the problems
of your customers at the moment I think
the way things have been going in Java
EE is is good I like the direction that
Java is going in but yeah in the past
javi has been perhaps criticized by some
people as being quite slow to adopt new
things and in part that's by design you
know you want to standardize on things
that people watch you're already using
and not just you know guess or making it
decisions yourself but the really key
thing is that there's never really been
a place for there to be some sort of new
ground being pushed forward from users
of Java EE so for example CDI was
heavily inspired by spring
which is related to Joffrey but still
quite separate so I think really the
micro profile for people in the audience
here is a really great opportunity to
help get involved and to help steer the
ship of Java EE and enterprise Java in
general in the direction that you want
to see it going you know maybe you're
really keen on reactive technologist and
you think actually that's a really
really critically important thing but we
want to get on board with early on so
that's something that you can do and you
can give feedback in so a little bit now
about what we've been doing pyara was in
an interesting place when the
discussions around micro profile first
started we was actually very close to
the announcement that happened back in
June so pyara already had a build called
pyara micro which is our own approach to
micro services so really what micra
profile has been for us has just been
another cut of pyara micro so for those
who don't know pie or a micro
encapsulate AP is that are normally
found in the java web profile but also
adds a couple of extras it adds J batch
and it adds je cache which isn't even in
Java yet I say yet because i didn't
really keen on it getting in there i
think is really valuable so micro
profile is effectively another edition
for us and i think a really key thing to
point out is that certainly at pyara we
don't see micro profile as a toy we
don't see it as just a proof of concept
or just something to do to be looked at
we see it's something to be used and we
want to make sure that that's the
message that we get out as pyara that
our micro profile product is a product
and it's one that we can the support and
one that we hope to work very closely
with the community to push forward I
can't speak for other vendors but from
my discussions with them I know that
they will feel the same
that we're all very excited about my
profile and we all are very keen on
making it a real product in a real
platform that you can be confident about
building your apps on and since I do
have time i wanted to show a little bit
about how I micra profile looks so if
you go to should probably actually put
it on the right screen so yeah if you go
to periodic fish / downloads you'll see
that we've got the full pay our server
there we've got pie our own micro and
we've also got pie on my pro profile one
point oh so if we go to that screen that
one this is the micro profile that I a
website which I will allows you come
back to that in a minute so what I've
done is I've already downloaded our
micro profile it just comes as a jar
file pi r michael profiles desh one
point whole jar and we use in the same
way as pie or a micro so we have a
microphone file published on maven so
that you can just use it as part of your
build process and i'm actually in talk
tomorrow which is more details about
micro profile where we'll demonstrate
that but i wanted to show one of the
command line options so here in the
window just below the one that I'm in
we've got a previously built part of the
micro service example app here you can
see that there are three outputs and you
might notice this a swarm jar there so
this is something that was originally
built untargeted to the Wi-Fi swarm
implementation of the microbe profile
so we deploy to we deployed to the micro
profile in the same way that we deploy
to pyro micro in that we just do Java
minus jar to the binary then you can do
minus minus deploy and then your wife
I'll so if I just do that now then
you'll see it start up obviously this
isn't the approach that everyone likes
so we've also got the ability to output
an uber jar if you call it on the
command line like that but this just a
little overview of of what we do I one
thing in to point out actually is that
by default in the micro profile we don't
disable hazel cast so je cache is still
there now in the sample app because that
is affected of the closest thing that we
have to a TCK right now we've explicitly
disabled that with the no cluster option
so hazel cast won't start it does add a
little bit of extra start of time as
well but we've left it there in the
micro profile because really it's our
view on the direction of micro profile
and it's something that we think is
going to be very valuable in creating a
micro services fabric so it's something
that we want to push quite a lot we
don't want to enforce it on the
community so what we're trying to do is
just convince you of its merits so that
you can then vote for it and get
involved with the process to get things
moved on so that's a little bit about
what we've been doing next how you can
get involved is in a few different ways
so there's micro profile that I oh that
I've just shown you that's a Google
Group which I'll show you as well
so on if you go to the micro profile
tire web page you can see that there is
a link in the top right corner called
join us and that will take you to the
google group which I've asked you
already got loaded here so don't trust
the network it's not behaving today so
there you will see all of our
discussions and that is literally all of
them we don't have any other you know
behind closed doors discussions but
something that's quite important i think
is this one so hiker from Red Hat has
been doing a lot of work on the process
to evolve the micro profile and I think
somewhere in this thread there is a
google doc of the meeting that was had
so all of the notes there in public the
call details were there so you could
join it yourself if you wanted to but
yeah do please get involved have a look
at the google groups see what
conversations are going on and do take
part in them yourselves because we
really want to hear your input so other
things that you can do is with that
evolution process you can submit your
own proposals of what you think should
be in there you know maybe you're really
concerned about configuration and having
a standard between different servers you
know be really nice to be able to set
the port in exactly the same way so
micro pyara micro at the moment you set
the port with minus minus port for
barfly swarm you would do minus DS I
think swarmed HTTP depart so maybe there
are things around there that you're
concerned about do please submit
proposals or vote on and be active in
their proposals that we've got already
and lastly we have a buff discussion
session today at 8pm in buff too so
please come along with any questions
that you've got because my time has just
about run out the other thing that I'll
say as well as you do come to the buff
I've got a few more t-shirts like these
and quite a few stickers that if you're
into kind of customizing your laptop so
do please come along or C the talk
tomorrow thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
