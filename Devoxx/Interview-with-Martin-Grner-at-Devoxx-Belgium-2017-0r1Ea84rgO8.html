talking to you Martin he's been named
checked a few times by Stefan of having
one of the most watched YouTube videos
and so you give talk a talk about
machine learning with tensorflow without
a PhD yes so I expect that you get asked
a lot about tensorflow and specifically
maybe we could just introduce it a bit
before I ask you more about use cases
sensor flow is a is a Python library
that allows you to build neural network
models and it's a library that we
designed mostly for our research teams
so that they can build anything that
comes out of the lab could be built in
tensor flow and the second design goal
is for it to be production ready because
we didn't want production people to take
a model from the lab and say well this
is horrible I have to rewrite it before
I put it in production so these are the
two main goals of tensorflow
build the next you know innovation and
and then ship it so you can use it if
you're a researcher but you can also use
it in production yes and there is
actually an intermediate between those
two it's it's it's us it's developers
normal software developers and more and
more software developers are jumping on
this this bandwagon because machine
learning and tensorflow and deep
learning solve real problems in the
enterprise at Google I'm seeing it
because outside of the research teams
tensorflow is used in thousands and
thousands of teams and for that we've
been pushing on the tensorflow team to
add a little bit higher level api's to
make it easier for non researchers to
build the models that we need and now
finally in tensorflow 1.4 which has just
been released as a developer I'm finally
happy with the API I can work with this
how easy is it to get started with the
tensorflow API for a developer for an on
machine learning expert well I think
it's roughly the same difficulty are
starting with a new language as
developer you are kind of used to that
learn a completely new language so think
of it as the same kind of learning curve
you will have to new to learn a couple
of new concepts but at the end of the
day once you're proficient in these new
concepts it's like any other field of
computer science you are piecing blocks
together that you as an engineer know
that you're working well and you know
what are the standard or the
state-of-the-art solutions for given
problems and you managed to assemble the
neural network or a full solution out of
those blocks which which responds
exactly to the problem that you're
solving is it advantageous to learn
Python first and then to explore
tensorflow or can you yes please spend
10 minutes learning Python that's
approximately what it takes I love
Python for that I do code labs where
people should tensorflow code labs where
people show up they've never done any
Python at all and they can still go
through the lab Python is great for that
I have to admit I do have a slight bias
towards Python maybe I do like a
difficult thing I found is the Java
developer learning Python it was getting
my head around the arrays particularly
we used some of the Python libraries
like numpy and tends to flow has some
data structures they're completely new
as well Pinsir flow tends to emulate
exactly what number does so that people
who know numpy are immediately very
familiar with how it works in tensorflow
and actually tensorflow
has this deferred execution environment
where when you use tensorflow
you build a computation graph then stuff
will need this graph to do all the
automation that it does but when you run
this graph and obtain values real values
those are real number values so it's
it's fully compatible once you have a
number or an array that comes out of 10
through flow
it's an umpire array and you can you can
plug it into any library that supports
numpy which is basically all scientific
computation libraries on Python how much
of the challenge of using tensorflow
is getting your head around
and the library or the framework I know
most of the challenge is to understand
the underlying concepts because the
library now is pretty well packaged and
all the concepts that are useful usually
are represented by one function in
tensorflow but this function might
encapsulate a pretty complex concept
that has a scientific foundation and
that you need to learn first and that's
precisely why I'm doing these tensorflow
without a ph.d sessions to give people
this perspective of what is behind this
function how does it work
without necessarily going all the way
into the equations but to keep them the
engineering perspective so that as a
software engineer they know how to use
it they know what it does and they know
how to apply it efficiently
that's what we need us computer software
engineers can you tell me something
about ml engine yes ml engine is on
Google cloud platform the tensor flow
execution environment it's a pretty
simple service where you submit tensor
flow training jobs
what is so I used to have a discrete GPU
on my machine and for small models
actually I think that's better but for
bigger models I tend to to or to send
the job to team L engine simply because
I can send multiple jobs at once and so
they will execute in parallel or be huge
but I don't have to worry about it I
don't have to worry about shutting
instances down in one feature that is
super useful for me as a developer is
hyper parameter tuning all of the magic
of training a model is finding the best
parameters and with hyper parameter
tuning you can just give it ranges and
ask the system to find those parameters
for you it will run multiple trials but
it's it's done in a smart way it's
called Bayesian optimization so that the
first trials inform it on how to search
for the best parameters in the
subsequent trials and and I I couldn't
work without it now
so more into the kind of networks that
you can build can you build so obviously
you can do a standard feed-forward
neural networks with tensor flow is
there support for convolutional and
recurrent neural networks that you might
use for times sensitive time series data
with recurrent neural networks yes yes
there is a layers API which has various
neural network layers that you can use a
dense layer of convolutional layer and
so on so for convolutional layer layers
for convolutional neural networks that
works great and there is a specific
recurrent neural network API which which
is I find it fantastic in in the session
we've been able to recreate a Google
Translate in literally ten lines of code
and it's ten lines of code without
cheating it's not instantiate Google
Translate we are actually building the
full model from scratch using the
sequence to sequence its API with an
attention wrapper and this was built by
by Google research so that they could
experiment in a very easy fashion
different architectures for building
those recurrent neural networks models
and I I find this API to be really
really nicely put together what's your
favorite part of types of loan using
tensor flow well today the estimator API
which encapsulate the model and allows
you to simply launch it on a managed in
for instance it has just been redesigned
and I have to admit it wasn't great
before but with this redesign they
really got it right
it's I write exactly the lines of code I
I want to write as a software developer
without any crafting without falling
through the cracks into into stuff that
I I don't know what that is so I really
love it now it's stencil for 1.4 and
finally productive with it as a software
death thank you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
