the session but we are going to talk
about testing and you know how r Killian
and Gawker can help you to write tests
and obviously how to can help you on
writing test for microservices my name
is alex 02 on Derrek Lee Ann Q fleet I
work as a software engineering club is
and you can follow me on Twitter you
have any question or wherever you can
ping in twitter and also my get up is a
lot of the jars so yeah containers is
that thing that has existed for a long
long time and now it's the past two
years it's becoming a trending thing and
you know are you everybody who can put
containers and productions and who can't
use this for example testing or or for
playing or for running in the production
environments but anybody here doesn't
know what is darker or how it works
darker yeah you don't know to stock it
okay doctor is in a an application
container in giant in the sense that it
takes it creates a container which it we
just when you put all the your processes
and you know all your files and so on
inside this container like you know like
this content that goes with the ships
and it starts in a safe environment a
top of a linux kernel so you have a safe
environment door but you can do whatever
you want and yes as any process you can
kill it start and so on so the way how
we built a docker image is like blogger
pool you put you get an image name on
the image and then the the image is
where its download it from the your
daughter repositories and this is an
image then we can also create a docker
image with docker file
which dr filiz of you know it's a file
to build your custom docker container or
even if you want you can say that you
can use dr. Campos which instead of
creating one container with duck on
compose what you're doing screen more
than one container so this is a sample
of docker file the from keyword is
forcing in which image is based then we
run for creating a directory we move to
the directory we copy from the local
artist the index dot HTML to users
source AP p also we are exposing the
port 8080 to and then as you can see
here it is i think that is the shorter
shorter and lightest I ttp server that
you have ever seen in your life it's
going to be simple you know it's only
one line of code and this is an HTTP
server which you know returns the index
dot HTML and then when you want to build
the image you simply do a docker build
you create a tag and discuss and then
you you know you run that container and
you have the server up and running let
me show you in a big way the first thing
that I'm doing is creating the image
which is everything in scotch because
you know to save time and then we run
and yeah this is or you know service
running in dahkur I would say that it
takes more time on you know transforming
this image to base64 and pasting inside
the HTML rather than you know creating
the server so yeah
this is now mm no no so my name is Ashna
klippstein and i'm a senior software
engineer at Red Hat and I'm the
archiving project lead how many here
know about are killing from before ends
up how many have you used it okay so not
too many so we start up at going through
some of the basics of it so a short
introduction to what our Killian or what
we know to be our Killian now what that
is so our Killian is not per se a
testing framework it's a it's a
middleware for your test so to speak
we're not trying to compete with j unit
and testing g and all of those types of
things we're more integrating with all
of them there's a lot of tools out there
for testing already what achillion tries
to do is to kind of combine those all
into a coherent story around integration
testing essentially so from the are
killing point of view when you when you
start to run a test the first thing you
have to do is some way of selecting what
kind of environment that you want this
test to run in and traditionally that
has been any formal application server
typically wildfly or jboss or glass fish
and so on and whether or not that
contain the rates on your local machine
or if it's on a server somewhere else or
in the cloud our Killian doesn't really
matter and it knows how to communicate
with the different type of containers
then as Arcadian start up it will
connect or startup that server for you
that's kind of the first step that
happens then it will need to you need to
provide the environment that this is
going to run within and at that point
there's a face within our Killian that's
the packaging phase where you define
your Java classes your resources your
XML files and all that into a deployment
of some sort and are killing will then
forward at and deployed to the
environment or to the container and then
it moves the execution from your normal
normal j unit to inside the container so
at that point when your test method
actually execute you have access to all
the resources that are available within
the containers so you can inject live
objects like CDI beans or v's connection
factories message queues and so on and
use them as if you were a normal
deployed application and the next step
is of course to verify that this test
runs and report back to the normal
testing framework chain essentially so
it doesn't matter whether you're not
you're running your j j unit in this
case in a in eclipse or to surefire the
reporting will happen in the same
fashion and surefire or j unit doesn't
really know the difference and then of
course there's a certain clean up and on
the ploy and stop the server and that
kind of thing so as far as the example
go so this is a fairly basic j unit
based test the first thing you have to
do is to use the j unit integration
points with the run with wrong with our
kill you in the class telling jenny to
hand over all the logic of how to run
this test to our Killian when I'm then
our killing starts up it will be looking
for that deployment method that's where
you define what type of environment this
is going to be so this is where you can
i define a job archive you can do a web
bark I've you can do a generic archive
of some sort enterprise archives and all
those different types and build it up as
you like to define this target
environment and then when the tests are
executed potentially in the remote
container you can inject or using any of
the existing component models injection
points in this case using the add
injects back but you cannot just as well
use at resource or a tea to be and then
inject the law
objects back into your your test case
and then as far as the test method goes
to just asserting on it on a normal
normal normal normal object essentially
so the libraries that are used to create
the deployment methods is a slight bit
called shrink wrap so you can add
classes packages files and folders and
resolve libraries from maven central and
all those type of things do to build up
this type of packages and then there's
the opposite side of the ink container
testing which is the default mode but of
course certain cases you want to test
the external endpoints as well as you
want to test an HTML page where you want
to test a dexterous endpoint for
instance or remotely to be or what have
you then you define the deployment to be
testable false and then are killing just
deploys that thing and the test itself
will execute on the client side that
being either in the clips or in surefire
depending on how you run it and well
this example we're simply just asserting
some state on a dexterous end point
since rkelly anything control over the
container and the deployment you can
also inject back things like the URL to
wear this application was deployed so
you don't have to hard code in some
properties file are we now running on
the staging environment or in the or in
the test server achillion will give you
that information based on what it knows
about the container and the deployment
so we just released the first alpha of
what we call the are Killian universe
bombs the Bill of Materials essentially
just the palm file that defines
everything of all the extensions that
are available in a coherent and unified
way essentially so start off with
defining the arc alena universe palm
file as part of dependency management
and you import it and then you
you just add something Oracle in
universe and then the module name being
are killing j unit are killing testing g
are killing Spock or killing cucumber or
drone and graphene or any of the other
type of extensions that are there and it
as we were saying before it needs some
form of container so in this case we're
going to use the chameleon container
which is a kind of wrapper container for
all of the other containers to simplify
the user classpath essentially where all
the dependencies are loaded dynamically
so we can have a look at just how to
essentially just run those demos that we
had or the source codes that you saw on
the slides so we have here defined it in
our Killian XML just to find that
there's one container here and using the
chameleon we're going to say that this
is going to be a wild fly 99 container
and it's going to be in managed mode so
meaning are killing will download the
artifacts or the container distribution
and start it up as part of the the test
lifecycle so the first test we're going
to do I it's an in container tests and
since it's seamlessly more or less
integrated with the DJ unit experience
or jaynewick sprinted j unit framework
when you're in the ID you can simply
just do a run as a unit test and
probably a bit hard to see in the logs
personality but essentially starting up
the server and executing the tests and
we have a green bar of course and
similarly this was the entertaining
version of it and the the client-side
version of it mentioned before just be a
detestable false and the test gates will
now actually run inside the same vm and
again when you run it it will start up
the server and deploy and on the play as
it goes and green power
so that's the essence of her killing as
we know it so it's it's it's built to be
portable in the sense that when we saw
the example code there was nothing there
in the test code itself that said
anything about what kind of container
this was going to run on if it was going
to be running on a glassfish or a
wildfire so all of that information is
extracted out and left up to the
configuration essentially so you can
easily swap between what type of
implementations that you want to test
your code on its intended to be executed
from wherever you want so you don't have
to go through the whole build phase for
instance in maven to get some artifact
to deploy you can sit in your ID and
just to run and based on the ids support
for incremental compilation for instance
you will have all the updated sources as
you go along and our Killian is built to
be flexible and extensible as a very
wide extension model to support any type
of testing services and integration with
other frameworks so with their support
for selenium their support for
persistence for TB unit and a bunch of
these type of testing frameworks that
already exist but then bundle into dr
Killian way of doing things and then
allowing you to do this these frameworks
in container for instance so as far as
being extensible we're going to look at
one of these extensions today so i'm
going to give you back to Alex Thanks
well yeah now this is one extension with
this clean cube which as luck says is an
extension of our Killian and we're clear
on community thought that and the past
all of you have seen in there Killian
core what we are doing is you know take
writing a test and before they execute
it started the server deploy the
application deploy the test in ticket
the test and then stop the done deployed
application and stop the server and we
thought that
it does was a really nice feature but we
could do it even better and it was like
if there is darker we can start darker
darker we'll start the application
server we are going to deploy their or
application on your test we are going to
execute the test and then we are going
to stop the docker container so you know
it's it seems pretty natural this stab
and this is exactly what is our clean
cube it's a an extension which manages
the life cycle of the docker containers
so when you execute your test our clink
you've automatically start the you know
the container or containers that you
have define it as a requirement for your
test then you know it's acute the test
and finally it stops that the continues
its it's interesting to see that in in
the previous examples well well well
flag was a start we use the manager mode
which means that our Killian will start
the container and then stop the
container but in case of cube since the
you know the petition service is a
started automatically in docker you need
to make our clean to start anything the
only thing that you need to do is
correct to that container and under
plication service it's inside the
container and this what we are doing in
cube as far as I as I said you can use
container or containers I mean that you
can define one container and run your
tests or define the container where
you're going to run the test and all the
containers that are required by your
application for example a mail server
database a James q whatever you need
inglis that all of them and then do with
acute the test against those containers
but also the one thing that we face it
is that with the new trend of micro
services where sometimes you don't use
an application server we needed also to
give support for these scenarios and I
think you also can be used with drop
wizard
and a springboard application which is
not I mean that spring boot that it's
not compared to a war file I mean that
jar file natty note bird X or you know
any kind of application that can run
inside the docker container so to run
this is an example of how to run wild
fly in a knowing in a rocker file so you
put here the image you up the users so
because if you if you want to deploy
something to wildfly you need to provide
the user and password to deploy that
file so you need to add the users and
finally we start the waffle and this is
how our clinic if test looks like notice
that there is nothing new I mean that
you're not seeing anything related with
Q on with docker the only thing that
maybe you are saying here is that using
the data set annotation this is another
extensions of archaean which is our
Killian persistence extension which
helps you you know to maintain that data
of your databases in a known state and
basically with this test does is that
every time that show should find a
strongest beer is educated before its
execution it populates your database
with the BML file after that execute the
test and with net and when the test it's
you know it's finish it cleans your
database this what this annotations is
doing but notice that from the point of
view of docker you see nothing strange
but of course we need to add the
dependency on the classpath and to add
the dependency to the class that it's in
this case it's we're using maven but it
just worked with Gradle as well we use
the rtn give darker which is a beautiful
name of cube
of course if you want to use the
persistence extension you need also to
add the artifact to have this using data
set notation which is active arquillian
persistence artifact a dream and of
course you still need to provide a
commonly on dependency to be able to
deploy your you know your war file to
the remote server now finally this is
where all the magic happens it's a file
called arquillian dot XML we have
already seen this file and basically
what you do here is saying that you are
defining an extension with poly fire
blocker notice that in this case we are
setting an optional parameter which is
machine name if you are using docker
machine you need to provide a name so
this is the attribute you use for
setting which token machine you want to
use and since we are we have a tight
integration with dr. machine it means
that you can use any driver that it's
provided by dr. machine so for example
in your case we have some tests that are
executed to digital ocean infrastructure
and it's a simple matter of pudding of
creating a docker machine pointing
toward digitalocean account and put in
here the name of the digital ocean
machine and then of course I've said
that you can you need to to provide
which docker image you want to run and
in this case you are saying that you
want to run one doctor image with name
why fly you said that the docker file
that we have seen before so it builds a
new image and finally of course you need
to set the poor binding and in this case
we are redirecting the 80 81 2 80 80 for
the you know the HTTP connections and
999 1 299 90 which is for this is the
poor for deploying your application from
outside and of course
still need to define the container in
this case it's a Wi-Fi as we said and
notice that now in the chameleon target
at the end its remote which is we are
saying that please don't stop I don't
start and stop a container but it's
already started then let's see this
example notice that now what we are
going to do is defining here have
the wirefly and going to a star wirefly
it going to start a my sequel and it's
going to run the test so in this case we
are going to start two containers and
the test is the one that we have seen
that is this one yeah yes
so now I ran us you know as a gay unit
test
notice that I here at the bottom I sorry
on the top of the right of the Eclipse
you see that the container white flag is
started and now let me check ok the
desert error executed and this state is
taking some more time and that's all
notice that now there is no container
running because you know our King has
take care of starting and stopping and
deploying everything so ok so that was a
single test that was reversed so another
single that that was a single docker
container that was running a wildfire
server and we've deploying into it but
when you're using you probably need more
than one thing so we were using the
internal h2 database but of course cube
supports some former orchestration as
well essentially meaning multiple doctor
containers that are linked together in
some form of compassion and cube will
know which containers are linked and be
able to start them in the correct order
for instance and start them in parallel
if possible so in the next example we're
going to see essentially the same setup
but instead of using the internal
database we're going to use a external
mysql database instead and so we're just
adding more container definitions
essentially downwards so with one of
them is going to be the Wildflower image
and the other one is going to be the
MySQL database interesting with this
setup you can start to kind of mix and
match so maybe you want to try this
application against mysql 5 or mysql 5 5
or 6 or other type of the type of
databases if your application as a need
to support multiple types of
Oh servers and looking at that format
that we had there it looks for those of
you who might know dr. Campos format it
looks fairly similar the reason why I
went by default not using document post
is because this was created before dr.
Campos was released essentially but in
the latest versions you might as well
define just set it say that the
definition format it's going to be
composed and then you can use your
normal dr. compose this is the style of
defining these instead in some future
version this will probably be the beaded
be the default so let's have a look at
that one so that's as we said
essentially the same test but now we're
going to use a remote server instead now
sorry two servers instead so justice is
there so there's nothing in this file
defining in the test class defining
which type of containers that we're
going to run against and as usual we
just do run as Cheney tests and looking
at the darker server which is seeded
mysql server being started and then the
wildfly server being started then of
course the wildfly server is using the
mysql database for for its data access
tests
and there we go green bars and of course
they will just do the opposite from the
start order and start shutting the
server's down again and the only thing
we really did was to add one more server
there and link those two together and
then we're done yeah now you have seen
all the examples using an application
server in this case well fly but I set
in in the start of the session that with
a killing cube you can still write tests
using for example spring boot or
barracks or no GS I mean at something
that it's not deployed inside an
application server this name it's quite
confusing because yeah you know that is
that at the end the code is going to run
inside that docker container but the
continuous thing comes because you know
the application servers are composite by
containers so since there is no
application server then it said that
container container less thing yeah it's
quite confusing let's say but yeah we're
going to go deep in the at the end of
the of the session so basically what the
continuous theme let you do is that any
application that is deployed and runs on
docker it doesn't matter if it's on in C
in JavaScript or can go or you know
where a spring boot Gerald thing it can
work and yeah you can see some examples
have dropped wizard natty note no GS
spring boot barracks or for example so
the new wild flight storm's also can run
with the container loss thing so what
you need to do is adding a new
dependency which is our clinic if
container laws this is a poor example of
an example of no GS application which is
using Express and you know it's an rest
endpoint when you go to be your
strongest that right
and this JSON file it's quite simple but
enough for showing you how it works and
then it listens a 8580 port of course
our clean is writing Java so you still
need to use one GBM language for writing
tests so although you are using
javascript on your let's see business
side your test site still needs to be on
Java so now instead of clearing that you
know a jar file 0 or a war file using
swim rap what you're creating is a
genetic archive basically it's a tar
file well you as you can see here you up
the appt GS and also the package.json
and notice that you are giving hear a
name which is the strongest beer m
microservice the tar and that's all
notice that since you are not deploying
anything inside the container you it has
no sense that you test something inside
the container you should run and as a
client so in this case i'm i'm getting
the URL not is that this URL is the URL
of the docker cost plus da plus the port
so it archaean does all these
transformations for you and then you
given the base uri you go to a beer
stronger than you assert that this is
the strongest one of course I've set if
you can see here we are creating a
generated archive which is a tar file
and this star file should be put inside
the container and to do this what you
need to do is create a docker file
template that it's like a docker file it
is exactly the same but notice that here
it is that deploy a deployable file name
this is a you know it's a placeholder
that it's replace it at runtime with the
file that you have created in with a
swim wrap so in this case when we exact
one a pube execute the darker build it
will replace the playable file name with
the location of the file the file name
you have created on your test
it inside the container on you know run
the NPM application and yeah this is how
you define a continuous application so i
have here the this demo which is what
they have seen they know the node.js
application you can see the code a thin
it it's in resources and no no sorry its
source test yes it's here so as you can
see this is a but it's a javascript
thing now hmm i have here the test and i
can run it again yep
now
and again have the scrip here notice
that an NPM application is running now
it's no deploying everything and no win
test and you know you have been able to
use or Killian just any program or
application that is running inside
darker so yeah I don't know if you have
any question of oh okay then one thing
that is going to come in the next brush
or you know the next version of killian
but it's already implemented in upstream
is the container object pattern I'm sure
that anyone here doesn't know what is
page object pattern yeah everyone okay
you can think of continued objected on
us as a page object pattern but instead
of four browsers for containers so
basically you know it completes all the
logic of the container inside a class
like operations that you can perform to
that container or the configuration of
that container for example exposit ports
the poor binding the host or the docker
host what that container is running and
so on and this approach gives you know
the capability of creating test with a
single responsibility your test is a
test and you know on the docker
management is the doctor management
isn't separated in different classes and
also it gives you the way of reusing the
docker instances in jabba because the
end container object is a is a Java
class which with all the configuration
of that container so you can take this
class move it to another project
and you know you have exactly the same a
typical example of this could be for
example on mail server I'm sure that
everyone here that deploy some that
deploys an application will need a mail
server to send emails so you will have
some kind of gateway classes for sending
emails and if you want to test these
classes obviously you need a mail server
so one way to do this is creating your
continual object which represents a mail
server which runs inside docker of
course and then you simply need to use
cue to instantiate this at this object
and cube will take care for you to star
in this mail server run the test and
then stop the mail server to do it is as
you know you need to use cube docker
that the jar the this artifact and also
the g-unit the stand alone because it
has no sense that if you want to you
know test something it's like a mail
server connection or ssh connection and
so on having nothing to deploy there so
here is an example of a ping pong it is
a docker container which basically you
send something at the it returns okay
and the first thing that you need to CN
it's very important is that the ping
pong container is inside that jar file
it means that you can have your common
library of containers and inside the jar
so every every time that your test
requires a container you can get this
job and you will have this ping-pong
container class inside so you need to
you know create one on one and 10 no
one's for all your tests or all your
applications you can have your library
of docker containers then notice that
it's a simple class that you annotated
with q the value it's the name of the
image and the / binding is you know the
prevailing thing of darker from from the
host where you running the tests and the
docker host then one of the things that
you can do is
use the cost I annotate a string with
host IP and then you get access to the
darker host IP of course other thing
that you can do is define a docker file
to create this container and in this
case you take a public static method
which returns an archive you notated
with cube docker file and you can use
the this descriptor which is a dark of
the scripture and notice that you are
doing / in a programmatic way creating a
docker file in this case is from dimage
and export as a string and then you
simple you know to add this docker file
content inside the docker file file and
there is other approaches to use for
example you can instead of using cube
docker file in a study in a public
static method you can use give docker
file in as a parameter of the of the
class I mean here's with cube and
setting the location of a docker file so
instead of defining the dockerfile
programatically you can point directly
to a realtor file and finally this
ping-pong container returns the URL
where you need to connect to do the ping
pong and this is a test notice that it's
a test which you can annotate your
attribute with kube annotation and when
our client cube starts the test and see
that one attribute is annotated with
cube it will start that container then
it will execute the show returned ok as
pong in this case and when the test is
jacketed it stops the container so yeah
this is a very simple example but
thinking about that you can create your
in this case mail container your JMS
queue container your if you are using
microservices and you have service a
that cost service be you can have your
service be container and when you want
to write a test of the service a talks
with service v you only need to you know
use this object I mean it's you know
that it's an infinite ways of working
with this
but the key point is that you can create
your library to be reused everywhere and
of course if you are using a doctor
machine you need to put the machine that
you are going to run and that's all you
don't need any other property and you
can see here this ping-pong example this
is the continued as we have seen which
contains the queue of the host IP and so
on dirt on the URL and this is that this
is the test did it it's not this is a
test value you know annotate your pimpin
container with cube and that's all now I
can run these tests usually us as a
g-unit test
now the that's pretty fast because it's
no it's a ping-pong only and all right I
can educate it again but I guess you
have seen that the container has been
created we need to go fast but you will
see here that this is a line yeah this
is the container and and then it stops
with you know six seconds in this case
was so that was what's currently in cube
now and cube is becoming our Killians
talker foundation for some Epsom salt
while the current implementation
supports the doctor machine and the
doctor compose format and the darker
server there's a lot of other
infrastructures essentially that also
starts to support the same type of type
of images and building these images so
in the last alpha there is some simple
support for communities at an open shift
three which essentially allows you to
build these images using the open safes
infrastructure or deploy demonic Cuba
natives server farm or whatever you want
to call it and but this would probably
also expand to have support for doing
the same but it but then against coro
coro s and also missiles and marathon
the next version of cube is most likely
going to be the 10 final and in that
regard we mentioned the weirdly named
container less container and we need to
change that name somehow so the the idea
here is if any of you guys have any idea
what the help we're going to call this
thing that makes sense tweet us about it
and
the line of the best for suggestions or
something we'll get access to the to the
new are Killian in action book that Alex
is writing with Jason Porter and we'll
do the release notes and so long with
thanks to all of you so the container
less container the premise of what
that's trying to be is a container that
doesn't have a container in it in the
sense of an application server container
not sure how able to explain it but I
understood by naming yeah yeah it's good
yeah because it's a strange because you
know you have docker container but
you're not using the Java container
let's say so yeah it's quite it's like
use your imagination yeah have you think
that I mean it can be anything related
with Star Trek or all the space or I
don't know you know it's true that in
inner Killian in general everything is
more or less related with something in
the in the space in some ways right I
mean I'll Killian for those of you who
don't know it it's from them of the man
in black movie it's the little alien
race that sits inside these other guys
body essentially and controls them and
that's kind of what are killing supposed
to do is in in the middle of your test
case and controls the containers and all
that so that's this is generally a
space-themed on the whole thing we have
the okay in drone which is the selenium
in integration we have our clean
graphene which is a drone that's added
padding to it to be stronger which is an
add-on to selenium we have the cube
which is kind of semi Spacey as you know
that the spaceship of Bork's it's called
cube so yeah tweet away if anyone happy
so the next steps of forest if you want
to know more about our Killian there's a
domain website are cleaned or org has a
lot of guides and lists all different
modules and I kind of
had are available so check that out then
if you want to kind of join the product
the project and see what's going on
there's discuss that are killing their
org which is of our developer forums
essentially and any questions in general
by the way at this point everything's
clear I'm a bonus yes
aren't you afraid that adding so many
layers it's it's not to be hard to know
where is the bag inside the desk
so the question is do too many
extensions is it hard to figure out what
goes wrong if something goes wrong um
hasn't been a particularly big problem
so far as far as I mean shorter there
has been bugs I'm not saying that but
that's been particularly difficult to
figure out who to blame essentially
which is tension does it wrong but yeah
I mean most of the extensions try to
kind of just help you provide some kind
of service so they're not trying to
fiddle too much with how your test
actually run so happy at least hopefully
no yeah also answer now so you can
examine case off of cube we have added a
lot of lock lines so you can enable the
lock you can use log4j or any rapid you
want to use and you will see a lot of
you putting the bag you will see a lot
of all the events of this happening to
say i'm reading this configuration field
i am studying this container the
container has been started and it
returned this and even if you put in
trace you will see also what which is
the json that we are sending to the
docker host so in some ways you can do
if you are not you're not sure if you
are doing I mean that if you are your
continuous correct or not you can take
the jasons you are sending and you know
trying in your local machine I mean
without cube and see if it works or not
I mean that it made yeah maybe you need
to start to to you know to execute some
manual steps and some investigations of
where is the problem because you need to
test these things but I mean we you have
the tools to do it now
yeah what's the best way to use her
killing would be DD framers so there is
a project called cukes in space which is
essentially they are killing integration
for cucumber that's probably the easiest
and most complete at this point there
was some effort to get jay behave up and
running in the same fashion but it's
kind of tied off a bit I believe no also
you can use a serenity be DD if you want
and there is a general rule that you put
this Union rule in a city in TBD the
test and you can you know you can use
serenity VD which at the same time means
that you can use Cacambo J behave and
with this rule you it calls all the
magic of our Killian and you can use it
for deploying your war file for
executing ability now well okay well
that's generally what we have so thank
you for coming you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
