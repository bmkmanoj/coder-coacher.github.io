is Ted nerd I've been doing a lot of
things across a lot of different
environments for many many years and
it's actually worked out fairly well for
me as you can tell I've spent some time
over in the Microsoft part of the world
I spent some time over in the java part
of the world as a matter of fact at one
point at a conference probably about 10
12 years ago buddy of mine was
introducing me at the talk said so Ted
you know you're kind of a Java guy
you're kind of a dotnet guy which one do
you love the most and I said Chris if
you have children and he said yes and I
said great how many stand two boys and I
said great which one do you loved the
most and he said ah I get it you love
them both the same and I said no
actually I don't see I too have two
children I have two boys they're not
really children anymore they're 23 and
17 and Michael my eldest is a geek there
is just no no way around it he is a geek
he is scrawny he is pale he is up until
4:00 a.m. on skype with his friends
playing Dungeons and Dragons I love when
we take a social in person game and do
it over a remote telecommuting
technology that's just awesome
my youngest on the other hand matthew is
17 and he is well he's a jock he's
actually taller than me
he's broader than me he plays football
he's in the band he's everything in many
ways that his brother is not now the
truth is I love them both but I love
them differently I love them because
they are different people I love Michael
because he and I can sit down and talk
about programming and technology and
whatnot and I love Matthew because we
can talk about playing in the band we
can talk about playing sports etc etc
it's not that I love one over the other
it's just that I love them differently
and that has been a significant hallmark
to my personal career for a number of
years for almost 25 years now so Deb ox
asked if I would give a talk on this
particular topic earlier this year and I
said chair why not and they said what do
you want to call it and I said
Polytechnical career ISM and Stefan kind
of blinked and then said okay what the
hell is that and I said oh it's very
obvious it's how to manage a career as a
Polytechnical and he said okay great and
we just left it at that
when I say Polytechnical I'm actually
referring to three different things most
of you are familiar with the term
polyglot right this is what you call
somebody who speaks multiple languages
just out of curiosity does anybody know
what you call somebody who only speaks
one language American yes thank you
absolutely way to ruin the joke there
anyway a polyglot is one who speaks
multiple languages Pali precludes oh is
making use of multiple storages aka
databases for our purposes and Pali
creppy doe is multiple platforms
foundations I'm borrowing liberally from
the Latin here when you are a
polytechnic you have a slightly
different view on the world than many of
your compatriots and colleagues for
example how many of you would raise your
hand if somebody asked how many of you
in the room are java developers parent
number of us right it's really really
common for us to put an adjective in
front of that as a Polytechnic I don't
I'm a developer that's it I'm a
developer I will use whatever tool seems
most appropriate to the job I will use
whatever storage system seems most
appropriate for the problem I will use
whatever plaque
whatever language I will use whatever is
available to the best of its ability for
a given project
I'm very communist in that respect mr.
Marx had a great quote it's been
purified slightly but I'm pretty sure
that's the original from each technology
according to its abilities to each
project according to its needs it lost a
little in translation is my
understanding
you really don't when your Polytechnic
you really don't embrace the idea that
there is one solution for everything and
yet somehow that always seems to be the
case whenever we come up with a new
thing right now the hot new thing is of
course JavaScript everybody wants to do
JavaScript everywhere it has to be
JavaScript all the way down instead of
Ted cetera that's great except where
it's not there's almost always a part in
any given platform any given language
any given technology where things don't
quite work as well as we would like and
this is where having a different
perspective can be particularly helpful
the problem is that it's kind of hard to
do because if you think about it if
you've been a Java developer for five
say years five to seven years you're you
know in many companies that's considered
a senior Java developer to then say I'm
going to turn around and I'm going to
throw all of that away and I'm going to
start learning Haskell I'm going to go
back to zero I'm going to be a zero
years experience developer that's hard
it's hard for a variety of reasons
number one because zero years developer
tends not to get paid as much as a five
to seven years developer and I don't
know about you but I like money does
anyone in here who does not like money
show of hands because those are the
folks you want working on your
open-source projects by the way no
nobody here not okay so everyone here is
a fan of money awesome that takes time
it takes energy it takes a certain
amount of strength if you will
to say I'm going to throw away that
which I know and I'm going to dive into
something completely different
Plus on top of that if where you are
currently employed is not interested in
the thing you want to learn next now
there's a tension between time spent
learning this new thing and time spent
that you could be learning something
that's directly applicable to whatever
your company is working on and in some
cases the things that you will learn
will suggest approaches to you that are
in diametric opposition to what you
currently know so it doesn't feel like
any of this stuff would ever actually be
useful there's a bunch of scenarios that
I can talk about in terms of problems
that a Polytechnical approach could
could you know help with and I've got a
bunch of examples you know here for
example if you're working on a project
where the logic that you're working on
is changing on a routine basis and by
routine I mean every couple of months if
you're working for say Amazon and you
are working on the module that will
calculate sales tax on a given bundle of
goods I don't know if any of you have
ever actually tried to calculate sales
tax for a modern ecommerce system but
it's actually not trivial and sales tax
by the way is different from v80 sales
tax is what American federal governments
and state governments and local
governments will slap on to the price of
a good just for buying it within their
borders and you don't get any rebates
off of sales tax by the way and it's
different for every city for every state
it's different in different nations if
you're actually shipping across state
borders
sometimes it applies sometimes it
doesn't if you walk into a subway and
say I'd like a sandwich whether or not
sales tax applies can depend on whether
or not you're choosing to eat it here or
take away it is not a very very simple
it would seem like it just take the
price multiply the tax and that to the
total at the end and it changes it
changes every time the government wants
it to change so every couple of years
sometimes every couple of months if it's
really really bad how many of you want
to be working on the same code module
for the rest of your life one guy down
here because he thinks that means he
could never be fired you're fired
there's actually a start-up in Seattle I
forget the name of it but they're
literally a sales tax as a service
startup that's all they do is calculate
sales tax and you pay them a certain
amount of money every month to calculate
sales tax and whatever it is you're
doing in some cases the requests that
are coming are actually user level
requests if you've ever built a user
interface for a user for some individual
and they looked at it and said I think
that button should be over there and
then that button should be down there
and then we should take this drop down
and put it over here and then make the
whole thing pink how long will that take
you and you're like six months six
months for all of that because of course
you have to go through your full
development lifecycle you have to
rewrite the tests in order to make sure
that the buttons work correctly you have
to rejigger some of the flow for the
various session state because they're
moving that list from one page to the
next and you're like six months and
they're like no way you're fired
we're going to go get somebody else who
at least pretend to do it in a week user
interfaces have this really really big
problem with them in that they involve
users and users frequently as soon as
they see something they change their
mind in terms of what it is they want so
what if we could give the ability to
modify or at least
Stand Bunnicula etcetera the user
interface back into the hands of the
users microsoft office did this
Microsoft Office with Word and Excel and
access they built in some scripting
languages that then was able to
manipulate the object model inside the
application which then gave the power
back to the hands of its users so that
if you wanted to do something that the
core application didn't support there
you go take a little VB script take a
little object automation model throw
those together shake well boom you have
an application Google Apps Script does
the same thing there is a company in
you're not going to believe this but
there is actually a town in Indiana in
the United States called Warsaw Warsaw
Indiana it is home to a company that
sells crop insurance like farmer crop
insurance so if you're a farmer and your
crops fail they will in fact because the
US government pays them a certain amount
of money to subsidize this they will pay
you for when your crops fail and they do
a tremendous amount of mathematical
analysis based on the size of your field
what you are planning to grow what you
grew there in previous years current
weather predictions etc cetera
all of that is currently written as a
set of Google Apps Script in JavaScript
living off of Google sheets now the
developers in the room are like tÃ© they
don't have any unit then they're so
screwed except it's been working pretty
well for them for the last five years
before that guess what they were using
Excel yep in some cases the problems
that we deal with a complex permutations
of possibility if you've ever tried to
schedule staff like if you worked at a
restaurant and you're trying to figure
out okay I need five servers to work the
5 p.m.
10:00 p.m. shift and okay well Angie can
be here but she can't be here beyond
9:00 because she's got another job and
Joseph well he can only be here starting
at about 4:00 and then Fred requested
Wednesday off there's all these possible
permutations to solve the problem and
you're trying to build an online
scheduling system that will capture all
of this this is not going to be easily
represented in a series of if else if
else if or one big-ass switch statement
it's not going to work at least it'll
work for the first iteration and then as
various scenarios change as it turns out
you need six servers instead of five
you're going to have to go back and you
have to refactor all of that code and
yeah we can try to break it out into
various strategy patterns and so forth
but it's still going to be a really
tangled convoluted mess because what we
are trying to do is we are trying to get
the computer to perform logic and there
are languages that are actually
deliberately designed to do logic if
you've ever
if you've ever sat down and done the
pseudo coup puzzle from your local paper
that is the kind of problem that
languages like Prolog are extremely well
designed to be able to solve which you
wouldn't know unless you are familiar
with Prolog and in some cases the logic
is best expressed by domain experts
people who've lived this particular
industry if you've ever tried to rent a
car you know you go to Hertz you go to
national you go to one of those
companies and say I would like a car
starting on Sunday and you know
returning on Friday and they say huh
well we don't actually have any cars
available what do you mean no cars well
I mean basically that particular lot
from that particular airport is sold out
I'm like really because I had this
conversation once said really you don't
have any vehicles because you know how
am I going to get from the airport to my
hotel
and the receptionist on the phone said
well okay hang on what time does your
flight come in and I said well my flight
comes in on Monday at about 5:00 p.m.
and she said okay here's what we're
going to do we're going to actually book
the reservation from side a at midnight
until you return to the airport then as
soon as the reservation is booked I'm
going to put in that this is a late
pickup which means you can pick it up
anywhere up to 12 hours after the
original reservation is supposed to
start then that'll actually be within
the six hour window before they will
release the car so therefore you'll have
a car I like wait a minute
you don't have any cars but somehow one
will magically appear because you've got
a 3d printer in the back or something
how well because of the various business
rules that was set up and oh by the way
this is actually going to be cheaper
than if you had just picked it up on
Monday can anybody make sense of this
whatsoever
now I guarantee you that there is
somebody at that rental car company who
knows all of this stuff they were there
when those business rules were first
enacted they've been there as they've
sort of lived through all of these
various business rules that have been
put into place and people have gotten
accustomed to and so forth and that
person is not you but you're the one who
has to write the code for that online
system how about we just cut out the
middleman how about we create a tool a
language perhaps that allows the subject
matter expert to be able to do their own
thing to let them express it doesn't
have to be a turing-complete language no
it really doesn't this is the whole
realm of the domain-specific language
and it was a really really popular idea
for quite a while in some cases the
requirements that we want to deal with
in terms of storage they don't fit what
we're trying to do imagine for a moment
this conference this conference had you
register and we've got your registration
information and it's
not your name your company perhaps your
address your email etc etc we've got all
this information and they want to store
that they want to be able to do queries
right they would of course never sell
your information to anybody no never
that but we also want to track the video
of what we're doing here as a speaker I
have a registration here and so do we
put the video into a relational database
because if you've never tried to do that
really large binary blobs inside of a
relational database does not work
particularly well trying to do a query
against the video column really just
doesn't end well for anybody but there
are other storage systems CouchDB
MongoDB etcetera they'll still love
binaries if you wanted to build YouTube
which is literally nothing but a big
database of videos but then there's all
those comments and there's all these
ratings and there's all these channels
you start saying crash what data storage
can I use that would ever possibly able
to handle really big ass binaries but
also be able to let me do some queries
across the data in a structured fashion
my response is none of them use both
this is where you start leveraging the
idea of collecting both together let's
let a relational database do what it
does well that is Express relationships
and let's let something like Mongo or
couch or one of these other more binary
centric data storage facilities do what
they do well even if frankly we just
fall back to the file system now we can
get all kinds of gigabytes in the cloud
so let's just dump the video into s3 and
then put the hyperlink inside the
relational database and go from there
and see how far that takes us one of my
favorite scenarios is of course and I
realize this doesn't apply to you
because you are on a team filled
entirely with all stars rock stars
ninjas right right show of hands I'm
ninja and all of my colleagues are
ninjas too yeah and the whole front row
here they all work together so they're
like you better put your hand up yeah I
hate to say it you're not a ninja
you're not because I can see all of you
so if you were ninja I would be
lecturing to a seemingly empty room
right now and I see you so you're not a
ninja
and based on some wandering around last
night near the conference center and you
know of the castle and in downtown
Market Square and so forth and none of
you sing very well either
so you're not rockstars
but it is fair to say that some of you
will have skills beyond those of your
peers and it is share to say that it's
entirely possible that you will
encounter somebody will work with you
that actually may have some skills that
you don't this has been one of the great
debates around language design as a
matter of fact was just having this
debate yesterday as I got here to the
conference the question was when we
start talking about programming
languages would you prefer to have a
language that requires you to focus on
some fairly straightforward and simple
concepts a la Java or would you prefer
to have a language lets you do some
really tricky and elegant stuff
potentially at the cost of being
completely incomprehensible to other
people within the company a La Scala
Clojure and I remember it was relating
this conversation I remember sitting
around with a number of other speakers
about ten years ago we were at dinner
and we were talking at that time about
Ruby and one of the things that some of
the other speakers were saying is all I
loved Ruby it's got all this syntactic
power lets you do some really amazing
things and I'm like look but at the same
time what are the chances that everybody
else on the team is going to be able to
understand that I said you know in some
respects when you're playing around with
the language that
you know really lets you do some crazy
things with the syntax it's like you're
juggling chainsaws you guys know
chainsaws right we use them in horror
films right you're juggling chainsaws
you can do some really amazing stuff but
if somebody's not a particularly good
juggler you know someone's going to lose
an eye and then all the fun is gone
that's what American moms by the way
will say to their children it's all fun
and games until somebody loses an eye
then you'll be sorry and it was a really
interesting discussion because several
of the other speakers looked at me and
said yes but I would much prefer a
language that lets me juggle chainsaws
because I know how to do it safely as
opposed to a language which constrains
me from being able to reduce 15 20 50
lines of code down into one or two
because you know number of lines of code
actually does have a direct relationship
on the maintenance of your code overall
it's etc here's the funny thing we all
write code on top of a platform called
the JVM and the JVM actually doesn't
care what you wrote your code in as long
as it Altima turns into a class file and
so if I've got a team with a wide
disparate variety of skills why not let
the experts write code in Scala or
closure or their favorite language of
choice and use it from a safer language
like Java or even potentially now thanks
to the fact that Java has scripting
engines that ship with the JDK
out-of-the-box Nazz horn JavaScript
there's a lot of people who will listen
to this and will say no way I'm sorry
this is a fever dream it's a pipe dream
you cannot take people from such a broad
technical background throw them together
in a room and have something that works
and that's definitely not the case
Barack Obama some of you may have heard
of him you may also be familiar with his
successor which we won't talk about when
Obama was getting ready to be elected he
specifically wanted to leverage
technology he specifically wanted to
leverage the power of the Internet and
so like most campaigns he called for
volunteers and he got a bunch of
volunteers or a lot of people who are
very excited to work as part of his
campaign but they all came from very
very diverse technical background there
were some PHP folks there was some Java
folks some dotnet folks you know and
because this was a Democrat you know
leftist there were even a couple of Perl
folks and they didn't get turned away
because you know Democrats they'll take
anybody right nobody laughed at the Perl
joke that's a little disturbing they
took them all they brought them together
they said here's what we need to do we
need to create this nationwide
potentially global if you really want to
think about it because we've got a lot
of Americans that are overseas in
various capacities we need a global
worldwide infrastructure and we need it
like yesterday because the election
cycle in the United States runs probably
about a year in length year and a half
if you could count the primaries and so
forth in 583 days
they designed implemented deployed and
dismantled 2000 nodes
processing 10,000 requests per second
with across three data centers 180
terabytes and 8.5 billion total requests
start-to-finish
closed out the whole nine yards and
there was no global architecture here
folks 580
days that's faster than what some system
architects will take to produce a bunch
of PowerPoint slides all of that is very
interesting but it's very abstract and
it doesn't really necessarily get to
what I think is the real heart the
benefit of being a polytechnic techni
sist so let's talk about something a
little bit more concrete how many of you
are familiar with Haskell a couple of
hands good enough good enough the rest
of you are like I've heard of it I know
it's a language I know that really
really pretentious people enjoy
programming in it right because the
functional guys right they will they
will have a tendency to be very very
pretentious it's all about Mon ads and
mono AIDS and the subcategory of endo
functors in whatever you have to have a
man bun if you program in Haskell by the
way just as a heads up that is a list in
Haskell everybody got that cool we move
on there are a couple of things I can do
with lists in Haskell there are a couple
of functions head will give me the first
element out of the list last will give
me the tail out of the list by the way
the curly bracket - syntax that's the
comment facility in Haskell and that's
just showing you what would be printed
when you print this out tail will give
me the remainder of the list after the
head has been trimmed off so we can see
that tail gives me two and three and TKE
says let me take let me return a list
consisting of the first end number of
elements of that list so here when I
take two I'm getting one and two out of
that list of one two and three so far so
good right awesome I can also create
lists using the range operator in
Haskell so here I'm creating a list of
one to a hundred sequentially and I can
even put some period into it so for
example if I want only the evens I can
say let me get the numbers to 4 and then
Haskell will assume that everywhere from
beyond that I want basically two even
numbers increment by 2 instead of by 1
so this will give me a
even numbers between 2 and 100 not bad
right
the other thing that Haskell can do with
these lists that we can actually
manufacture them directly out of code
this goes by the rather academic name of
a for comprehension okay so here you can
see that on the right side of that
vertical bar I'm basically using the
left hand arrow to take the elements of
the list and pump that into X what this
means is Haskell will go ahead and
iterate if you will over that right hand
side and each time a new value for the
list is called for we'll get it from the
code on the right hand side there now
here you can see in squares the second
one you can see that I'm doing the same
but then I'm actually saying x times X
I'm manipulating that result before I
actually return it and these will return
what you would expect the first one will
give me a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 the
second one will give me 1 4 9 16 it sets
etc all the way up through 100 if you've
ever been challenged in a programming
interview by the way on how to do
fizzbuzz this is the very simple
algorithm that says count from 1 to some
number and if the value is divisible by
3 print out fizz if it's divisible by 5
print out buzz if it's divisible by both
printout TSA's and buzz and here it's a
slightly modified version but this is
the exact same code but it's all done in
terms of a Haskell comprehension take
the numbers 1 through 25 pump them into
X and then either keep X or we're going
to use buzzes or buzz or fizz or etc at
the end of the day it's just code it's
looping it's calling and it's returning
now one of the things that Haskell will
let you do is do what they call an
infinite list so remember our arrange
operator from before 1 dot dot means
this literally never
terminates that list will in fact be
infinite and trying to print it by the
way it's a bad idea
ask me how I know there's even a method
in Haskell called 'cycle which will take
a list and repeat that list ad infinitum
that is to say it'll be a never-ending
list so here what I can do is I can take
3 from the list forever love and that
will take the first 3 elements of that
list love and love love love can't
possibly imagine who would want an
infinite list that's just ridiculous
I mean lists are collection and
collections by definition have a finite
balance right there's just no point to
this this is just silly this is just
functional pretentious man bun wearing
programmers being excited about some
ridiculous concept that nobody could
ever really possibly use in practice
least that was what I thought when I
first found this in Haskell and then I
went back to Java and I thought you know
Java iterators are kind of interesting
creatures for a long time they've lived
in the shadow of the collection that
spawned them if I have an ArrayList then
the iterator just walks across the
ArrayList if I have a linked list and
the iterator just walks across the
linked list what happen if I had an
iterator without a collection because
that's kind of what a for comprehension
is doing in many respects its producing
a value each time you ask for one and so
that's kind of like an iterator that
knows how to manufacture the next Val
the next value that you're interested in
there's not really a collection there
there's not really a list it's just
every time you need a value for the list
you go to the for comprehension and say
give me the next value so for example if
I really wanted to try to capture that
that concept in Java I could create an
iterator or in this particular case
I'm going to create an iterable and that
iterable knows how to manufacture an
iterator and that inner that iterator in
turn knows how to manufacture an integer
now it'll keep track of the current
count because it needs to figure out
what's the next value I'm going to give
you and you know in this particular case
I'll say that this is an even numbers
comprehension only up to the value of
100 so that I can just you know has next
we'll say when I'm at 100 stop right
because again infinite lists those are
silly and then to use this because it's
an iterable it knows how to manufacture
an iterator which means it can be used
as part of the for each in Java it's
kind of interesting this is a ton of
code though I mean it would seem a lot
easier just to do a for I equals 0 I is
less than 100 I plus equals 2 and go
from there that doesn't seem like we're
really gaining anything right but if I
start thinking about the idea of an
iterator that doesn't have to be tied to
a collection the iterator just knows how
to manufacture the next value again
that's basically what the for
comprehension is doing in Haskell it's
just manufacturing the next value or
it's obtaining it from somewhere even if
it's not manufacturing it out of thin
air so what if I were to create an
iterator of string that knew how to read
from a file in other words I'm going to
open up a bufferedreader right I'm just
going to put a bufferedreader around
whatever file I'm interested in and then
manufacture an iterator that will
continue to read until there are no more
lines left now because of the
peculiarities of how Java does iterators
we have to actually prefetch the first
line in order to know whether there's a
line there so that hasnext can return
true or false but now I have an iterator
that knows how to read a file which
means again for each now granted there's
a pesky IO exception you have to deal
with here but you know if you're like
most of us you'll just put that into an
empty cache block and ignore it or
better yet you'll write it to the system
log file and let the system
administrator deal with it because
that's what they do that's their problem
but the interesting thing about that is
you start thinking this way you start
thinking about iterators as being
somehow separate from collections that
iterators can in fact manufacture the
values that they're going to be
interested in then you start realizing
that there is a lot that haskell and the
other functional languages can teach us
as a matter of fact there were a number
of people who had already picked up on
that idea number of them work at Google
and inside of the guava library you'll
find two classes iterables and iterators
and they have a series of methods
including the aforementioned take that I
showed you from Haskell to just grab the
first couple of elements out of a
collection the important thing to note
about this particular file iterator
example is you'll notice that the memory
pressure here is nil I can do this with
a file that is 2 terabytes in size if
I'd like because contrary to the
collection approach which says I'm going
to slurp the entire file into memory and
then give you an iterator across that
this iterator says I don't need a
collection I know where to go get the
data in question so I will go fetch it
on demand as necessary and once we start
putting some of that intelligence into
these iterators we start opening up a
whole bunch of interesting ideas such as
for example I could maybe do some of the
processing that I'm interested in doing
I could actually put that processing
inside of the iterator it's
oh and then actually if I do that so
that I don't have to create a for loop
to manipulate it if I put the actual
action that I want to do the system dot
out dot print lend from my earlier
examples if I take that and put it
inside of the iterator then I don't
really see the loop and if that action
is in fact what we call side-effect free
if I'm not manipulating any state from
inside of that then actually I could
potentially take that processing and run
it over a whole series of threads in a
thread pool Java eight introduced
lambdas but more importantly it
introduced the streams package the
streams package is effectively this
concept of iterators without collections
without having to deal with some of the
pain of writing it yourself think about
those infinite streams for a second
though you say to yourself there is no
case where I would ever have a
collection that was infinite there's
nothing that's internet on planet earth
period it's not the number of people not
the grains of sand there's nothing
that's infinite what could I possibly
model as an infinite stream the problem
is you're not thinking about the problem
in the right way according to some folks
you're thinking about it to temporally
that is to say you're not taking into
account time
what have we think about external events
as streams what if we start thinking
about the idea of mouse move mouse click
button click those are event and we say
well yeah an event happens and then we
process it what if you look at that as a
stream of collection of events that is
in fact incident the user will never
stop doing things at least until the
program crashes or you shut it down
which is basically the same thing for
all intents and purposes or you're
building a web application that wants to
receive notifications from the server
hey somebody just changed the amounts of
something that you're interested in the
number of books in the shopping cart or
the the current sales tax rules or
whatever you floats your boat those push
notifications they can arrive at any
time so what if instead of trying to
model this in this giant state machine
what if we see that as a stream what if
we see that as an sequence of events and
we want to process them one at a time
effectively we want to start modeling it
using this kinds of syntax such that
every time we go back for the next line
that is to say for the next event we
block until that event is ready and then
you simply say hey on this block of code
underneath that's what we do in response
to that particular event if we put some
code around the idea of taking one thing
at a time off of the stream you actually
get really really close to the whole
reactive metaphor matter of fact that's
basically the reactive metaphor
congratulations now for the simple price
of sitting in this room for 50 minutes
not only do you know Haskell but you can
put reactive programming on your resume
please don't just just yet don't okay so
assume you're convinced assume that
you're saying all right there is value
in studying things outside of that which
I currently labor how do I do this well
as an individual what you want to be if
you're going to pursue this notion of
Polytechnical is you want to be what the
recruiters these days are calling a
t-shaped individual if you consider the
horizontal axis the number of
technologies you're familiar with and
the vertical axis your strength in them
they want you to look basically like
this you should have depth in a few
areas
but you should have breasts in a wide
number of them I'm not saying that you
all have to go out and become masters of
Haskell and begin debating Mon ads and
mono aides and endo functor reactors and
whatever that weasely arrows and all
that stuff in many cases that's not
going to be useful unless you get a day
job programming in Haskell in which case
then yes you're going to grow your depth
in that language if you're going to stay
where you're at knowing a little bit of
Haskell knowing what its strengths are
knowing how it looks at the world
knowing that there is a flavor of
Haskell that runs on top of the JVM as a
matter of fact there's - this can all be
helpful if you run into a problem that
Haskell would be really really well
designed to solve but for the most part
what you're looking for here for most of
us is breaths in areas that you're not
familiar with and depth in the areas
that you are familiar with or areas that
you're really really excited about part
of what you want to do then is when you
look around the technical world and you
see something you want to figure out
where exactly this fits in the world you
want to create a personal ontology you
want to create your own categorization
system for how you sort things inside
your head personally what I like to do
is I typically will try to create a
fairly simple non-trivial project
depending upon the technology in
question many people like doing the
to-do list as it getting started that's
fine but the to-do list is really just
an exercise and simple crud application
of things it's not really going to allow
something to shine create some problem
for yourself maybe you have a CD
collection and you'd like to be able to
sort through it maybe you have maybe
you're one of those old-school DJs you
want to do that for your record
collection
perhaps you're part of the church
perhaps you run a softball league
whatever some problem that has some
unique characteristics that you can
solve using said technology for
JavaScript for example I actually built
a convention a game convention
scheduling system so that people could
say I want to host a game on this day at
this time and other people could
and up for that there's a certain number
of limitations I can only have X number
of players players may need to be over
the age of 21 instead it's etcetera that
actually turned out to be a really
really good groundbreaking project to
figure out what was good and what was
bad about doing the whole mean Mongo
Express angular node stack it's got to
be a project that's personal to you
though because you don't want to be
asking other people for business
requirements when you're trying to
figure out whether or not this works
well with the technology you want to
pursue dissimilar angles if you know
Java don't go learn c-sharp seriously I
love the dotnet framework and if you
wanted to learn F harp which is the
kissing cousin to Scala you want to go
learn the object functional language on
top of the dotnet platform go to F sharp
awesome I'm totally behind that don't
learn c-sharp because it's basically
just another kin to Java you can go
learn Kotlin because it's just different
enough from your traditional
object-oriented language but if you
really want to grok functional go to a
language it's functional only Haskell or
there's an older predecessor called ml
that is the language that supports no
concept of objects whatsoever and yes
there is a version that runs on the JVM
so at least then you could keep your
existing tool stack if you really like
that ml version by the way it's called
Yeti pursue something that's different
if you're familiar with relational
databases and you know my sequel don't
go learn Oracle don't go learn sequel
server go pick up Mongo go get couch go
get something that's completely
different from what you know the
differences here are what's going to be
interesting not the similarities create
your own evaluation function that
project that problem that whatever in
order to be able to decide whether or
not this thing is of use to me again
it's got to be something that's personal
to you and don't be afraid to turn away
I mean I understand it everybody's
really really hot right now for Kotla
and everybody's really excited about it
Kotlin got supported by google and that
means something is important and yeah
it's awesome but you know what if it's
just not speaking to you
walk away it's okay it's your time it's
your life it's your career you have to
choose where to spend it would you
really be interested in learning some of
those concepts if they're just going to
dredge up painful and terrible memories
of having to slog through something when
I was in university I actually took a
programming class that did C++ which I
was really good at and Prolog and lists
and lists totally kicked my ass I could
not wrap my head around those
parentheses to save my life I got
straight A's on the C++ part of the
course and I got straight F on the list
part of the course the professor
actually was concerned that I was dying
or something he's like I've never seen
anybody you know that badly
Lisp remained a foreign space I mean
every time somebody joked every time
somebody said something about Lisp I
made a joke out of it you know what Lisp
stands for right lots of irritating
silly parentheses that was my go-to joke
and then probably about ten years ago
because of the crowd that I was hanging
out with speakers and whatnot people
started picking up cloture started
looking at it started showing me some of
the benefits it's like oh now I begin to
get it okay but it took me 20 years
before I could come back to it if you
are a dev manager you want to embrace
the t-shaped team the broader your team
the more powerful they will be in
addressing a wide variety of scenarios
so don't hire Java developers hired
developers as a matter of fact if your
team currently is working in Java go out
and hire a c-sharp developer who's
wanting to make the cut over they'll
talk to you about link they'll talk to
you about Visual Studio you won't have
the foggiest clue what they're talking
about but the conversation will be
valuable because you will discover that
there are things in the dotnet world
that we are only beginning to discover
in the Java world and that will make
your decisions around technology that
much stronger establish formal
you ever been in a room where your
manager says we are not leaving this
room until we all agree on what to do
next
management by consensus is a manager's
cheap out it is the manager saying I am
afraid to exercise my power to move us
past an obstacle descent is healthy
descent is important there are
psychological studies that will show
that unless somebody descends you end up
creating this culture where everybody
turns into carbon copies of each other
and you lose the ability to innovate
designate one person to be the dissenter
the official dissenter to say you will
argue with whatever we say I tend to
have that role in my family as well as
that work set some non business goals
and constraints it's not always about
just the technology you use you also
have to relate it back to the company's
goals what are we trying to do how do we
make money if you cannot answer how does
your company make money you are missing
out and you are probably going to be in
the next round of layoffs what is core
business what isn't the same thing how
do we make money what exactly do we care
about and accept that you're not always
going to be able to hire full-stack
developers pull in a DBA teach them some
programming they won't be the best
programmer to start none of us were when
we got started but they'll have very
interesting perspectives on what should
be stored in what shouldn't pull in that
javascript HTML nut who went to web
design school dresses in all black has
like two earrings in this year one in
here in that ear where's a man bun
because he'll have some perspective on
how we should design things and that
will in turn lead to some interesting
implications around system architecture
etc you do not want to hire the same
person over and over and over again
diversity both in terms of racial and
gender as well as technical background
tends to yield the best results we're
now starting to see some
these that justify that this isn't easy
I'm not going to stand here and wave
this really Pollyanna it will all be
amazing and you will all be brilliant
and everybody will be handsome and you
know good and that's not it's hard
because there will be pressures on you
to sort of conform to the rest of the
crowd but it's worth it
because if you have a broad selection of
technologies if for whatever reason the
bottom falls out of the java market you
have places where you can go as an
individual as a team if you are a poly
technical team you actually have options
in the event that your boss comes and
says oh yeah by the way we actually need
to stop doing Java we are completely
moving everything over to dotnet because
our senior vice president just had this
really really important meeting with
some folks and now we're a dotnet shop
because to you it's just technology it's
just a tool you show me a carpenter who
only uses his hammer and I will wilfully
retract everything I have said here in
the meantime don't be a hammer only
carpenter see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
