nice weari 7ck and I'm with coffee here
is an excellent communicator beep in the
future today and you want to be a
specialist in this storytelling yes I
want to ask you about especially
pertinent because you're speaking about
verbal storytelling so what the
components of a good story well thank
you for the opportunity the works has
always been awesome to me so I'm happy
to be here so to to to answer your
question there are a few elements that
go into a good story as a speaker when
you come to conference you have an
unsecured understanding of the audience
so that is study the first component you
know knowing and understanding your
audience and understanding what's gonna
provide value because if you are to
think about it you in the room in front
of a bunch of people and you're asking
them to commit to you their time and I
think it's only fair for them to expect
from you to give them something that's
going to be useful that's gonna make
their life as developers better so that
is that is the first the first thing you
need to think about your audience right
and a good person that I respect a lot
not sieved watching says that when you
are in front of a roomful of people
you're not a hero your audience is the
hero so it you know every day every
every speaker that I you know at least
the best one that I've seen on stage
always keep in mind that component they
always speak to the specific audience
they're doing runners because the
audience is going to color what you say
and how you say it right so that's
that's the that's component number one
and
number two you need to to crack the
story in a way that they can relate to
you know it's not just story for story
sit it's the story in a frame of
reference that they can they can see and
they can they can react to I don't want
to get too technical on you here but I'm
sure you've heard the term ethos pathos
love right we're not gonna get into
interacting or anything but I just
wanted to point to the emotional content
of what you're what you're conveying
because every presentation is an
exercise in persuasion right and as
someone who is trying to convince people
of something you gotta give them
something other than the facts other
than they the dry information right so
you guys you can't keep the motional
content of your story in mind and then
you have to structure it in a way that
every story in structure it's you have
the beginning middle and an end
right and you have to keep that in mind
as you know as you as you step back and
look at the entire presentation you look
at does this you're going to tell a
whole bunch of small stories during the
presentation but when you take a few
steps two steps back and look at the big
picture does all of that make sense is
it coffee is eco heat coherent do you
have cocoa cohesion in the in the way
the story means is been told in the flow
of the story right and you were specific
asking about verbals right now of course
your voice is gonna play a big role you
know it I think is that that's the one
instrument that everybody knows how to
play but knowing how to how to play your
voice also has to do with the type of
environment you're in right you might
have to tone it up or down just
depending on what kind of medium you're
using right if you're using a microphone
that you know now I'm getting technical
your microphone that gonna make you
about your voice sound boom here then
you might have want to do something
about it right what other elements in
your verbal well this this melodies is
nonverbal is also very pertinent to it
your posture yeah right the the way the
way you are the way you're speaking and
the way your body is behaving right I
didn't lie already I don't think you
know because if you give a chance to
your audition they will choose to
believe the contradictions you know
things that you're saying but that
you're not saying right the the
non-verbal part of your of you of your
communication that's that's what I
believe you know I don't know why that
is but that that is the waiting if that
the reason it's important to be aligned
like the story you're telling has to be
in alignment with what you're not saying
yeah and I'm a big delivering nonverbal
communication or no but nonverbal
storytelling I am sure you know this is
at 93 percent of everything you say does
not come out of the mouth I know I
didn't know that yes ninety-three
percent of everything that you say
everything that you're communicating
doesn't come from your mouth you know it
comes from all the other nonverbal you
know portions of your communication yeah
so everything has a meaning
everything has a unique contributing to
the story and it you know I think it's
important for everyone as a speaker to
understand that one young stage
everything you do count everything you
do contribute to the story yeah no
accident no no pressure I know I you
know I think I digress but those are
those I think those are the things that
I would recommend you keep in mind as
you're as you're approaching you know
presentation to a crowd or to fellow
developers or whoever the audience is
you have to you have to place loud
okay yeah it you have to be careful know
your audience yes and then you have to
craft narrative or have one in mind
yes no not just have one in mind good
intentions don't have legs like a good
intention has needs action yeah right
and when you have one you have a good
intention you kind of have to practice
or you kind of have to write it down you
know one of my friends usually says if
it's or if it's all in your head it's
not real it's only real when you voiced
it when you voice it and the boys in
portion is either write it down or tell
it to somebody right now if it's just in
the mind it may not come out the exact
way you're imagining you know I'm sure
you've done this before where you you're
thinking something and it sounds very
clever in your head when you when you
say to yourself and then you say it out
loud and it comes out sounding
completely different from what you
intended right that's that that's the
reason you need to write a story now you
know if you if you don't want to script
it you see need to do like a storyboard
and one of the best storyboard ways I
know to do a storyboard is to just use a
post-it yeah right use the post-it and
use each one of the post this as a as
the the frame right and then just if you
can draw stick figures like everyone I
know everybody can can do that but some
of us can't just write out the words you
know what would you want that one slide
to say if you're using slides you know
or what is the you know where is that
slide or what is that gonna fit in them
in the whole story you figure that out
because if you did that you know
homework first before you go you'll have
fun time yeah and then after that you're
carefully crafting a story and you have
to watch your nonverbal communication
you have to you cannot Delattre with
other numbers
doubled part of the story now if think
about this in terms of movies yeah right
there is no dialogue in a movie that
tells you outside or I'm unhappy or I'm
angry there is nothing in the movie
there is no deadline right actors don't
come on and say I'm angry now you you
have other ways of talents you know the
music is is part of it the facial
expression is part of it the environment
they live there working in or the end
and the scene is happening is this part
of it so movie filmmakers have mastered
the craft of telling you what you need
to know right now as a storyteller and I
see every probably speaking as a
performance so you're telling a story
you need to help your audience keep
those points you know see or feel what
you want them to feel you need to be
able to communicate that and that comes
through your your nonverbal
communication so it's not it's not a
small thing
no no it's not small so work it make it
do it makes it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
