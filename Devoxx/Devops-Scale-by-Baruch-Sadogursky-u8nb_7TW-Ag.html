walks up and I don't know what you are
doing here I don't know what I'm doing
here all the rest of the sessions are so
awesome thank you very much for coming
I'll do my best to prove that you did
the right choice and it will be hard
we're going to talk about DevOps at
scale and a lot represented is a Greek
tragedy in three acts and the kind of
the presentation way was obvious to me
because anyone knows what distinguishes
Greek tragedy
everybody dies thank you very much
so DevOps at scale is obviously a Greek
tragedy that's kind of a comes without
saying we'll start we'll go by the by
the by the rules and we'll start with
the little introduction and this is me
but of Sadhguru see I'm developer
advocate with j-rock at J bar on the
Internet if you are already here feel
free to follow me on the Internet and
we'll start with an overview of what the
hell is DevOps right we are on I don't
know how many years four years into this
movement and and it looks like we have a
pretty solid way to talk about DevOps
but maybe not so before that shown out I
prepared a special page for you with the
video tomorrow the slides are already
there all the links about this talk
ratings comments and ruffle to thank you
again for coming here you see the link
right here on the bottom let's see if
that works here we go jeopardy comes the
show notes so you can find all the
information there and going back to what
is DevOps the and diagrams this is how
we explain everything
starting in variation times and and this
is kind of the canonic explanation on
how DevOps work we have dev we have ops
we merge them together
this is DevOps and apparently QA came a
little bit late
right they didn't think about it from
the start so it didn't make it to the
name and changing the name I don't know
dev QA ops QA dev ops it doesn't play
well and by the way note how S stands
for security in dev ops as well so this
is it on the other side we can take a
little bit different approach and this
is what we are going to talk to the day
is the merge of the change in technology
process and people and this is the sweet
spot between those is of course their
offs as well and this is what will be
kind of our view on on their ups today
so we'll take a completely fictional
company called Pentagon Inc they are in
the money processing business as some
other company with geometrical shape
name that's joke that works better in
the United States I my can assume and
yeah will tell their story in three acts
AG number one called the fire brigade
also known as reactive ops we are going
to talk about why they fighting fires
and how they are how they are doing
before we start we'll set up the stage
and we will see what's going on in this
company and well as I mentioned
beginning three developers three
developers they came together and
created this awesome startup and they
come from an on-prem bracket background
none of them did any cloud work or or
being in any contact with with the cloud
yet there are smart guys so they know
what they are doing
a little bit on the hipsterish side so
they peek kind of a little bit
hipsterish
stack javascript in nodejs reactive
micro services and everything that the
cool guys are talking about and let's
talk about process for three people
there is no much process at all as
something very basic for structuring
development maybe Kanban a whiteboard
with stickers or
not more than that QA is I mentioned
there are good developer so they know
what they are doing all the right
practices test-driven development unit
integration automatic tests a good code
coverage everything is fine well oops
as I mentioned they are developers they
have no idea what Ops is they went to
couple of conferences like this one and
others and learn couple a couple of
terms that they really liked and one of
the terms they really liked is server
less which means there are no servers so
it means that we don't need to take care
of them and this is wonderful this is
what they want and the others I liked
even more no ops that's great no ops
means well we don't need to take care of
ops this is just perfect and this is
what they kind of embraced tools again
very very basic something to manage
their backlog and there are issues maybe
JIRA maybe issues on github or anything
else that basic github for their source
control bitbucket get lab in Travis CI
or any other CI server in the cloud
draw nigh or shippable code sheep there
are a whole bunch of them and again
they're going to the cloud they don't
want to do any obstacle to maintain any
servers so everything is as a service
and then the platform again something
server less and there are a lot of them
it could be lambdas functions AWS
platform as-a-service Beanstalk google
appengine Oracle cloud whatever any kind
of cloud that they don't need to worry
about servers or ops so this is kind of
the landscape and let's see what happens
so as every startup in their early
stages they basically do two things they
write code and they wait what do they
wait for they wait for the first
customer and and then let's say a maid
conference which is now is a franchise
of conferences it trust them to process
their parents to buy to buy tickets
right then toward it I'll invent some
name maybe deadlocks sounds like a good
conference and they go with those guys
and they trust them to process all their
payments for tickets and everything else
and that of course brings the next scene
which is a hardcore celebration drinking
they party like there is no tomorrow
first customer first big customer and
and everything is great Friday night
3m they kind of drink and then customer
calls nothing works what is their first
reaction what do they do yeah well they
panic first of all right this is what
kind of the first things they panic but
after a while they get themselves
together and they charge now the good
news are they are all the company the
support to all the developers everybody
three guys and they have all access to
root so they can look in and start
looking what's going on and they're like
okay let's well where do we start let's
see the logs where are the logs well
there are some were in the cloud where
are they in the cloud we don't have any
servers we don't have any ops so we have
no idea where they are they start
searching they discover the logs and
then they go like oh yeah here are the
logs I see this exception and it's in
two a.m. and the other goes yeah I see
kind of related exception and it's 4
a.m. how that's even possible
well time zones some of their servers
are on different time zones so they do
in time zone acrobatics anyone remembers
doing time zone acrobatics yeah well of
course right so that's all the fun and
and eventually they find the problem one
of them a guy we will call him Billy had
a great idea after couple of beers
or maybe a dozen and he actually went
and caught it this great idea
and now you remember their tools right
once the code is committed built
deployed to production runs in
production or in our example not very
much here to comment a couple of tests
in the middle because they didn't pass
and that's that what happened so the
vicinity right all we need to do is the
refer is revert to previous commit and
then it will run it will build it will
go to production and it all feels the
problem well the problem is it doesn't
build anymore which is kind of weird
because just couple hours ago before
they started to party they actually push
their last comedian everything was great
but now they have some kind of weird
errors about some dependencies which are
not found how can that happen someone
remembers that right em left pod a ok
let's do that who didn't hear about left
but who doesn't know about left pod oh
just ok ok enough people deserve a brief
explanation here in health ago all the
interent broke the reason why the in
turn broke is that a lot of the builds
stopped working because they were
dependent they were dependent directly
or transitively in a library package
called left pod now left pod are 11
lines of JavaScript code that actually
do what the name implies they had
strings from the left and apparently you
need a library for that in JavaScript
and the author of this famous library
went to some fight with the organizers
of MV on deposit registry which is the
main repository of JavaScript code and
eventually took his library with him and
left and another wonderful script thing
about JavaScript is that when NPM builds
not only checks for new dependencies it
also checks what about my old
dependencies I already have them in
cache but let's check once more and if
they don't not exist anymore let's fail
which is kind of weird but this is how
it works in the JavaScript world long
story short they probably didn't write
those 11 lines of code because this is
not what you do in JavaScript but they
found it's somewhere in the cache and
then they restored this dependency and
managed to build now the problem is that
this kind of behavior keeps coming back
every once in a while sometimes there
are some new bugs sometimes those are
old bugs sometimes the customer calls
that nothing works sometimes they
discover it themselves but this is a
firefighting mode in which a lot of the
startups spend a significant time in the
beginning of their journey and anyone
was a part of the startup that was in
this firefighting mode yeah a couple of
hands obviously and and and that that
makes sense and this mode is is okay I
guess until it's not sometime in
somewhat of time we need to go to the
next level which is act 2 of our tragedy
and it's called smoke alarm installers
or reactive improvement and this act
will try to install smoke alarm
detectors in the places where fires
already happened so they won't happen
again
let's see what's new what changed with
the company well first of all they
raised some money and now they are a
group of 30 people 26 development 26 new
developers one developer with
background he actually knows that
servers do exist even in server less
they are just you just don't have them
but they are somewhere and and there is
no such thing as no ops because someone
does the ops sometimes it's just not you
how many customers they're growing
eventually they have a successful
product support team so they got kind of
tired of being waking up and interrupted
during the day and we came up during the
night and weekends so they hire a bunch
of guys that do the kind of the first
line of defense and those guys that did
you try to switch it off and on again
right that's kind of support um and the
process evolved as well thirty people is
like what two three scrum teams scrum
sounds like a good process and
exploratory testing who knows what
exploratory testing means yes when you
go through existing system manually what
it sounds like it's just a fancy name
for manual QA if you ask me right yeah
just people hate the manual QA so now we
have another term to do the same no I'm
just kidding it's actually a little bit
different but for the sake of our story
it doesn't really matter it's something
that gives another layer of protection
on top of automatic tests and test
coverage some someone that actually
clicks through the system and verifies
that everything sorry that everything
works well yeah now they discover that
they do have ups because they have a guy
that actually knows it and actually told
them okay guys there are servers and you
run your code on those servers and we
need to take care of them develop run
call another kind of measurement measure
for a interrupting less so now the
support won't wake up the whole team in
the middle of the night but there will
be a dedicated developer on call which
will be interrupted if this
port cannot fix the issue themselves and
of course fix this stupid thing with
which deluxe tools evolved as well so
now they need some kind of a
knowledgebase conference wiki Google
shared Google Doc whatever whatever it
takes some kind of repository to proxy
the artifacts the dependencies and host
their own artifacts so rollback will
just be
take the last build and deploy it to
production normal login there are tons
of different tools for that stuff like
Summa logic the one that I picked but
also Splunk log entries log lis elastic
King benign stash and whatever there are
tons of them and some of them better
some of them worse but something to
process the logs and it's also kind of a
poor man's APM application monitoring we
can set up alerts in those systems and
then get alerted if something went wrong
and then who is old enough to know what
Kingdom is here you go those are my
herbs guys here
well Pingdom is is a great service it
does one thing it pings a URL and tells
you if it's up or down right not very
sophisticated but at least it solves the
problem of customer calling and telling
us no nothing works because this is kind
of embarrassing hey guys doing all of
your system is down let me check that
it's not it's not a good answer right so
this is solved they have pinged them and
let's see what's happening so just to
remind you they raised some money what
do they do first thing they celebrate
they drink of course they drink and and
you know by now Friday 5:00 a.m. and
everybody drunk customer calls well it's
not nothing works because they have
protection against it now it's something
doesn't work
let's say Visa and MasterCard
transactions are fine
American Express is failing
so you remember they have the support
team what the support guys do they panic
right you don't buy now it's relative
it's easy to learn you're developers you
have this mind right so yeah of course
they panic and and then they charge so
they know what to do they go to the
knowledge base they check there is there
anything about American Express
transactions failing there is nothing
interesting there then they wake up a
developer and call now the vote burning
coal was is obviously he and the support
guys are all still the only sober people
in the company and they're like well I
didn't touch this code you know who
wrote this code of Americans press you
guessed it Billy and and Billy is is
wasted Billy is not on this planet
anymore so they try to somehow wake him
up and you know I guess they have to
drive to his home and shake him and pour
some water on him and he's like what
yeah I remember that I think I already
saw this error and I think they fixed it
and JIRA looks kind of weird
it's closed but it's not done it's
resolved but it's not finished something
is not right and they're like you know
what III think I know the problem let me
do something and then he logs into his
computer and then he's like okay it's
done it's fixed and they check and
everything's fine so everybody go back
to sleep
and now something new happens and this
is a new process that actually install
those smoke alarm detectors that I spoke
about and this is a probe process of
root cause analysis now I haven't here
an example of a real-world root cause
analysis from a project that a friend of
mine and co-author of this talk Leonid
Kulik
managed and we can try to analyze the
root cause analysis report by looking at
it so we have some metadata here about
where it happened when it happened
how long it took and then the
the first part the long part is a
timeline of events and the time of
events describes what happened who did
what and we had to kind of censor out
the names of not so innocent and it goes
step by step and in our example it would
probably be something like the customer
tried to execute American Express
transaction and it failed and and the
beginning of investigation what we did
step by step and the interesting part
here is how this information is gathered
so I would say there are two options
option number one there is this legal
secretary with this tiny typewriter that
sits in the middle of the column
taps everything that happens and it's
usually not the case the other option is
using some kind of log from your
corporate jet if in which you probably
have a dedicated room for this incident
in particular or for incidents in
general so it's very important to
actually type in what you are doing and
not being like Billy yeah I'll fix it I
fixed it right now because I fixed it
right now won't give any valuable
information for the root cause analysis
report the second part is the symptoms
and this is important because this goes
directly to the knowledge base right and
the symptoms if the American heiress
transactions fail with those errors in
the exact same way that means that
probably it is this problem and we can
go back and look what happened and fix
it in the same way technical explanation
of what happened in our case it will
probably be that we set up the cue of
American Express transaction incorrectly
and we didn't measure the size of the
the expected size of a the volume of the
transactions correctly and the customer
had a promotion
who
ever pays with American Express gets 50%
off and of course the the number of
American Express transactions a peaked
and the queue was over flown that's kind
of technical explanation what happened
root cause analysis one line or one
sentence or one paragraph of what
actually happened in our case it will be
well the American press transactions
queue overflown and then next steps now
this is most most important because this
is the smoke alarm detector right this
is where we guarantee that this problem
won't happen anymore
others will but this one one returned
because we guarantee here that we fix
the code added monitoring and it's some
kind of a log alert did something to
make sure that it's not happening again
it's usually possible sometimes it's not
but usually it is possible to guarantee
and in our example it will be okay we
need to increase the queue by how much
don't they ask Billy and Billy bills
like 42 why 42 EV 42 is good
trust me 42 want overflow 42 is perfect
okay so they said the queue to 42
because they actually don't have any
better way to assess it we're going to
talk about it later now this process of
root cause analysis not only a technical
investigation but also super Fletcher's
kind of retrospective on what happened
and this respect is not only important
inside the organization but also very
very important for your customers em and
what the industry teaches us is that the
customers are extremely forgiving for
errors that happen once if we come to
the customers with such an analysis and
say look this is what happened and this
is how we guarantee it won't happen
again a lot of sins can be forgiven
sometimes things that you will never
think that will ever be forgotten
let me give you an example what do you
think the worst that can happen to a
cloud company yes
data loss and the canonical example that
we have since last six months is the get
up database incident this is an amazing
story of a service provider cloud
company loses six hours of customer
database of customer data and it sounds
very innocent someone deleted the
production database now that's okay that
happens all of us deleted production
database in some point of time yeah yeah
I am
I hear this guilty laugh and and and the
problem is not that the problem is what
we do next what do we do next well we
will come back up right this is easy so
let's see how that went and that was a
daylight in the United States so we kind
of watched it in life and that was
fascinating so the guy who deleted the
database is called team member one
that's his nickname for for the RCA this
is how they kind of censored the names
of not so in a sense and he is going to
restore a backup and he doesn't know
where the backup is so he asked him
number two and then eventually they find
it but it's empty he's big enough right
and then they check for SQL dumps and it
turns out that SQL dumps were performed
with the wrong version of the dump tool
which actually means that no SQL dumps
were made at all
no despair how about disk snapshots this
snapshots exist but not for the
databases and how about replication
replication procedure is super fragile
prone to error relies on handful of
random shell scripts and is badly
documented which is a very fascinating
way to say we don't
have any replication how about backup to
s3
well the bucket is empty out of five
techniques of replication and backup
deployed known are working reliably or
setup in the first place we are ending
up restoring a six hour old
backup now we are watching that and we
go like it was funny it was said it was
it was emotional it was everything but I
personally saw that that's all that's
the end of gitlab and no as I mentioned
customers and users are extremely
forgiving if you are honest with them
and explain them how we are going to fix
the problem just we team number one I
think that's my favorite this is just
hilarious they send the money and
cookies and what's not tons of love and
interesting story about team number one
he was up to a promotion just before the
incident and he was actually promoted
which is the right thing to do because
this guy have battle experience you want
this engineer he's very funny guy this
is his description on Twitter database
removal specialist so yeah so smoke
alarm detectors we know now how to
install and life is getting better right
we have more and more repeating s events
when we don't fight fires anymore but
then the perfect storms arrives at 3:00
is where everybody dies and it comes
with a certain size in our case more
money more developers and a hundred
people on a development team which is a
big development team by any scale five
guys with the obspec round hole
performance engineer alexei tupelov just
picked up the door and left
causing you I'm going to speak about him
chief architect like staff that the big
guys actually do customer success team
now you remember this poor development
call that had to actually try and wake
up Billy because he didn't know about
American Express so this is solved by
subject matter experts from every
subject of the system participating on
on call together as a team during the
day they help prevent the rest of the
team to be interrupted during the night
they help to prevent the rest of the
team to being woke up and there are
different techniques of assembling those
customer success teams sometimes you
want your people into it and that's very
very important because pain is
instructional if people need to fix the
problems they created they don't
probably create less problem no problems
sometimes there are guys who just love
this kind of job they kind of play a
detective in a murder case in which
there are also the murderer and and
people like it some people like it so
anyway
you need to get the pain of the support
to the developers and the customer
success team rotating customer success
name is a very good way to do them and
they're big enough so they have legal
someone needs to come they have to round
a lot of investors someone need to count
investors money so they have CFO now
thousand customers big successful
company and of course process evolves as
well eight scrum teams working on the
same product it's hard there are some
efforts to build a structure about that
and one of them is safe scalable agile
framework probably when you are in this
scale it's a right way to go for me we
are relatively small company we are not
in this a level yet so for me when I go
to the safe side my
I start bleeding of the amount of
process that they have there but I think
probably in some part of time this is
what it takes
system testing now remember the system
now is huge and it needs to work on some
performant manner so there are steps
that need to be taken that cannot be
taken by the regular developers right
you need to set up a labs in the cloud
or on Prem you need to write software
that will be tested by your software so
there is an expertise that special
people need to participate in
implementing okay now this is where you
leave the room in anger and say what the
hell this guy is talking about DevOps
and then he has actually ops team on the
slide and well there are two ways of
doing DevOps today at least maybe it
will change but today we see two ways of
doing DevOps one of them is what we call
the Netflix way the Netherlands way is
the pure DevOps the beautiful divine way
of doing DevOps everybody have access to
prod everybody do both development and
operations everybody are aware and care
about the tools that are used through
continuous delivering deployment
pipeline and there is one problem with
that it only happens in Netflix it only
happens in Netflix for three main
reasons first they hire only people who
are the best and actually can do it
second they pay way above the market to
be able to afford those people and third
those guys are streaming movies I mean
if that is down is upsetting but it's
not the bank or or anything critical
right I know these are
never listen to you and you won't be
able to chew yeah it is critical for
some people but you're not having the
rest of us we don't have none of those
three luxuries we don't have access to
those people we don't have such money
and sometimes we do critical systems
like payment processing so the other way
of doing DevOps and this is what we see
today is having this special team which
does two main things first
those guys lay the foundation for DevOps
automation those are the guys who set up
docker it's a DevOps TOC
I cannot not mention darker darker
darker darker now I'm good ok so they
said up this I don't need to say that
anymore
I'm chef puppet and Sybil all these zoo
of tools spinnaker and and then what's
not they take care of all that they know
this stuff they love this stuff probably
other developers not so much they would
love to hear how it works but do they
want to implement docker I did it again
no they don't but for good reason
obviously and this is what they do the
other one is advocating for DevOps those
are the people who go to developers and
say guys this is how we do things this
is your pipeline this is how you push
the bottom when you commit the code it
ends up in production it's your
responsibility that it ends up in
production not ours we are here to help
you give you the tools teach you but
it's yours so this is the ops team that
we've seen the majority of the best
firms that do devops they have something
like that it's collation path you
remember we had this escalation from
support to the developer and call to the
customer success team but also managers
who takes care of orchestration of what
the resources needed and sometimes all
the way to the CEO and why would you
want CEO on on the escalation path two
reasons first sometimes it is the end of
this collation path the problems are so
big that see
have to step in play golf with some
people and this will be his contribution
for solving the bug the other reason is
you know escalation path is a piece of
paper or a document in which you have
names times were took when to call them
starting the beginning of the incident
and mobile phone numbers now let's say
CEO is on this list and whoever is
taking care of this problem have to call
CEO in six hours after the incident
began and this is a mobile number and
now it's 4 a.m. now miracle things
happen all the bugs are suddenly solved
in just under six hours so - or any
other regulation government regulation
is also very important this problem and
Seok - is here not just to say oh it's
Beninese but to see how modern DevOps
deals with those kind of things so I
don't know if you are we're probably
shocked - is kind of a North American
thing that there are controls in sauk -
that looks like a complete violation of
DevOps one of the controls for example
is ensuring that people who write the
code and people who deploy the code to
production are different people and then
you go like okay I cannot do that ops
goodbye it's written that we cannot do
that together it's just here and the
interesting part is that there are ways
around it and for for this particular
example the ops team that I mentioned
earlier they are the ones who are in
charge in deploying to production they
build the pipeline they control the
pipeline they ensure the quality of the
security the permission and everything
and then everybody can deploy the
production on this pipeline that the ops
team is managing and then it's fine so
here is another reason why this team
is important and can exist even if all
the team does DevOps as close as
possible to this ideal world of
everybody to everything non-functional
backlog another important aspect on this
kind of scale performance monitoring and
other aspects are now part of this
process tools of always well so for
example something like configuration
management and proper APM is about time
to introduce and another change that
happened in this last act is that billy
got promoted and he is now the head of
engineering and by the quality of the
greeting card you can see that he's not
really beloved in his company now you
know know why ok so let's see what
happens here in our perfect storm so of
course there is money so you know by now
they drink interestingly enough nothing
happens during the weekend it's all good
everybody everything works we have the
support the customer success team they
might have some work to do but generally
everything works good until Monday now
on Monday
you remember legal so she went to her
old conference it turns out that they
have their own conferences when they
speak about fascinating things like LGPL
2.2 and these kind of stuff so she comes
back very very excited she goes to Billy
and say Billy and I heard that we are
not allowed to use LGPL 2 point 1 point
2 anymore do we have any dependencies
with these license and Billy goes like
has no idea now couple of good things
first of all Billy has now developers
that can do the work for him and also
all the dependencies are centralized in
one place their repository so he sends
his developers to go
through all the dependencies in the
repository and analyzed the licenses
maybe they're Informix ml maybe there
are in package.json new spec license
files heroes of sources or my favorite
nowhere eventually they come with some
lists and it might be that they do have
this LGPL of the unapproved version and
what do they do now they need to
remediate which is a nice word to say
you are not allowed to use this
dependency anymore good luck find an
alternative implementing Kevin finger I
am around it and the release is still
tomorrow well okay this happens and then
another call from for Billy and this
time it's from their CFO and she asks
Billy Billy what will be our operational
costs for next year for our production
servers in Amazon Billy goes like but
then he actually remembers 4242 will be
the right number why first of all
because here's no idea second no one
will cut operation servers if everything
is good and he is over budget right
Tory's pretty safe this guy who knows
this guy will it blend
ok good will it blend is a fascinating
YouTube channel that all of you should
start watching in which those guys blend
things stuff like iPads brooms cameras
bricks and a lot of fun stuff just I
guess to prove that their blenders are
good in our example it will be will
scale the head of the sales comes to
Billy and asks will it say will it scare
will eat scale we have a very
high-profile customer in very high load
we expect very high load and we need to
know will it scale and
Billy actually goes to their source of
the scaleability who are the developers
and he's like guys so what do you say
will it scale and they like absolutely
sure of course we wrote it it's a great
code everything is fine
it will scale and how do they know they
have no idea but well I promised you
everybody died this is where everybody
dies it didn't scale no I come to you
from California and as you probably know
there is no such thing as bad ending in
any Hollywood movie so we will attach a
happy epilogue to our grid tragedy and
Smokey the Bear is the symbol of
proactive firefighting in the United
States and this is why he was selected
to represent a proactive improvement the
last stage of that team can be in in
order to not only firefight or prevent
existing fires but actually or we
actively improve and prevent even future
fires to happen it's all about
processing tools the people are xx and
stuff like performance and scalability
testing now and there are tools to do
that actually can ensure the quality and
the scalability of tools a license and
security management can help you fight
staff like do we have this license or do
we have now stretch to dependency
somewhere four layers deep in our docker
container hidden and waiting to be
exploited by some hackers proactive
performance and trans review they have
NPM for a while now but only this stage
they actually start to do this weekly
review of trends to actually see if
there is a degradation somewhere that
they can prevent before bad things
happen non-functional definition of done
is
interesting one because it actually
means that aspects of ops of performance
of scalability are now coded in what
they are doing and how those aspects can
be coded how can we guarantee that our
new service in our micro services world
will have a monitoring endpoint proper
log configuration etc etc how can we
guarantee that you know the answer we
are on DevOps talk talk here talk here
now jokes aside it's actually one of the
things that are very easily and very
well done in Dhaka you can actually put
all those infrastructures in your base
images and then where you inherit from
those base images you already have kind
of a box with all the infrastructure
ready for you all the logs are already
pre-configured all the monitoring the
endpoints are already set up it's very
easy for you to write code and it's very
easy for the organizational
infrastructure to plug into your new
code so this is one of the ways you can
code this non-functional definition of
done into your infrastructure there are
tools as I mentioned to tackle a lot but
it's mostly the process and the culture
but tools are important as well so more
new parts staff like Jeff rogue x-ray
can help you monitor your licenses and
security vulnerabilities and proactively
react before it goes to production and
bumps their blades meter or tons of
other cloud performance testing tools
that can generate tremendous load on
your system without you require to set
up all this infrastructure service
virtualization of which you can think as
mocks for huge thermal objects like
American Express transaction systems if
they do not expose their own
testing facilities so there are tools
that help but the most the biggest
problem is using those tools correctly
and embracing them which is of course
about process and people now will see
just couple of examples of how we can
path all those problems with those tools
so you remember this is Billy guessing
what will be the operational expenses in
the next year and I will show you a
quick example of very sophisticated and
expensive tool not a lot of you can get
access Microsoft Excel my point is it
doesn't really matter what you use it
matters that you take a look at the
numbers that are already in your hand
this is an engineering gear for a
location for a sprint of a company and
the interesting part here of course is
that the head of engineering might think
that they work on a big feature a but
they actually spend only 6% of them most
of the effort goes into something that
is called keeping the lights on which is
fixing bugs making maintenance and
making all different of a technological
depth fighting etc etc now all you need
to do is start writing it down in any
tool and then magical things happen
suddenly you have better visibility in
what's going on last example that I want
to give you is about the quality of the
tool right so you are the developers and
the quality is awesome but actually what
is their one and only important metric
of quality of your product customer
satisfaction and how do you measure
customer satisfaction feedbacks in terms
of how the customers say they are
unhappy money sales but for the existing
product tickets issues defects right if
something doesn't work probably the tool
is not good enough and here
an example again that's from Leo needs
old team bugs in a quarter organized by
severity 65 percent civility one silver
82 is it a good product
not so much he can go and shout on his
developers about the quality of their
product but now let's take the same data
and organize it differently grooving
them by resolution suddenly more than
half of those civility 1 and severity 2
are resolved by information provided
from the R&amp;amp;D team to a support the
problem is not with the quality of the
of the tool the problem is with the
training of the support team right and
and all indeed is we looked at a little
bit more information now have one minute
for an Appy myth who knows what every
myth means no one does my wife now she
is a major in theater that's why she
knows mmm it's the moral of the story
and the morale the cup of points
personal scale is a scale and scale is a
scale means you cannot jump from one
stage to another you cannot start to
start up and say you know what I will be
proactive improvement let's implement
safe that's a suicide because that will
be too much process teams evolved from
one state to another naturally and
although you know their happy ending you
cannot fast forward to it until you go
through all of them and tools process
and people all of them have to change in
order to achieve it and I will leave you
with three I would say main things about
what we learned today you build if
you're on it is kind of the basic of
DevOps this is what DevOps is data is a
key and you saw couple of examples for
that it's extremely important especially
when you progress through the scale and
of course my favorite
Payne is instructional when you bring
the pain to the people that are
responsible for this pain this pain
trend to disappear other people say it
nicely what does this say if you fail do
it more
well plane is instructional feels much
better to me with that thank you very
much i'm enje bow from Twitter this is
the only the girl Nick who caught or
this talk with me where Derrick's 2017
Jeff Roe becomes the shownotes is the
place to find the slides the video the
raffle and everything else and you are
more than invited to visit our next talk
about a completely different subject
battle between Google home and Amazon
Alexa in their Java extensions in half
an hour in room temp that was a very
shameless plug thank you very much oh
don't forget to vote because there are
some people on top that we need to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
