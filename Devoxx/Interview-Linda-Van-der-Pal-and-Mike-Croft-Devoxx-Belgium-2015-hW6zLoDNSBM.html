direct life and i'm joined by linda van
de pal and Mike crush hey and we are
going to be having a discussion about
some of the exciting things that have
and will be happening today first or
Mike and simply don't know Mike can you
tell us about your elf yep so I'm nicely
branded for pyara pyara is a supported
version of glassfish built from glass
fish for and we offer support services
and release every three months or so so
presumably you've been having a look at
the Java EE sessions yes back yes
absolutely yeah so there's a few
interesting ones about on the on the
first day actually there was a very
interesting University talk about using
je cache which is hopefully going to
make it into java ee 8 and something
that we actually already support with
pyara thanks to including hazel cast in
there as I urge a cache provider so very
interesting is there anything that's
kind of made you think anything it's
busy want to go away and do a bit more
research yeah very interested in talk i
should just today on not not related to
java ee but the talk by the twitter
employee on on the twitter jdk i was
completely unaware the Twitter actually
write their own build of openjdk kind of
you know not too dissimilar from us
making our own build of glassfish but
they do some very interesting things
around garbage collection and they're
quite innovative the things that might
be worth checking out if you kind of
absolutely not a lot of people would
know that actually could be obviously
difference is known for opens first but
not really intrinsically linked that
much with openjdk i would face yeah so
they do obviously contribute some of
their fixes to do openjdk gwan
traditionally of scala fur yes yeah so
they were once carlin on the JVM and
that was I think part of the reason was
because that I the guy said that he was
moving from Ruby to to the JVM and scar
lowers their language of choice so yeah
and lynnze I grabbed you because my
successor owned by amazing devoxx
t-shirt join me in getting ok what is
getting icing sketch noting is enriching
your regular notes with pictures so
here's some images from yesterday the
keynotes quickie about Edgehill family
the Java Council with lightsabers and
everything and the with you what is the
point of a sketch now can you walk us to
kind of your thinking bath ok so first
of all that this was the entire session
and I've summarized it and used some
images to highlight the important points
so for example they said that Jason was
Jason p1 dot one was backwards
compatible with Jason p1 dot oh so it's
pointing backwards so they had a Jason
pointer there was an RFC they're going
to include so based dinero pointing
towards a part in your JSON file there
is Jason patch which allows you to
update and there was a Jason merge patch
so I've merged two different materials
there there's Jason query which allows
you to ask questions from your Jason
file as in what's in there filter it
that's what there's something to handle
big data well what's bigger than an
elephant I could have drawn a whale but
I wasn't thinking of that and there is
was also Jason be integration which does
marshaling an done marshaling so it's a
marshall star cuz if you join it where
you might have just gone ducker thing
yes and what's the benefit of doing this
is opposed to kind of just writing it
down or maybe in your macbook um adding
with people do adding the visuals allows
you to remember the visual connections
you actually make in your brain while
you're thinking about what while you're
listening and for me this looking back
at the pictures actually calls back the
entire presentations I've got some
sketch nodes where I'm like yeah I
didn't draw the speaker but I could
still remember exactly what he looked
like because I could actually
I suppose it's using totally different
areas of yes which is a bit like the
opening keynote yesterday quantum
physics not develop it really made
everyone think and that's kind of the
benefit things like their box isn't it
like these forcing yourself to think of
new directions and try anything oh
that's very cool and maybe some people
will have a go at one now watching the
rest yes there cuz I can't just say try
it you'll be surprised at the results
and you don't kindergarten level drawing
is really enough for this break your
inner child yes your inner child with
advanced technical knowledge of OpenJDK
yeah great well thank you very much and
everyone enjoy the live stream thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
