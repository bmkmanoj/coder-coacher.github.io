principle for web pages that focuses on
core content first so it's like function
first and flair second is CSS the
awkward factor in this when you're
thinking first of all function and then
you're factoring in style yeah it's
quite difficult because even when people
think about progressive enhancement they
tend to just only focus on JavaScript
for example but CSS is quite difficult
to work with that's like it's quite
famously
and things can get really complicated
when you're starting to deal with oh
just a browser support this does a
browser support that so yeah CSS is
quite awkward in dealing with
progressive enhancement but I guess
that's what I'll be covering in my talk
how should I ever commit yeah I mean so
can you build a good web page using
Cressman huntsman technique but still
provide good visuals is it possible even
though the focus is on functionality can
you marry them yeah definitely that's
what people sometimes think that maybe
if you're trying to create the site that
will work in browsers that aren't the
latest that you're gonna have to
sacrifice some design and to some extent
that could be true like you can't do the
latest angry so stuff like all the time
when you're trying to make things
functional so it's about finding a
balance and you can definitely make
really great designs using progressive
enhancement techniques but like I said
it's about just figuring out what works
for your particular user base so if your
user base is all like tech people then
maybe you can creates like the most
cutting-edge design but if you're going
for something more broad then you're
gonna have to like consider what's more
important whether it's having like the
craziest design or having something
that's more functional but still
beautiful what's the biggest challenge
with progressive enhancement the biggest
challenge is probably with CSS in
particular it's all the testing in
different browsers and trying to and
knowing exactly which browsers you need
to support and what each of them will
actually support so you have to be on
can I use a comb like all the time
searching
as you're writing like each line being
like is this actually supported and also
like I said figuring out which browsers
you want to support cuz add them at some
point you're gonna have to draw a line
and say okay this is where my user base
is so just kind of defining all of that
and then working with it while you're
developing it can get quite complicated
so that's probably the hardest part yeah
I'm I know she says well when I was just
doing some research you have a really
cool blog so don't know if you want to
mention that for the video because I
mean you know there's some really cool
articles like ok I'm offline and I love
the one at the beginning where you say
you know what do you think of this image
and it's a broken image and you've kept
yeah yeah yeah so everyone goes this is
my blog plugging my own self so it's
called bits of code and I started it
about two years ago almost two years now
actually I know I was just trying to
write weekly articles also like as a
challenge to myself to learn more but
also to get better at explaining things
to other people so I just do anything to
do with like HTML CSS JavaScript and
yeah the article you're talking about
was about broken images so how to kind
of deal with them because obviously when
an image breaks it kind of just it's not
a really pleasant experience so one of
the things I was writing about was how
to kind of just change that from a
really horrible user like design or user
experience to something that is more
informative and helpful to the user
thank you very much you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
