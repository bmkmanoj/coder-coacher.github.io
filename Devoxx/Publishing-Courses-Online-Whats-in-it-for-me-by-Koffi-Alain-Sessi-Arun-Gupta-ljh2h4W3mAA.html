hello everybody thank you for coming my
name is Coty ceci I work for both sides
I'm in content acquisition and this is
hi my name is Arun Gupta I work for
Amazon awesome so we're here today to
talk to you about online course
publishing and we're going to look at
what is important I will cover the front
end wise important what are your options
in terms of publications and Aaron will
share his experience as a published
author so let's start at the beginning
why would you want to consider doing
courses online why would you want to
publish courses online now I'll give you
three reasons reason number one is for
your personal brand what do I mean by
personal brand your personal brand is
what people say about you as steps Bezos
put it what people say about you when
you're not in the room what does your
name stand for I'll give you an example
when I say Antonio you may know who I'm
talking about when I say Richard you may
know who I'm talking about when I say
Stephan you may know what I'm talking
about that is the power of top of your
brand and raising your personal brand is
all about making sure your next job find
you instead of the other way around
now reason number two would be to invest
in yourself a wise man once told me to
teach something you have to master it
final point and what that means is for
example if you're going to do a
conference talk you're going to invest a
lot of time into mastering that subject
you're looking upward of 40 hours am i
right yeah that is just for a 50 minutes
talk so every time you put yourself out
there to teach somebody how to do
something you're also learning in the
process and the third but not life would
be to grow the community I'm certain
everybody here I'm just
and why is important to grow the Java
community
just think about COBOL if you have any
doubt that's you know that's as far as
I'm gonna go on that now I know what
you're thinking what about the money
well in my book and I room can expand on
that a little later in my book
money is never and will never be the
reason you do something I'm certain you
know what happen the morning thing
intercept hmm how much money am I going
to make today if you are developer
you're thinking how am I going to fix
that problem with that or the library
today how my get the two to talk
together
that's how develop at least that
developers I know if you find yourself
thinking how much money am I going to
make today maybe you're in the wrong job
think about Usain Bolt how many of you
know Usain Bolt right so you send both
know is three-time Olympic medalist know
is a phenomenal runner and I am a runner
so I really have high regard for him the
guy runs to win the race he doesn't run
to win the race and make money out of it
he gets ready he gets up he trains and
he runs he wins he runs to wins the he
run to win the race money comes as part
of it so my point now I think that what
coffee is saying is if you are looking
at it look at the big picture see I am
looking to it to build a personal brand
and I'll give you a classic example I
started at Amazon about what five weeks
ago my boss reached out to me around I'm
building a brand new team for doing open
source at Amazon do you want to write
the job rack that you want to work for I
thought oh that's pretty cool
and because we wanna focus on containers
I've been a publish courses with total
site on containers I've been writing
about containers for a while so wait for
you don't go hunting for a job let the
job hunt you yes and that is you know
once again that is the power of your
personal brand so what are your options
in terms of publication there are a few
ways you can go you can do you can do it
yourself
you can publish self-publish now
self-publishing gives you 100% control
you control everything that is that is
great but that comes with some some
remote work that you have to do for
example if you are a if you are
self-publishing now you have to track
your your your ribbon you have to track
your accounting you have to track how
much you're spending how much money
you're making you also have to make sure
you put your content in front of people
you have to market it you have to
promote it and then to top it out when
once people buy your your content and if
they have a problem with it you have to
stand ready to help them now all of that
work doesn't use the very good return
the returns on self-publishing are very
small now there are a few people I know
that are succeeding at it you have
someone like Adam Bing I don't know if
you know him or you have someone like
last bozo who are self-publishing I
don't know how well they're doing but I
guess if you have a name as big as their
it doesn't make sense to go that route
but now if if self-publishing is not for
you and you've done the you look at the
numbers and you look at the amount of
what you have to put in and you realize
that that's not for you then you the
other option is to go with linking style
publishing what that means is for
LinkedIn they slide you into a studio
and you record everything and then you
go home and they do they do the work for
you so in that in this situation the
work you have to do is relatively small
but then the return is also not I mean
it's not half bad is way better than if
you self publish but still I mean it's
good but it's not super good it depends
on what you're looking for and then the
focus is not on the money but you have
to kind of account for the time you're
investing right there is a caveat the
Cardiac is
you have to be an example is brand I did
a few you know I did a few research for
this talk
I looked at O'Reilly Safari library I
pulled a few numbers a few number
numbers number of their publishing pub
published authors the top eighty percent
on that list have at least one book
published and then the remaining 20
percent are superstars in the superstars
in the Java community so you have to be
an establishment for O'Reilly to
approach you say okay you want to write
a book for us so I'll give a personal
example five five six years ago I
reached out to O'Reilly that I wanna
write a Java EE 6 Pocket Guide I sent a
mail I got connected to the editor yep
go ahead write the book that's it so ok
I'll write the book
oh then after I published the book I
asked them that you know a lot of people
were asking me how was the process does
it mean the process was very straight
forward I sent a mail they said go ahead
write the book the key part was leading
up to that point for almost six years
seven years I was writing blog about
Java EE 6 so you would search the term
google the term Java EE 6 and my blog
would pretty much show up right at the
top itself so the brand establishment
has already been done so by the time you
reach to O'Reilly then know you and they
don't have any content on that topic but
otherwise if you submit a proposal to
O'Reilly you have to go through the
vetting process that why are you the guy
to write the book so it is a bit of a
work by the time you get to the stage of
publishing a book awesome awesome
so what are you what is your other
option it's Riley it's not gonna work
for your lynda.com it's not gonna work
for you
your other option is the pro side taia
publishing what that means is you do a
little little more work you have 100%
creative control which means you don't
have to fly anywhere you don't have to
go anywhere you can work in your own
space at your own pace
so what exactly are we looking for yes
you have waiting for truth and the
returns are much better from everyone I
spoke to who has done courses for
precise unanimously they told me the
return
on the pro side courses have been better
but they come with a lot more work I'm
just being transparent and honest here I
do work for aside for for disclaimers
just as you know but what are we looking
for we're not looking for someone who is
already established who's already known
in the community we're looking for
someone who has these two things you had
to have the experience and you have to
have a passion for sharing what you know
with others and that goes back to what
we were talking about the little earlier
it's not about the money in a room
doesn't do courses for the money he does
it because he wants to share what he's
learned he wants you know I think if you
look at it he is for not remaking the
wheel because he spent a lot of hours
learning this one thing fixing this one
problem he wants to make sure fellows
that his fellow developers don't have to
go through the same thing because he's
already hurry stop the problem he knows
how to serve that cargo anything you
wanna yeah I mean I think the only time
I got excited about the money aspect of
the book was when I got my very first
royalty check
oh that's pretty cool I think book
actually gets the money as well and that
was like 170 dollar check at something
like that I don't even remember now but
since then it's the auto payment it just
comes to the account
I have no account of how much money
comes in so honestly don't don't if you
want to write a book for money is far
too much effort that you're going to put
to all of the book the fashion is not
going to come in now because then you're
going to be too much focus on okay hey
I'm going to make money out of this and
I'm gonna retire on this book not going
to happen on a technical book unless you
are like you know somebody like Josh
Long who writes the book which is like
crazy popular or somebody like need for
to write the book which makes crazy
money but the point being the reason I
write book honestly is purely about
sharing you know that sharing is into my
blood you know everything I do I share
it as a blog I share it as a conference
topic I share it as a tweet and certain
times you get this experiences where I
know people like coffee kind of gets in
another twist your arm that no you have
to share
we can get you that outreach that turns
out very well I think that is you can
eat really just keep that one thing in
your mind that I want to share this is
the topic that is hot and I'm going to
share it with others
yes think of yourself as a Usain Bolt
yes I want to share money comes with it
sure if it doesn't come with it doesn't
matter all right
and I think that's that's all we have
for you today we don't have time for one
of the key things that I would like to
say here is also I was running short of
time now I mean I I really my calendar
runs very tight for next few months out
in terms of travel in terms of work
commitments family home all those things
everybody runs like right so one of the
things that really helped me out is
where coffee said in over Tyrone he was
literally after me for a year and a half
and it just wasn't working out that I
could do the course by myself so then
the way it worked out is no we just
decided on one day okay Aaron we're
going to make you fly to Chicago you
come over there we'll do a play-by-play
and essentially what happens over there
is in a play-by-play we had Michael
Hoffman you know a fellow developer you
know he was in Chicago he came by to the
studio and I was in the studio and all
it it was he asked me a bunch of
questions hey why docker matters know
and sometimes you can feed the questions
to Michael that these are the questions
that community cares about based upon
your experience and breadth of knowledge
or exposure then you feed the questions
he ask the questions you answer the
questions and that was a two-hour
play-by-play course on docker for Java
developers so depending upon really your
time availability experience entrust to
it and give it a shot now and I think
the course has done well and then you
start small and then you can build upon
that hey you know what I think I'm going
to go back and in my studio and I'm
gonna build the course so Peter Kellner
is a good friend of mine who has done
several courses for approval site and he
has built a full garage converted it
that it was to you so it really depends
upon how much time interest knowledge
learning you want to do and then share
with others that sort of what drives me
essentially here all right thank you
very much for sharing your experience
Arun and as I'll invite you to you know
don't sit on the sidelines you have
something to tell you have a story to
tell
yes you might be thinking oh I only have
three years of experience I don't think
I'm ready to do that yet but I'm telling
you the story has not been told with
your voices yet it has been told by
somebody else just not by you and your
voice matters because think I think
think about where you are today and
where you were three years ago somebody
is exactly where you were three years
ago today and he's looking out he or she
is looking at you thinking would I ever
get there I think by jumping in by
producing content and by publishing
yourself in life you're helping grow the
community you're helping that person
think oh if he can do it I can do it too
thank you for coming what's an example
you know 12 years ago sorry but 12 years
ago I was told I would never be a public
speaker so now you don't have it in you
to be a public speaker and I literally
took that challenge to my heart so all
right let's speak now I'm an athlete I'm
an athlete by body by mind by heart so
I'm always up for any challenge you know
I'm getting ready for my first 50k race
and about three weeks is coming up so
I've never done a 50k but hey I'm up for
a challenge it is easy everybody will do
it I think it's difficult that's what
makes it interesting so give it a shot I
think you will like it you know think
about what what are you passionate about
and coffee and his team does really a
nice facilitation where you can focus on
your core competency and let them take
care of post-production and all that
stuff and hey some money comes with it -
why not
Thank you Thank You Aaron I think we
have a couple of minutes left do you
know we don't we don't all right so
thank you very much for coming we
appreciate your time all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
