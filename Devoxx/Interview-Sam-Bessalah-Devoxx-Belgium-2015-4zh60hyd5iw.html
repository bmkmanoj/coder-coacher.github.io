thank you for joining us today thanks
for inviting me and can you tell us a
little bit about yourself well I'm a
software developer I'm sorr engineer I
do I work as a freelance mostly in big
date distributed systems machine
learning those are things have been
deeply passionate about for a while now
so I've been working with them for some
customers all over Europe in Amsterdam
in Paris Germany as well so all over the
place all over the place yes say one of
your toast you are doing three yeah just
come from one of your talks is focusing
on machine learning which pretty caught
my attention because they obviously it's
been I read a lot about it recently yes
what was the focus of your talk Wow the
talk is about deep learning what
demystifying deploring because there has
been a lot of talk about this deep
running yeah like something that's
really in the air right now I think it's
very intimidating with some people's
faces yeah we kind of AI and for
intelligence absolutely sounds like
magic sometimes so your machine learning
of course but sometimes it's really
sounds like magic that really thing is
that just to demystify how it's being
used how developer can use them in their
application how they can actually try to
use them so yes it's not going to be a
low-level talk but rather something like
to understand what it does how you can
start working on its oil it's only an
hour talk so yes so how I did relatives
go about jumping into machine learning
and why would they want to ah why would
they want to well because at one point
we have data we work with a lot of data
today we're going into a world where you
have sensors everywhere working with IOT
things so at some point application that
we're going to bid at need to be smarter
not just thanks to the algorithms or the
framers were using but actually to
making them learn by themselves so yes
that one went diving into machine
running makes sense for developers and
it's fun why not you can I mean you can
do so much fun and cool things away so
it's a good thing to dive into them much
similar will be daunting at first might
sound like a daunting task at the very
beginning but once you get started there
a threshold to cross after you cross
that threshold it's a it's really too
nice things to go to so how would you
about jumping in then what would be your
first steps first steps I try to try to
go with some basic maths I the police to
say you wanted match to the machine
learning but I used to tell people yes
map are important so try to learn some
statistics some algebra a bit of data
science comfy yeah well some just the
basics and hopefully it's just one
Western actually how the algorithms that
are working inside but you have a lot of
frameworks out there so you have to
Syria for example that's that online
worried place where you can learn you
have a lot of course is on machine
learning to get started there you don't
want you won't have to implement your
own algorithms because have libraries
for that but yes it's a great place to
start for Sarah some mats and you have a
slew of data out there where you can use
them can start using anyway so you have
all the rules you need today to actually
start doing some machine long it's not
that complicated to get to get into so
what kind of machine learning projects
have you put together Wow ah personally
for myself I have a lot of fun with
machine learning of course but
professionally I've been working I
worked on fraud and and risk detection
and finance for trading and for payment
fraud so you do machine learning to find
out oh yes maybe this payment is not so
it is not okay so you have to work on
that and we also worked on machine
learning for health data so for example
to say okay you're running maybe warning
too much baby due to your pre two priors
we all health priors maybe you should
slow you should actually do this kind of
exercises you can do it should do this
kind of exercising so yours that we blew
some machine learning stuff to actually
work on that and I work for some clients
of course I'm not at liberty to say
similar things but for me for my own fun
I like to say for example to predict up
to have fun with machine learning
especially with deep learning to play
with image classification play with this
kind of thing I would he do that yes for
example an anomaly detection of course
also kind of things
it seems like a lot of people
specifically media organizations ticular
looking for Paige clicks are
increasingly looking into machine
learning and you're doing that up in
their systems do you think in the next
year I'll say we're going to see a bit
of an explosion in machine learning in
the same way that you saw this explosion
people talking about big data and things
like well it's already the case because
ah big data today it's not just about
piling up your data somewhere and
holding some somehow it's gonna bring in
morning the way many times you do yes
just throw your data somewhere and
somehow wait and pray that it's gonna
produce something now the reality data
only makes sense if you can learn
something from the effort from the data
and to learn something from that data I
could use machine learning we're talking
about marketing and page click
prediction yes I did those kind of
things to it didn't mention them but yes
that's a place where I you have a lot of
data and where you can actually apply
machine learning we do recommendation
for websites not just for page click we
want to buy something you want to say
okay I want to have clever
recommendations on how my customer are
using my website I want to track how
they go into the website so maybe my web
designer can find out okay maybe this
thing is cool is nice but people are not
clicking on that thing for a reason a be
testing yes it's have a lot of machine
learning all over the place now today
we're using google now using skype auto
translation google trusted those our
machine learning application so it's
already here it's just that developers
at some point need to say okay maybe I'm
gonna dive in and be scared come visit
just try just always a place to start
thank you very much to Jesse me this day
yeah and look forward to seeing your toe
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
