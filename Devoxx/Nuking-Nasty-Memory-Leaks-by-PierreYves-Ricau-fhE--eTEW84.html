nasty memory leaks so my name is P why I
work at square I'm part of the API team
so I'm not going to talk about that so
we have a huge attendance today there
are no cameras so I can say whatever I
want in the recording is going to sound
like can you actually cheer a little bit
like laughs yeah whoo geez so many
people all right so who has made an
Android app before I think about 100
people just raise their hands so how
many people have dealt with out of
memory errors before yeah that's 200
people so that's where we we've been
through the same issues and we realized
that there are sort of two reasons for
out of memory errors one of the big ones
is just that you're trying to create
something too big that's never the case
the second one and the real reason is
memory leaks and solely canaries the
library that helps you detect memory
leaks in your dev environment so we made
this library and started working on
reducing like memory leaks and when i
say we i really mean I and but I'm not
trying to put myself forward what I mean
is that I kind of got the hang of it and
started fixing things and then I was
like the then I stopped and then the the
number of crashes went up again and I
realized that I was the only one doing
it because it's really hard and I worked
with intuition and I wasn't really good
at explaining how to actually understand
those things and fix them so I try to i
sat down with a couple engineers and we
did it a few times and then we came up
with sort of a method and this is what
this talk is about so let's pretend that
we're new to android we haven't really
done any Android before and we want to
make an amazing app we love the color of
blue and we want to make an app that's
blue when it's focused and that's not
blue when it's not focus and we're going
to use multi-window because why not
so here we have a nap and it's split
into a multi window and then it's not
focused its great focus it flew oh
that's amazing really fantastic app so
we related we get a million downloads I
love huge numbers as you can see so we
get that million downloads and
everything is going great until we get a
lot of one star reviews because the app
is crashing so you know we start looking
at the crash reports and the cross
reports they say you got and out of
memory error that's happening a lot so
what do you do well there's a check mark
there that says marked as fixed to try
that first it doesn't work it comes back
and people are still unhappy so then I
talk to my friend and you sell it sell
me there so this library called Lee
canary you should try it out so it's
actually pretty simple you essentially
are a bunch of dependencies there's this
application class that's it singleton in
android and you just have to extend it
and add like a few lines of code and
then apparently that works and so that
now we look at we run the app again
we're in the AB and all of a sudden
there's going to be this like huge
freeze of the UI and a little toast that
pops up and the memory or hip dump has
been taken the memory is dumb to a fire
and then NIH runs and then you see a
notification that tells you hey we found
the leak and so we click on that
notification and we get to this it's
super fancy looks cool but not really
sure what to do about it it's called a
leak trace and so if I look at it the
first I did the first time I'll I'm like
I don't know what any of this is except
i see at the bottom there's a class
called neo neo mug we are leaving
realism view and the custom view that i
wrote so i'm going to look at it I'm
like okay cool let's teach you well it's
a severe that set the background color
in a Miss constructor and then it does
something amazing which is it register
as an activity I cycle call back when
it's attached to window and it changes
the Alpha from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1 1 g
activities is put in a resume ie when
the app is focused or not so that's what
you saw here they actually
view is focused and unfocused and the
color changes so that's cool if you're
an Android developer you have seen this
you immediately saw that something's
wrong the application is a single turn
and when you register an activity
lifecycle callback you register it on a
single time so it's going to stay there
forever and if you never and register it
well you're you're single tone is going
to three the callback is going to leak
and you're leaking your view hierarchy
and everything is bad so the solution
seems pretty simple we're going to
extract that callback and then remove it
in on the attachment window everybody's
happy problem solved so that's what I
used to do the problem is problem solved
not really how did we fix this problem
we used intuition we saw something wrong
and we fixed it and that's the
crashlytics temp problem fixed no
problem anymore so the problem is this
was a very easy thing and I just poked
around found a class found the leak and
I fixed it but I actually have no idea
how I got there and like really good
like people are good at fixing say
performance problems for example will
tell you yet that you never start with
the code you start from the out and you
start observing and then you dig I and
only then so that's what we're going to
do so let's let's take a step back and
let's learn java again we're going to
start with the roomba the garbage
collector and the principles of very
basic principles of a garbage collection
so we have three classes plus a Class B
and Class C and then we have method in
which we create a new instance of the
class a right so what happens when the
method is called an instance of a is
created and then it's garbage collected
everything's great okay we're going to
do the same thing again that create
three instances and we are going to
create references between those classes
right and and then we're going to set
those references so that every class
depends on the other right so we have an
island so what happens when we call the
method well same thing the
whole group of class to hold the three
instances are garbage collected
everything is fine now we create a
static field and we have that static
field reference one instance in one
instance and then we call the method now
what happens no garbage collection
because the whole graph of object is
held by the static field right so this
static field is called AG throught and
the reference is never feared other
types of jesuits our local variables and
threads that are running or native code
so if you if you zoom out you
essentially in your java memory in your
java heap you have a bunch of GT boots
and they hold two objects which holds
you object in that essentially a graph
right a direct us and you have some
isolated isolated groups of isolated
object islands like this one in the
middle and this can be garbage collected
all right so now we know that an object
that's connected to GT roots cannot be
garbage collected so let's look at this
and say this is one activity and this
activity here has been destroyed and
destroyed is a lifecycle event in the
Android lifecycle that means that the
activity is not going to be used anymore
it should be garbage collected soon and
here we can see that it cannot be
because it's connected to ad throught so
we have that activity it has an M
destroyed feel that set to true so it's
it's clearly leaking and the problem is
the activity references of interviews
which have bitmaps there's a whole world
of things that are kept in memory
because that activity is leaking so
what's going on here the activity is
leaking because it's connected to the GT
route and we can draw the pass from all
of the GT routes to that activity and
they are not there is not one platter
there are multiple paths and actually in
real life you can have hundreds of class
and combinations of class from any
number of GC rue21 instance and if we
want to fix that you see with what we
really need to fix the leak what we're
going to do is find the connections that
need to go and it turns out that we
don't need to find many connections we
actually industry just need to find one
the one on the shortest path because
there can be
leaks but if you fix one leak then
that's one less problem and then it's
going to come up again and you'll find
another league so all you need to do is
look at the shortest path which here is
that one and and then and then find the
wrong reference and that's exactly what
Lee canaries doing so what happens with
Lee canary is that it will perform a
heap dump and then process the heap dump
find the shortest path to a reference
and then show that in a foreign object
and show that in in the UI so this is
and that are exactly the same these two
things and white you see any canary you
see the nodes and in purple the fields
are actually the edges all right so come
back to this if we have a shortest path
to the worst thing our shortest path and
one of these connections shouldn't exist
and let's pretend that we already know
that in fact the two green instances are
the top are objects that should be alive
for example Singleton's and the two red
at the bottom should be garbage
collected at this point right and so
it's very clear at that point that the
problem is the connection between the
green to the red that's very into it
then the converter the whole thing is
isolating and Gabby can be garbage
collected all right so this is all nice
but how does that translate concretely
so on mobile devices generally you have
you actually have on your Android
devices a lot of memory leaks that's
just how it is that's life and these are
small and they're not generally a
problem except that they accumulate over
time and that makes the app crash so
let's apply the the method that we just
saw to a real concrete example so we
have this leaked race and we're going to
we started the way we started with find
a kind of you and I and look at it so if
you know Java a little bit you know that
n on in this class is actually compiled
two distinct class that gives a
reference to you out of class so this is
what it looks and the class is named
dollar one out of class
one so when we look here we can actually
split the whole dick trace in two areas
the top is the objects that are alive
and should be alive and the bottom is
the object that should not be alive
anymore and this is the link that we
need to to kill but how did we figure
that out if we don't use intuition well
like what we actually do is we can look
at every single object there and make a
decision they should be dead for example
the activity is leaking that I know for
sure it's destroyed so it's read the
application class is a single term its
grain at that point every time we make
that type of decision we know that
everything above a green object is green
and everything below a red object is red
so it becomes very easy to move forward
and make decisions for example of view
well what about the view the view that's
right there at the bottom we can
actually Siliconera provide a string
output with some it's not like a fool I
doesn't provide a full state of
everything but it provides the fields of
every object on the league trace so if
we scroll down we can see that I'm going
to get there but there is yeah the
imitation so is now on the view what
does that mean well if you look at the
Android code you'll see that the view
class has an M attaching fulfilled and
in is attached to window method that
returns true if imitation for is no it's
not no so what that means is that if
this is known as we saw then the view is
detached which means it jolly should be
garbage collected in that context exist
and therefore we can realize that ok so
these objects should be gone and now we
can look at the top and see and see that
it's an array list and then below it is
the implementation the array the array
list is the list of listeners in the
application so that itself should stick
in memory what should not have been in
memory is the listener itself so we're
back to where we were ok let's actually
start to do get a little bit more so
this was an easy example right we're
going to look at two example one from
the support library and another one from
squares good but before that so the
cannery gives you a notification that
tells you hey I found a leak in your dev
application what do most people do most
developers they don't sit down and fix
it they just swipe out with an education
and move forward because you have a lot
of work to do and you don't have time to
deal with that so that's not great so
what we did instead is we thought well
we should capture all these things and
send them to back-end I haven't done
server in six years and I'm lady so I
didn't want to do back end so instead I
realized that we have crash reporting
tools so i made a sick of fake text
actress because you can do that in java
you can create fake stack traces based
on because it's very similar based on
the leak traces and then just upload
them to a crash reporting tool and it
looks like this looks like a stack trace
but it's not actually a stack trace the
front part is that you benefit from the
grouping and Counting that these tools
usually provide and that gives you that
way you can actually fix the most
important memories and then you can look
at a better representation of that and
we can reapply the same thing so let's
look at this one for example here at the
root we can see that there is a main
turret and for sir that refer that has
to fill that co-main refer that
reference is a looper that's the main
thread looper it should stick around
we're pretty sure about that it should
not go away everything is fine I'm the
same we can also look at the activity
the activity is at the end that's what
we can I refound we know that it's
leaking now click in the middle ok this
is getting interesting the run queue
this is an android class so people's
reaction to that 90 oh this is android
not my fault i don't know i don't want
to touch it but we can actually enter it
is open source we can actually go and
look so what is the view would involve
run queue ok let's figure this out it's
an inner class of your route info and it
has one interesting a couple interesting
method one of them is supposed to date
that's it a runnable it rats it and then
put that in an array list that is stored
in the red rank you there's also post
method that just puts with
delay of 0 the question is okay we're
putting into a queue when are we dq'ing
also we look at Java doc and Java doc
says that the work is executed during
the next call to perform traversals on
the thread so their queue is going to be
dq'd the next time there's a traversal
and also says that the run queue is used
to in queue pending work from use when
the no Henry's attached so let's check
that out let's look at the view class
and we can look at post and placed on
animation so in the view class you can
post work to execute later on the main
thread and the implementation is very
simple this again this am attached info
field and if the views attached just
supposed to either the choreographer or
the main thread a handler or put in a
queue to be executed later on the next
traversal ok that's cool what does huge
Impala get ranked you do well the
implementation is again a relatively
simple there's a static field is a
threadlocal because there's only one run
super thread usually there's only the
main thread but you know some people do
you I not on the main thread I guess and
let's read local keeps a variable for
each thread and then the then it's
pretty simple right like do I have a
queue yes return it otherwise created
and put it back in there so if you come
back to our licked right here and we
look at these two elements over there it
mentioned thread locals and so you think
that we're not very familiar with but we
just saw that there was a threadlocal
for that very much essentially the
static field that's holding on to the
queues and then we can see that this is
the static the queue right and so if we
think about it ok the three local
holding on to Q the Q should stick
around right it's static and it's going
to be there forever so we can make the
decision that it should stick around
it's green and we can expand our green
area and similarly we can look at the
list of action right so there's an M
action field that's referencing an
ArrayList that has a backing array and
the first element of that backing array
points to the next object the action
well that's this is essentially what's
in the queue I should also be around
that's pretty easy now we get into the
more intriguing part what is this app
compat delegate in pool v23 it's an
instance of app compat delegate and if
we look at the code we see that there's
something called app compat activity and
essentially it's a companion a delegate
that leaves in there and that receives
all the callback and deals with that so
if you think about life cycle that means
that when the activity is destroyed the
delegate should be destroyed as well
it's created for the activity and it
should go away with it so if the
activity is supposed to be destroyed at
this point the delegate should not be
around anymore now we can do one row up
and we see that there's an anonymous s
in the v9 version of that class so
essentially there's a hierarchy of
classes v 9 b 23 that override each
other and so there's something that's
referencing that and so if we look at
the code we actually see that there's a
vulnerable that MV validate panel menu
runnable and it's apparently leaking so
where is it used it's used in invalidate
panel menu and it post on a window decor
which is a view it puts that burnable so
if we wrap it up thinking about what we
just so we're posting an animation to
view and we saw that if the view is not
attached then the post is done on the on
the is just stored on the run queue and
will be dq'd later it will be dq'd on
the next traversal now the problem is
what happens if the activity finishes
and there is no next reversal because
there is no next activity for now the
thing is going to stay in the queue
until there is a next activity which
might not happen for a while so the fix
is should be a relatively simple which
is in whatever that delegate is just
when the activities destroyed remove the
callback from the view and that will
clear it from the queue so that's
something that we site on Android I
haven't checked in awhile i think they
eventually fixed it i hope
I think they did screenshot is old so
that shows that whenever you have a leak
doesn't mean and even if it seems to be
an Android land it doesn't mean that you
can do anything about it you can
actually report it you can provide a six
and in five years it's going to be fixed
on your phone so that's pretty great
sorry I had to so let's go get something
that was a little bit harder for us in
the square code base so we got another
leak and in there there's a view I'm
like oh I know did you pass code unlock
view it's one of our things so I know
how to check if you should be garbage
collected or not right so I just go into
the details of the state and look for
field call em attention oh it's no the
view is garbage collection I know in
that context it should be gun which
helps me a lot because now I don't have
to look at everything at the bottom and
all of that should be garbage collected
then I see an anonymous class actually
it's an anonymous stress in an anonymous
s right so it's dollar for dollar one
what is it so I look at the code and it
is just it will set background image
that takes a request that's a Picasso
request because our image library it
loads pictures and it makes that very
easy and so instead of just showing the
picture what it does is wait for the
view to be measured to have a size and
then start this cold back that's going
to download the image at the right side
the point of this is basically we want
to wait to have a view that's measured
and then we're going to ask the server
for the measure of the right size and
then we're going to insert it so okay
that's cool and we can see that this is
what's happening there we say we start
the peak at the request and we provide
any major you and it's going to go back
into it and set it when the image is
there so let's look at request that into
Java doc because piezo is a really good
square library and it has very good job
work and as we see that asynchronously
fulfill the request in to the specified
image view and invokes the callback note
callback is a strong reference and will
prevent your activity fragments from
being garbage collected Oh kind of rings
the bell just what happens if
use this method is it is strongly
recommended you invoked cancel request
to prevent temporary leaking all right
so open up your passcode in lockview
cancel request was already there it was
doing the right thing so that's kind of
weird what do I do now so we start
looking at the cancel request
implementation and we can see that it's
pretty simple it has a map and of
targets to actions and it removes the
target get the action impulse cancel on
it and if you look at an action an
action as the cancel field that's
interesting because that action is on
the path of the undertaking best if we
can actually we can actually see it and
we can see that it was not canceled so
now it's weird we do a call and on the
attached to window we actually cancel
but it's not canceled something is
clearly not easy 200 something is wrong
so if we come back to the leak trace we
see that the action should not be around
the list of action that's right above
should be around it's pretty easy to do
that distinction and now we're now we
have a problem we've actually done our
job of investigating the link trace and
finding the top part that's what should
be around and the bottom part is what
should not be around and we're doing the
right thing we're calling the code and
we're still not able to understand
what's going on that's when you actually
have to pull out the real tools so
memory analysis or anything that's a
heap dump our story you can you can poke
around so we need a hit dubs which means
you're using things and you know usually
it happens later we look at the thing
that's happening the most so it's always
a think so we need to need it to upload
he dumps to a back end in background
automatically so that we can then
download done on them later but i'm lazy
i don't know i don't want to deal the
back end so i found a better solution
let's go slack slack has an API and you
can go into slack API and upload
whatever you want so we created a
channel on our slack and
it just gets it's about challenges get
all of the all of the heat dumps
uploaded to slack and then we can go
later and download them and I'm still
waiting for someone that's like to call
it and tell us to not do that but so far
it's been working great you can't
imagine how much data that represents I
don't actually want to know it's
actually very interesting trying to open
it in a non flag just freezes your
instance for like quite a bit it's
really nice so let's open this in that
figure out what's going on so if we come
back to this we saw that Picasso has
these target to action feels so let's
look at it let's find in in Matt Matt
being memory and I use this tool so look
for Picasso we noticed that there are
two instances in memory you can see on
the far right side and it has a target
to action filled the first instance has
the target to action field that is the
hashmap with the size of zero doesn't
seem to be what we want and the second
one has the size of one and it has our
ticket Oh image review action in it we
found it okay but that doesn't really
mean that we found a leak we just yeah
as expected it has been cancelled it's
still in the map so how can it be
canceled and fill in the map and not
removed but we are calling a cancel
request from on the dash to window like
what's going on here so there's a
Picasso field in that object so let's
look at that Picasso filled in in that
right so we open the passcode unlock
view and we open a Picasso and that's
where the surprise is because we open up
that Picasso instance and we see size
zero and now it starts to click there
are two Picasso instances my view my
view has the Picasso instance with size
zero but there was another Picasso
instance that has the inanimate rest
that we were dealing with so what's
going on exactly well what actually
happens is that the PFI instance was
injected by
dependency injection and so we can
probably lay in dependency injection
injection for that but what's actually
going on is that when we call set
background image we pass in a request
and that request actually has a
reference to another pokito instance and
so we're canceling the request on the
wrong ticket for instance so we just had
to unregister from the right ticket for
instance so with that said that was a
quick introduction to the canary the key
principles are try to not use intuition
I try to remove myself more and more
from intuition and trying to not jump to
the code directly we just apply this
like green red green red method and
avoid jumping to conclusions and you
just need to find you know which ones
should be around which one should not
and if it's below if you find something
that should not be around everything
below it not be around as well it's a
bit of an oversimplification but it's
more so nine percent of the time and
that way you can find the instance the
reference that's long and most of the
time you actually fix the bug that way
and sometimes you actually need the heat
jump to figure out how to fix it with
that say well I think that's it I'm done
thank you oh and a word from my employer
we are building api's and we would love
to have more people using our API if you
are interested in taking payments which
has nothing to do with memory leaks but
it's super interesting in itself I
suggest you go to square I TI's and Jake
who does not work at square at all has a
question
you
yeah so the question that that's a
really good question the question is can
the machine do the work for us and can
we be more lazy even yes we can it's if
someone wants to contribute to the Lee
canary projects and implement that is
actually I have a branch from a long
time ago that does that we could we
could really automate for we could
basically use pattern matching for views
activities fragments and a bunch of
class that we know we have easy ways to
detect whether they should be around on
that we could totally do that and just
simplify and just really show you where
the bug is I think that that that's a
very reasonable ask and I wish I had
more time to do that yeah
it's a really good question so I didn't
go into the details of the runtime of
the canary the question is how do you
get the heap dump was that automatic or
like how do you have you does that work
solely canary is actually a very simple
implementation where what you need is
objects that have a life cycle and when
you know that there should be garbage
collected soon you trigger something so
what we do is so activities for example
have a non destroyed call back in
undestroyed we put the activity
reference into a weak reference and then
we use a cue forget the name anyway
basically five seconds later we check
that week we're friends and if if the
weak reference is clear then there's no
leak the object has been garbage
collected if it's not peered well we do
the usual we do system the GC wait a bit
too tender juicy wait a bit no just to
make sure that true and then we check
again and if it's all that garbage
collected then we assume that there is
likely to be a leak and then android
supports there's a static method in
android to actually dumped the memory so
you just call debug that I think it's
heap dump or something than the heap or
whatever and then proceed into a file
and then we spin off a new process and
we start parsing that when I say we I
never wrote that code it turns out that
someone originally someone made a fork
of mat with no UI so that's what I used
I just packaged it and then recently the
Android team actually made a new hip
departure for Android studio that's also
based on the same original source of
thing that was K hat and I use that
instead but so and so and then it's just
a navigating through graph finding the
shortest path and that's all provided so
yeah so it's all automatic if you
weren't if you like say you writing
server applications you don't have the
automatic keep them's you have to do
some external integrations probably to
do that and I also don't know that on
servers you have the same easy objects
with a clear life cycle that tend to
leak often one of the key reasons that
this works so well on android is
because activities are good object they
are able to do everything they represent
a lot of things the end they hold on to
a lot of memory and they have a life
cycle so there are perfect candidates
for object to track that should be
garbage garbage collected and if you
have a similar context and it works well
if you don't then maybe works less if
there were like people working at Google
in this room maybe maybe you could talk
to them but I don't think they are just
[Laughter]
kidding all right I think we need to
leave room for the next person thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
