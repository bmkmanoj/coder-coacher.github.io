my name is James Weaver and I'm with
pivotal and we'll be talking about
composing music in the cloud and where
we're going to today is I'm going to
show you some things about show you an
application I wrote that that does
algorithmic composition and I'll explain
some things about music theory and and
specifically about counterpoint music
and then also we're going to dive a
little bit into machine learning and I'm
going to discuss quickly machine
learning and then I'll show you a
project that was created by by the
Google brain team that does machine
based music composition and so we'll jam
with that a little bit by the way I have
a session tomorrow with Katherine
Beaumont actually two sessions where
we'll take deep dives into machine
learning the first one is an
introduction the second one we'll do
some deep learning so you're welcome to
come to that to both of those sessions
one is before lunch and one is after
lunch and then and then I'm going to
give you a live demo of a piece of this
algorithmic composition thing so we'll
be lots of demos today so first of all a
little bit about me I've been doing Java
for a long time written several books on
Java and Java FX j2ee as well as my
latest book was Raspberry Pi and Java
and so just kind of dive right into what
counterpoint is that that's the kind of
the subject a part of this is
counterpoint is the relationship between
musical voices so musical voices are
like melodies and they they are
interdependent harmonically in other
words when two notes play at the same
time they must be pleasing to the ear
and that but they're independent in
rhythm and contour
so the rhythms can be different and the
way that the notes the pitches rise and
fall
can be different among the different
melodies and if you wanted to get a nice
gentle introduction to that then here's
a nice link by the way these slides are
on the on the web and they're in my
slides calm account and I'm going to
show you how to get to them very easily
so here's an example of counterpoint
where we have four lines of music and
notice that we have different different
rhythms and different contours and
shapes and so I'm going to go ahead and
play you than an example and just listen
for the okay
start over again there we go
again noticing that the contours the the
way that the pitches rise and fall are
different as well as the the the rhythms
but then every time two or more notes
were played together they sounded
pleasing to the ear so a little bit of
history then this person named Giovanni
Palestrina in the sixteenth century
created a version or he kind of
developed his own style of counterpoint
called Palestrina counterpoint and he
had a lot of influence on musicians such
as johann sebastian bach
and then the next century a guy with a
very awkward last name Johann Joseph
Fuchs who was born in Austria by the way
he codified Palestrina's techniques so
he noticed in in counterpoint that
particular type of counterpoint music
several rules as a matter of fact maybe
seventy some rules for how note should
sound together and how they should
follow each other and so he documented
those rules in this book called gratis
odd pon Assam and so those described
valid pitch and rhythmic relationships
between the notes so he influenced the
music of Joseph Haydn who is I believe
was born in Austria Mozart and Beethoven
so so there's a in order to demonstrate
this counterpoint composer application
that I'm going to show you that I that I
developed using Java and spring and and
some other technologies I'm going to
play this melody called I guess it's
funky funky cleaner starin is that what
it is here in in Germany okay very good
so it's twinkle twinkle little star in
the US and so I think you've probably
heard it before about go ahead
playa that's twinkle twinkle little star
and I I never get applause for that so I
brought my own applause track now now
don't it's too late now I'll just give
myself my own applause here by the way
if I don't get enough laughs I'll just
I'll just pretend you're laughing here
so I better turn that off here so that's
going to be our main melody we're going
to use that for a main melody to our
counterpoint and then we're going to
have this application that I developed
then compose algorithmically other
melodies that then are supposed to sound
good with that and follow the rules of
Palestrina
counterpoint as documented by Johan
Yosef Fuchs so that's so there's an
application called counterpoint composer
and I've got it I've got it right here
let's see counterpoint composer all you
have to do to get to it is type in
counterpoint composer calm and if you go
there then this comes up in your browser
and then to get to the slides that I'm
presenting all you have to do is go to
the help system so the getting started
guide which is kind of what I'm going
through now is at this menu item and
then the technical presentation all the
technical things I'm going to show you
are in this second one so it's very easy
to get to count
point compute co-composer comm and so
we're going to then start with twinkle
twinkle little star now in one of the
slides it shows you how to do this but
since I'm here I'm going to go ahead and
show you personally so what we'll do
first of all is we will click into the
musical staff that's where we'll be
composing our music and then I'm going
to click the keyboard icon right here
and then I'm going to play a couple of
notes just to get it started
I'm going to play two notes that will
form the basis of it'll tell us how many
how many melodies we want in our
counterpoint I'm just gonna specify two
melodies and then I'm going to play the
rest of twinkle twinkle little star so
so here's the first two notes that we'll
play simultaneously and then you see
that they're being answered there so
okay so we've we've typed in our Cantus
firmus and now we want to compose so
there are a couple of options here we
can choose the species so when when
fuchs when he created when he codified
these rules he noticed there were about
five different species of counterpoint
from easiest to hardest and so when he
wrote the book gratis add par nessam
gratis means stairs in italian and so it
was this idea of taking a student
through the different species 1st
through 5th and so the rules kind of
progress so the easiest one is the first
species and then then music there are
seven different modes
that are if you if you play the piano or
have seen a piano then you have white
keys and so the Ionian mode for example
uses is kind of centered on the C key
and usually begins and ends on C and has
a very bright feel there are other modes
like Dorian or Aeolian mode that have
kind of a darker feel and so you'll see
that in a minute but I want to go ahead
and start out with Ionian mode and in
first species and now I will say now
that I've punched in my Cantus firmus I
will compose and so now it is going to
the cloud using micro services in the
cloud that I'll show you to then compose
the counter melody here so this is the
one I punched in I also punched in this
note as you'll remember so I wanted to
lines in my in my composition in my
counterpoint and then the micro-service
make sure services then composed
according to the rules that were
documented by Fuchs it composed this
second one so let's see how it sounds
let me go ahead and play this I'm gonna
make it play a little faster than then
then the default may be 200 and some
beats per second or for a minute that
would be fast if I did it per second
okay so there's play
okay so you'll notice that even though
it was rhythmically different that the
pitch contours were different the notes
sounded good when they were played
together I want you to notice a couple
of other things as well notice the the
d5 everybody see the d5 in the a5 up
there those are those are chord
signatures chord markings and those are
those will come into play but basically
what anytime two or more notes are
played together then the counterpoint
composer the microservice in the cloud
then tries to identify is that a chord
is that a known chord and if it is then
it it returns and tells it and then we
put it on our score so that's how we
enter a Cantus firmus and we compose and
so here are the steps to the demo and
you'll be able to run through that
yourself and so those are just the
things that I said and here are some
resources if you'd like to learn more
about counterpoint or or first species
counterpoint and then also some tips on
composing a Cantus firmus a main melody
so now we'll go to the second species
the first species is you'll notice was a
whole note and on top of a whole note so
there were the same values as far as
time note on note counterpoint is what
it's called the second species contains
half notes in the counter melody so
there's two half notes for every whole
note so I'll go ahead and go back to
counterpoint composer and I'm going to
specify second species and we'll go
ahead and hit compose and then we'll
play that again speeding it up a bit
okay I'll just type in 240 that'll be
easier okay
so that's second species and then if I
wanted to go to third species third
species is quarter notes so for every
note in acanthus Pyramus there are four
notes going on in the counter melodies
so I'll go ahead and say third species
compose and then we'll play that and
we'll see what third species sounds like
okay and then forth species is called
florid counterpunch sorry forth species
will have two half notes but it's kind
of a kind of a hasn't has a nice feel to
it and I'll explain why let me get up to
fourth species here okay so if you look
at the notes there you'll notice there's
a tie that's the this this kind of half
circle or arc between two notes and so
you'll notice that the the half notes
are the same between measures so they
kind of cross the measure and so what
that does is that builds this idea of a
suspension and a Rick and of a release
so you'll notice as you're listening to
this one that at the end of the measure
the last beat of the are the last two
the last note of the each measure it'll
it'll play this interval you know that
has this feeling that it needs to be
resolved and so there's this suspense
there and then when it gets to the next
measure then you hear the resolution and
so I'll go ahead and and compose with
the fourth species and then we'll play
it I'll play it a little bit slower so
that you have time to to hear the what I
was talking about as far as the suspend
in the and the resolution so listen for
it
suspension suspension resolution
suspension resolution
so I misled you I I misspoke actually
the the suspension is actually on the
first half note of a measure of each
measure and the resolution is on the
second half note so I'd like to listen
you to listen to it again in that light
you're that suspension resolution so
that's part of the fourth species of Tom
okay then the the fifth species is
called florid and it combines all of the
other species plus it adds eighth notes
and you have various rhythms things so
it's very it's very creative in terms of
counterpoint so that's this one that's
fifth species and so you'll notice in
the counter melody lots of different
variation so we'll go ahead and click
click fifth species here and compose it
couldn't compose there we go
and then we will speed that up to maybe
200 and play so any more like a
classical piece
okay and again there are there are links
if you want to learn more about 50 C's
so that now there's something called
modes in music and I just I talked about
a little bit there are seven major modes
from Ionian to anybody musician here
anybody can tell me what the last mode
is yes what's the last mode okay I'll
give you a hint here here we go
Locrian mode so and Locrian is from is
all the white keys again from B to B and
so Dorian is from D to the etc so so I'd
like to do then is kind of explore the
modes in music so what we can do then is
compose something that starts in D and
ends in D and we'll select Dorian mode
from the counterpoint composer and we'll
hear something that's in that vein so
I'll go ahead and clear here didn't mean
to put you on the spot ok so again I say
Dorian mode first species and we'll just
go ahead and compose something that
starts with a D whoops you have to click
in there ok I want you to just kind of
notice that this has a little bit of a
darker feel kind of a minor minor feel
so I'll go ahead and compose and then we
will speed it up a little bit and hit
play
everybody here that it just has this
darker feel to it and so there's a video
on doing that so you can also use in
counterpoint Composer this is actually
being used in some universities and the
students are able to experiment with
turning off and turning on these rules
so again there are 70 some rules and
they're listed in this application if I
go to the rules menu they're listed in
order of importance so here are some
rules with critical importance like
there's something called parallel fifths
that were very that we're very common
with gregorian monk chants and things
like that so they sounded they sound
good in those chants but they don't
sound good in counterpoint music and so
parallel fifths are not allowed in
counterpoint music for example so those
are here are some critical ones here are
some ones that are with high importance
and then here are some with medium
importance and I'm going to pick on this
one this rule that says avoid Unison's
in two part counterpoint so I'm going to
go ahead and and disable that rule so
that it should allow now Unison's in in
in two part counterpoint so here we have
two parts in our counterpoint and I'm
going to go ahead and now that I've
turned that rule off I'm going to go
ahead and hit compose again and I'm
going to go ahead and play that and I'm
going to point out that it did in fact
allow a eunice and I'll explain what a
unison is in a second here but I want
you to hear it first
so we'll play that so that last note you
only heard one note if I'm gonna go
ahead and play it again and listen for
the last note so that's called a unison
when you play more than one note and it
only sounds like one note that's unison
and so if you look at the last measure
in the treble clef which is the upper
clef the one on the top we have a D in
the bass clef even though it looks
different because it's in a different
clef that is also a D it's the D above
middle C so they're both the same one so
when we when we switched off that rule
it allowed it to put a unison in two
part counterpoint another thing that
you'll that you may have noticed is that
the counter melody that was generated
was different so if you disable a rule
or change a rule then then it affects
because of the algorithms it affects the
entire melody or it could have a
potential effect on the entire melody
because there are things that are
dependent upon on on different
combinations that are happening in the
in the composed counterpoint
so the fact that it allowed a unison
allowed other things than to happen it
caused the melody to change
so that was the effect of disabling it
and so now I'd like to then kind of dive
into the technical portions of this so
we we did some composing music
algorithmically I demoed counterpoint
composing composer so now I'd like to
show you the high level architecture for
this application so first of all we have
a single page HTML html5 application and
so we have some some common
functionality dropdowns things like that
but then also we have a plug-in called
note flight note flight is you can just
go down note flight comm it's a it's a
site where you can compose music but
they also have a plug-in that you can
embed in HTML applications and so in
this case what I'm doing is that I'm
embedding it so that I have the use of
the staff and the keyboard and the
ability then to allow the user to
compose something and then when when
they compose a Cantus firmus then what
we do is we send that information up
about the melody and some other things
to a micro service that's running in
pivotal Cloud Foundry and the micro
services are created in Java and they
use spring and spring but-- so there's
one called counterpoint service so we
send up some information about the
melody to counterpoint service and then
it calls court analyzer service and I
remember court analyzer we analyzed the
court and we showed what kind of court
it was and we put that on the on the
music so that's the job of the court
analyzer service so we have these two
separately running independent micro
services that then are combining to
provide this functionality so that's the
architecture by the way if you have any
questions while we're going along please
do ask I'll be glad to to answer
anything I can here the source code this
is completely open source
it's Apache 2 license so it's in github
here's the the counterpoint service in
github and to kind of dive into then
these micro services and what their
functionality is if you look at the top
there's the Cantus firmus that we
created so there's the three chords or
the three notes that we we use two notes
when I demonstrate it but you could use
three or more if you want if you'd like
and then there's the melody and so we
create a JSON string out of that in the
html5 application and we send that to
the service so the JSON string consists
of the main melody which is a numeric
representation of the melody in
something called MIDI mi di which is a
standard for representing notes and then
we send the the parts in the initial
note which indicates how many parts we
want and then we also send the mode and
the species of counterpoint that we want
so then that's a post to the
counterpoint service it then returns
some XML that is in this dialect called
music XML which then expresses the whole
composition that was created when the
service created countermelodies and used
all the rules that I did that the fukes
documented and so it creates it sends
back the melody in music XML but then
when more than one note is being played
at the same time we want to be able to
note that on the on the score and so we
call that court analyzer service passing
in notes in this case it's a G chord at
G 3 D 4 B 4 and then it sends back
information about the chord like the
root of the chord is G the chord type is
major the bass note is G and then we can
in the html5 application then we can put
that on the score so that's kind of the
the cycle of what what happens with
these rest services created in Java and
you know it has a kind of a legacy of
you know Fuchs created and wrote a book
on on those rules and then other people
before me have ported those rules to
languages like C my contribution was I
ported it to Java and then created put
those in micro services there and put
them out in the cloud in pivotal Cloud
Foundry so that then so then anybody can
use them and and including including
universities and things when they want
to learn about how to use counterpoint
and so that's kind of that in a nutshell
and so I'd like to explore a different
approach now to music composition if you
don't have any more questions about this
particular approach so any questions
okay so I'd like to switch gears a
little bit and we're going to come back
to counterpoint composer but there are
other music composition approaches that
have been taken over the years for
example back in the 1800s it used to be
a fun parlor game to have music notation
music bits of music written on the face
of dice and then people would roll them
and then whatever came out then they
would play so that was a way of kind of
randomly generating music more recently
than Google brain has created this
project this open-source project called
project magenta and this is this idea
where we have this artificial
intelligent agent that uses machine
learning to receive it receives a notes
kind of to seed this artificial
intelligent
and then it responds using machine
learning to what was played and so you
can kind of go back and forth kind of
jam with this this neural network so
that's project magenta and so I want to
set the stage a little bit on what
machine learning is and by the way
katherine beaumont and myself tomorrow
will be giving some deep dives in
machine learning but in a nutshell
machine learning is it's right there is
the science of getting computers to
learn without being explicitly
programmed so if you recall with
counterpoint Composer I had to
algorithmically create an application
that in Java that would Express all 70
of those rules and then and then create
those counter melodies with machine
learning you don't explicitly have it
learn something you don't explicitly
teach something the machine learning
mechanisms like neural networks they
learn how to do something and so the
teaching that you give it would be with
data so super either supervisors or
unsupervised so here's an anatomy of
artificial neural network
it's basically modeled after the brain
over on the left you have inputs and on
the right you have outputs and you have
hidden layers in the middle that are
analogous to your neurons and synapses
in your brain and so very simply kind of
a very simplified view is over on the
left you have an input let's say you
have a picture well a picture is made up
of pixels so your input might be you
know a 24 by 24 picture that so it has
whatever 24 by 24 is pixels and then
each of those picture each of those
pixels would actually have RGB values so
you might have three times that many
the inputs each having a 0 to 255 value
and so that's your input and then you
have layers in your artificial neural
network that then take the process that
input and and try to you know true you
you you can then it can then learn by
you training that input with some output
for example the initial picture on the
left you might want to train yet on
recognizing a cat and an elephant so
there's an elephant and so we would give
it many pictures of elephants and we
would tell it that's an elephant and
then in this this is a very simplified
view but in the hidden layers then it
begins to to put values in the neurons
as well as in the synapses those edges
in the graph put values that then trains
it but then that then represents the
weights but then cause it to when it
recognizes an elephant to know it's an
elephant or when it sees an elephant's
and know it's an elephant and so in the
middle there it's in the hidden layers
it's beginning to build up
representations of things that might be
in an elephant like tusks or eyes or if
it's a cat like fur and eyes and so
that's how that works
and so that's supervised learning in a
traditional neural network there's also
something called a recurrent neural
network and that if if we're if we're
recognizing a cat or an elephant then
that's something where it's very static
you're giving it a picture and it's
saying what it is you're asking it to
classify what it is
but if you have time series data like
music is time series data so we have a
melody and one note comes after another
excuse me
so when that note comes after another
you need to be able to to capture the
order in which these notes happened to
be able to then predict the next note or
compose the next note so to illustrate
this let's say that it's you have a
couple of cats in a box so if you are
giving this to a supervised learning
technique you know a normal artificial
network it would only be able to tell
you that there's two cats in a box but
it's not it can't tell you what's gonna
happen next cuz there's no time series
data with it but then I had a lot of fun
on giffy by the way finding this but but
it turns out that what's going to happen
next is that the cat on the top is
closing the box but it could have very
well been that the next thing that was
going to happen is the cat on the bottom
would open the box so how does that
relate well we we have this thing called
a recurrent neural network that can then
make a prediction so if we give a a
certain number of notes let's say I'm
playing some notes and we're asking then
the the computer the the neural network
then to jam with me we're asking it to
then play some notes that might happen
next
so with this recurrent neural network we
can play some notes and then it can then
predict based upon probabilities that
it's a that it's observed in a body of
music from in this particular case
they've trained project magenta with
everything from Bach's Radiohead to
different other groups just a wide
variety of music of melodies and the
music and so then it can make these
predictions with its artificial neural
network so it extracts melodies from
songs and then and then if you look at
this diagram this is depicting a
recurrent neural network so we have
at the start we have you can see below
start there's no note so we don't have
any notes and so the recurrent neural
network might say okay if there's no
notes I'm gonna play a C because the
body of work that I analyzed the
probability if there's no notes for the
next note to be a C is highest and so it
would play that one and then we feed in
this particular case we feed that C back
into the bottom and now we have C and C
and so then the recurrent neural network
says ah you know the next note the
highest probability of the next so when
two CS are played then would be a G and
and and and so on and so it's it's
that's a simplified version of what's
happening the same type of thing also
happens for rhythm so half rests and
quarter rests or the durations of notes
are the absence of the of notes those
things are studied as well learned by
the recurrent neural network so then it
can make predictions on what note should
be next so they created a a demo called
a I duet that that the end the link by
the way is here so you can play with it
anytime you want to as well and I'll go
ahead and hit play and I'm going to play
this actually I didn't show you this
before this is this is a MIDI keyboard
it's called a lynnster man it's got 250
keys 8 by 8 by 25 actually 200 keys and
it's a very expressive instrument plays
a little bit like a keyboard piano but
also like a guitar it's laid out a
little bit like a guitar so it's a
really nice fun instrument to play
so I'll just jam with a little bit so
first of all I'll play just a typical 1
4 5 chord pattern that's a pattern that
you'll recognize and lots of different
songs
and so it's now playing back based upon
these probabilities that it's learned in
the recurrent networks who's heard of
Close Encounters of the Third Kind I
thought it'd be remember the close of
the movie Close Encounters of the Third
Kind anybody has heard that okay
there was a it's a it's about a
spaceship you know an alien spaceship
and so they're trying to communicate
with it and so they find they found that
they figured the best way to communicate
with it would be to play a melody and
then maybe it would play a melody and so
I thought well it'd be kind of fun it
kind of appropriate so here was the
melody that they played it with just
four four simple notes
the fact that this is here is it's
messing things up a little bit okay
okay so then we could also like kind of
jam with it like play a song as frÃ¨re
Jacques
so so it kind of it kind of plays kind
of jams with you as you're playing so
and it does it with a neural network so
now I'd like to go back to counterpoint
composer and you remember that second
micro service that identifies chords and
then puts them in the music that
micro-service is as as is the whole
thing of counterpoint composer is
written in Java and it uses spring and
spring but-- and so it's really easy to
create a rest service with java and
spring you just create a rest controller
and then you give it a class and so this
is now my rest controller class and then
I can give it give it endpoints like
analyze and then I can associate that
endpoint with with a method like analyze
if I say slash analyze in my rest
service then I can it'll call the
identify chord by notes and you remember
we passed some notes to it so those
would be passed into this and and it's
very easy then to set up to stand up a
rest service and if I want to because
the the notes and the chords are
serialized over the wire between the
client and the and the rest service I
need to represent those and with spring
you can easily represent those with with
plain old Java objects pojos and so this
represents a musical chord where we have
the the root and the chord type and the
bass note and so you just do that and
then it automatically marshals that
serializes DC realises over the wire
with JSON or XML whichever one you
choose and then to make the app
executable then you use the spring boot
application annotation and then and then
you have your application and then you
just say spring application run and then
you give it the name of you
or spring good application and then it
and then to to deploy it in Cloud
Foundry it's just two steps you know my
whole development cycle is two steps you
just do a maven clean install and then a
CF push and CF push pushes it into cloud
foundry cloud founder by the way can run
on top of AWS as you're now Google cloud
platform so you just you're just putting
it in you know pushing it to one cloud
platform and not having to worry about
the underlaying
ia yes so so that I'll end with this
demonstrating the court analyzer client
so that that was a separate micro
service member over there on the right
and and so as I play I'm gonna play on
this this instrument and as I play the
notes that you see are going to be from
locally from this instrument the chords
that you see are going to be after those
notes have been sent to that second
micro service and then back and identify
it and I'm running it through my my
phone hotspot so should be pretty good
pretty good response time and even
though it's running through a personal
hotspot and it is running in a cloud in
the eastern side of the United States
right now we should see a still see a
pretty good response time so to
demonstrate that I'm going to I'm going
to place a Bach Prelude in C and see if
I can do it without butchering it too
bad here oh we have that's okay that's I
need to turn that off there we go
that would help
so anyway as I as I play chords
notice that as I'm playing them then
it's playing it's showing them the the
actual chords that are represented
so anyway that's my presentation but
that's in a nutshell composing music in
the cloud thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
