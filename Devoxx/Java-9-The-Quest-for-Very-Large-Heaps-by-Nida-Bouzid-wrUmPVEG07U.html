the box today's 2017 when it comes to
running Java applications on very large
heaps the release of Java 9 probably
brings the most impressive improvement
ever it would be possible to operate
heaps of terabytes and more and in this
session I'd like to tell you how that
happened
my name is Neda I'm leading the
technical team of Activia in the APAC
region our R&amp;amp;D teams based in New York
and Paris are building a product called
active pivot activity what is an
in-memory analytical platform fully
written in Java
I'm here with Han Wang let's introduce
yourself hi all my name is Han Wing I'm
a senior consultant with Activision
based in Singapore so the improvements
to Java 9 that both NIDA and myself are
going to review today our result of a
partnership between the Java team at
Oracle and active in Oracle and active
we have met at the end of 2014 when a
common client of our one over one of the
common client of ours put us in contact
and true as a challenge can we run
active field application on a chair on a
JVM with more than 10 terabyte of heap
size for this purpose a joint II was
created and we built a prototype credit
risk application running on oracle m7
with 16 terabyte of RAM the initial
result of our work was presented at
JavaOne 2015 where drew a lot of
attention as a result the net reverse
that the vice president of software
development for Java decided to
strengthen the partnership engineers
from both the company Oracle a and
Activision started to work together to
improve garbage collection targeting
large skills complicate large-scale
applications
Camas shuttle from the jvm team is in
charge and today at Vox Dei 2017 we are
really talking about his work work which
all of us will soon benefit when Java 9
is released at the second half of 2017
you know that's a very exciting
collaboration indeed this multi terabyte
active - what application on ranked
mentioned and we have presented the year
ago has become the reference use cases
for the JVM engineers working on the
support of large heaps and that we that
will be our baseline for the result we
will present to you today just to
introduce the use case we were focusing
on it was related to what we call a
credit risk most of our clients are
banks and credit risk type of
application will require a huge set of
data credit risk is no more than for
Bank evaluating in short evaluating the
amount that the bank is going to lose if
one of the country part is defaulting to
do that you need to do a lot of
simulations actually we consume those
activity what is consuming those
simulations from the risk engines that
the bank has you do thousands of
simulations in the future point time and
then on every point you do the
evaluation of your portfolios and
positions this is how it works so this
requires terra's of data to be
aggregated so this is why that use case
was really relevant to challenge the JVM
on large heat so let's see our agenda
today first of all I'd like to share
with you our view of the in-memory
computing in the Java world and why it
matters then we'll share our experience
of writing Java code that runs well on
terabytes of memory but as soon as
possible we get into the heart of
matter for this presentation the
improvement made for the Java nine that
bring that have been made to the garbage
collection to unleash large memory
applications so how important is this
in-memory computing story does it
deserve all the hype after all the idea
of the CPU loading data in memory has
been around since the beginning of
computer science but in the past what we
were doing is like loading chunk of data
in the memory between the 80s and today
the price of memory has been divided by
1 million at that time no one could
imagine loading the whole set of data
that an application needs in the memory
but today almost everyone can do it it's
not even an investment with a snap of a
finger you can go for instance to Amazon
Web Services and get an x1 instance X
one instance has 2 terabytes of RAM so
all the data technology we learned now
exists in memory maybe you're familiar
with some of them sequel databases such
as vault DB would record transaction
faster s AP Hana will do execute will
execute analytical sequel queries faster
key value store such as Reddy's hazel
caste oracle coherence will have access
to the element faster and finally apache
spark speeds up big data batch
processing but storing intermediate
results in memory so everything you
could do before you can do it now faster
but is that the end of it we don't think
so
all businesses have their rules and
formulas to quantify how well they run
most businesses run run those
calculations once a month or once a week
in spreadsheets before the board meeting
but what will happen for those
businesses when they realize that they
can run all those calculations every
time on live data and anytime all the
time the in memory computing will not
merely accelerate the practices but it
will transform the way we do business so
let me give you a few examples as I
mentioned for the financial for the
financial institutions the bank they can
have this type of application like
credit risk application running all the
time on their portfolios evaluating the
risks so this will give an insight for
the traders for the sales to take
decisions on the spot no need to wait
for the batch to run overnight and to
take the decision today after remember
what happened in 2008 when Lehman
defaulted or the financial industry
we're in crisis and everybody wanted to
evaluate what is my loss
for the e-commerce marketing teams and
retailers are in charge of putting the
right right price on the products but
those prices they depend on the stock
level time of the year the price of the
competition so what will happen if you
have everything loaded in memory and you
can in a dynamic way adapt those prices
according to what the competition is
doing by doing so you enter the dynamic
pricing era and I'm pretty sure this is
what companies like Lozada will do when
Amazon will be with certain Singapore
because without doing so you will lose
the battle last example is related to
the supply chain
say you have just giving you like a real
example that we leave some of us lived
here in Singapore sudden weather change
he is coming to Singapore and you're
running everybody is running short of
his mask so if you have the ability to
order or to reroute some stocks of masks
in the region and then bring them to
Singapore and take the decision right
now that will help you can also do
simulation say what if tomorrow there is
a haze am i able to bring masks for the
whole population so this is something
that could be that could become critical
actually there are many more striking
example that they can bring from our
clients use cases but here we're talking
about technology so what type of
technology that we can use to write a
solution that is performance when we
start writing the product ten years ago
the shortlisted languages we we were
looking at we're C++ and Java I know
that song will suggest from other
languages so let's keep this for the Q&amp;amp;A
session by choosing Java we wanted the
language that runs everywhere there is
versatile safe allow us to extend it
easily to implement use cases in an easy
fashion with a huge community for
instance Java I'm going to estimate the
number of users developers using Java
like 20 million developers so huge
community and then a language that allow
us to do complex calculation because
here we're talking about SaaS
we're talking about sometimes nonlinear
aggregation we're not doing just simple
click count that we can achieve with
sequence so we're more close to high
performance computing type of
use case then sequel use cases so this
is why we picked up Java and we don't
regret it we're really happy with that
choice so now that the stage is set
let me tell you more the effort we did
in the RNG and I will try to summarize
ten years of RNG effort in in two three
slides so first of all to run Java on a
huge memory we start by controlling the
memory by controlling the memory I mean
we start storing some part of the memory
of heap for the use case we mentioned
earlier of the 16 terabyte we had three
terabytes
sort on heap and the rest was off heap
of course that removes some pressure
from the garbage collection this is why
some of the solutions running on a huge
set of memory written in Java they use
this of heat technique also some of our
internal structures like the culinary
that abases are also sort of heap
although basically all the primitives
are sort of heap also to control this
memory allocation we do some system
calls like n map and we implemented our
own malloc that fits our allocation
pattern the second part was related to
parallel programming for that we used
all the known tricks like for join pool
block three data structures to minimize
the contentions and we introduced the
design where we were partitioning our
data to align it along the course
more than that we control where the
allocation happened as you know the big
servers nowadays they have what we call
one uniform memory architecture Numa so
what we do is we control where every
processor is allocating the memory we
try to stay in what we call the same new
man owed and we avoid communicating
across nodes because if one thread is
getting the memory is getting the data
from another new man owed will degrade
the performance
don't forget our engine is running fully
in memory by doing so we maximize the
memory bandwidth so I'm realizing is
that I'm just summarizing a lot of
concepts in in just a short time so if
you're interested to see all the efforts
we did to run our Java engine on a huge
memory set like this of heap how we did
the call to the how we allocated the
memory of heap the the call and how we
where Numa how we coded our software to
be Numa aware I invite you to look at
either JavaOne conference 2015 where
we're presenting that or for those who
are in Singapore there is engineered SG
where we're doing a talk one year ago
so let's talk a bit about the garbage
collection now thank you
so basically what was Chet just now is
just some other techniques that active
VM has applied application coding wise
how we actually managed to build an
application on running on large heap of
memory but of course the in terms of
coding it can goes you can only go so
much as how the platform can support it
and that is where the g1 GC comes into
the picture so when I talk when we talk
about G 1 GC it basically up until 2015
it has not really been tested on very
large ships
and when I say very light ships I mean
one terabyte of heap or more of course
that was the goal of the JVM team but it
is more for the longer term however with
the rise of in-memory computing that the
media has just mentioned it has made a
strong case for improving the g1 GC even
further and of course this helped to
reprioritize the improvement to the
process to improve it now we mentioned
about the prototype that we built the
credit risk application now this
application has been used by the JVM
team as a benchmark application as well
as to reveal some of the shortcomings
with the g1 GC and ultimately it is used
to tackle those shortcomings as well but
the story of G 1 GC started even before
that so let me try to put things into
perspective for you guys garbage
collection in Java has the most impact
on overall application performance that
is how important it is that Java
applications have been growing faster
than GC could adapt application nowadays
they use more memory they allocate more
objects from more and more traps and the
amount of time that an application must
pause to allow the JVM to perform the GC
has become somewhat unacceptable so with
the previous GC strategies that was
employed the post time will actually
proportionate to the size of the heap
that's why they are actually obsolete by
today and it has been replaced by
techniques that make use of what we have
today which is larger memory and of
course multi-core processors
the g1 you see architecture represents
this renewal review and you see the hip
is divided into regions that can be
processed in parallel and each of these
regions can be assigned a specific
policy one for new objects at another
for long living objects for example you
bear in mind that g1 GC has been in the
works for years it has been available
since Java 7 but it is only reaching its
maturity now it comes to a sudden I mean
it may become the default garbage
collector for Java 9 ok Before we jump
into the improvement that was made in
for the g1 GC let us just let me just
give you guys a brief overview on how G
1 GC actually works in a real
application so as I mentioned g1 GC
divides the hip into regions of equal
size and memory management is actually
done at the level of these regions
itself so when it java application runs
the tread will instantiate new objects
and some of the regions are used to
allocate these new objects the regions
are what is known as the young
generation so basically here monie
objects are created and then the young
generation will just continue to grow
and grow until it is full at which find
the G 1 GC will stop the application
wakes up the garbage collection thread
and it will proceed to clean up the
young generation
most of the objects allocated by the
application are used for a short time so
statistically speaking when the
collection begins only a small fraction
of these objects are still alive so what
do you want you see does is that it will
locate these objects which are still
alive and they will be evacuated to
other regions leaving only garbage in
the region of origin that can be cleaned
up do note that all this must go
extremely fast because I must like I
can't stress this enough because it is
actually a stop the world application
which means application is just stopped
while the young collection is happening
so what was noted is is that this young
collection is not performing as as fast
as we would like it it's not just simply
not fast enough so in a moment Nina will
share with you the specifics on why it
is not fast enough and what was done to
improve it the object that will survive
will be evacuated into other regions
which is referred to as the survival
region and technically speaking the
survival regions to belongs to the young
generation so when the next young
collection happened and if they are
still objects the life in these regions
they will be evacuated again so this
will happen for I mean the IVA equation
during young collection will happen for
a few times until it I mean what I mean
is after has been evacuated for a few
times these objects will be promoted
into the old region now basically in the
origins these objects will not be evac
you will not be collected it will it
will not be collected during the young
collections the idea here is that once
it has reached the younger or the old
generation it will stay alive for a long
time and the continuous process of
evacuating them into a new regions we
actually degrade the performance further
so here what happened next the
application will go on like this while
there is still free memory left through
a series of young only collections of
course the old generation will continue
to grow until it comes to a certain
point that you know it will reach a
certain threshold that it tells the g1
hey you bet you guys better be looking
at the origins as well now this is ready
the interesting happens interesting
stuff happens basically g1 cannot
brutally clean the OL region inside to
stop the world pause it is just it may
pause the application for just too long
so instead what you and you see does is
that it tries to do as much as possible
while the application is still running
first you will need to mark the objects
that are still alive in the OL regions
and collect statistics about which
origins contain the most garbage you
will then need to select a number of
those regions and collect it together
with young regions in what is called the
mixed collection which is basically the
last phase in the gray dirt boss so what
you see here is just some other phases
involved in g1 GC and it will actually
move to SD what is required the mixed
collection and on a side note I'm sure
most of you already know this but G 1 GC
deals with garbage first and that is how
the name comes from garbage firs is
shortened into g1 but as I say I'm sure
most of you would already know this so
next the mocking face it will take a
while but note that it is done
concurrently while the application is
still running so
well the marking is proceeding there may
be young several young only collections
in the middle so basically as you can
see from the slide here concurrent
marking is the safe is below and in
between as I mentioned there may be
several young collections
now when the concurrent marking is done
there is a stop the world pass which is
called the remark this is to help the
completion of marking and to ensure that
all the objects that they have located
all the life objects within the origin
including those objects which were
created by the young collection in the
middle and then there is the collection
the statistic collection phase now again
this is run concurrently with the
application here
what g1g see does is that it collects
statistics about how full each of the
regions are after this statistic
collection there will be another phase
which is a stop the world process which
is called a cleanup and then it goes to
one last young only collection the
purpose of this phase is to free up as
much space as possible in anticipation
for the upcoming mixed collection now
finally we have reached the this is
where the mixed collection can begin
here G 1 G C will evacuate and collect
the young regions as well as a set of
all regions that it has identified this
process is going to happen for a few
times until all the old region that G
ones that although all regions that you
want wants to collect a process and at
which point we are back to square one
now I like you guys to actually take a
short pause try to digest the phases
here as much as possible because okay
pay special attention to the young
collection as well as the concurrent
marking because next NIDA is going to
share with you some of the specifics as
to what are the improvement done to
these two phases neither
thank you okay now that you have an
overview on how g1 works what we notice
it when we're playing with our
application is that some part of the g1
scale pretty well but some part not that
much last year when we were
collaborating with Oracle on our use
case we started on static set of data
and we were stressing that set of data
by firing short queries and then other
queries that require a lot of
aggregation what you see in this
benchmark like for the short query the
average post duration is around 5
seconds but for the order but for the
other use cases that sometimes the post
is close to 30 seconds however we never
hit what we call the full GC which for
this type for this size of memory almost
means game over but the idea is this
scale pretty well but we are not happy
with those poses that are close to 30
seconds because remember the use case we
address is an interactive application we
want things to run smoothly when you
fire query to have something that runs
in almost few seconds by having 30
seconds of pause then our clients won't
be happy being in contact with the JVM
engineers we start looking at the first
phase that Han ranked mentioned which is
called young collection since for this
use case we didn't change the data set
we were working on which means the data
set is already in the origin the origin
won't change much so what led us to
those
poses those 30 seconds plus poses are
only related to the young collections so
this is what we start doing is focusing
on the young collections so how does the
young collect collection work from their
internal so usually the GC threads start
looking at their stack and then they
start from the root object and then they
follow the outgoing references and every
time you find the live object you
evacuate it however when one reference
bring another reference and so on so
what the thread need is to store what
they do is they store the references in
their public buffer when the public
buffer is full they store the references
in the private buffer by having of the
references in the private in the public
buffer we enhance the work balance
because sometimes when the thread is
working on its private buffer if the
public buffer is full other idle threads
who did finish their job of evacuating
they can do what we call work stealing
so this is a common pattern that you
find in the fork/join pool pool for
instance to to have a good work balance
but the thing we notice it here that
could be enhanced is that some threads
get flooded they get flooded when they
were processing a large object arrays
which bring a lot a ton of references by
having those huge number of references
in the buffer they keep looking at them
trying to evacuate them the public
buffer remains empty and then you have
only one thread working for instance
focusing on its private buffer trying to
evacuate the object and all the threads
who finished their job they're looking
at the only thread which working who is
working they're trying to finish this
young collection so maybe you notice it
such behavior when you sometimes look at
them the thread dump and you see only
one thread is working and other threads
are all idle so then there is an
enhancement that could be done which is
working on the cause of references
flooding so instead of copying all those
references coming from large object
arrays what the JVM engineers that
Oracle did is to follow just to copy the
reference of the thread or focus process
those large object arrays by chunks also
when thread is focusing on its private
buffer from time to time that thread
will fill its public buffer so
authorises over idle thread will come
and help by doing those two enhancements
reach the following benchmark so as you
can see in blue those are the new pauses
after those enhancement that has been
done on the young collection I'd like to
highlight the one in the middle which
were happy with because we divided by
sometimes like five to twenty times we
were five to twenty times shorter in
this young collection phase and this for
interactive applications applications it
everything that was the first
improvement that has been made so on the
young collections
however activity what being an
interactive tool that is able to ingest
data that comes along the way during the
intraday that means that we are not our
tool is not a read-only tool even if
that use case was in a read-only mode
focusing on static set of data what we
wanted to do is reshuffle and refresh
the data that is stored in our database
while doing the GC and that didn't
happen well so that was a disaster one
year ago because the phase that is the
concurrent marketing phase we're
spending too much time there then we
were not able to do the mixed collection
and then the old gen get full and then
you kill and then you hit the full GC
and then the game is over so something
has to be done on the improving mix it
collections that is probably the most
important important improvement that has
been made on g1 for the java knife so
let's have a look actually we did two
improvements if you remember well when
we do before doing the mixed collection
we have to do the marking there is the
marking phase that happens in parallel
with the application for that marking
phase you need marking threads the
marking thread they work same as the the
GC threads
however instead of evacuating objects
they just mark them for then for the
later on mixed collection so same we
start from the root object and then we
follow and then if there is any live
thread sorry any live reference live
object we will mark it the way this
works in the internals of the JVM talks
as follows
actually you have a sub sampling of the
Java heap and then every 500 bit of the
Java heap has you have now said that you
have a bitmap index for every thread and
then if there is a live object in that
portion of 500 bits you set the bit to 1
so every GC every marking thread has a
bitmap index that will just index the
regions that have live objects that
works well when you have few marking
threads but on a huge application you
need hundreds of marking threads and the
fact that you have a bitmap index per
thread that was a disaster
because that bitmap was waiting
sometimes a few tera and that didn't
work what the JVM engineers did is
instead of having one bitmap per thread
they totally change at this part and
then you have one common bitmap in a
lock free type of structure for that
they used compare and swap casts if
you're familiar with that and then all
the threads can access to that bitmap
instead of having one bitmap per thread
and then at the end you have to merge it
now you have just one so that was the
first thing that has been made for
improving the mixed collections the next
thing that has been enhanced is related
to the work balance what they notice it
for the marking thread is that they have
their private buffer but they also have
a shared structure where those thread
they can store the reference and then
the other threads may help
however this structure was guarded by
only one global lock so only one thread
at the time can access there so then
from that they move to a lock free
structure to enhance the work balance
and minimize the contention with those
two improvements or the make
collections we'll be able to move 250
times having a marking 50 times faster
than before as you can see here we have
side by side they read only so that was
the one related only to the young
collection and then the read and write
and for the read and write what we were
doing we were adding we were changing
one terabyte of data so behind you have
a process that is bringing in new data
into the system removing the old data so
there is some resources that allocated
to refresh the data plus answering the
queries so this is what we had if you
put side by side the return write read
and write and the read-only you notice
that we have less than 50% in term of
scaling so that means that the marking
collection and the mixed collection they
were working well remember before I told
you that this didn't work at all
so with this last benchmark reaching the
conclusion of this talk let's focus on
some takeaways actually with the afford
that has been done on the collaboration
that has been done between us and the
guys who are writing the the JVM and the
garbage collection algorithm we didn't
change the philosophy of the g1 GC what
we did here is some engineering and this
engineering that has been done you will
find it it will be for everybody you'll
find it in the open JDK you will find it
on the hotspot when it will be released
in 50 days and Thomas charger the guy
who oversees this work told us that
during the lifespan of the JDK 9 what he
expect is to reduce those pauses in 1
second or less on a huge set of memories
so if that happens you will probably see
us again on stage to talk to you about
that
one of other conclusion let me try to
just wrap things up for you guys
what NIDA and I have actually done is
that we shared with you guys some
information about a rise of in-memory
computing we share with you guys some of
the techniques that active vm has used
on how to build an application that runs
on large heap of memory and then we
presented just a brief overview on how
gon GC works and most importantly the
improvement enhancements that was done
on G 1 GC which would be available in
java 9 for you guys and as just a final
reminder if you guys just visit the site
of java 9 countdown you will see that
Java 9 will be available for all of you
in 54 days so thanks thank you generally
last hour I demanding applications
using the lights if we have to activate
the license our business
the Heidemann team in America that
really cannot live for that have been
done on the g1 for drinking on the to
minimize law school that person who is
in the license plate 3.8 a pastime into
a a for example nice Gators in a 91
website where the boss man is not a
retard in that game of the we deal with
elections actually the approach is like
for any here what sort of the bottom I'm
having full in my calculation or XO
how're you whatever thought for the
fourth is to create for what the model
what we call that alone that you want to
save on basic term contract and then
we'll see where the both happens does it
happened in the pleasure does it happen
to Nick collection and you have removing
object
you know you look at this he said the
art I'd make you have to know the
default patterns you have to make every
size the region there are many ways of
tuning kijima on the JVM zero that has
been promised
even before litigate seven eight and now
we do you want to see that is gaining
like a attention in the gentleman answer
after the fortune and sense we're in the
bottle
Neverland most of the deflating when the
company would we would start the
application but they usually put this
politely that will be later stopped the
world kind of hard to animate so so I
think what the question is are you you
did you lucky we have a reward unity is
that variable any confirm performance
improvement just by switching to
geography
so what get relegated on someone is
pretty good
greenish and haunting just for vacation
and running that also chips chips Tyler
so for the world to try to anything it
will be you will notice be performance
improvement immediately actually from
you when you route in Georgian see the
travel is returned on some blog if we
will tell you don't you anything or not
uses allergies there the fourth like
others you can talk to you some chili
project it what there any which is the
initial maple community presented this
you can load before you are like
certifies them or the other gt40
emergencies because adaptive so you can
choose that and bring the down for
instance for our application were made
with that you see how the previous hope
you have maybe 20 slacks that you added
the behavior didn't use it and it it so
we had to lower the frequency so as far
as we have
and he occupies attendance and we start
the market we produce at the market you
have some other matrix where we can say
I'm expecting their collection to happen
in this maps full time so you have any
class kindig Evonik as they continue
song has some good references on object
and all that but the idea is you have
more applications you have to know where
is the bottleneck and you have trouble
working with of the neck in the garbage
collection part refused parallel all the
runs EMF or even that you want to was
saying that you want the general ballot
that will solve our model you have
related for application g1 as well can
be - oh yes this is our email and
services how from good
under the ground or
because men are like you like to see
you mean this one biggest like with this
one
without me I'll believe you
what you see here yeah but so the world
of the means of the world forever can be
something work for us for a dream or not
but when we say this is the way to our
city is working they do the operation
episode the world that you can be
stopped like there is only other words
with exposing the application as you
know to do the collection you have to
meet your threads have to be the same
one
sometimes the first local train station
to the collection you cannot the only
thing roughly that you can do in
parallel application in the current
working all day over you have to be a
small opening of course if you're a huge
that's what you know
beauty ephemeral then we had when we
have thought for 30 seconds for the
election before stop to be a communist
that's particular to money quick wins
for us especially for the Navy
hand-forged aiming at achieving so much
yes you get something you get soon as
whether it is important to serve also
prohibit by this what you have like a
ratio from the debatable trends that
will be allocated to the marking ratio
from the various will be allocated to
garbage collection to fortune you have
to know because - mark that was in sport
parameter like an issue he represent the
number of bread for marking the number
thread for placing a hepatic and first
president after the group identify a
method do you think
and even lately and we have various did
I gave you our product Center were army
women were not to collaborate with
warble but you cannot write or porcelain
and wrote over what a doula do laser is
twisting on sun microsystems they did
their from jpn which is the form of the
hotspot and they have TV encoding they
have their data collection of all it's
called people we get the other it folded
when we desert alone in 2015 wearable is
where like a in second for hot spot they
were milliseconds rather adult went to
be voted country favorite games people
however what we notice is that when we
were finding the query very well and if
the response timeless world was better
with hot spot why because assume is
using maybe density system the CPU power
because this polymer is no magic don't
believe in magical there is something
that is having
there's a poll if you have a bullet like
you keep doing himself and this is what
they get to try to do and we're but a
little so they're improving that and I
think at the end of the day there's a to
be happy
pickle barrel again so that wasn't a
question that when you have his heart
Brixton in traffic you use normal Pig by
burning a cross to the humid area to
commit I'm an authority figure it not on
a normal but it isn't we have had his
time in our talking life would you say
behind a mysterious power center of your
life don't ever get permission to market
right they know we're eating with some
people it's the you deep inside I can
find with that but yeah doesn't matter
it does matter for the ratification i
canna get the signal go back and I can
do what we did I can do that but there
is again for this you know in hand like
you helped state come all the voices one
actually when we are testing this one on
the Solaris but we just
very matter is the optimum collection
land around an organization is trying to
eat a line such that initially is coming
it is not committed fully it is a very
precise but after immediate after every
collection it is not increment the
generation sentence so my concern is
after doing that increment after
collection happens is the daily amount
that we have more than enough memory but
it means to generate the proper
algorithm we just use those that memory
back to voice animation it does not
increase in size whatever if you keep a
lot of Technology and in a fixed
allocate ji as a drum what the geodesy
does is have explicit cleaning up into
regions of the precise
no one generation have those documents
localizable just evacuation in six
objects you just feel like putting into
other areas so by filling this ceramic
right xn and XM x before Natick right so
actually expect MX and estimate is just
for the yolk initial allocation and
usually size not send them to the same
value pairs in the best practical that
especially if you know that you ship
something close estimate total second
105 open and most Eagle ranked wherever
and then she want me to break me what
women said evaporating me I move the
objects from one region to another
region and then do what we want
compaction actually the first time in
the garbage collection but we're doing
incremental compaction before we were
like if you're used to cereal or all
share type of entity you are stopping
everything and then let's do the
compaction here the compaction will
happen incrementally
this is quite unique this mixed
collection this is unique honestly this
is forward to the g1 so incremental II
you can produce there's the compaction
without harming the application because
the evening the Fuji C would be a bad
experience forever
definitely and every time you keep
moving on okay
those region so I put everything I have
a greater fish in this region and then I
go back to nightly sometimes one of the
page will still operate is like all this
region in Port Phillip remission I clean
it okay to have all the mechanics one
the fact that everything is regionalised
makes the work easier before I am at the
region I don't have to be going to use
you can have a bit of shell here between
come here come here before long time ago
everything had to the quantities for
some JDM so let's bring profitability
Jiwon is really something that will
change the life of someone who used to
open application that was suffering over
from the Kitsch action
Rizal okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
