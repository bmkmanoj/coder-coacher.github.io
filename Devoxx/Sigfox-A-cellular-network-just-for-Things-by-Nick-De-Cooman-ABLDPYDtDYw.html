you very much for being here for
spending your lunch here to learn about
sayfox my name is nick de Kumon
I'm IT solution architect for in the
pocket we are a mobile and IOT agency
based in guns so just to be clear I'm
not working at sig folks I'm not
involved in any of their activities I'm
just an early believer and I hope to
make a believer from you as well by the
end of this presentation let me get
started with a simple question the
Internet of Things we all know it's
definition is the fact that soon all
devices near us will be connected will
be connected with each other with the
internet but the question I have is the
following how are these things going to
be connected which technologies are we
going to use to establish that all these
devices are going to be connected
connected to each other connected to the
Internet to answer this question let's
take one step back and see which
solutions currents IOT applications use
how is it that they achieve connectivity
and what are they
limitations the first group of devices
that we can identify is what they call
smart home devices devices like the home
at the nest thermostat Philips you and
at the right you see the Luna smart
mattress which is a mattress capable of
tracking your sleeping pattern these
devices they're all situated in your
home they are connected to the
electricity grid so they don't really
need I mean energy consumption is not
really an issue here and most likely
they are also not going to be moved
around often so these devices they sit
in your home and the best way obviously
to connect them is to have Wi-Fi
connected to all these devices here the
use Wi-Fi to connect to each other to
connect to the internet and obviously
that makes a lot of sense second group
of devices are the more portable things
things like a SmartWatch or a variable
or ibeacon or this style thing which is
some sort of activity tracker devices
like this these are categorized by the
fact that they are compacts they run on
usually a small battery and so therefore
for this power consumption for them is
super super important finally most
likely they are also going to make use
of short-range communication and so
therefore for these devices Bluetooth is
best fit bluetooth is being used just to
broadcast the data all the way to your
smartphone and then your smartphone is
going to take care of it himself so up
till now we saw two distinct groups of
devices on the one hand the smart
devices with the Wi-Fi on the other hand
more portable devices running on
Bluetooth obviously if you think about
the inside of things we can envision far
more applications and devices devices
like for instance your car that you want
to lock and unlock remotely or for
instance this smart trashcan city of
Brussels for instance both 30 of them
and this trashcan is capable of sending
a notification when it is full and needs
to be empty so all these devices they
are quite different from the ones that
we just saw they are not inside your
home they're probably somewhere outside
and they do require a strong
connectivity so they need to have direct
access to the cloud how does it solve
today well all these devices they have
actually a SIM card inside so they use
3G and 4G to have connectivity today but
you feel that this is not ideal
I mean 3G 4G it's often quite expensive
especially for these use cases they also
rely on the local telecom provider and
the Deaf are not very scalable
so even though these solutions today
make use of 3G 4G to reach connectivity
this solution is not very ideal so if
you compare these different types of
connectivity you can basically see two
groups of them on the one hand you have
Wi-Fi 4G 3G both offer strong
connectivity meaning that they have
direct access to the Internet data
package that they can send our rich so
they can be videos they can be photos
very rich data but there this
implication is that they consume high
power so they they have a high power
consumption on the other hand you see
bluetooth bluetooth is short-range
communication it's soft connectivity so
you don't reach the internet with it but
the data packages that are being sent
with these they are small and therefore
they only consume low power so this is
already ok for the groups that we just
saw but as I said before if you think
about all the devices that we will have
in the internet-of-things era everyday
devices then we see that both are not
really ideal for us we need like a
combination so what we exactly need is
is the following on the one hand we need
strong connectivity we need these
devices to be directly connected to the
Internet so strong connectivity data
packages they can be small we don't
necessarily need to send videos and
images what we only want to send this
small data like status updates or or
some sort of coordinates that's that's
more than enough for these devices and
as these devices are usually not
connected to the electricity grid we
want them to have low power consumption
so it's important that we reduce the
energy consumption as much as possible
music Vox sig Foxx is a cellular network
especially dedicated to connect things
that we will see in the internal things
error it offers strong connectivity
so it offers direct access to the
Internet it allows very tiny data
package to be sent power consumption is
low and for those reasons seefox is
significantly cheaper than other
solutions then 3g and 4g for instance so
this makes cfox ideal to connect
everyday things to the internet a little
bit of background about cig fox say fox
is French based company it's based near
toulouse it was already founded in 2009
it has 80 employees and only the
beginning of this year it received a
funding round round of 150 million euros
to explain how this works we go back to
this smart trashcan so in the other
slide this trash can we assume that it
used 3G 4G to connect to the cloud this
is let's say trashcan 2.0 that we use a
sick fox module 4 so this trashcan will
notify that when it's full using sick
box and to do this it needs to have a
sip Fox ready
module and you have to see this on like
a Bluetooth module for instance well
instead now it needs to have a sick fox
module this sea fox module is capable of
sending seefox messages and each of
these message is automatically
authenticated using a hashing mechanism
using a private key specific for each
device so this device then emits these
messages in the available frequency band
and then you have some sick fox base
station and these base stations they
listen for all the sick fox messages
that they receive and note that there is
no negotiation necessary between the
device and the sick fox base station so
there's no handshaking message can
simply be something received so as soon
as this base station
thieves the message it will forward this
message to the sick Fox cloud so the
base station is connected to the
Internet the message is forwarded to the
sick fox cloud and from there it is
being pushed again to your dedicated
cloud using HTTP callbacks or sick fox
also provides an API which you can then
use to retrieve your messages from once
the message is in your class you can
obviously do whatever you want with it
you can react accordingly and and
process the message and show it in your
application so just it's very sure to
flow you have device having a sick folks
ready module it sends messages that are
being received by the sick folks
base stations sick fox base stations is
connected to the Internet from there the
message is being sent to your dedicated
cloud to give you an idea about these
base stations base station can receive 1
million messages a day and for instance
to cover entire France only 1200 of
these base stations very necessary and
since in contrast to more than 50,000
stations to cover regular gsm solutions
so the range is a lot longer and that is
due to the underlying technology that is
being used for sip folks some numbers as
I said see Fox messages or tiny tiny
small in fact they only can carry 12
bytes of data to 12 bytes is not a lot
so therefore it's definitely not
intended for high bandwidth usage like
sending media or permanent broadcasting
but for many IOT applications many
everyday objects this is more than
enough also keep in mind that a
timestamp and a unique device ID is
already automatically sent so it's not
included in these 12 bytes so you don't
have to take care of this yourself
sending a message takes about 6 seconds
and due to mostly European regulations a
sick Fox enable device is only allowed
to send six messages an hour so if you
take a total on daily basis that means
that you can only send 140 messages a
day per device but again for most IOT
devices for most everyday object this is
more than enough sequence communication
is also be directional so it means it
goes in two ways you can send a message
from the device to your web service but
the web service can also push data back
to the device so it goes in both
directions now to make use of cfox
coverage is obviously required so you
have to have a base station nearby these
countries here are already fully covered
so we have France Spain the Netherlands
and more than 10 cities in the UK have
full sick Fox coverage and apart from
these you also have the city of Munich
watermelon and Dublin that are also
being covered currently being rolled out
is Belgium it was announced earlier this
year that Belgium would be covered by
the end of this year so any progress on
this is probably going to be announced
very soon other countries being rolled
out or Italy Portugal Luxembourg and
Denmark and just two weeks ago or so sig
Fox announced that 10 cities in the
United States will be covered including
San Francisco by early 2016 so it's
clear sig Fox is being rolled out at a
high pace more and more cities are being
covered and it is showed that in two to
three years most of Western Europe and
probably most large cities in the world
will have sig Fox coverage so with an
increase in coverage obviously more more
see Fox enabled products will arise and
I particularly like this product it is
called stick and track a
developed by Belgium company and it's
basically sort of asset tracker using
seefox to track your device or your
belongings
the battery is said to last for ten
years because it uses sayfox which is
very energy friendly and it's only in
pre-production phase so it will get more
sexy for sure but it's clear that
solutions like this will become more and
more important and will definitely make
use of sick folks for this how to get
started well it's very simple obviously
you need to be a an area that has sick
fox coverage you can them by adrenal
shield or a Raspberry Pi module like the
ones up here the first one for instance
cost about 75 years and with this shield
there also comes a subscription which
allows you to use sick fox for one year
so it is very simple to get started
visit definitely this website below the
sick fox website is not very friendly
but this page definitely gives a nice
overview on how to get started and which
models you can buy this brings me to the
end as we said the Internet of Things
will make all the devices connected on
one hand we will see smart home devices
that will benefit from our Wi-Fi network
on the other hand we will have Bluetooth
devices that will our short-range
intended but then others devices like
for instance the smart trashcan or your
your bike lock for instance these are
devices that can definitely benefit from
technology like seefox coverage is
growing rapidly you can buy modules to
try them yourself and if you have more
questions definitely don't hesitate to
hit me up on Twitter this was only very
brief introduction so definitely keep
your eyes on safe Fox and enjoy the rest
of the books thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
