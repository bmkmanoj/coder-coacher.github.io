so welcome to our talk okay the second
because we have an awesome first slide
with some draws from Russia
okay know where we're going welcome to
our talk our developer designer and the
data scientist walk into a bar so who
are we
so I'm Luca developer software architect
in Swisscom data in AI team I'm from
Switzerland and I almost have ten years
of experience with this field and I made
this team for almost about two years now
and my name is Arash I'm UX designer and
product designer in our team 10 years of
experience as well and I come from
Serbia and I'm Maxim I'm a data
scientist I've been in this team for two
years now in Swisscom I am French and
yeah so are we were talking about this
team about data and AI so we're within
Swiss come it's a fairly new team we
have developers DevOps there are
scientists designers testers product
managers
we're very multicultural as you can see
on this map with more than over 50
nationalities and many languages as well
and we're spread across Switzerland well
three offices one in Lausanne one in
Bern one in Zurich all this make us
makes us say that we are probably the
most diverse team well in Swiss come we
haven't verified this but we're pretty
sure of it and if you are here this
morning at the keynote talk you know how
important this is for building awesome
software
yeah also another stuff that it's pretty
rare 90 is that our two managers are
ladies so this is really uncommon in in
IIT usually and so I'm really interested
in this topic that's why I pick up this
topic this talk with these two guys and
so actually is after working together
for more than one year we discover some
patterns that we tried to analyze and
refine for a better collaboration in our
team and so yes the topic would be the
magic recipe of how to build products
but unfortunately we cannot provide you
one instead we can provide quite a few
tips yeah so these tips really rely on
your team and actually first of all
let's start with our management tip I
really like these quotes and also our
bosses salami so that's why it's in our
slide so credo where to go and let them
figure it out so this is really our
spirit so the bosses just say which is
our goal and they trust the team and let
us figure it out so how it works in
reality first important thing is keep
team members as close as possible in the
same room whenever possible and now it
relates to the graph you saw previously
in our case we are spread over three
offices it's crucially important that we
meet occasionally for this purpose twice
a week we all go to burn from other
offices and then we sit together and
discuss of course we try to solve more
simple issues over Skype online but
whenever there is a smallest doubt that
one of us in the team doesn't figure out
or does not align with the rest we sit
and talk in person it's crucially
important
although this is era of a remote work
and online work online meeting should be
always a plan B because if you have
multicultural and multi-device team it's
sometimes hard to understand each other
and motives and drivers behind any of
decisions even when you sit together in
the same room so yeah let's do it in
person whenever you can
another tip that we want to provide to
you which is very important in our eyes
and we like to bring this back along
this talk which is that you need to
include everyone in each discussion at
every step of a product building so at
least one developer one-day descent is
someone designer in order to avoid bad
things that will prevent the product
from being good and useful for the user
in the end so now we're gonna start by
breaking things down and trying to do
battle one versus one so we start with
the differences are like the small
mistakes that we need to do between
developers and that we need to avoid
between developer and their scientists
here we're going to talk about theory
versus pragmatism so like we we think
there is a bit bit of both in these two
roles so usually the data scientist
they're like they're very good at
imagining like fancy moles are all like
state-of-the-art research that works
perfectly in an ideal world but then
furtively we're not in an ideal world
and so that's why
theory and on the other hand a very
pragmatic usually when it comes to to
actually coding like social code the end
result so the coding centers are much
lower than the ones to developers so
like the ideas is to move fast when it's
about coding so in this case it's more
pragmatic for example the project in me
like some Python scripts together with
some - some kind of stuff so for
developers so we have very pragmatic and
usually they teach us to structure
everything perfect and clean code and so
on but you have to actually figure it
out and find a trade-off between you and
scientist so actually first deep for the
scientific so stay down to earth when
you're designing your solution and don't
don't over thinking also try to imagine
that your solution or maybe your script
that you try for extracting some data
and so on but they can be reproducible
and maintainable also for the project
projects
my turn is the asset is to give some
tips for developers like also try to
stay down to earth when you imagine the
solution I mean we all try to work a
child so it's also what we want to do
when we build something but over
engineered the architecture of the
solution you don't need like abstraction
layers everywhere when you start
elevating so like you might you might
have like higher coding standards that
we do but sometimes it be too much so
like you will see that you can live even
if the code is not as perfect as you
would want it to be okay so talking
about code qualities so it's really
important here like I said before to
find the trade-off between the two roles
so between developers and data
scientists so we as that past developer
we can sit together and discuss with
data scientists they can learn a bit
from us but also the other side so and
talking about coding style I mean
because otherwise some stuff can happen
like this one the day before to go live
yep but then we can also discuss about
relationship between developer and
designer and why it is complicated so
this action we can call trendy colors
and wow effect because like designers as
most people think are good at proposing
great functionalities for the end users
that are totally out of reach not doable
or out of the budget yeah and usually
you have to do the dirty job and put
together the bank
with that design you know so okay we are
good at making things works and
achieving goal for meaning minimal
effort and cost reduction of course but
we need to also to find a trader a
trade-off with develop desires also
because maybe they designed something
completely impractical or and too
difficult to develop so first tip for
designers so you're designing experience
for the end user and not for your
portfolio so also keep in mind that
stuff and your job is not done when you
submit the design so there is also
feedback faced with developers and you
can submit a first draft and then you
can discuss with the developer see if
it's doable
yes/no and so on so also he here is
always talk and share your perspective
and say why you would like to design got
stuff like this instead of that
and then for note for developers is that
simple to use for you is not the simple
to use to our customers
which means yes designers can overdo
things at times be super creative but at
the same same time unrealistic but still
it's important to interact and discuss
what were the motives behind some
designs so then even if my design is not
doable let's sit and talk how we can
bring similar experience to our
customers instead just proclaiming hey
we cannot do this we don't have time I
will do it my way and and then user is
not happy with that
yeah so here is one real live example of
one recent projects right we had as
always release small port of time to
deliver this and it was a widget for
customer project application and there I
built like experience as I wanted it I
did a bit testing around the office and
then I came with proposal on the left to
Luca you know saying like hey can you
build this place thinking I put
one gradient one icon and round corners
and it's fine but then Luca told me yeah
I mean you can imagine I mean we usually
don't develop that's the publication or
but this is this this is a widget it's
route there is a gradient in it the
gradient rotate and also change color
because these three colors are the mood
of the conversation because behind the
results a system that is listening to be
how you call from a phone call
stop no you're scaring all the front end
he continued complaining I said okay
I'll build something with sharp edges
you know and actually like health day
later we both were quite happy with
proposal that was in the middle and
think okay problem solved and then all
of a sudden there was a customer hey my
new visual identity came from the agency
and this is our logo in circular so yes
I would prefer if this widget can be
round so the conclusion behind this
slide is yes although we managed to
align we're not the only stakeholders
and even if you hope for the best and
have understanding from your teammate it
doesn't mean that it will reflect to the
product to the end so yes at the end we
made this round shape whatever rotating
tink actually work and we're all happy
right yeah
and now let's move on to the last bulb
data scientists versus designer we're
gonna title this which is the world
title we're gonna title this but I can
offer you this instead it's about
discussion between both and what one can
learn from the other so in a sense that
the essence is very good dealing with
their edits what we do this our job and
we know what is doable with the data but
we sometimes like the like the
creativity to know what we could do that
is actually useful for the customer or
the end user because we can think about
plenty of things to do that are pretty
useless and this why it's a discussion
between both of us well like you can you
do this doe but I can you
but I can offer you this instead yes and
for designers same thing right designers
are good at proposing great
functionality for the end-users that are
totally out of reach not doable or out
of the budget meaning that if we work
separately on solving the problem we
won't get far and we won't impress our
customers therefore there is a tip that
as a designer I can get to data
scientists you might be passionate about
data but if you overdo it user will be
bored or overwhelmed be selective and
display only data that user really needs
and not all the data you can extract
right and in order to Det do that
properly ask a designer for help support
comment whatever right yeah and write it
for designers like you need to
collaborate and communicate with their
scientists I mean you want to know what
you can do with the data and this you
will not know by yourself so you need to
talk to each other that's only after
having communicating between each other
that you can really shape your ideas and
think about a solution that is both
doable and great for the end users with
features that will be useful for him yes
and in case of Swisscom internal search
which was the project where three of us
collaborated together we had project
owner from completely different
department of Swisscom and we had like I
don't know budget of five days to
complete
POC meaning that Maxine started earlier
before rest of us and he put out some
sort of layout where he displayed all
the data that he could find and extract
which was quite interesting for him but
when I saw it I was like whoa I mean how
can i prioritize information from this
slide and of course I did like some
really fine-tuning and kicking out all
the information that didn't make sense
to me and then when proposing my design
it turned out that those information had
sense to everybody else except for me so
the end result was putting back some of
those things that I thought were not
needed but also removing some of from
the first
posle sitting together we found the
perfect measurement and conclusion but
it was important to learn about each
other perspectives while while
delivering solution so last tips for
developers as you can see or like we
said this kind of stew practical we
communicate synchronously we don't have
to talk so force yourself to speak
sometimes and really you have to find
trade-off with data scientists and weak
designers so a useful skill that you
should have it be able to communicate
last team philosophy data scientists as
well like already said it but don't just
build them all I mean it's a great
excuse to just go do something else well
it will it's training but so yeah you
you know the data you're you have to
have a very central role in the shaping
the product in the end so you need to
communicate between you to others to
other roles and not just bilham oh also
after the mall is built you should also
make sure that it runs smoothly in
production so it's not just building mo
and for designers producing visuals is
just a small part of being a product
designer supporting other roles in your
team such as product owners developers
data scientists as equally as important
right so you have to focus on that one
as well and to use design thinking to
whole team and steer overall design
process which is not just on your screen
but also in workflow of whole team so
yet what happened when we all meet
together
just awesomeness but more seriously we
said at the beginning that we cannot
provide like magic recipe but we can
sell we have given you some tips but we
still share how we do it and then you
need to find out whether it works for
your team in your work environment and
to adapt it so when we have a new black
project product whatever always goal is
come like we want to solve the problem
and we have to discuss the problem to
really understand it so this is the like
these are discussions with the customer
the product manager you name it and the
three of us afterwards there's always a
part like that involves only the data
scientists about data exploration I mean
this part is mandatory in order to know
what it's doable out of the data because
even if you think about great
functionality that might be ideal for
solving the problem if the data is not
clean enough or if you don't find the
information data it's not gonna work
so you notice these two are in different
color because afterwards we start a
cycle so we iterate over like building
the product so once we really know the
problem and based on the data what we
can do we define the features we want to
we want to develop so this involves
mainly the three of us possibly also
customer impact measures but really the
ideas with we three like define what we
want to build and yes at this point I
start doing first wireframes and designs
and I heard the word feasible and what
is available so many times that I
immediately quit with some crazy ideas
but already start focusing my designs
and something that we can actually
produce under the circumstances
available data available budget and so
on at the same time Maxime is doing
model training or data scientist role
right and magic yes magic has if I sit
side by side so we save some time and
cut some corners and of course then when
well this is done I hand over
my work to Luca to developer but this is
not where my work in this phase five of
implementation ends instead yeah because
when we start implementation so we start
with just a few Babel or just a few
draft start iterating over it so the
first week of project we redefine
together all the features and so on and
what we want to display and then we
proceed with feedback internal feedback
before we tested because some errors
would be obvious and we want to make
them work before we approach with the
testing and therefore we do so at the
end that's it we end on this phase start
from phase three again and this is like
circular in this blue area and more or
less that's it from us thanks today you
should give your own microphone if it's
on if it's a question for developer
you'll have to yell yeah that's good
I can sorry because concentration
because you've got three distinct roles
how do you you have a safe word what I
mean by that is when you start doing the
other person's role do you do have some
way to communicate that so if if the
developer starts doing the Dennis
Lawrence's role and data Sciences for
all starts doing the designer all well
how do you start head you say stop now
that's my role when you're lying
I would say that roll is just you know
title in your CV or position but what we
discuss internally a lot is that when
you face the problem you have to be
realistic about what are your personal
capabilities and you just stand up and
say hey I'm going to cover that area you
know regardlessly what is my official
role but in the end it is not as not
much of a lap between the designer and
the two other roles I mean it's a bit
distinct so but like when we do work
together obviously if I train them all I
can also start like making run somewhere
and then at some point it's when when
the code is too early for him I hand it
over to him and it's always 12 in the
box and so on usually we work always on
projects that are a bit similar so we
it's pretty obvious for us what we how
we share the work but of course it can
happen I don't think it ever happened
really that we had to fight over
something thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
