thank you for coming I'm going to talk a
little bit about writing a good equals
method so who here has ever written an
equals method that's a lot of hands I
was kind of expecting that
how many people have tested an equals
method still a lot of hands how many
people did not like testing an equals
method yeah I figured I figured so I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
eCos method in Java what can go wrong
even if you have it auto generated by
your IDE and how you can easily test it
using equals verifier which is a
shameless plug something that I made I
made it about nine years ago it's been
going steady
ever since during my day job I also work
in the Netherlands for a company called
code star where I write mostly Scala
code so I guess that makes me one of
those rare people who do Scala for work
and Java in their spare time so I
already went over a little bit what we
are going to talk about so the final
thing that I should show you before we
really start is the running example
everybody who has written who has read
Joshua blocks effective Java will know
the point example it's just a simple
Java class okay so what does a good
equals method have to do well there's
five rules that it has to follow they
seem simple enough the first one means
that an object is always equal to itself
that that's that's obvious right
the second one is that it shouldn't
matter in which order you call the the
eCos method on two objects the third one
transitivity means that if you have a
bunch of objects that are all the same
and you have one that is equal to one of
those then that object is also equal to
all of the other ones that are equal to
it
that's what transitivity means also it
would come in very handy if you call
equals multiple times that you get the
same result every time otherwise it
would become very unpredictable and
unusable and the final one is more about
housekeeping and it says that an object
can never be equal to now so how can you
test this I many projects many Java
projects before and because I write this
equals verifier tool I'm always curious
if people use it when I join a new
project turns out sometimes they do but
mostly they don't but they do often try
to test the equals method and I
basically see three kinds of equals
tests in projects the first one is
actually no tests because people think
you know the the IDE generated it for me
so it's it should be ok right
why do I have to test it the second form
is where people will make one test for
each of those cases but then often I see
that they choose examples in their tests
that don't really exercise the problem
and and why this transitivity thing for
example is important and where it can go
wrong I'm going to show you that later
in the talk and the third one is you
know written written by somebody who has
read effective Java very thoroughly and
it's pages and pages and pages of tests
code for just one single equals method
and that's also not what you want
so let's go see some code as I said I am
going to use the point class as an
example and this is a full
implementation of it it contains an
equals method it contains a hashcode
method and it contains a problem does
anybody see what the problem is in this
in this equals method I see only one
hand okay more are coming okay okay well
let's let's give it a try before we
spoil the surprise so when I run this
test I have two points they are the same
they have the same value and they are
equal to each other you know this this
test proves that but if I put it in a
list you will see that it cannot find it
in in that list so why would that be
let's have it see actually equals
verifier gives us a hint about this it
says it's overloaded you should have
used an equals methods with an object
parameter instead of a points parameter
so if we go back to the code of the eCos
method over here sure enough we see that
it says point over here and it should
have said objects so let's change that
actually we can't because I didn't put
in a cast so I'm sorry about that but I
prepared a class where this problem is
fixed so this equals methods looks
pretty nice I guess and still there is a
problem here as well
because if we create a point and add it
to a set and then we change one of the
values suddenly it won't be able to find
our object in the in the hash set
anymore which
see if I run the test this is because
when you change the field the hashcode
changes as well and that means that if
you look it up in the hash sets it will
look in a different hash brackets and
find it it's that it isn't there anymore
so that's that's a problem this is
actually the the fourth one in the list
that I gave earlier consistency if you
call the same methods twice you expect
the same result twice otherwise things
will go wrong equals verifier also gives
you a notice about this it says hey this
equals method that you wrote it depends
on fields that are mutable so you may
run into problems later on if you are
not careful if you are careful though
and you're sure that this is what you
actually want you can tell equals to
ignore this problem and the test passes
again okay so these are pretty pretty
simple things let's go one step further
obviously I don't want to write this
equals method by hand all the time so
let's just generate one on the spots I'm
just going to accept all the defaults
except for this one here this is
actually the default and I get a nice
equals method it has a gate class call
over here to check that the class is
what we expect so what's the problem
here well if you create a subclass but
don't do anything with that subclass you
do get a new class and that means that
the gate class call inside the equals
method it will do something other than
you expect it it will return false even
though the object is obviously the same
thing
and this is actually a problem this is
part of the Liskov substitution
principle maybe some of you know that
one and it basically says that if you
expect an object somewhere you can pass
in a subclass of that objects and nobody
is the wiser and nobody will notice but
here with an implementation like this
people will notice because suddenly your
equals method returns false when you did
not expect it to and this is a problem
in real life as well because tools like
hibernate and mojito do this all the
time they they add some magic to your
class and they do that by making a
sneaky subclass of the thing and that
breaks your equals method implementation
so equals fair fire also Flags this it
says hey I have an object and it's not
equal to a sub class with the same
fields if this is something that you
deliberately want that's fine you can
just say you can add this flag and
equals verifier will pass again so
that's the Liskov substitution principle
which is actually you know a big deal in
object-oriented code so can we write or
can we generate a Nico's method that
does not have this problem well sure we
can will generate one here and now I
will enable this flag again except all
the other defaults and now we have an
equals method that has an instance of
check instead of the gate class so now
we should be golden because the Liskov
substitution principle problem is now
solved however we have a new problem now
if we introduce a subclass and if we add
state to that subclass
and this is an important distinction to
make if you add state to a subclass
that's a different thing then if you
make a subclass and don't add state but
here we do we add the color property and
let's generate an equals method
accepting all these defaults again and
here it is so again we see an instance
off and it also calls the super equal
method which is what we probably want so
this should be fine right well there is
a problem and it has to do with the
symmetry so if you call the equals
method on P and give it a Q then these
two objects are equal to each other but
if you turn it around they are not equal
anymore and this is because you call the
eCos method on Q and it sees that it
that you give it a P a point and point
is not an instance of colorpoint and
then the instance of check fails right
out of the gate an equals verifier again
tells us this it says hey there is a
symmetry problem here if we test on the
color point class okay so we're
programmers right we should be able to
fix this so i copy/paste at the same
point class that i used in a previous
page and now I did some tweaking on the
color points I made a distinction in its
equals method are we working with a
color point that we get as a parameter
or are we getting a point and based on
this distinction
we will do something different okay
that's fine let's see what happens do we
solve our symmetry problem with that
actually we do so that's good but we
introduced a new problem
so we have two color points and one
regular points all at the same
coordinates and the color points have
different colors so we can see that with
the code we just wrote a and B are equal
to each other B and C are also equal to
each other but obviously an indigo color
point and the red color points aren't
the same thing so now we have a
transitivity issue and again equals
verifier tells us this it says hey I
have two color points with different
colors and they are both equal to an
instance of points at the same
coordinates that would mean that they
have to be equal to each other but
they're not how does that work
so everybody who has read effective Java
knows that this is where the book stops
it says this is not something we can
solve if you want to add state to your
subclass then you cannot write an equals
method anymore that follows all of the
all of the contracts however turns out
thankfully for us that you can do this
so let's see how that works we have a
point class we have an equals method and
we also have a can equal method and what
we do inside of the eCos method we check
we ask the other object that we get can
I be equal to you so if you turn it
around like this things work differently
it will just check
if it can be equal in the first place
because if it can't it doesn't it
there's no use in testing all the other
things and the real trick is actually in
the subclass where you do the same trick
but you have to override the can equal
method and tell it that it's a
colorpoint
so we turn those things around we do
some complicated code does that solve
all of our problems so I have a bunch of
tests here and it does solve our
symmetry problem but not in the way that
we expect it so now it is no longer
possible for a point and a color point
to be equal to each other anymore and
this is also in agreement with the
symmetry principle same with
transitivity they are now no longer
equal to each other which is also fine
but we still have our Liskov
substitution principle at work so
basically when you add States you add a
little extra restriction to your class
and that way you make sure that all of
these contracts points are still being
upheld but if you make a subclass and
you don't add state you don't have to
override equals you don't have to
override the can equal method and then
everything works like you were used to
if we do this though we have to tell
equals verifier about it because it's
not smart enough to actually sniff that
out and you may have noticed this is
actually a lot of work and it's pretty
complicated and you cannot auto generate
this code anymore so we have something
here that is correct but it's very
awkward and I actually suspect that's
when Josh Bloch wrote
effective Java he knew about this but he
just didn't want to tire you with it
with all this
so what you want to do in most cases is
just have a point method it generates
your equals method except subclasses and
just make your equals and hashcode
methods final and now equals verifier
says hey this is okay because usually
when you have a data class you most of
the time you don't need to add state in
subclasses this is actually a rare case
and you know if you do need it well
that's fine then you can do the
complicated thing but first try to keep
it easy try to make your equals and
hashcode method final that way a
subclass cannot override them and mess
up your symmetry or your transitivity or
you could even make the whole class
final if that's if that's possible in
your situation this is very simple
so concluding you can generate your
equals method from your IDE but if you
automatically assume that that means
that it's correct well you have to be
careful with it somebody could make a
subclass and accidentally break your
symmetry or your transitivity
requirements so if you generate an
equals method just see if you can also
make your equals method final or your
class final and if you use equals
verifier you can just look at the the
error messages that it gives you and use
that to fix any issues that you may have
and that's actually my talk you can find
me on Twitter you can find the code in
this presentation on the link on the
screen are there any questions yes
yeah
yeah so the question is when you when I
was trying to solve the the subclass
that adding states you know with the can
equal trick is this something that you
should even be doing because if you want
to add do you ever want to add States to
a class right this this is something
that can cause a lot of problems also in
other fields in other areas and it might
be better to create a new class that
takes the old one as a parameter somehow
and I completely agree yeah that's that
would be a lot better although sometimes
in some domains people think they do
want to add States and in that case they
can use the canonical trick but it makes
things needlessly complicated I agree
other question over there
so if I understand correctly you ask if
you can just invert the call to equals
so inside the parent class you call the
equals of the subclass in the equals
method of the parent you call well maybe
that would work but that foots assumed
that you know all of the subclasses in
advance and you know six months from now
somebody might make a subclass and then
he doesn't realize this so that seems
little dangerous
okay so first your detective it's a
subclass and if it is then you call the
other ones equals methods well it is
slightly less complicated I'm not sure
if it works I would have to try it out
actually but I wouldn't recommend it
either way oh there would be a recursion
okay okay so the subclass would be
calling the super equals while the super
equals calls the sub equals and then you
have a recursion and okay so that's
definitely not a good idea then somebody
way over there up top yes please shout
because I can't hear very well yes yes
so the question is about java.util date
and Java SQL date I'm repeating it for
the for the audience so they it's
actually it's true what you said I tried
it before
Java SQL date has an incorrect
implementation of equals and it fails so
they cannot change this in future
versions of Java because that would
break backward compatibility this is a
known known problem so you have to be
extra careful if you use those classes
okay well I can try
I can try running it through equals
verifier oh my screen saver came on so
let's add a test method here
this is what you meant right okay an
equals verifier says ah okay so this is
an extra problem it has a recursive data
structure inside so I have to I have to
do some other tricks and then it will
fail for the reason that we just
mentioned this is an implementation
detail about the class we can try it
later if you wants but to fix this would
take a little bit more time yes come so
the question is doesn't serialization to
Jason and then comparing strings fix the
problem you mean with the SQL date or in
general sorry with my classes well I
guess that could work if you make sure
that the serialization is in a very
predictable way yeah sure why not yeah
that there would there would be a
performance issue probably if you use it
in a performance heavy situation yeah
sorry I can't quite hear you yep if you
use a couple of thousand in a hashmap
then it will be it will be slow any
other questions
yes
so the question is how does eCos
verifier work with objects that have
custom objects inside of them that's a
good question and that's actually the
problem that occurred here sometimes
these equals fair fire tries to resolve
these objects and recursively build
instances of those objects but sometimes
you run into a loop in this recursion so
in this case the SQL date probably had a
field of util dates and then there was a
loop somewhere I guess yeah so usually
it works fine sometimes you run into a
loop and then you have to help it goes
very far a little bit by giving it some
instances of the classes that it cannot
resolve so in this case it would be the
java.util dates no more questions
then that was it I guess thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
