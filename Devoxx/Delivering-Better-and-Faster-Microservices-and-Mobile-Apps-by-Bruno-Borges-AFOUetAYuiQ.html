to an Oracle session appreciated my name
is Bernie Borges I work for Oracle in
san francisco and the session is about
delivering not necessarily building how
you build is up to you macro services
but also how you expose perhaps those
micro services or to data that the smoke
reserves that are providing as a mobile
app and i'll show you a live demo on
building that mobile app quickly with
one of the tunings that we are providing
Oracle cloud okay so I'm just introduce
myself a little bit better I'm Brazilian
so I hope we can settle in English I
don't even know what language you guys
speaking Belgium months Dutch French
always confused but I'm brave enough to
live in the u.s. these days given the
recent events with Trump anyways um not
sure if I would go back still but
anyways I'm a former patchy contributor
I did a lot of patchy we kid Apache camo
contributions in the past i went to
apache con three times the twitter
component that you can see on apache
camo i was a initial developer and
contributors that to the apache
foundation my javafx harvest so i do
some java sex development my free time
the game 2048 did a novice expedition
and separator was a java champion took
that code and using glue on he built
mobile version he exposed the java sex
application on as a android and iOS
application i also have another project
it's called weather facts it's a so Java
facts Brown
that exposes web pages that were written
in F XML and the logic is written in
JavaScript so it's kind of weird thing
so if you are curious about Java facts
and web application written in F XML and
exposed as a browser remote loading the
content check that projects on github I
am a Java in a work of casual evangelist
I don't I am NOT a full-time evangelist
at the company but I do several things
that some folks or most folks understand
as evangelism which I kind of like it's
fun it's fun work reality is I'm a
product manager and I'm leading a
developer initiative that Oracle trying
to find you know how should Oracle talk
to developers they don't speak that
language yet so that ugly at least saves
my job for the pad for the next 10 years
that's good and i'm a keeper of Oracle's
github organization so if you go to
github.com / work oh that's that's
another thing that I'm doing and helping
the product teams to expose open source
software on Oracle's github and finally
one of the recent things that have been
doing is a writing and altering and
working on best practices for dr. files
for Oracle products and those are also
in github so we have logic coherence
oracle database bunch of orders so if
you are interested in Oracle products
that you can run or you want to run
inside a doctor container go to a to our
github few things we are again and
having this develop initiative and part
of the odd we did a portal we built in
exposed develop adoro com so it's funny
oracle has lots of tools for developers
who uses virtual box here okay who uses
my sequel okay who uses java
okay you see you are using Oracle
products so but there is many more
there's many more products and we are
curating the technologies that we have
that are interested for interesting for
developers and also the content the
training tutorials documentation all of
that and there are these website we can
now set open with Java one the container
registry server it's not live yet but
instead of building your the docker
images for Oracle products by ourselves
you might go to these server assume we
and we make it live it's already live
internally but not yet on on internet
but you would be able to pull docker
images for some other products including
oracle weblogic and oracle database and
again the github.com / oracle we have a
couple of interesting projects we have
the node j s driver for oracle database
it's open source we have the dr images
project and the oracle chat it's an
exchange accession toolkit JavaScript
taxation toolkit for building
client-side web applications there are
other organizations on github that are
maintained because those are Oracle
products or projects my sequence 1 /
Mexico and Jersey the jocks are as
reference implementation there is also
an organization for that and because we
have different organizations besides /
Oracle and we have more organizations
coming up next more projects will be
working on a github that I'll page so
you can navigate through everything that
Oracle has on github despite of which
actual organization github
reorganization that is located another
update next year starting January will
have an Oracle code event series it's
going to be 20 cities that we're going
to have going to run one day conferences
for developers it's not about Oracle
products it's about development with or
without Oracle products and we're going
to have oracle engineers sharing which
is kind of weird engineers or continue
sharing you know it's like weird but
they will so it's an opportunity to talk
to them but we also going to have coffle
papers so if you are interested in
talking network code you're more than
welcome details will be announced on
this URL so you can go right now and
subscribe and then we may you as soon we
have all the dates confirmed the
addresses when the call for people will
open and close etcetera all right so
getting to the content of this talk so
this talk is about how development and
is focused on two areas my / services
and mobile I've been going to a couple
sessions this week a divorce and it's
all pretty cool sessions on software
development doing microservices writing
along your your first night of service
using some framework spring boot for
example and it's pretty cool but how can
you how can you go and run them on
platforms or moral bone clouds on
infrastructure on premise and there are
many approaches there are many ways to
do it so we're going to cover a little
bit some of these questions and then how
what are the trends that we see on
building cloud native applications using
platform as a service offerings and
infrastructures or service offerings and
then I have a quick story and I'll do a
live demo for you on how we do in our
cloud okay so first it is well known
that businesses are changing in by
software it's not more about building
the next cool thing and selling it it's
about building the next school service
and subscribing to it and we see that
on on companies like Netflix uber nike
and Apple I think you don't subscribe to
not to you don't you think you don't
subscribe to an apple product but you
are subscribing to an apple product
you're going to be an apple consumer to
the death so you are subscribed to it in
a different way and that flakes has a an
interesting thing you know the they
thought hey we want to offer you movies
how can we do that in the first way so
let's get those movies put on data
centers across the world and and then
people just consumed from there through
the internet it is interesting recently
I saw an article that shows how Netflix
distributes its content which kind of
put down all that belief that netflix
has everything in the cloud reality is
most of the netflix content isn't a
cloud most of the videos are in the
cloud but internally in their HQ or your
office they are they have lots of stuff
that run are running just for now they
might be using a cloud service but not
distributed but the video architecture
for video content catalog that is pretty
cool in uber is changing a lot in how
they do business recently they announced
a new version of the app that will
instead of asking you where you are it
will ask you where you want to go it's a
simple change in the app simple change
in this software but that has a huge
impact on the business model because
instead of just asking where you are and
then nobody want to go they will be by
by changing that to asking where do you
want to go first they will be able to
integrate it lots of things like
automatically it suggesting you a
meeting that you have somewhere else or
a concert or a movie and then they will
integrate all of that by software and
getting all the information oh you do
have a movie coming up next at 8pm
so it will automatically select that
destination because it will believe that
it's about time and that is where you
want to go and then over we'll start
integrating late cinemas and movie
theaters might provide discount might
have more advertising and lots of things
just by that little change in the
application so winners they win because
you're doing that through software speed
of business and all of that enable voice
software but for open for example to do
that little change in the application
there are many things that are going on
behind the scenes and for any developer
for any company doing doing that that
sort of business digital business there
are many ways to do it and these days
there are new demands for that kind of
software or for that for those needs we
are seeing lots of a great increase on
deploying polyglot microservices we are
seeing that companies are not just doing
monolithic one single language
applications you're going to have teams
of 50-100 developers thirty percent will
be doing Java thirty percent we've been
doing nodejs one percent will be doing
PHP and the rest will be doing something
else but Ruby Python PHP was a joke
maybe you didn't get it but sorry bad
joke
then after you develop those
microservices you want to deploy to
deploy them to package them and run them
and it's becoming very common to use
docker or Linux containers not just
docker are key rkt is another option
it's a it's an easy way to package it's
an easy way to run and it's cool it's
new it's trending you know kind of a
hype but it's moving really fast and and
it's making developers really engage
with coding and I would even say
infrastructure coding writing code
official channels of code other demands
are the tools right you need them up sin
cloud-ready tools you need IDs that can
talk to cloud services that have the
plugins enabled you need IDs that have
support for dr. containers you need IDs
that have support for multiple languages
net being supports PHP Java C sharp Nazi
shops or C++ and Java Script IntelliJ
well ID the jet brings I'm sorry they
have many ideas for many languages so
you kind of need that and you need those
tools being ready for for your this new
world of cloud development elastic
scaling is another thing so I mean it's
a hot demand you want when you do when
you go to cloud you really want al data
asta City and being easily accessible
easily tweaked by yield easily automated
for different business cases in
scenarios another thing is the smart
performance monitoring the more you
scale in the cloud the more you build
stuff in the cloud the more you create
containers and VMS and in and different
micro serves in different languages
you're not going to be able to monitor
all that by yourself you're going to
have to automate all of that going to
have to use tools that are able to do
that
for you so that's why we see lots of
tools that are have their agents that
you can plug into a runtime that agent
will extract all the information from
that application running you know in a
container and expose that information
back to a dashboard so you can see hey
twenty percent of my instances are going
down quickly what's going on so it's a
it's another demand for for software
development in this world I wouldn't say
that all developers would care but at
least one developer in a development
team will care and will take care about
smart performance and monitoring of your
project and finally there is these rapid
mobile development sales force has been
working a lot on on this browser-based
IDE use other companies are doing
cloud-based IDs work was also working on
a cloud base ID and you really want to
be able to quickly develop something
without installing software so you just
go to the browser and maybe you use a
cloud ID like a cliche or you can you
don't even code you go to a platform the
Salesforce mobile platform they have
drag and drop you I and just build a
mobile app from there and we also have
all these web designers for write
applications and that is actually quite
interesting you can see because the more
we build microservices the more we care
about the api's the rest api is not
about the perhaps the static HTML CSS
javascript web page and you just want to
expose that information to the user so
all these rapid application development
services are quite interesting so we
focused on the business thing and we go
to these platforms and you just quickly
build something and exposed to the to
the user plus the analytics right the
moment you have platforms for that
analytics comes from free or free
so when you think about the micro
service development world there are many
options believe it or not you can do
micro service development with Java EE
there are options that allow you to do
that but there are many other
possibilities from a Java developer
point of view on how to do microservices
what kind of libraries are you going to
use what kind of projects you're going
to use and and it's really up to you
your taste your existing knowledge which
one to use and you know you can go from
pretty simple thing like spork Java and
you can just write a HelloWorld using
this kind of code which are actually
like a lot this is the kind of code I
would write on a cloud-based ID very
quick you know just connect to database
get information sequel and then exposes
a REST API or maybe you want to use rat
pack it's another cool micro framework
as well you saw lots of sessions this
week with different options there is
grizzly the HTTP server that is used on
on on glassfish you can also use it on
has anybody ever used tomcat embedded
here no okay skipping what flies warm
anybody know said okay well what flights
worm is d perhaps today the best option
for doing in Java EE microservice kind
of embedded development and it's quite
cool because are you you take advantage
of your Java EE api's knowledge and you
do some coding to set up the container
but after that you just do your jocks
are as CDI servlets what I want
now on top of what fights warm so um and
then there is spring boot who use a
spring boot all right josh is doing a
great job evangelizing all of you should
get him drunk or so yeah I springing
boots pretty cool I had that session
with josh at javaone it was fun to work
with him and it is a fun project I like
it a lot I talk a lot with Philip Webb
who is also part of the spring boot
development team and there is a lot of
interest from the Java development
community from the arc side we do have a
lot of interest in Java EE we do have a
lot of interest in jock Suarez but when
it comes to Oracle cloud or when it
comes to Oracle stack we really believe
that any Java framework in any language
actually even not just Java but any
language is very much welcome and that
is why you will see on Oracle cloud for
example the ability to run PHP
applications we did have that native
support in node.js applications and when
it comes to Java you can run any Java
framework on an Oracle cloud so it's
kind of fun for us because now we have
our engineers looking into well at least
the Oracle cloud engineers looking into
all these Java frameworks and other
languages on how these developers will
build their applications and how they
will run it in our in our services but
regardless of which language regardless
of which framework there is a pretty
simple pattern of cloud development you
want to have your source code on get you
want to have the development phase which
you all of you love it's very code and
then I'm going to build package and
deployed that's it you build you compile
you can use Jenkins you can use Hudson
you can do this end you can use maven
you can use a shell script if you are
still
brave enough you package with zip file
and then you just deploy it our
deployment part is where things get a
little bit tricky because it really
depends on where you are deploying it's
not the same for every cloud it's not
the same for every one time or for every
application server but still when you
think about harden thinking about
getting the benefits of a cloud
workspace I would say you really want
things to be easy nice modern open to
any kind of language and platform that
you're doing and you just want hey
here's my application run it and give me
all the other benefits of that so one of
the ideas that we had in our case was to
give exactly that so you do your
application or child you send that to us
we're going to package inside a docker
image and based on what kind of
application you uploaded we will just
select which image should be used is it
a job application then we get the Java
image is it a node.js application you
get the node image and then we run it
and after we run it you are able to
scale that instance and you're going to
have a load balanced automatically
configured and everything just works did
you have to write a doctor file for that
no did you have to install doctor for
that no in fact it could even write on
notepad your application is zip with
winzip and you upload to the dash TDY
dashboard can you automate of that all
of that sure but just saying that there
are lots of faces in that new world that
we just skip and we just let you focus
on code and then where that application
will run in hell but if you do want to
have microservers microservice
architecture containers it is important
you have the ability to do your own
containers in every cloud companies
doing that amazon has the
the elastic container service Asia has
the container whatever Oracle has that
too IBM is working i'm not sure to be
released already but they are working on
that on bluemix you want that
infrastructure layer ready to go but you
don't care about the VMS only the only
thing you care is about the containers
are going to deploy can you automate
that all of them will provide you with
the ability to you and then it's up to
you to select the many options of micro
service stack or elastic surge cabana
for data analysis data processing
whatever you want to do but in the end
you really want a DevOps pipeline you
really want the ability to automate
things and regardless again of the
language you want to develop build
package and deploy and the one thing you
really don't should or should not care
is about installing and configuring
monitoring applications analytics and
compliance applications and
orchestration and change management
applications you really want any any
cloud vendor or cloud company to just
give that to you again you focus on the
code so when you think about cognitive
there are many things that you should
consider there is of course the the
tooling part there is of course the
service offerings that the cloud vendor
is providing to you but we believe that
the first very first thing that matters
when you want to do cloud native
development or is culture change you
cannot achieve all of that without doing
having a culture change in your team but
after that you can include all the
DevOps tools that you need or you
already have perhaps and then you are
skip the DevOps fades the second phase
is how you're going to consume all these
services that are providing to you
provided to you in third how you're
going to build your micro servers that
consume those services and last in the
distributed computing which is basically
mayor consequence of doing cloud native
development but the road is long the
the road is uh is not a straight line
you're going to have several terms you
might come to a point where you might
have to give a few steps back and
rethink your architecture really think
of which project you or product you
selected for a specific part of your
environment and in the end it's really
about the competin sea of both the tools
that you use and yourself as a team so
it's it's not easy right it's not easy
we are I was looking at four I look at
at 19 four sessions this week and I felt
like almost lost and reminded me about
the early 2000s when when we Java
developers were doing lots of web
development and most of you perhaps were
doing struts who who did struts there
you go who love starts ok i don't
believe you but fine and there are so
many options right after struts there
are so many options we kid tapestry what
else those are the only two that it
worked besides struts better there were
many was always like a web framework
battle at javaone something like that
until her just for a web application
development didn't you have mobile
development you have security concerns
which language going to use in for what
so we have to think about all of that so
when when it comes to to cloud and what
we believe in again everything is
opinionated right Cloud Foundry is
opinionated openshift is opinionated
spring booties opinionated wildfly swarm
is open ated there are many things that
are just opinionated because it's how
things are people believe this is the
right thing to do this is how I think is
the right thing to do or the right way
to do in for Oracle specifically we
believe that the things between your
application your
coding phase and the application running
you should not care that much we would
give you we do give you the opportunity
if you do want it to care about that we
have infrastructure as a service we have
compute you if you want to get a vm just
go and get a vm and do whatever you want
but if you really want to take all the
benefits of cloud native development or
a cloud or cloud development in general
you know then we skip all that phase so
this is a story we got from our customer
and a partner the customer wanted to
save costs on health care you know
United States healthcare sucks you know
expensive hey go for they wanted to save
costs and they thought how can we make
our employees healthier so we don't have
to pay for their health care or don't
pay much and we would save money a
healthier employee saves money and plus
is also more productive so they thought
about that long interesting how can we
do that well we need to get those people
to exercise how do you motivate motivate
someone to exercise you put a beer
treadmill in front of you you know not
sure if that would work you just walk
and drink at the same time but you need
to give some perks to motivate the
employee and perks cannot be easy things
it has to be or just stupid things it
has to be something valuable like credit
of actually money or bonuses or more out
vacation hours oh by the way yes
vacation system in the u.s. also sucks
yeah I'm Brazilian it used to be really
awesome but then I went to the US I hate
freedom
so so this is the this is the
application and now I'll try to do it in
front of you the application basically
tracks data that we are gathering
through many ways we get data through
through a Fitbit through a hypothetical
smart treadmills that you connect to the
internet and then you log in and then it
would send all your workouts to the
cloud and then we have Jane who I think
he doesn't she doesn't need to get fit
but fine and she wants to track her
steps so she can earn points and at the
same point at the same time she will get
feet so so these this customer and the
partner worked on on a solution like
this and the yep so this is the the demo
part so let me just keep before all that
data coming from exercises and fit bait
and whatever device that this person is
using the supply is using goes to the
cloud goes to some IOT that is processor
and then I stored on a database right
and then the company can go into that
database and extract all the information
they need to consider health care
savings or cuts I don't know why I'm
helping them damn so so that's the
company part right to do analysis data
analysis on all that data and they
process they do they go with the CFO
this is how much we can save because our
employees are doing a lot of exercises
pretty cool but Jane is not seeing that
data how can she get motivated if she
doesn't see that data and she doesn't
see how much how many points she has and
what about the perks and the exchanges
that she can do with those points so we
need to do this application so now we go
to these situation here where
we have Jane Runyan treadmill super
awesome modern clipart of treadmill and
all that information is going to y ou T
and database fine and then the company
do the analytics bi health savings makes
life miserable and saves money while the
employee doesn't get a raise it's a run
but then we got we have to show Jane
something so we have Mike and sewers as
you can see they have been doing
microservice and mobile development for
decades and n mike is a micro service
developer and Mike will do will develop
a REST API will get information from the
database and expose that rest api
because he knows how to do java
development he knows how to do struts
development and then we have soo ins the
mobile developer and web developer and
he needs to give a UI for that
deformation so he will give a mobile app
that Jane can open on her mobile device
and grab that information so um we're
going to focus on this part of it here
because the IOT and database it happens
somewhere else the tridem you is not
easy to carry it's heavy it's big it's
do it was the worst idea to use a
treadmill in this demo but it's a this
part of it here we can do it right here
okay so so just before going there this
is a little bit I mean it doesn't change
much but just give gives names to things
on on Oracle cloud so we have the
fitness devices send information to IOT
gateway so you can you can go if you
have so our IOT platform provides a
software the IOT gateway where you can
install somewhere it can be a Raspberry
Pi if you want it can be a server it can
be a home server automation tool you put
the IOT gateway they're all the
information the raw information is
sending over there the IOT gateway gives
you the opportunity to do some
pre-processing so you throw away all the
garbage that came from
those devices and then you just send the
actual interest information to the
stream data platform and that where that
is where the information will be
aggregated and consolidated and then use
storm database now the macro service
platform is where you're going to run
your application that will consume
database you can use the DevOps platform
to do all your continuous integration
continuous delivery and then the micro
service has the rest api exposes to the
mobile platform and then you have the
mobile app consuming the mobile platform
which consumes the REST API now why are
why are we not exposing the rest api
directly to the mobile app because we
want to do an optimized mobile api
sometimes when they do mobile
development when you do an api
development for mobile devices you have
to be careful how much data that mobile
application will require from the server
so that is why you have the opportunity
to do a mashup of api's so let's imagine
the mobile app needs to get three for
informations so why doing three four
calls you know you just go to mobile
platform one call it gasps information
mesh of information and gets back to you
from one single call in plus there is a
lot of analytics user engagement
information about the device which
devices you being used the speed latency
security everything that you expect to
have on a mobile environment and plus
here on the corner we have the
performance monitoring is more
performance monitoring tools log
analytics monitoring etc now log why why
log is separated because you are doing
microservice development you are doing
distributed computing you cannot go into
each container to get the log of that
application you have to allocate that
somewhere else with some smart smart
Lord reading capabilities and
so this is the architecture for the
micro service application container
platform so again you got whatever
language you want or whatever one time
you create containers not containers I'm
sorry you just say how many instances
you want how much memory and we put a
load balancer in front of you you don't
even know you don't even configure that
and then you can bind your services with
different other path services to get
information from messaging cloud service
storage database your name it or even
services from water clouds all right so
um let's I'll show you a little bit of
all these sayings I've been talking
about so first thing first oracle pod
exists okay because I some phones were
asking me I never I've never seen
ocupado does it exist or is it just pour
point no no it exists okay so this is
the dashboard for the administrator but
the developers will also get into this
dashboard so you have a compute which is
kind of the ec2 of Oracle cloud the
mobile environment the application
container where we put your application
inside a container the developer
instance where you do all your CI CD
source code management issue tracking
etc we have database which is oracle
database we have Java which is not java
it's weblogic there was a problem with
the naming somebody got the wrong mammal
and then we have storage cloud service
which is where you storage data in a
more like object storage format ok so I
already opened some tabs here so it's
quick so we have this treadmill tomcat
based application and this is the
experience that you can have when when
you are on developer cloud service you
have your tools your features what
happened today
repositories for maven and get remember
the team members I just let just look at
the code okay that's what matters so
this is the source code and i want to
show you that first of all this is like
not recommended not best practice do not
put a binary apache tomcat on your git
repository okay this is a quick and
dirty mo don't do it please okay thank
you so we have the Tomcat here we have
actually the actual application is only
here it's amazing application here's the
source you should target you know it has
many fans like Jason and this is the
thing that is important how will this
application run so we pack a zip file
with whatever is inside the only thing
that matters for our platform is that
you give these manifest JSON file with a
command what we should do with your
application to make it run and that is
SH Catalina run now this is tom cat
stand alone it's not the actual thing
let's look at the actual thing I'm sorry
that is the actual thing so we we build
with this shell script so we configure a
Hudson to call this script we do the
mating build and then we do this call
here to zip tomcat and the application
here is zip my tomcat application plus a
PM which is my agent for application
performance monitoring plus the manifest
file as all my application that and the
tomcat distribution so what is that a PM
a PM is what will trigger monitoring
inside tomcat to send information to our
application performance monitoring
dashboard
the developer doesn't have to do any
change on the code doesn't have to do
any configuration on tomcat all it needs
to be done is this wrapper call so we
have this shell script that you just do
exact my binary but we'll configure the
agent on on tomcat and then the APM
agent is just like a jar jar library
that's it and where that happens it
happens over here on this manifest file
this is the actual one we use to run in
our platform so we configure the APM and
that will actually and then call tom cat
with the micro service deployed inside
now where is that all that information
going by the way the micro service is up
and running let me get the URL for it so
so this the micro service just returns
JSON file from from the database you
know we can see tom cat running at the
top URL here is so common Tomcat and we
can go to the application container
dashboard and we can even if we want we
could even scale I mean everything that
you can do on you I of course you can do
them rest api is every cloud service has
that i can just come here and create
scale to five instances floor Wow and
applications getting better bigger so
I'll give more memory I go so I would
apply but let's not do that on a live
demo so keep one instance with two
gigabyte memory ok the load balancer is
already configured so we have containers
running here so the load balancer is by
default on port 80 your application
inside the container is by default port
8080 and when we scare you the number of
instances automatically more
dr. containers are created inside this
platform and more instances are
available in the load balancer just load
balances so you just don't care about
that all right so few other things that
we do have okay so I have my code I have
I mean regular things like you should
tracking code review codes knee pads but
this is this is the sprint dashboard
it's running late I don't care so and
this is a the continuous integration
continuous delivery it's based on hudson
and we have three builds here one to
build the custom api implementation for
the mobile api and then one build for
just the tomcat application in one build
that does the tomcat application plus
the agent so we can deploy on
application container okay so now I'll
not talk you through Hudson it's pretty
much well known but here is a deploy
part so i have i configure a deployment
and this appointment here is configured
on demand which means it will get
deployed on my demand so i have to come
here and redeploy for example and then
it will start the deployment process but
I could it's not impossible to come here
and say just do it automatically
whenever there is a build whenever there
is a code change whenever there is a
trigger of a new version just to play it
because I'm brave enough and I want the
latest of the latest in production and
then get calls at 3am so okay so we are
done with the micro service and i'll
show you just before moving on to the
mobile piece the application performance
monitoring and here it is so we have
application performance monitoring the
agent is installed on tomcat it gets all
the information that he can get from tom
in from whatever is deployed inside
Tomcat and we of course we configure an
application we get a token we get an ID
we configure that on an XML file inside
somewhere and then that information is
triggered and sent over here okay so
let's take a quick look let's go to
applications and here we have a couple
applications not just my demo this is a
shared application performance
monitoring that is why I'm on another
browser which means it can monitor
whatever is running wherever you want so
it can monitor an application running on
your own data center as long there is
internet connection between your
application server and and the cloud
service here so let's go to the
treadmill here it is there has been six
requests so far let's go there and let's
see what's going on so this is running
application server they used to be two
instances because it was two businesses
but then we scaled down to just one and
you see it so it was on port 8080 right
now we can go to the actual rest service
that I showed you the workout sessions
and this is one of the cool things that
this shows it inspects everything that
you did including database calls so you
have the rest service being called
processed and then you have your Seco
command and you can see here what took
so long was to create connection because
it to create a connection takes time
with database can you speed that thing
of course use the data source right or a
connection pool well actually a
connection pool not a data source and
then you can you can you can check
everything that is happening the
sequence of calls inside your your
application so it took four seconds to
get information or four milliseconds for
seconds and 44 seconds yeah to get
information from the database
the Select it was really fast to close
the connection was slower than than the
Select but this is where you can find
what's going on with your application
okay so this is a p.m. now we have our
marker service up and running we have
monitoring been done we have continuous
delivery configured we have develops
kind of environment now let's expose
this information to the user right so so
this is a mobile platform and this is
where you can do your mobile development
your server side mobile developers a
mobile backhand as a service mobile as a
service you name it there are few
concepts that are important here one
thing are the connectors sales first
they use I think they use the same term
connectors it's basically something that
you will connect to get information from
so then you can expose on your mobile
application and then we have here the
connector to the metro service we can
create a new a new connector we can do
rest we can do soap we can do a call to
connected to another cloud Oracle cloud
pass service called integration or even
fusion applications are running on
oracle says so we did we did a rest and
it's configured over here treadmill so
so this is where you're going to put the
rest URL the actual server where this
application is running here it is so you
can figure this you configure rules you
configure security you can do a test if
you want security it sits there there is
no security on this on this case you can
do a test if you want I'll just skip
this and after you have your connector
you can use it on when you implement the
mobile optimized mobile API
okay so we have the connector fine let's
go do a mobile API so we can do a new
API the new API will ask things like
okay what's the name of the API the
display name the name and short
description or you can just upload a
r-mo Randall is a specification for
markup language for rest definitions and
I'll skip this so let's just open the
try to move application API here it is
and it has a name it has an API name it
has a URL now so your mobile application
will use that URL to connect instead of
the actual microservice money on app
container now one key thing Oh in the
end points of course we have two
endpoints the micro service that exposes
this session the workout sessions that
we saw but also arrested service that I
didn't show you but it shows the profile
the user information so we got like what
is the current way so what is the height
what is the BMI what is the age how many
points these employee has and things
like that the key important thing
because you're going to do a mobile
application here is to define this
schema of that data and when it your ass
development and you want to do a rapid
development you need to provide these
metadata so the application the software
you're using is capable of understanding
what you're trying to do so we have to
define a schema for the data that we are
getting from the micro service so here's
a schema for the user profile so you can
see properties like ways age height BMI
etcetera the treadmill workout sessions
so uh what is it a dimension what is the
user information which is a reference to
the user profile metrics and some
additional properties and there is also
a user stats row like calories miles
duration and work out specific lines of
all the data that's coming from
the service okay so we have our
definition we have our endpoints where's
the code right where is the code that I
actually make a call to the last service
that was beautiful 79 years old very
expert in micro service development mr.
dude and that code is here so we have
that code on on on the same again not
best practice but here's the code and
perhaps you're going to don't kill me
it's no jazz so here's the profile call
and here's the workout session okay so
there are few things that again just for
the demo purpose but we define the end
point but it's all all reactive call
back saying I'm not an oj s expert but
this is how it's done I just go to the
documentation or stack overflow ctrl-c
ctrl-v make it happen we all do dad
right right so the DS string over here
this one over here is the definition of
the endpoint session / sessions so that
is the code that will be executed when
the mobile web calls / sessions on the
mobile platform not in micro service now
what happens inside this call we go to
the Oracle mobile platform we get we go
to the connectors and then we get an
access to that connector that canal is
connected to the rest service on app
container and then we put some
parameters URL parameters which is try
to middle / sessions and then the user
ID again it should be coming from a
context user context property but I'm
just sticking into it and make it happen
for a result we parse the JSON and set
this pause if there is any error its 500
and just return that to the request okay
so we get this application with zip it
everything that
in here so the treadmill ap rjs and
takoj Jason days to this is where I make
a reference to the connector that I'm
going to use inside this code and I'm
gonna I would upload that here it is
already uploaded but I could upload a
new version if I want so here is the
opportunity for a developer to do mashup
so let's say I want to get new offerings
to show to these or new perks or hey
there's a discount in this store get the
location of the the employee and get
that information so here I could make a
couple calls three four calls to
different services through the
connectors gather information and send
back to the mobile app okay so we are
done with the mobo API let's go build
the interface I have five minutes left I
think there's time so this is max mobile
application accelerator this is where
just like you don't want to code we just
want to get things displayed on your
mobile device so you go here new
application try the meal that walks up
next I do a next and then I get profile
and then also like to hear the profile
dashboard layout and create okay so I
have tiles I'm going to scratch this one
and I'm going to add an image and this
image from the image gallery and here it
is Max it should be coming from storage
cloud service or database or somewhere
but just want to get it done I can go
back to my screen tile new tile I will
scratch it to two columns and then I'm
going to get the form
with my data so i want to add data and
this data should be coming from that
mobile api that are implemented which
consumes the rest service so there is
nothing out so I come here and then the
tribe new API is displayed here because
only because it has all the requirements
to be used on max so the rest connector
the API implementation and the schema
definition of the data okay so we're
going to get the user profile and we're
going to get a few things here like name
age what are the earning points earned
points that she has and let's make her
life miserable and expose her weight and
height on the same field and what else
what is her BMI ok so next finish and
let's see if this thing works and not
yet ok so let's go create the second
screen because you are running out of
time new screen and the new screen will
be called dashboard and it will be this
kind of dashboard to and finish and then
this tile here is to these are the 12
columns and these are 12 columns ok and
now let's expose some information using
the board chart a line chart and an area
chart ok so the chart our title we're
going to remove the tile and the type
will be this type of here and let's show
the data so i already added the API
I'm going to map that data to the chart
so we want to show here miles per week
so we're going to show miles per week
but we have multiple series so what kind
of workout did you do next and finish
and there it is walking fat burn running
and how many weeks and how many miles on
each week it was done and this data is
already live it's already coming from
the rest service run your nap container
and this one here let's make it nicer
let's make it oops let's make it oh oh
no oof thank you let's make it this way
and let's remove the title and thumbs up
and they need to be quick and I'll do
just this one more and then we have same
thing how much how many calories per
week and poor workout and all these was
gathered through the metadata that we
gave on the schema of the rat service
and there it is now let's see if you can
if this thing works on my phone at least
so I'm not sure what's going on that is
not happening on my chrome but it used
to run until this morning but let's see
if I built this application and here's
my phone okay so it's life alright so
let's see if we can install these
application so let's go to max on my
device we have some applications already
installed and we're going to install a
new one using the QR code that is so
that's going to download the application
into max
which has its own little environment on
my mobile device okay so we got the
application installed Jane and the
password I think it's dot dot dot dot
dot dot and there's the application with
some information come from the right
service and the data from the two charts
that I did the other one was no time and
this is max so you can easily and
quickly build your application to expose
the information you need you make your
boss happy you make Jenny happy she gets
fed you get paid everyone is happy
except me that needs to go back to the
US and and just a quick like two minutes
more this is the entire texture of the
solution from this custom in this
partner there's are many many more
things going on with all these data that
is gather that is not exposed to Jane of
course but we have data going to a local
to do campaign with employees we have
data going to analytics business
analytics so you can they can know
what's going on with these employees if
they are actually getting more
productive after all these exercise and
everything that works on on our platform
and devices that send data to our cloud
few other things I'll just skip that I
mean again people are not very much
aware but we have lots of stuff cool
stuff that makes developers life easier
open to any language and pretty cool
stuff that I believe developers would
enjoy to work with and if you want to
try it you can go to cut rock
accomplished why it and i hope you like
this session thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
