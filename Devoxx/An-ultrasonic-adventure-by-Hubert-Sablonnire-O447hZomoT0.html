night is dark it's late very late our
hero has decided yet again to work on a
side project yes at last it's going to
work I think this time maybe so let's
try this oh yeah sorry
what's going on sorry we are gonna do it
okay so bla bla it works I'm so happy
all of a sudden the door open what the
hell are you doing it's his wife you're
still working at 2 a.m. you woke me up
with your bloody music
wait wait wait on you it's it's not what
you think
it's it's not work it's actually a funny
story so it all started with a simple
question I wanted to make two devices
laptops communicate with each other with
ultrasounds and then I got carried away
and I created an awesome music
instrument with my remote you know I
don't care I mean if you use ultrasound
I wouldn't be I would still be sleeping
right so why are you doing this what's
the purpose I I really don't see the
point
hello everyone my name is Wes Elena I
work for open device and open web
technologies and today I want to talk
about side projects and especially the
usefulness of side projects and I think
you may have experienced the same thing
whether it's with my wife or with you
know some friends my my girlfriends the
non-id persons I always have a hard time
explaining to them that a side project
the concept of the side project you know
well first I have a hard time explaining
what I do for living so I think just
like you I just say I build website so I
try to avoid installing you know
printers on windows Christmas memories
so then I have to explain that what I'm
doing during my my day life my job as a
developer is completely different as
what I do on my spare time but because I
use the same kind of skills most of the
people I talked with don't understand I
was trying to explain that to many kind
of different professions so fireman
secretaries doctors etc and because I'm
using the same stuff I used to during my
work day they're like but so why are you
doing this what why what's the purpose
because it needs to have out to other
purpose and I completely disagree on
that and at some point they are thinking
that I'm some kind of you know sorry now
I'm some kind of Walker colloquy doesn't
really have a fulfilling life and I
really disagree because I think side
projects are awesome
and today I want to celebrate them with
you and at the same time I don't want to
to put pressure on anyone here or
outside we don't have time to work on
this I mean we all have other other
hobbies we all have families to take
care of friends etc so I don't want to
make a an Apollo job of working 20 24/7
sorry so I just want to take a step back
and appreciate the value of site project
so for that I want to tell you my my
ultrasonic adventure so it all started
in November I was with my colleague at
the Hertz Belgium having fun and you
know each time I go to a conference when
I go back home I'm like I want to test
all those crazy technologies I so and so
we got a bit serious and we were talking
about project we're working on so
basically it's a tool for trainers and
professional conference speakers to
display and control slide decks so the
general idea is a bit like PowerPoint
speaker mode you know but in better I
mean at least to our appreciation of
course so here you can see the next
slide but it's a bit too small I mean if
I'm standing here I can see it but if
there's code on it I can't read it same
for them the notes it's really too small
there's like lots of buttons that I
would require a mouse to to use them and
basically I have no mouse so you have
the same kind of problems on keynote
fonts are really thin I mean it Apple so
it needs to be you know great-looking
but it's really not readable when you're
really this far from the computer so we
prototype something which looks like
this and I'm currently using it on this
screen and we try to make the best use
of the screen real estate we also put
lots of attention on the story I mean
I'm here I'm not here to to tell you
about how to do a technology X or Y I'm
here to tell you a story because if I
wouldn't if it wouldn't be that
different from a reading an article so
it's really important to put the accent
on this so instead of putting the notes
for the current slide we have we have
all the notes we basic basically put the
whole speech on the right it's a solid
all area just like a teleprompter and
this allows people to speakers to click
on slide next at the very very precise
moment they need to to tell their their
stories so how does it work
so basically it's just a web app you
browse it on your laptop but you have to
set up your computer as a you know
extended desktop mode and obviously the
second screen is the projector screen so
on this I'm projecting the UI you just
saw so current slide next slide etcetera
and on the project screen I just have
the current slide full swing and then I
have a system with my remote that sends
some kind of events on a desk and each
component of my system so the slide
viewers node viewers received those
Evans and
everything is synchronized it works
pretty well and it actually requires no
servers which is really nice so just
have to browse the web page but what
happens if I want to do a demo I have to
fight with this in front of hundreds of
people going from extended mode to
mirroring mode driving the AV guy crazy
because the screen is flickering in
every every direction changing the font
size or on the resolution so the problem
is I would not use with the extended
desktop if I want to do demos I would
use mirroring mode obviously so I will
display the same thing here and here so
when I want to move to you know my IDE
it would be displayed the same way and I
could code like this instead of like
this I would still have my remote
sending Evans to only the laptop because
it's actually the same browser window
but then I would have another laptop and
it's actually the setup I'm currently
using so on this laptop I have the
current slide next slide notes etc but
then I need something to communicate
between the two laptops so job day Adel
would say well let's use WebSockets I
mean I've already used them it's fairly
simple to use with some libraries it's
okay it's safe it's like we don't have
time to around and we're going to use a
solution we know but it's not because if
I want to make a bridge between the two
I will need a server somewhere to relay
the events between the two parts it's
not that complicated and I mean I could
have the server on one of my two
machines so I would say it's okay but
again it's 3d not satisfying I want to
discover new stuff and add lots of
conferences sorry I'm going to low the
sound and I'll put it back again after
okay at some conferences I heard about
whereabouts II so I saw a few talks but
I never really used it so on my spare
time I was like maybe I could use web
RTC to do just the same thing to relay
the events between the two machines
without any server and that's why I
think side projects are some because
they allow me to discover stuff so what
is web app see anyone knows about web
out see so if you already knows
everything about it you can fall asleep
there will be sounds after that will
wake you up so basically when you hear
about web app see you often hear it's
like Skype but in a browser without any
plugins which which is a good definition
or it's a simple one and it's actually
great I mean no plugins just send out
should be ok and I'm actually using this
with my colleagues here you have tolki
but there's a lot of you know hangouts
and Skype competitors using web RC but
if you look at the specifications who
loves to read
specifications right one people ok I
don't either but if you look carefully
in the the api's of the w3c and
specifications from the IETF the
protocols and surf you see that you can
exchange not only video and audio
streams but also any kind of data so you
have crazy experiments on the web using
place this if you look at web time dot
IO you can watch a movie not any movie
this one because it's a free and open
source or Creative Commons movie but the
bits of the video are loaded through
many nodes that have also opened the web
page and I think it's actually great if
it could be a way to decentralize a bit
the web could be awesome and lots of
people are working on this you also have
other very interesting IEDs
this one allows you to share files
between two laptops two devices without
any server in between and if you're in
on the same network it works pretty well
so here I'm just sending an image
the other one is accepting it etc so how
does it work let's take John and Janice
so why not Alison Bob because I mean I
love music so let's use John and Janice
so German John is on the same network so
they both have local IP addresses and to
put in place a connection a direct
connection between the two machines on
the same network you have to do a round
trip of to create this WebRTC connection
so first John has to send an offer to
Janice then Janice will with answer with
an enter so once you do this you can
create the connection but in that offer
and answer you only have a few
information like okay we're going to do
audio only on our audio video etc but
you you don't have much information to
contact and know where is your if I'm
John I don't know where Janice's so you
also have to send in the other way yeah
you also have to send ice candidates so
a nice candidate is just a couple of an
IP address some ports and TCP or UDP so
it's a way for John to say you can
contact me that way and then Janice will
answer with also some routes to go to
for them to contact each other so once
you have done this it's it's working
pretty well so let's take a demo okay so
here I have a very very simple demo
because it's not that simple to display
to lots of some the same screen we are
going to pretend it's two different
machines
and chrome on the left is John's laptop
and Firefox on the right is Janice so
here I'm creating an offer so as you can
see and it's not really interesting to
see the details at least right now but
you have what we called an SDP it's just
a lot of text describing the the offer
and then we have the candidates so I
decided to put all that information
inside the text area so I can copy/paste
it there I mean my network is fairly
simple could be fasting so here I just
sent the offer to Janice then I can read
the offer and create an answer ok then
I'm sending it back to John
I read the answer and boom the
connection is open so now I can send
Evans arbitrary data that I decided like
previous slide and Janice received it
and then John can say next slide
etc so that's pretty pretty nice but
sorry but now you just copy past it
information I mean it doesn't work in
real life
so the problem is that to create this
direct Direction connection sorry you
will need a server in between a
signaling server and the web ad suspect
doesn't really force you to do it in any
way you can do whatever you want so most
people let's imagine the servers on the
local network most people are using
WebSockets connections and it's actually
a bit like if you are using what Skype I
mean when you open the two clients they
are both discussing with the server at
skype.com or something and here it's the
same so the idea is to say I'm going to
send this to the signaling server and
it's going it's going to be sent to
Janice so the offer and the ice
candidates and then Janice is going to
do the same so once we have done that
run trip through a server in between
we'll be able to have the WebRTC data
Channel
so it's the one that only does arbitrary
data not video audio video so once I
this I can communicate directly between
John and Janice and I think that's
really great and in my example it's it's
actually not what I'm doing I'm using a
WebSocket
we will discover why but on my use case
I only needed local network
when you go to having the two machines
on different networks it gets tricky so
I have the diagrams but it's not that
simple to do it could be done in a whole
talk about what about C but basically
you still need a signaling server it
would be on the internet obviously you
would still do WebSocket connections to
exchange you know the the offer answer
etcetera but Janice cannot contact John
from from our local network because
there's the public internet in between
so for this we have what we're not
siÃ¨cles standard at least it was
existing default Webber see this concept
but they are using a stone server and
the idea is to say John will ask this
server Who am I and the server we will
be able to answer well you have this IP
address on the public Internet you have
this port etc Alice does the same and
then with this they are able to create a
direct connection with each other and
then it's even more complicated because
if you have some kind of symmetric nuts
something like this so it's clearly the
point where it bought me a bit because I
didn't have to use this for for my
experiment but in some cases you cannot
do direct connections so you need some
kind of relay that will be used to relay
the information in between and if you're
doing audio
video it's like under a massive load so
if you want to do a Skype competitor be
ready for like I think it's 15 percent
of the people have not server that don't
allow direct connection that would
require 10 server I'm going fast on this
because we again the idea just to
explain my adventure and it wasn't the
part that really that interests me the
most so what I really like about side
projects is that it allowed me to learn
so much about web at sea about not
servers network in general etc and I
choose voluntarily to use the low level
API if you want to do this in production
maybe you would need to use polyfills
and helpers so this one is really great
is to maintain by the community and
browser vendors it's the only library I
used on the project so it it prevents
you from having to deal with the
differences between Chrome Firefox etc
and I would not advise you to use the
low-level IPS it's lots of boilerplate
I haven't shown you the code but if you
want if you want to ask me at the end
and this helper is really nice you just
say it's kind of a high level API
library to do web RTC data channel so
when you do web technology stuff there's
always the question does it work in IE -
42 you know so where does it work well
basically it works in Chrome Firefox
edge we will talk about that and suffer
it's a bit wave so at first I was like
oh and you've all read articles about
this suffer is the new I et cetera
I don't really I don't really agree with
that Safari for more than a years
a lot of efforts to communicate about
what they do in in their release so if
you look carefully they are saying we
are in development for Weber C which is
really good news I don't know how much
time we'll have to wait but it's in the
government officially the problem with
edge is that the only thing they don't
support is the data channel so my
experiment wouldn't work but they say
it's under consideration it's a bit like
at Christmas you know I want a Nintendo
switch and your parents are like we'll
see it's it's not yet not no answer so
if you know people working at Microsoft
just shake their body and say we want
this so in my quest to do several ace
communication between these two I was
almost done I mean you all have heard of
several s and I actually had a server in
between so it was several s as you know
and but I really wanted something
without a server I really wanted several
a server less you know like the Wii on
the wheel thing so I was back to
experiments and I really think side
projects are awesome because you can
experiment so I was trying to find a way
to create this direct connection and to
exchange the offer etcetera the answer
without any server and if you look at
the you know the IETF doing the RFC etc
every April's one they do some jokes so
if you read carefully here you can do I
pee over Asian carriers so at first I
was considering it and then not then I
saw lots of really interesting articles
so this guy started experimenting with
doing the signaling without any server
so he had interesting way to serialize
the information and then so he has a
project on github
and then I got to this website someone
used QR codes Hey we find the way a
useful way to use QR codes so he also
has a project on github so if you want
to do it between a laptop and a
smartphone you have to put them like
that you know they are both displaying
QR codes and filming each other at speed
yeah I can't see myself taking my laptop
and doing this before I talk so then I
got thinking a bit
I thought a bit about something I heard
a few years ago anyone has a chromecast
here yeah
so I think two years ago we heard about
the fact that chromecast can use
sometimes ultrasounds for the guest mode
so if someone is at your home he wants
to cast a video of a cat on YouTube but
is isn't on your Wi-Fi he can at least
what they explained in the documentation
is that the TV is broadcasting some kind
of small hash of a few characters at
ultrasound to make sure the the phone
can interact with it so I got interested
and I looked a bit so Google also has a
Chrome extension to exchange your ELLs
with the ultrasound interesting a few
projects on github again I was mainly I
want to reuse them but it's not fun you
know I really want to to learn more so I
read about those projects and there's
actually lots of great articles about
this but I really wanted to do it myself
so I got interested in web og I think in
one ever done web audio so if you like
music or if you don't I'm not sure that
it's so much fun so the first thing I
try to do is to produce sounds so let's
try this
so it's the example you see you saw at
the beginning here I have a very very
small code no libraries like 45 lines
I'm listening to keydown keyup and I'm
playing with sounds so how does it work
basically in web of you you have a few
nodes the first most important one is
the audio destination it's the speakers
then on it you can create oscillators so
there are some shells our fans here it's
really great here I can set it up to 440
yards so and perfect a 3 or a 4
depending on if you're English or if you
took MIDI anyway but if you do this
you'll have huge and I not doing in
right now but you you'll have permanent
sounds into your speakers so to do my
instrument
I also required a different kind of note
so here I can change the frequency to
change the note and here I had it a new
node which is game so it's to control
the volume
so here the gain is between 0 &amp;amp; 1
here I have a 80% volume and if I lower
it
I can go to silence which is actually
right now on my system there's a webpage
oscillating it I don't know which
frequency and when I'm going there when
I press I just change them the value of
the frequency as you can see here so I'm
just mapping the the keys of my remotes
to some notes and I'm also putting the
gain at 40% and when there's a kieth I'm
going back to a gain of 0 to make it
silent the problem could be that it's
monophonic so I can do multiple notes at
the same time I can't do chords but if
you like zelda and ocarina as you know
that an occurring i cannot do two notes
at the same time so yeah ladies
the forest it's great I had to go on
Wikipedia to learn about the different
frequencies of different notes but I
think it was a very good experiment if
you put on the side the fact that I had
to wake up my wife then I had to detect
sounds and then it got really
interesting so have you ever heard of
DTMF yeah one people okay so I haven't
heard of it
in my research I was like this is
interesting and it's actually the system
that's used and still used but we knew
it from from when we were a bit younger
when we had phones we were dining and it
was making some strange noise and it's
actually if you look here on the
Wikipedia page each number and the
different characters like a pound stars
etc have a combination of two
frequencies so what I want to what I
wanted to do back then was to emulate
this with a mic so the idea is to use
web audio to detect the frequencies and
try to replicate this so basically it
now you have a node which is a an input
so it's the microphone and you plug it
to an analyzer and that's when it gets
tricky because the ania
the analyzer just looks at the signal
and it can give you an array of so each
part of the array is kind of a volume of
frequency between 0 &amp;amp; 2 to 5 5 and you
have to map this to Z words between 22p
nodes
yeah ok and so basically I had to use
that flight requestanimationframe to
frequently get measurements from the
microphone and each time I got the the
array I was talking about
I just have to map oh I have a high
volume on this index of the array
what kind of frequencies is this is this
one of the frequency of the DTMF code
and that's how I got to do it so again
no libraries only 56 lines of codes so
does it work that's the question
feigning demos right now I was about to
display my phone on the screen that
something is not working so I have a
dialer here of the classical of Android
so let's try this yeah five is not yeah
not bad the problem with this is that it
doesn't always work perfectly well and
that's when you realize that it's a real
job I mean sorry I was playing around
but again you have to be really deep
into it to make a proper detecting
library but I had a lot of fun and I
think side-projects our sum for this is
because you can play with stuff and and
just have fun and try to explain that
through to a muggle that using what you
do at your job you can just have fun and
there's nothing after that it's just
like playing cards or watching a movie
discussing with friends it's just fun
for fun and sometimes people are like
what okay
so again the super supports is something
right now the supports is pretty pretty
nice for web value and the problem is if
you want to use the mic you have to use
getusermedia and for now on Safari it's
not working so I would be able to play
the ocarina on Safari on iOS but I
wouldn't be able to place I wouldn't be
able to use my mic and do the DTM
a demo so then I got to the last part
the signal encoding and that was really
interesting too I have a degree in
electronic signal encoding something and
computer science and after three years
of studies I was like let's select all
the options about computer science so I
don't remember much about it and it's
funny to see that now it's really
interests me and it interests me because
it's fun it's my rules my hobby and I
can do whatever I want
so I really think side projects are
awesome for this so what I try to do I
will put a very simple example so again
the context I'm trying to send this
whole offer and ice candidate from here
to here so then I can make a direct web
RTC connection which is when you
explained it very crazy but let's
imagine I want to send ello okay let's
imagine I want to send ello I have five
letters but I actually have four
different letters so this message I'm
going to send it using a dictionary of
the four letters that are used e h l o
so then i'm going to map each character
to a number let's say so here it's the
position in my dictionary so H is letter
to so one because it started zero you
get the point so one zero two two three
here I want to send this message so what
I did is frequency modulation so I
assign each number I want to send to a
frequency to a note we could say so the
first one is frequency 1 0 is frequency
0 etc the first problem I had is that if
I have two letters like the elf here
that are repeating I need to find a way
at the destination point to detect that
it was longer it's not that simple
to do with Web Audio because it's not
that low level you know performance ad
is so I cheated and we used an ID I saw
in one of the few projects I talked
about I have a frequency 2x to tell the
destination I'm starting the message and
I use the frequency that is some kind of
useless space that I use when I have
repetitions and I have a frequency to
indicate that the message is done so
once I have this it's fairly simple I
just have to play the note and then on
Janis I just have to remove the space
remove the start and finish and then
using the same dictionary map it to the
original message so that's when demos
are going to fail yeah so basically here
you have my demo here the dictionary is
hello well it should be eh ello but you
get the point
let's try so I have the code here I had
to create a string codec to go from the
text to the numbers and a sound collect
to go from the numbers to the
frequencies and and back again so here I
can change the frequency I'm using so
first I'm going to use frequency you can
hear and sorry if it's a bit hurting
your ears that should be okay so let's
use frequency we can all here just for
the demo okay so hey I wasn't expecting
this to work in the first time so what I
did just here is using five frequencies
so three for the beginning space and
ending and 2 for 0 and one it's really
just binary well you can see that when I
talk it does
something crazy anyway that was pretty
satisfying the first time and i
transmitted something like this i was it
at my co-working space and I showed that
to a co-worker and it was like oh it's a
bit like Shazam no you could detect
music I was like I'm way way far from
this point I think but it was excited
and so then I was thinking about the
fact that basically I have to okay yeah
I have to transmit this so this is the
offer I want to transmit and the answer
is looking it's a bit the same it's the
same kind of information
it's 380 characters mostly ASCII
strictly ASCII actually so ask is like
120 term possibilities so I was like
maybe I need 128 frequencies bless the
space etc and oh wait I also need to
transfer you know the the ice candidates
to know where to go oh my god this is so
much characters and now you're like
thinking about the 56k modems you had
that was so slow so the first try did
too when sending everything of this with
a ASCII it took ten minutes to do the
round-trip not that great and that's
when you really I really think side
projects are awesome because now I had a
challenge I the first step was not that
easy but it was not that complicated to
hear I was like how am I going to shrink
this so it makes sense at the end so
that's where I found because there's
everything on the internet someone
explaining what you can remove from the
HDP objects it's really
pimp my ride yeah it's a bit like this
well let's remove this it's useless it's
useless just here I won't be putting
flat screens inside it so if you look at
the message you can only keep some IPS
some fingerprints etc so everything is
explained in this article and I just
followed it carefully but once I've done
that I reduced from 10 minutes to
something like 4 to 5 minutes don't
remember the details but I was still a
bit disappointed because I mean under
one minute would be great but above
wouldn't be really reusable so that's
where the string codec I was talking
about that's where I implemented smarter
stuff so in order to do not to send you
know the messages as you seen before
with as many frequencies as characters I
had to change base oh now I remember my
lessons so if I have a dictionary of 4
letters I have to send 4 character 5
characters because there's 5 letters
ok but if I look carefully and because I
use four frequencies I can decompose
this as a number right so it's just
changing the base so here I'm using a
base for and it's actually 929 and then
if I want to change it to more
frequencies like using 29th frequencies
I just have to use a library I haven't
done it by myself
to change the base and just send instead
of sending five characters I'm now
sending three so it's like well you win
two characters no I want a lot of
percentage of efficiency and using this
I was able here to let me show you two
have different dictionaries for the
different parts I
and so in the object sometimes I have
ipv4 sometimes I have fingerprints which
are only extra decimal characters so I
created a few dictionaries to encode the
different parts in the smallest possible
way so if I were to show you maybe an
IBD firm yeah an ipv4 so if I want to
send this okay
yeah do this it's like 29 seconds so we
are going to change to more frequencies
than just two
let's try I think we should try as
ultrasounds now because again I don't
want to helm your hair so we're going to
switch to 29th frequencies that most of
us shouldn't hear and the other one
don't complain you're young so it's a
gay so I'm here I'm like it between
around 17 K and 20.9 keiki lowered so
most of us shouldn't hear them let me go
back okay so I need to use the same
dictionary on the left and on the right
and if I do this okay
so here I'm going to send it using 29
frequencies plus the three frequencies
I'm using for start space etc okay so
clearly the speakers doesn't seem to to
be loud on ultrasound so I'll try again
yeah it stinks a bit right I think 16.9
K is a bit too low so something is not
working I'm gonna try with my M my other
laptop so let me try this what I can do
is just show you here I I sent an ipv4
without just using ASCII but an ipv4 is
just numbers and numbers that goes
between 0 and 255 we don't need the dots
so what I hear you have like 12 ish for
15 ish mmmm
numbers bits to send if I change the
dictionary and I'm going to cut the
sound just to show the output I just
have to send six bits and the
optimization on this is really really
nice so I'm going to go back to ASCII
especially here and try to success a
demo in with ultrasounds so let's try
this
sorry
so first right
no let's write this one more time maybe
still no I think the 16.9 is bit too low
no still not it's not missing missing
lots of characters if I look at here so
I won't insist it was working in the
autumn room it was working at home maybe
if I changed a bit the frequencies let's
just do a last one try with a bit less
frequency so here I'm using 27
frequencies I mean I still have a bit of
time so why not try one one more time
just like with the video games one more
time okay
no I was writing hello devoxx UK sorry
so yeah so it's yeah okay so what was
nice with this is that Irie man egde to
shrink the message to only send three
frequencies bless the start and finish
and send this to Janice so I managed to
do a round trip in one minute something
which was my goal and so I stopped
working on it and it's okay and side
projects are awesome because it's your
garden it's your project and if it's not
finished
it's okay I mean we don't have to follow
those kind of rules like you're not a
real developer if you don't work all the
time and have this great you know github
account we are we are mortals and and I
really think we need to say it again and
again to our friends to each other
let's stop this bullying on oh you don't
have this you don't know this no so your
side project is whatever you want to do
with it and it's okay so it's okay not
to do too much documentation and test
sort of again if if you're in that kind
of we creative side projects you do
whatever you want if you want to create
your next to be startup yeah well maybe
you you really need testing and dogs but
then it's not really pleasure and side
projects it's working on on the side of
your job so and I also stopped
experimenting with this because now I
was accepted that DevOps frames and
dialogues tickets talked about it so I
had to prepare user amounts of diagrams
to share it with you and that's why I
also think side projects are some it's a
great way to share with
your colleagues in meetups conferences
just to you know to transmit the passion
you maybe you got lots of passion these
two days with some presentations on
Monday you'll have the responsibility to
to spread it like a disease but a good
one so that's why I really think side
projects are awesome so this is not a
story about waking up waking up your
husband or wife they would totally have
the right to be mad at you
but when I think when I think back about
the questions my wife my wife asked why
do I do that what's the purpose well in
less than two weeks I discovered new
technologies web at C Web Audio I
learned so much stuff about networks
Nats I experimented with ultrasounds
music notes I had lots of fun
challenging myself on this project and I
would say it's really really not that
bad for a useless project thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
