I teach at RISD i'm also a designer and
entrepreneur and maybe you guys saw this
so before i even get into what that's
all about i'm just going to play you a
segment from Discovery Channel from
January that they ran on it then wants
them done with that then I'm going to go
through what we're doing at RISD with a
I design which is in my opinion a whole
new field of design and something we
want to get prepared for
I got to say sometimes in a week like
this I get a little overwhelmed by the
amount of genius that's displayed by all
the inventors but there's hope now the
sky is the limit but we can start small
we could even repurpose what we've
already got kicking around in the house
what do you get when you mix artificial
intelligence with a retro wall ornament
a viral video featuring the coolest big
mouth Billy bass you've ever seen
prepare to be hooked Alexa what is
artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence means the branch of
computer science that deal with writing
computer programs that can solve
problems creatively hi I'm Brian Kane
and I hacked amazon Alexa into a big
mouth Billy bass for those who don't
know Amazon's Alexa is a personal
assistant that uses artificial
intelligence for your home you can ask
her to play your favorite music give you
traffic and weather reports make to do
lists and a whole bunch more this is
what she normally looks like and this is
what Brian turned her into I'm an artist
in a designer and I also am a professor
here Rhode Island School of Design last
semester we started a new course called
AI design and the idea there was to take
a look ahead and see where artificial
intelligence is going a lot of what
we're seeing from these AI products are
mostly boring they're pretty sterile and
bland and there's not much that people
can relate to in any kind of waste as
artists and designers we work with
emotional and social intelligence all
day long that's our meat and potato
it's our strong point we've been
thinking about how can we make these
characters and personalities and so that
just seemed to me a really funny thing a
talking fish here we can see the optical
sensor and the sound sensor Alexa what
time is it it's 134 p.m. so when the
light turns on the optical sensor tilts
up the fish's head and when the sound
plays it moves the mouth on the fish
here we have the Arduino and the Arduino
has a motor controller connected to it
and the motor controller is directly
connected into the motors on the Billy
bass when I first got it to work and we
were in class and all the students were
here the first time that that we heard
Billy bass speak like Alexa it was a
real sort of breakthrough moment because
it was the first time for us that we'd
been able to actually talk to an object
this video has reached thousands of hits
and Counting but that's not the most
important thing that's come out of this
the best feeling of being a teacher is
really inspiring the students to do
their own thing and I think you walk
away after an experience like this is a
teacher thinking wow I really generated
a lot of ideas and I got the students
excited give him a sense of wonder using
tools like Google vision and open AI
programs his band of pupils are putting
their own spin on the world of
artificial intelligence what I wanted to
do was to investigate what happens when
a I becomes able to hold a conversation
similar to a human so what I did was I
co-opted an Adobe software and used it
to create a live interactive artificial
intelligence I actually use my own face
that's tracked on to the illustration to
create the appearance that someone's
talking to
van Gogh in this case who's the best
artist the best artist is Vincent van
now of course I think we in a very sort
of Lewis and Clark way cut a path into
the wilderness of these new types of
characters and smart personalities when
other people can follow and start really
flushing that out now and bringing a
next generation of products that are
exciting and fun and humorous and
emotional it'll be hard to top this AI
hack but as they say there are plenty of
fish in the sea and bigger fish to fry
alexa i love you what swimming rules
Thanks alright so that's the short
that's the short made for TV version and
then I can talk a lot about what we've
been doing and different types of
projects and how we're approaching this
and on Thursday I've got some new stuff
that I'm going to do in my keynote
that's not here so I've got some new
hardware a new product that I think is
really cool I also brought the fish if
anybody wants to see it we can get to
that later but let me bring up my deck
so this is personality is the new
ringtone that's going to be the topic of
my keynote on Thursday morning and
that's sort of the result of doing this
work in this research and that's where i
think that the industry is right now
that's where i think the market is and i
think it's a new way of thinking about
AI product and i'm going to get to that
a moment i teach a rhode island school
design i don't know if you know that
it's an art school and providence rhode
island pretty pretty advanced kind of
place and this course come on go ok so
this course is for the last five years
I've been doing I started with my friend
Katherine the what some people call
wearables program at RISD I really don't
like the word wearables i like to call
it fashion interaction so we were
working with this kind of stuff for the
last five years integrating fashion and
technology but really focusing on the
Ashton side and some of the projects are
really cool we've been very well
received both in the art and in the
fashion world trying to do new things
and that's a whole separate conversation
and if anybody's interested I can talk
to you about what we've been doing with
with wearable technology but this year I
started to think about AI and it's it's
it's developing so rapidly that I really
think that we got to get artists and
designers out front because it's being
developed by technology and corporations
and they're making these awkward
products and it's not we got to think
about the the people the humans that are
using it because if not it's going to
fail and there been a whole bunch of
real failed products especially in the
wearable side as well as in the AI side
so we can start to take a look at that
so what do we do in the design world
well this is this is the typical process
for design it's a user centric design
approach this is from Don Norman over at
the nielsen Norman group and this is
this is sort of the core of design
thinking so what happens when we take
design thinking and we apply it to
developing a I products and we went
through the cycle a couple of times in
class so you start by empathizing which
is essentially observation it's an
observational process then you start to
define based on observations what you
think that that product should be and
then you id8 although I don't like that
word anymore that's a real buzz word
that means you come up with ideas and
then you get to prototyping and
prototyping for me is where it's at and
that's what i like to do it's what i
like to encourage because the sooner you
get to a prototype and the sooner you
can test it the sooner you're going to
find out if your ideas are any good and
so i'd rather go through this cycle 20
times to come up with a killer idea than
spend you know a whole lot of time
sitting around a table with a whiteboard
trying to figure it out and as the old
saying goes you can you can save six
months of coding six months of coding
will save one week of testing so we like
to go through it real quick and then the
implementation phase in general we're
not concerned about that in class
because that's that last mile
you know getting it getting it finished
so we're really focused on ideas so as I
started to look into you know what AI is
I suddenly realized that if you look at
how it's been defined on the left side
that's Marvin Minsky and this other
fellow beau Morgan that helped me with
this that's Marvin Minsky's emotion
machine cognitive architecture and his
system goes like if you look at built in
reactive that would be considered one
and then it moves up to learn reactive
deliberative reflective self reflective
that's how science and computer
engineering was to think about thinking
but then on the right side that's where
we work as designers that's persuasion
thats that's user experience and those
are Robert chal dinis six principles of
persuasion which are reciprocity
commitment consistency social proof
Authority liking and scarcity and so
generally as a UX designer we spend our
time on that right hand side but when
you look at the two of those they really
work together I mean these when these
things come together you're going to
have some incredibly powerful products
coming out because once you understand
for instance when somebody is interested
in social proof well then you can
understand that that's part of that's
part of their self reflective thinking
and you can start to put those together
to create unbelievable experiences this
i think this right here is really
something that needs to be explored very
very deeply because once you put
together thinking in persuasion that's
that's an amazing set of tools i'm also
personally since i'm an artist i'm
interested in this idea of a creativity
engine and i think it can be done so one
of the conversations right now is you
know ken ken machines be creative and I
say yes and the reason I say yes as
having been an artist and a designer for
so long one of the secrets is that we
know that in many ways creativity can
just be considered a set of
transformations so if you take something
you can transform it you can reorder it
you can move it you can invert it you
can exaggerate it simplify it you can
add something to it you can remove
something
from it and this is one of the this is
sort of an insider trick the artists and
designers know well you can program that
easily into a computer to start just
generating generating infinite
variations until people like it or until
it works so this is something I'm
personally interested in let's also come
out as some of this work that that I've
been doing in terms of research I think
that's something I'm going to be
focusing on to the next year or two so
thinking about AI so I've been in this
game for a while and it really reminds
me of where the web was in 1994 we've
got this new thing and people kind of
feel like there's going to be something
big and I just saw an article somebody
said that the first trillionaire is
going to be from AI maybe but back in
1994 people were saying the same thing
like oh this web is going to be really
big but nobody really knew what it was
you know they're like what do you mean
like how is that going to be so big oh I
can I can go get some text off somebody
else's computer like why why is that so
cool well now it's everywhere and we
basically can't live without it but the
products that we have now are almost
none of them were predicted in 1994 you
know when you start thinking about meme
culture and tender and all the types of
things that we're doing now jiffy com
Facebook and snapchat this is not the
vision that was from 1994 this is one
that's evolved from our culture from
people making lots and lots and lots of
mistakes and a lot of them are not
obvious webtv does anyone he remember
web TV yeah so you're laughing so web TV
was going to revolutionize the world but
i like to use that isn't as a perfect
example of new media old thinking so
they were going to put the web into your
TV and you're going to browse it with a
remote control and it was just the worst
thing ever it's just wrong TV &amp;amp; internet
or different but the TV people didn't
understand that and the internet people
thought they were going to stick their
internet into your TV and it was just a
huge failure but it was the most obvious
thing and that's
according what I have on the next line
so and that's what's going on with AI
right now so this idea of driverless
cars is very similar to the idea of a
horseless carriage and I included those
pictures down there below so if you look
at the original horseless carriages they
were basically carriages without horses
because they didn't understand like what
a car was yet whoops oh they just
understand what a car was yet and if you
look at what's going on with the
driverless cars it's exactly the same
they took a car and they stuck this
thing on it and they called it
driverless but it's still the same old
car so there's a lot of thinking that
can go into this like this idea of
autonomous vehicles and intelligent
products they are they're fundamentally
new products they're not just a new
version of something hold and that's a
really really really exciting thing what
that means is that there's unbelieveable
opportunities to reinvent basically
everything right now so a lot of the new
products that are coming out right now
the current designs are just not
engaging their boring their passive and
they're pretty creepy so you know if you
start looking at these two products
whether it's Alexa or Google home or
even Siri they're these products that
just kind of sit there they just sit
there they don't do anything and they're
designed to not be seen they're not
engaged they don't have this thing that
we call affordance so in design language
we would say affordances when you just
know what to do when you walk up to a
product you don't need instructions you
don't need to be told what to do and
it's unclear why they're also coming
from this weird tech culture no offense
so like who put that woman in the
cylinder can we let her out like what's
going on why did they put a woman in a
thick black cylinder so I think
culturally we need to go through some
therapy on that level don't speak unless
spoken to you know just we don't have
relationships like that with with people
or even with with animals or anything
and yet
are expecting that so we're basically
building it's kind of like digital
slavery kind of thing going on you know
sit there and shut up and don't do
anything unless I tell you to and from
what we've been finding out this whole
idea that you have to invoke and
interact with an object in that way it's
actually not very natural and it's not
very comfortable I think we think it's
better to actually leave the mic on and
have it be responding naturally to
what's going on in the room and that
might be a little controversial because
then you get this whole of surveillance
feeling going on but it's a lot more
natural that's the way people interact
with people and with animals and all
sorts of stuff and when you start doing
that you can get into a whole new set of
relationships for some reason why'd they
take the screens away I'm sorry I should
just do that why'd they take the screens
away screens are good so on the right
there one of my students Esther did a
bunch of research with with Alexa and
kids and kids didn't know what to do
with this thing it just it's not fun
they didn't want to play with it it's
not engaging but then when she reput it
into this other device that's fun and
had the screen on it as soon as the
screen was there the kids went to
interact with it so the screen says
interact with me especially if you're
young people screens are good let's
bring them back get physical that's so
that's another this is an experiment
that I did with the kids so I took I
took Alexa and I put it inside a hamster
ball so you can throw it and roll it and
play with it it gets just love that all
of a sudden that product plus you know a
three dollar hamster ball becomes the
most fun thing for kids and this is the
kind of thinking that we want I have
video of that too this is the kind of
thinking that we want the designers to
be thinking about but getting physical
is really interesting especially when
you consider this whole idea of like a
disembodied character inside a can it's
really kind of strange when you think
about these products what's being made
so let's let's have bodies let's be
physical and let's let's let's use more
of our senses
and then the other issues that we need
new narratives so when you think about
the development of a lot of these types
of products all like in many ways where
we are building Star Trek but that's a
vision from 50 or 60 years ago that's
passed along culturally but it's time to
have some new narratives because the
future doesn't need to be what we
predicted it to be 50 or 60 years ago
we're here today we can define our own
teacher and when you start breaking away
from that old narrative and I love
science fiction but when you start
breaking away from it and start doing
experiments on what really works all of
a sudden you create new stories and it's
those new stories that people are really
attracted to you know the in many ways
serial exit all that stuff is really
just the computer from Star Trek that
they would talk to and it's we have a
generation that's obsessed with making
that better and better and better
because they want to live that they grew
up with it they want to live it or how
so let's come up with some new
narratives and that's what especially
with the design students the college
students that's that's what they're
they're designers so they're really good
at that and they're projecting their
images forward and it's not necessarily
it's not dystopian it's not utopian it's
somewhere in the middle that's that's
the future and finally can we make her
go away boy I know I keep on harping on
this but this is as all these new TV
shows and movies and everything would
like this killer robot hey I like can we
retire her finally like I've had enough
of that it's a very strange vision it's
one that actually goes back to
Frankenstein which is kind of
interesting so it's got a long cultural
history but it's really preventing
designers and Technology people from
from really innovating because there
were stuck culturally with this vision
and it's also people are creeped out so
they think that when you a lot of people
when you just say AI their creeped out
and don't want to hear anything more so
how can we make that so it's not so it
sounds cool so I'd like to thank you
very much but I'd like to retire her ok
so
user experience so that's the first
thing we look at it's the last thing I
look at so from talking to a lot of
people in the industry what I keep on
hearing is that the last mile is
emotional and social intelligence the
tech industry you guys are doing amazing
things as all sorts of incredible
software code and unbelievable hardware
and all of this stuff but that last mile
with which will make people fall in love
with it is this idea that these products
are going to have social and emotional
intelligence and that seems to be the
stopping block for the industry right
now but that's great because artists and
designers we work with that all day we
wake up that's the meat and potatoes of
what we do that that's easy thing for us
emotional design so designers artists
writers and musicians so tech companies
need to start hiring poets as weird as
that sounds they need storytellers
musicians they need people that actually
understand how people feel about things
and that can write story arcs and
understand drama because that's going to
be the key to making these new products
successful and we need designers with
new skills so we got tons of people that
can do adobe photoshop and they know how
to do a web page or maybe they can make
an animated button on a nap or something
like that but we really don't have any
designers that understand the connection
between this emotional intelligence and
automated intelligence and consumer
products it's a really new thing so I'm
really trying to get push out a
generation of students that you guys can
hire and work with designers that
actually understand this stuff and it's
a whole new at the holyfield fake it to
test it so prototyping prototyping
prototyping that's what we do all day
long I want to get as quickly as
possible to something that we can test
and see if people like it and that was
this so this was basically the fish was
basically an in class demo on how to do
a rapid prototype so I built this in
like two hours with off-the-shelf parts
it's a very inexpensive thing and say ok
now it works and then
how do we test it I said let's just take
a quick video and put it on the web and
see if anybody likes it and went viral
so it was like okay that's how you do it
you know get yours don't don't spend
weeks of weeks of going through ideas
and doing powerpoints and all that kind
of stuff build it and put it in
somebody's hands and test it because
that's how you know it's good and a
whole new thing as UX designers so when
you start thinking about
machine-to-machine communication the
user in this new world isn't always a
human so there's a lot especially when
you think about IOT with these emotional
machines they may need to talk to other
machines and so the interface that has
to work for humans but it may also need
to work for other machines and that's
sort of another whole new thing that I
don't think has really been thought
through yet so we tried to live with
this stuff I bought all these smart
products and had them in the room and
we're working with all these things what
does it feel like that was my first
question what does it feel like to live
with this stuff well basically when
you're all of these smart products what
you're doing is you're giving up control
and that's a whole new thing so if you
think about software it's being it's
been designed for the last 30 or 40
years to give you increasing control
over the most tiny minutia of things
that you do well this new stuff actually
does things for you so you have to be
willing to give up control you need to
be willing to trust it and that's a
whole different set of use cases like
you know so I can I use this there's a
site called the grid AI I don't know if
anybody's used it it does web design for
you and the designers just freaked out
they're like I want to change that what
you can it makes decisions for you so
that's a whole new thing and what it's
doing is it's actually freeing up you to
not have to think about stuff but this
idea about control versus giving up
control is a huge emotional issue the
products improve over time so you
because like with machine learning and
all that it keeps getting better and
that's sort of an odd thing so we're
used to getting stuck in this cycle of
upgrading and feeling like we always
need the newest thing but these learning
machines you have to start with them and
then you
aim them a little bit there's this
period where you need to sort of
establish a relationship with it but
then it gets better so your expectation
is that it's going to improve which is
also different as opposed to like I
bought this product and it's going to
stink and in 18 months and I'm going to
need a new one we talked a lot about
vehicles and I've been working with some
of the different autonomous vehicle
people and that's a matter of trust and
so from what I'm hearing they can do
this we can make all these autonomous
vehicles you can do all this stuff
people don't want to get in them that's
one of the big problems they don't trust
it so I take I would take that to the
next level and say what would it take to
put your kid in one and let it take your
kid away and if you can if you can solve
that extreme trust problem and that has
nothing to do with bits and bytes and
that has to do with do you trust your
kid in this thing is going to take it
away and we can design things for that
experience but that's that's the level
of extreme challenge that we're getting
at now when we're talking about these
products because if people don't trust
it doesn't matter how good the product
is they are not going to use it they're
not going to use it there's a problem of
digital loneliness that's going on right
now all over the world it's actually a
medical issue now so the more that we're
connected to the internet the more
people are isolated and actually not
being social medias making people not
social so we can use these tools to
solve that but in order to do that you
want to think about things like pets
animal intelligences friends and you
want to think about what what people's
emotional needs are you don't need to
necessarily help a helper it's not a
tool it's a friend and that's really
something interesting to think about and
then for every every time something
moves forward there's always backlash
culture and I brought up that picture of
the vinyl record player because they're
really trendy now it's like why does
anyone buy vinyl records it makes no
sense right but they do and they're
buying a lot of them and that's because
as things get more super high-tech their
their yearning for that older thing and
so it's really something to think about
is we're designing this next generation
or products that you know with thinking
about autonomous vehicles when they're
on the road maybe the most romantic
thing in 15 years
going to be taking your date on a drive
where you're really driving a real car
you know like hey this is so cool and
romantic right and and it's really
important culturally for people to think
about that kind of stuff because not
every things don't always move forward
that's always two steps forward and one
steps back culturally all right so
lokesh he's one he's one of my grad
students amazing amazing guy he's going
to be here Thursday he developed this
it's sort of a game where you can take
all the different appliances in your
house and you can assign them different
emotions and then you can create stories
between them so you can think of a
stressed watch how does that communicate
with a happy plant or how does it what
is that sorry for me to see exactly
what's up there oh so how does an alert
game controller how does that have a
relationship with what is that Oh a sad
computer and so when we start assigning
emotional states to these different
objects they need to be able to talk to
each other and this using this type of
technique we can create a story so we
can talk about the sad computer having a
conversation with the alert game
controller and we can actually write out
a narrative once we have that written
narrative we know exactly how those
products should be designed and how they
should interact and there are these fun
stories this is the kind of stuff that
people are really into when you start
you know when you start showing them to
people and they can we can so we can
reorganize this it's a really cool game
we think that that's it's not perfect
but we think that that's a pretty good
map of human emotion that goes around
the outside and you can put whatever
object you want anywhere in there you
can invent your own the things are like
an excited back on an excited blender
having a relationship with a depressed
vacuum cleaner like that's sort of
interesting right so we may think of
these objects as standalone objects but
they have relationships to each other
and they have relationships to us and
and that's sort of at the center of what
we're looking at so here's some of the
lessons learned
um they're doing a lot of this so
essentially we there's a lot of talk
about assistance and agents I'm not
seeing a whole lot of value in that
right now even though the industry is
like really focused on that I'm seeing a
lot more value in these things or
companions and friends and pets there's
already so many helper things that we
need helpers for our helpers you know
it's like I think the Apple watch is
designed to solve the problem of taking
your cell phone out of your pocket so
we're getting to this thing we're like
we're searching for problems to solve
for people but the real problems are
emotional their lifestyle and their
human so I see bigger value in that in
the bottom size one size fits all a lot
of these new things Alexa Google at home
they there it's like one product and
everybody's going to love it but that's
not really the way it works it's
certainly not the way fashion works it's
probably long-term not going to be that
way like why should there be one
character that we all talk to and that's
this personality is a new ringtone thing
is that I think we want to turn these AI
characters essentially it's a memes so
there should be ways that people can
create them and share them and send them
they can be characters they can be
moments they can be events they can be
these little smart nuggets that you make
and share on Facebook or Instagram or
you send it to somebody's phone when
that happens I think it's going to
explode and everybody's going to start
to get involved with it because they can
they can be a part of it and that's the
way internet culture has worked so far
there's tons of barriers to connectivity
right now everybody's building their own
silo but I'm sure that if anybody here
has smart products in their home it's
like you're constantly downloading apps
and connecting things and they don't
work and you're updating and you spend
all your time doing digital gardening
really need to think about how making
these products all work together and
that's something that I think open
source can do we don't need to synthetic
emotions we don't need to
mimick humans because people like
machines if people didn't like machines
we wouldn't all be here we all like
machines right so people like machines
and we have relationships with machines
and we can think about this new thing
about synthetic emotions because they
may be more fun coming from machines
than a machine pretending that it's
alive if that makes sense or or that a
machine is like one of us dumbness is
really important as these things get
smarter and smarter and smarter maybe
maybe you can think about like the last
person who you want to be around is the
person that's always smarter
better-looking than you is never rude
everybody likes them they always have
the right answer like you don't want to
be around that person so we can we can
design defects in the characters of
these things to make them more fun and
people will relate to them people love
humor they love things that are
imperfect we don't necessarily need to
design this thing of perfection and we
keep on going we're trying to do the
perfect thing always but perfection
isn't really what people like we can
make them not too smart and I think we
can program them to make mistakes which
is really interesting so when I think
when these machines make mistakes if we
can figure out a way to have them make
mistakes that aren't harmful and then
correct themselves that's going to be
the kind of character that we really
love because then it's not smarter than
us then we act it feels more alive if it
can make mistakes and that's a whole
it's like a whole sector of things that
they can be thought about and again so
stop stop solving problems think beyond
function terms of like especially
technology and design is like always
it's like fixated on this idea of form
follows function but there are emotional
functions aren't necessarily problems
and once we get outside of that realm we
can think about this whole class of care
of products that are just fun and just
enhance our lives in an interesting ways
we don't need for instance we don't need
music we don't need movies we don't need
television we just love that because
that's who we are we're humans
opportunities so as I was saying so AI
is me that's what I think is going to
hit in the next few years it's small
it's small it's shareable somebody needs
to make some type of editor where you
can start sending these things around to
each other there's a lot of potential
especially in our phones so we don't
necessarily need to sell new hardware we
all have our phones but the phones
aren't that interesting as objects so
there's a lot of opportunities to take
those objects and for instance just a
quick demo that I did for the students
there's a lot of opportunities to like
you take your phone you put it by your
bed stand at night on something like
this this can have all sorts of motors
and software and things in it and it can
be this little character that all of a
sudden when you connect it comes alive
transforms your phone makes it feel more
like an AI product you can use existing
products microwaves new schema so as
these objects and experiences start
having emotions or reflecting our
emotions they need to be able to
communicate those two other objects
machines and software so I think that
there is an opportunity to create some
type of open-source emotional markup
language type thing that says so when I
walk into my house that my microwave
knows that I'm in a good mood or that
I'm in a bad mood or that something the
vacuum broke and so it's in a bad boot
and so it can tell you're you're AI guys
next to your bed that you're backing the
sad and this is really kind of an
interesting thing when you start to
think about it we're sending tons of
data but I don't think we're sending
emotional data yet really nice if it was
standardized there's all sorts of
opportunities so you know one of the
things we do as designers as we look for
the worst things what do people hate
okay what do people hate we can make it
great people you know and it's so easy
just look around the world it just look
around it's an observational approach
the finish this like
well hey ATM so we can make ATMs great
microwaves we're going to talk a little
bit about microwaves clock coffee makers
these things are already in the house we
don't need to necessarily bring in new
hardware because they already have them
so if you're going to get a new coffee
pot why not make it a little bit smarter
and think about how that works you can
stick all these tiny electronics in
there ai celebrities that's my
prediction for the next year too
somebody's going to make it it's going
to be either some kind of Twitter bot or
some type of AI musician or some type of
AI artists that's going to be more
popular than the human we're seeing this
already in Japan but there's all sorts
of opportunities to be working there I
think there's like that's a big money
making thing if somebody comes up with
these AI celebrities they're going to be
huge and creativity engines we need
artists writers comedians musicians
involved with the design working with
these companies and I'm seeing under the
radar I'm seeing some of these companies
are secretly hiring poets and things
they need them on staff and we need a
lot a lot more deep testing and a lot of
this deep testing can be done like we're
doing here you don't have to necessarily
like code some super machine you can
make it out of cardboard you can just
make a very simple prototype that just
does what it needs to do or for instance
like with them with the autonomous
vehicles one of the things I'm
interested in is people are very
hesitant to getting them maybe they'll
go for a short ride but what does it
feel like to ride in an autonomous
vehicle 48 hours you know do they start
to panic is there this fear and you know
if you think NASA does these long-term
tests where they put people on the side
of a volcano for months we don't know
what it's like the long-term effect of
living with these things but we can fake
that like you can build a fake
autonomous car that people don't know
that it's autonomous and it gets towed
by a truck and they don't know the
difference but we can get that feel of
what it's like to be in afraid hours and
say hey pull over i need i'm hungry and
how does it respond to that you know and
what is it you know what what is that
and so i think there's a real lot of
opportunity just
to do this type of testing on these new
products because if we understand it we
won't make mistakes with it thank you so
that's just sort of my final inspiration
thing but I have one more video to show
you and I'm going to bring this was too
complicated to bring it here I didn't
know what what room I was walking into
but this is the new thing they were
working on so again I was working with
lokesh and we looked around and we said
what's this what's the saddest appliance
I think it's the microwave right is
there any sadder right it's always dirty
no one ever cleans it it's always stuck
in the corner like in the back of the
7-eleven it's gross you don't want to go
there you don't want to touch it's like
sad like you just feel sorry for it so
we said okay let's take this what the
worst thing possible and make it the
best thing and this is a part of what we
part of what we came up with I've got
this here and I'm going to bring this on
thursday so we can all play with it and
I got all these toys we can play with
but let me show you this you're the
first people to see it or hoping to
bring this to market pretty quickly let
me see if this works
you
so that's the new thing i'm working with
tenor and clarify on that and i'm going
to have that for I could have brought it
here today but I couldn't and I also
have this other product that there's a
more of an emotional comfort device so
we think that's pretty cool and it's
like all of a sudden the microwave
becomes really really fun and we've been
getting really hands-on with that
testing and everybody seems to love it
and again it's not solving any problem
it's just making life a little bit more
fun but I think that that's what people
want um any questions no wait hi
yeah so
sure so uh what's an example it uh I
don't know if you're having a discussion
with somebody it might answer the
question for you it might you know it
might interrupt or it might make maybe
it's listening and it then it knows a
joke it was a Steven Wright joke it's
related to what you're talking about you
could certainly have something like a
Roomba that's moving around and kind of
following you around and sort of giving
you suggestions or talking to you a lot
of this has been explored so the people
like a Pixar and you know with Wally and
definitely with star wars with some of
their robot characters I mean the
thought about a lot of this thing
they're making characters not not not
like computery robot things certainly in
the car you can imagine that it could
proactively tell you that there's gas
station up ahead I pretty pretty much
pretty much everywhere but the but the
way it is now you have to ask it a
question and is anybody here have a
lexus erie google home and anything that
kind of stuff it's very sensitive this
sort of this just so a lot of these
products our honeymoon products like you
get them in there great and you love it
for a week or two and then you never use
it right same thing with a lot of the
wearables of the Fitbit and you know
like yeah I use the Fitbit for a few
months and now it's in my drawer and I
haven't charged it so you know how can
we make as opposed to things like cell
phones and facebook and instagram and
all that kind of stuff where people get
them and they increase their usage over
time so that's that's really the goal
you know what from product perspective
we want to make things that people like
more as time goes by not this sort of
like 11 liner thing that answer your
question this is really new so we just
started this in September and it's like
we sort of didn't even know what
questions to ask now I think we know the
questions to ask and there's all of
these little avenues for research going
out there that are really really cool
there's also you know one of the other
things that we look at a lot especially
on the wearable side is like why are
these products failing so hard like
things like Google glass and there's
answers to that
absolutely and I think that the result I
mean one of the things that's really
interesting to me is looking into animal
intelligences and why we why humans like
pets they don't really do much for us
and they actually require quite a bit of
attention and there they don't behave
like this they're very unpredictable
they jump up on our keyboards and stick
their butts in our faces and make a mess
on the floor and right I mean so we have
this relationship where we actually you
need to you need to you need to love it
in order to get the love back and these
are the types of things that I think are
going to make the AI products really
exciting that people are going to love
and and you know so much of the tech
industry is like wants to have you not
have to work anymore but maybe you do
want to work to these products and to
make them really good because they have
the whole thing with learning and you
know these deep learning and all that
kind of stuff is you have to train it so
why not make that like thinking like a
pet and all over the world people love
pets and that's actually this product
here which I didn't really talk about
this is a this is a pretty pretty simple
device that this is part of the digital
loneliness thing that I've been working
with for a while so it's right and it's
a very very simple device very
inexpensive we're hoping to get this out
for under one hundred dollars and all it
does is / so when you hold it at purrs
and it's very very intimate it's very
very simple and it's not it doesn't
cross the uncanny valley do we know what
the uncanny valley is if I say that yeah
uncanny valley is where something is
very realistic but it's just a little
short of it and that makes it super
creepy so instead we just dial it back
and get more into an abstraction and I'm
working with the some folks now because
I have to make peace
be and it's getting complicated but if
you want you can you know how many how
many tech products do you throw around
so these are like extremely tactel
extremely physical products whoops
that's okay that are four different
types of emotional needs and we're
hoping to get this them or any other
questions now's anybody want I can leave
this up here if you want to see the fish
it's the funny thing about the fish is
that I really just meant it to me an in
class demo it's not like a sophisticated
I mean it's kind of cool it's an Arduino
project right but it's not like this
vista cated hack and it was meant to
just be very quick but then that sort of
because it went viral it sort of
eclipsed and I almost felt bad about
that because they'd eclipse some of the
students which I shouldn't do but any
other questions
so my answer to that is test test test
test test and test so come up with an
idea make this thing in a day have
somebody live with it for a couple days
see how they're responding to it and
keep going through that cycle and find
out yeah is this like so addictive that
they never leave the home anymore or is
it just really helping out you know I
mean you know there's all these moments
in our lives where it might be like you
can't have a for instance you can't have
a cat the office you can't have a cat in
the car but now you can and is that
gonna make us feel isolated and lonely I
don't know maybe maybe not but I don't
know the answer so I'll test it I don't
I don't think so I mean we do know now
that people are feeling isolated and
lonely I mean you go into coffee shops
and everybody's there nobody's talking
to one another the people are emailing
the person in the next cubicle over at
work right you have question
that's tough question I don't you know I
think it's again i would say test test
test because i don't think even with the
best intentions i don't think we know
how our products are going to
necessarily have an impact it's very
it's a it's a very very difficult gray
area and so I would just say try making
this stuff and test it and see you know
see what what happens a lot of a lot of
design is intention so you know I guess
if you keep your intention clear i'm not
i'm not sure that my morality is anybody
else's morality so i don't know if you
want me projecting it to your world i'm
not the most moral person
so that becomes really interesting and
that gets back to again what I was
saying about this no one wants to be in
the room with that perfect person right
and nobody does you do you really want
just a yes friend probably not and
that's why I was saying it should I
think it should make mistakes and it
should you know have flaws and it
shouldn't be so perfect because we we're
all very egocentric beings and we want
to think that we're better whether it is
true or not we want to think that we're
better and so with these other things if
do we know the Paul Bunyan story
everybody know the Paul Bunyan story
yeah well bond it's an American myth
about the guy who could chop down trees
and then there's a machine that can do
it faster better than we don't want to
live with that so by making these funky
flawed characters and you can think
about like I said Pixar is thought about
a lot of these things because it's all
about telling stories and narrative
Wally is not threatening all right
what's the r2 d2 or whatever these
characters they're not threatening so we
can make things that are actually really
really cool but that don't make us feel
powerless that they don't make us feel
less than I have a if you're interested
like I've mapped out a lot of this stuff
I didn't know this was the right forum
to get into that level of detail but and
user experience we're constantly working
with that so we any user experience
designers here ya know okay so I mean
basic 101 you never tell people that
they made an error anymore a used to in
the old days it's like oh you made an
error now we say oh you could why don't
you try this or for instance so if
you're filling out a form every time you
get that field right maybe if you give a
little green check next to it it's like
hey is a little reward now I feel good I
did it right this is what we do in UX
and if there aren't any designers here
you may not be aware of all the very
very subtle little hints and tweaks that
we can do and that gets back to that Cal
Deenie stuff that's I shouldn't I
shouldn't even show that because that's
the secret so
but we can work that in and also in and
if you start mapping that back to back
to the Minsky model of the mind it's
like oh I know that this person just had
a reactive response so i need to respond
to them with this type of i need to
respond with liking because they're
they're reactive response to this said
that they're nervous so if i give them a
liking response they're going to feel
good and get out of that space so that
they'll continue moving forward it's
actually really that that's a very very
I haven't even because I've been so busy
doing all this teaching I've had time to
to really sit down and explore but
that's what I'm hoping to do for the
next few months I don't have the answers
to the morality and all that kind of
stuff I wish I did the smarter Minds
will figure that out so any other
questions no you can play with the toys
if you want I don't think there's
anybody else in here and come back
thursday so low cash is coming he's
amazing a student and we're going to
show off and have a chance to play with
the microwave because as cool as it is
to to see a video of it like getting
hands-on with this stuff is really
really fun dependent going to do my time
right on time thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
