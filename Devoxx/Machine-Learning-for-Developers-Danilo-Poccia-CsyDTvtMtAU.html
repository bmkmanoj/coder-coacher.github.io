he's giving it to a concealing to
developers but you're from amazon and
part of you talk about amazon web
services are endless but it's also about
terminology machine learning exactly so
what can people is machine learning from
the beginning 30 what do you explain
well I think machine learning is Billy
and exciting poverty is going to change
the way we live we work in the next year
so I want I think developers must
understand terminology so I went to an
overview of how mush running evolved
over the year that from a more
statistical approach to neural networks
and deep learning so that developers can
understand which tools they can use I
also talked about an open source tool
that we support the Famicom is Apache
amex net it's a platform where you can
do deep learning a scale and then
everyone into our offering we now
launched an Amazon artificial
intelligence initiative where we have
services that can help developers use
api's to do image recognition or to do
text to speech so that you can render
effects into voice this is especially
interesting for ioc because if you have
a device with limited possibilities
whoever display i display you can have
voice that can tell you what is
happening and then we will also have a
services amazon legs legs if the what's
inside alexa you may know the amazon he
co device basically now you have a
service that you can use and integrate
with any device you want a mobile app
you're going to web app and you can
build a chat bot and you can interact
via text or via voice and at the big
thing right now chat but yes listen a
lot of interest in our customers because
shadows container has interacting with
your customer in a more interactive way
not being just a website offering
information still is very efficient to
build and with the especially the new
generation they like interacting with
both so if you need to uh no book
something like a buca hotel butiker are
a much easier this interactive way
that's going in a handless website and
finding the right options so spell
making things more intelligent using
intelligence exactly we think that these
tools help developers build smarter up I
also think that some things like user
interface must be
dr. sue customer so I hate when the
option that I choose in are always in an
application is the most given one if
it's the same time that I use an
application application can learn and
optimize the user interface format for
my basic usage ok so you think that and
that maybe we could go towards the
future where an appt rearranged itself
to suit your youth exactly so maybe be
content on a page based on what it
thinks you would be the most interested
in or if you're always texting cancel
maybe it will learn to put the cancel
button at the top yes actually or make
it a little bit bit bigger but not
hidden among a lot of options so it's
something that is doable there is the
tools to do that with without being a
machine earning expert because now you
can use api's that can really help you
abstract from the complexity the
mathematics is inside and just use it as
a service so what's the kind of app if
you're talking about integration with my
bowels what kind of apps that you think
would would get a lot of you surface so
I'm not explaining it very well
imagining I'm a retailer for example and
I have a retailing app what would you
suggest that you start using you mean
machine learning in general of course
one basic usage is for ateliers
recommendation if we use it a lot in
amazon so understanding the taste of
your customer so that you can have them
find what they need in a quicker way but
you can also change the user interface
or maybe if someone is looking for
something very specific instead of
browsing of searching a catalog you can
create a chatbot where you can interact
say hey I need to solve this I need
something that is maybe white because I
want to have the same color of the
Builder something else I already have a
home and the chaplet in an interactive
way can guide you to find the right
items that you want to buy and it's that
easy to configure it is most difficult
figure a shin or is it may be looking at
the data first and then so this high
level service they are really designed
to be used with some simple
configuration if you move into having
your own data to be analyzed and train a
model then you need to understand your
data and visualize your data before
that's why we usually have this
three-tier approach so the top here are
services that you can use as an API so
much recognition
speech for the chat box then you have
platforms and engines that you can use
where you need to understand a little
bit more of machine learning and how
your that ice is built</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
