am joined by the dream team Aleksandras
so two complimentary people and your you
deal with the operation is anything
based on operation contract negotiating
invoicing everything on this side and
garlic and I'm trying to find the right
before the right speaker to find the
right mix of technologies that we bring
here and this year we managed to forget
a lot of my speakers and we have an
impressive and pineapple of technologies
represented so we're quite happy of the
event they're here and they coined by
twenty percent yes I guess so and though
you already started to play dollies
obviously in our minds about the next we
defend me I'm not sure if we'll increase
the number someone to sue or it is
against the number of attendees where we
could have some logistical problems we
will see the venue will let us
accommodate some more more fiber like
100 more people or maybe we will decide
to have days of conference which was the
freaky decision this year as well and we
decided to visit the number of attendees
and I think it was a good idea but now I
think we reach the maximum capacity of
the of this venue and I don't know in
the future maybe we will start
increasing the number of days of boxes
because in order to get to organize the
devil's you have to have more decent
just one so we're preparing baby sets
with my my logo babysit oh one thing I
excited me other than if you can access
if there is some kind of rumor last
night speak dinner about maybe a box
days in Dracula's castle
it's kind of a joke on that because you
actually can rent the Dracula's castle
but it's kind of complicated to make a
compressor because there are smaller
rooms and kind of spooky you cannot
accommodate a whole conference there but
you can actually rent with the castle
and yeah it's safe I think it would be
definitely something different how did
you might qualify forever safe I'm sorry
I hate the next year apart from maybe
changing the format bit well I really
hope we can meander soon get the same
lineup of speakers and maybe some more
attendees and I my intention is to keep
the same quality of socks and the same
quality of ride another venue and the
late and expand them but we wish I wish
at least as i already mentioned so i'm
planning slowly and we are trying to
adjust some things are already
developing and to see how things are
going again that seems like he had a
really good mixture this year of
international speakers and also Romanian
speaking mm-hmm yes yes we have the sum
from Romania speakers did with stickers
we try to help them improve the speech
improve their workshops and we actually
were trying to to to create the right
mix of local speakers and international
speakers and the easier for for the
people to meet some rockstar speakers
some come international because because
it is easier to bring speakers here then
who like my own house fly-half five
other people in another country
that's from my point of view I'm so
what's the most important thing that
you've learned from this year FFA Degree
almost fun thing well actually recently
we had a little strange period of time
in the beginning of February's and we
were a little bit concerned about the
whole political environment in the
country and everybody was a little
bitter affected by this stranger period
of time but we learned from that that in
the end everything is fine and the even
though things are looking good as well
as you would like to look you just have
to be confident that the things we sold
and in the end I think of oxidase is the
kind of event that the cells and death
that brings people together and of
course with a lot of work involved you
just have to be confident they to get
all those people together and well this
is especially for me because
electrolysis I'm the political person I
consider whether for realistic alone'
but well I was more concert hall of the
mythical and he was more like a it was
defined it will be fine but this time
maybe I will have to learn myself that I
have to stress this things will evolve
well it's more like a lesson for me yeah
I miss that here the number of workers
was individual participant increase that
means the individuals want to learn more
and they're interested to to be up to
date with the latest in technology so I
hope the next year this big trend will
amplify and more and more individuals
will speak to
to be updates abuse alleged with the
latest latest technologies with and
please be on top because we like to
browse our stuff that Romania we have a
very very large IT community and it's
true but in order to be there be a
relevant community we have to make
efforts to stay in the top and go to be
updated every moment so it's that that's
our reasons of doing work the uterus
it's our little little steps to keep yer
the remaining material up updates not
speed with technology well it's been a
really fun event in the atmosphere are
so impressed by the food half day this
would be perfect yeah that's a big win
for me it comes well it was one of the
reasons we chose this venue so we know
the chef is extraordinary so you just we
knew exactly where to come for great
food and especially just with which are
my favorite sir i have to admit them so
they are all pretty when people hear you
haven't come to verse 8 request at the
end of dinner this is fantastic rose
cake cake cake Oh like brightly colored
like pink cake fruit cakes chocolate
cake okay I'm a latest cake but I wasn't
looking for anything I not so when I
have to I like to hurry yeah they also
had the chocolate cake though everybody
was happy I was happy with my cheesecake
and fruity cakes and he was happy with
his chocolate cake it was all good oh
