presentation will go a very quick - and
category theory and why is important for
functional programming oh can I ask you
how many of you are kind of using the
functional programming right now okay so
it's kind of beginner and how many of
you have heard about the world monad and
how many of you are kind of confident to
explain what a monad is okay nobody I
hope that is really not that difficult I
hope that at least if it's not that this
a talker after this talk you can study
yourself understand better so the goal
of this presentation is basically not to
let you fall asleep and yeah at the
secondary goal I would like also to have
people start looking at functional
programming and then studying category
theory and it's okay if you don't
understand everything and it's more like
a quick to than to raise your curiosity
but of course I mean yeah I hope that
you can understand at least the main
point oh let's go very quickly this is
story called so what is a category
theory very quickly is something about
this called a general abstract nonsense
which is not a bad thing
that means that is something that is
general is it absurd and it doesn't have
a specific meaning because you can apply
to all the stuff and the category theory
is actually using physics Ponto dynamic
it's using mathematics and awesome
functional programming so category
feelings in fossa is very very iLab and
I don't know if you know this comic it
caller cabin dobbsy one my favorite one
and there is this Stafford toy with the
tiger that when some adulterer is
present it's always a stuffed toy but
when the kid is alone then became alive
and so this is a kind of transformation
and and the end of the day category
theory is all about those formations but
those formation that keep some
properties so it's not just any possible
transformation and let's start with the
definition so to have it
what is the categories in size category
theory so we have a collection of
something called object which absolutely
nothing to do with the programming
object something called arrows that kind
of link object between them and it
allows collect one object to another and
the arrows must also have a property
that you can you must mean you must be
able to compose them otherwise I mean if
is it ours is absolutely not composable
is not a category but if all others are
composable then means that they have
also to be composable and also to have
assertive property and also there must
be an identity a host that basically
applying it ours to any object it will
keep the object that it is I mean this
is very basic requirement is not much so
we can do a kind of I mean I'm coming I
live in London so in London we have the
underground tube and we can imagine that
the object at the station the tube and
ours are the neighborhoods and each
others is connecting to a station and
you can compose the air hose because you
can go in there so for example if you
got from Bond Street to Oxford Circus
and then for Marxist fish goes to
Tottenham Court Road you can compose the
two hours to have an aisle
and you can keep composing them and this
is already make a category so it's
nothing really difficult and at the same
time also a functional programming
language is also category but there's a
cat take one thing that is a keeper
you have to keep in mind is that types
are objects so not the specific instance
but types like integer string or user or
whatever and function more fish master
morphine's is exactly the same as arrows
so this talk is always about hours and
movies so you have string length for
example is an hour that to take a string
and return an integer which is
incidentally the length of the string
but on a category furious that is not
really important what is important is
that you can compose without the hours
that take the integer and it was from me
some finesse one small habit for
functional programming is that
differently from mathematical we have
these things called partial function so
there are some function that undefined
for some value for example if you take a
function with the two value and divide
the first by the second the second must
be different from zero otherwise you
have an error and the possible levels
are what we call exception in our in
Java for example it could also be an
infinite loop this is also a kind of
error so this kind of means that today
is for when we talk about the category
in programming languages always this
bottom type which is kind of T reversed
that is I mean all function can also
potentially hurt on this button times
but for the sake of a composability we
kind of put this apart and they will
really don't want to
think about so this is very very I mean
if you are kind of a used to object
orientation you know there is a nice
metaphor in object oriented well what
language I mean application is a bit
alike of living like a garden of
acquiring a fish tank or something like
that well you have an object that
communicate each other they they live
their whole lives and they can transform
okay in functional programming this is
very different you have also to change
completely the metaphor because it's
something more like pipes and gears
cogwheels stuff that really have to fit
together and it's completely eight of
its work or is completely unworkable and
in object-oriented you really wanted to
keep at the state the inner state of
this stuff completely hidden and user
communication so when you communicate
with I don't know connection DB you say
you're headed I wanted to know what what
is the internal state of addy connection
you just want to say ok give me this the
user with this ad and it will return the
user and you don't want to know about
what is the one inside but unfortunate
program is the opposite I will finish
completely transparently you absolutely
see anything that is running and
everything must work with the
transformation so in object orientation
we have in inheritance as one of the
most important and podium office in
future programming we have the
composition so we can compose things
using other things but we never hide
what is inside finally in object
orientation we have interface in
functional programming we have classes
and we go back on this now the example
of this talker will be in cotton which
is not very important I mean I could
what the same talk with example in
JavaScript or Scala will be much easier
probably but I try first to have the
example in Java but it's really hard to
read and the cotton is very nice is
quite similar to Java so usually people
don't have a big shock and differently
for example from closure of Scala and
these are some the advantages on cotton
of Scoville for functional programming
so my suggestion is if you really want
to try a bit maybe using cotton is a
better idea than using Java oh we don't
go I mean some example so if you are not
completely for me just a question how
many of you are more or less familiar
with cotton in syntax okay less than
probably wanted so there is a just it's
very similar to Java but there is some
curve is there is no semicolon the type
with the question mark is a different
type than the type without question mark
with the one with the question mark is
new level the other one is not new label
but you cannot assign one to the other
if you wanted to pass a lambda you know
you have a kind of easier syntax than
Java
basically using square brackets instead
of the arrow notation instead of in Java
tender add in diva but in coding there
is a digital way to declare a variable
if it's mutable or immutable which is
quite convenient for programming and you
don't need that then you then you
keyboard if you just have a to create an
object you just use the type and pass
Department
okay but why bother I mean why we want
to do use a object-oriented language for
doing functional programming and well
there is now I don't have an answer for
that but you have to keep trying
it's a good question and but I hope that
at the end of the presentation I have
some ideas if you are using cotton there
is of course you can implement
everything yourself but it is already a
library which is already ready to do all
this example of this book and finally
there there is a proposal to add type
classes and I hindered types to
cluttering which is are two things that
we'll see later that were quite
convenient and at the moment they are
using a kind of hacker to make it work
will be much better to having
implemented in the language and there is
a disposal which also I'm cooperating
too so if you have some specific
question we can discuss later okay
purity and
immutability you know what what how many
you know what the pure function is okay
for pure function we intend a function
with us no side effect that means that
whatever are the input they determine
the output there must be no assessing to
in turn a singlet an internal state
external even print line is technically
Imperial function and of course when we
talk about this kind of composition and
mathematics all the function must be
pure because otherwise we cannot be sure
that the same input give the same result
and so all the laws that will so we are
not working and for the same reason we
have to use all immutable data so
everything that must be
we cannot use math but that we can
change so each matter must be a specific
immutable object and then if we wanted
to change something how we do we just
create a new map with just one value
different and there are some tricks so
it's not so inefficient as it sounds but
anyway just keep in time that this is
very nice and everything but at the low
level everything is still completely
mutable and unpure so all this stuff
that we wanted to do be mutable and
purity is only because we wanted to
compose them it's not available for sale
but we will go back on this one so the
first thing that the first beast that
we'll talk about is that a monoid
so basically we saw this this example of
a category so but what if we do a
category of all the owl's all the more
FISMA of a category and basically it
looks more or less like this this is
just the tool to think about so you have
a types and you kind of collapse all the
types in a single object and then
everything that works on the types
basically stick working on the same
object so you have a category with just
one object and a lot of ours that works
on the target and so when we have a this
house must all be ours of the same kind
of type like for example incremental so
we have something that take the object
and the return and this kind of a
composition so if we compose the one
incrementer with the second
incrementally we have a like plus two or
we compose again we have a plus three
and ever and this is also
interesting because theoretically this
is how they define at the set of natural
numbers from logic to category theory to
mathematics this is quite radical but we
have at this idea of Menard someone ID
is something that allows to compose ours
and if you want to really squint enough
we can also say that the tuple map is a
kind of monarchy because I love that too
quickly composer hours between the
places and when we have in the code
let's see how we have something that if
it's a monoid there must be something
that allows to combine and have an empty
value so the empty value is the
beginning so we can start and we have
something that allows us to combine at
you two hours together and we see some
good example but first let's go back a
second about this discussion about the
type class and interfaces interfaces
when we have an interface is something
that we have the two types
captain dogs and we say there are both
animals and what can you do with two
animals probably they can mate each
other but if we created a category
interface animal we can define some
abstract method and then have a
implementation but the specific week and
when you use the interface we kind of
lose if it's a cut of dog because we
just wanted to talk about anymore and
the idea of interface is basically to
hide the details and to have a kind of
higher level instead in functional
programming with never either the
details so what do we do with the tag
classes is basically same these types
have a kind of similar class and when we
talk about classes nothing to do with
the class is a I
types is like a class in object-oriented
this is a bit confusing so third class
is a bit like meta class in object
orientation but with the top class we
said we have a kind of types with a kind
of similar way to behave so we wanted to
to say something generally about these
types but we don't hide the types so if
we say that the cats and dog both share
the mate type class while the turf
grasses in instance that allows to mate
that means still keeper that the cats
made with cats and dogs made with dogs
and if you think about also when we have
a equal method in Java we can do any
object equal to any other object but
probably what we really like is to say
that a specific object of a specific
class can also be equal to its own class
I mean doesn't make any sense to say
that any integer is equal to a string I
mean ideally we really wanted to have a
compiler higher then there is an object
orientation the concept of inheritance
but we don't have any returns in
functional programming so we don't
really have to worry about eye level but
let's skip about type classes interfaces
are similar but very different and type
class have the instance and it's a way
to say that when we talk we talk about
some before we can say that this somehow
we don't say that some is a monoid we
say that some as a monoid instance
because you can create a decent answer
to allows two to combine that you do
some and also the technically when we
talk about our code the instance will be
well we syllabus this is more less how
do you write a monoid in cottony with
some DD laws basically to explain the
laws and there is the instance
is this Minaj string and the monitoring
it Justinian's us of course to
concatenate the string oh you can also
have a monoid integer that to some some
integer and you can combine them yeah
you can combine them also form a list
and then go and all this recombine
method our method of the instance that
in this way you can make sure that it
works only on the same type I mean I
know that I'm very quickly but if
there's any question specific please
stop me anyway this is just to give you
a kind of idea
let's pretending that we care about but
now the second most the second entity
that the second type trusted that we are
going to meet is the factor and while
monarda allows us to combine two hours
functor basically allows us to transform
transform something in something else
and technique usually the definition of
factor is something that transform
novice from one category to another
category but it's also can work in the
same category but still preserving the
property because find are more less like
the toss forma so they can transform
something in something else
keeping the the properties and the
factor is the most important concept of
this talk if you've tried well later and
you don't know exactly still try to
understand a functor first because once
you understand factor all the highs the
kind of fitting place everything is that
we are talking basically it will be
factors also monitor and
and the fact I have this kind of loss
also slows and basically said that if
you to transform in a factories at doing
a map and you probably already know
mapper because it's already in Java ater
with the streams and another lot of
other libraries but the idea of a map is
a bad factor so also this talk is about
if you learn a bit about the category
theory it's also a bit easier to
understand the new libraries and
frameworks so the ladies that if you
haven't an added function and that just
an ID function is a function that
returns the same value that he put us in
input it must be guaranteed that a DX is
equal x so you can have something map
that say if something then do something
else
or other value plus one or stuff like
that must be exactly apply the function
Tony and if you are composing to
function must be exactly the same result
that apply map on one function and the
other function then compose the result
and before London I was living in Milano
and we can kind of imagine that to give
you an idea of a factor that we have a
factor that the movie plays from Milano
to London so we have a drama the main
Church him in and we move to some poll
the Costello becomes the tower London
but also he became Buckingham Palace but
we can also move the arrow so if we have
announced that say going from dwama to
Palazzo Holly our phantom must be able
to those from this is that go-to from
simple to Buckingham Palace
I mean we don't care about that it is
but this is how Frank Thursday they
translate about the de kipper structure
and also must be identical if we apply
one
that Purdue to another I mean if you go
from dominocus toilet and Pulitzer
Harlem must be exactly the same result
that frança standard a lot so hell and
then and warmer to castella
and when we talk about programming
because we said that our programming
language is a single category all the
factor that we have basically are the
factor in our category because we were
not performing from one language to
another
so it those are functional Arcola and
the function because basically the same
in the same category but even if they
stay in the same category there is a
kind of transformation because that is a
defunct idea so what we basically do we
will something we create a type based on
another type because we remember that in
category types are the object so we take
one type but that will be like a doii
Milan and we create a new type that will
be like and what we call generics in
Java in the functional one that we call
the typical start because the idea is
that in Java we kind of tend to see
something like list of T whatever st
like a generic abstraction of a list in
functional word instead we focus on the
list of T is just the a constructor that
allows us to construct to create a to
build specific types like list of inter
inter stop string and everything what we
cannot do in Java which is is a
beautiful functional programming
perspective is that we can say I want a
list of a of a be can be like a list of
a side-table integer I mean we can have
a list of set of integer but we cannot
live a and B as a generics we can only
have a one lover
generics in Java Oh in functional
programming what we use a lot is that to
not specify the second in level so we
say this is a list of something that
needs something else so it can be a list
of a sector that will be or some
specific type or can be a list of lists
of a specific type or other stuff like
that and this concept like genetics of
genetics and epigenetics is called I are
kinda types and it's quite useful when
we do operational factor because if
factor is something that take an ax and
the return a list of a if we wanted to
take a factor of a functor you need to
be able to generalize more and this is
something that they are discussing now
to put inside the country but right now
there is a kind of hacker so it kind of
work and this is how factor works so
probably one of the most useful example
in and you probably already know about
because it's quite useful is a this time
how many of you have heard about that
they try yes
it's basically is an idea of type class
over the exception so instead of having
something that they can return an
exception which is something that you
remember the button type something that
we really don't want in unfortunate
programming we we usually try and so
they try with degree wrap around the D
computation and can return a success
like in the first case or a failure in
this way instead of a returning like an
integer but can be also an error we can
return a try of an integer that will
happen in turn but the word point of a
factor is that post formation remember
so let's go back
another way to see a factor is called
the D lift the forklift so if you have a
function that goes from A to B they say
from integer to string you can have a
factor that was from something that they
go from FDA to FDB for example for a
list of integer to a list of string and
in this way basically we transform at
the try on of a string in in a try of a
number of an integer which is completely
stupid at this example but if you think
that you can take a de tie from a
previous calculation store in variable
and then perform in another try it can
be actually useful because you can just
the other try to to do something else
and okay this is a bit this is quite a
difficult to understand the first time
you can also have a functor not only
over a type but of a function so you
have a function in this case that take a
URL and the return a connection with it
B which is something like that we will
do probably with the dependency
injection and what you can do you can
create a functor that is called ojeda
because it's kind of a typical factor
one of the most famous most useful and
basically you do this one that you
created ojeda with the factor that you
want then
Johanna basically start the factor and
then you can use the basically toss from
the result so you can use this method to
to get the result that you want in this
case that the username of course their
code like this system circuit without
any point but you have to remember that
you can compose and you have a you can
pass stuff around
and then you can have the injection of
the company stream connection for
something completely different module
that do the actual logic okay another
step so we have a de function that was
from data we have a defunct us that it
was from functions so what if we want to
transform a functors we have something
that is called natural transformation so
going back to our example if we wanted
to switch from London to Paris we have a
factor that goes from a lot so Holly to
Buckingham Palace and another factor
that goes from Palazzo Holly to
Versailles because that is a de Paris
subcategory and it's the same with with
the church but then what they want to
say okay let's take one factor like
Buckingham Palace and transform in
Versailles and this is a kind of
operation transformation over the
factors which is called a natural
transformation and explanatory
transformation is something that this
came before category theory is from
Mathematica on on the code is something
that is quite trivial to be honest which
is basically we have destroyed that we
talked before and the weekend off from
destroy in an option which is another
another type class or we can assert us
format the option in the list so
basically we have a try into a list and
this is a natural transformation and if
the try is a positive value something
like three to enter is a positive trial
I mean it's a success try we have a
delta stir with the same three but if
this is something that it cannot be
taught from an integer so will be an
exception those four meaning list will
be an empty list of course doing this
transformation we lose the information
about the the exception for example in
this case there could be some illusion
but the structure is a month
okay yeah nobody's sleeping yeah what if
and now we put the together
the idea of monoid and the factor that
we saw till now so my night is about the
two to combine the two things and we can
combine it to factor in basically two
ways one is a like addition so we have
something of something else so we have a
function inside the factor a value
inside the function we put it together
on the other is that we have the
multiplication so we put the function
inside another factor let's see the
first case first so basically if let's
just look at the the last point if you
have a function that from A to B and a
functor away we can create a factor of B
we can also create if you have this the
second way is exactly the identical way
to is you can transform easily and it's
useful if you have a function with two
parameter and the for example with the
code this is we use the duplicative in
black is our instance and we can
transform some tries in example of try
so basically we combine we combine the
top old function have a multiple
parameter and so we can combine multiple
a functor in a single factor which is a
the success of the failure which is as
inside the top but okay let's on the
other side what we did the same fix of a
monoid and we have this idea of okay
let's create a category with all the end
of anthos we need that no factors
because we need to compose
each other so it cannot be functor from
a category to another they must work on
the same category so we have all this
and the factor and we create a new
category with only the end of factor and
this is what is a moment Amanda is
nothing as that the idea of composing
together the end effector exactly in the
same way that the monoid
composed together the faction and the
Mon and the main method at the unity
which is something that allows her to
create an amount in the first place and
the multiplication so something that if
you have a factor of another factor of a
we can kind of collapse the two factor
and have been justified in a kind of
mathematical notation they have a disk
and of they can declare Lomu the
multiplication and Etta the creation and
they say that that diagram commuted that
means that everything must be exactly
the same and these are a graphical way
to explain at the laws of the moment and
so there is a many kind of manners which
are just the most useful and kind of
famous one
nothing implement you to extend up to if
you have some specific requirement so
each month basically has the basic
monitor package the one that we saw the
creation and the multiplication
multiplication is called a flat map and
also all the monitors applicative so
they also have the supply and also the
older monitor Franco so all the models
also have a map and on top of that each
of this monitor has a specific something
specific to this specific manner that
allows you to do some
some operation on a bit more the
probability most important historically
it's been the I am honored the last from
the one from last because it's the mana
that are lost in functional programming
to do side effect for example if we
wanted to read the from the standard
about standard in vitae to the standard
out and that's bring us to the bindings
which is a kind of dance of a moment
that is a really different that kind of
a we knew that the functional
programming 102,000 so and basically
what bindings allows us is if we have
this composition of Manas for example we
wanted to have a disk i/o monitor to go
to fetch a stuff of homicide then from
if student we want to get a university
from the University wanted to get the
Dean we have a to created this stranger
I mean not so nice flat map by nesting
stuff but using the bindings function we
can basically flatten that and be sure
that when this final band of his this
line basically we refer to the previous
element but not to the previous element
but to the same are your monitor and
let's see a specific code example which
is alright again with the reader monitor
and if you have a function that got the
user had be given a DB connection which
is the that user from context and not
that when we write to get yourself in
context we really don't have nothing
about the DB connection we just have
know that it is an interface that they
become that there will be some
implementation behind so this is kind of
object orientation hiding
stuff and then when we bind basically we
can bind together with the space and
having something like that say do you
say wanna get Frankie user took at the
journey then combine that the two names
and then when this Evie that is
evaluated this is something specific to
cotton you don't need that in Haskell
but adjust basically what's happened is
that the bindings is creating in
parallel so if it's possible at least it
will fetch both of them in parallel and
then it two hands all the stuff it wants
on a specific the big connection that we
can define later but because if we were
on adjust to the first block just to
de'vide Amanat we can defy the until we
call evaluation on we don't do
absolutely anything so we can keep
composing our logic without going to the
database and only when we have a prepare
- Lee put outside let's say and someone
else will hang stuff on a specific
database and we get the return so how we
can use them or fishman here what
programming right we can still explore
this one thing that we need to think
about is that yeah
purity and all the stuff that we saw is
very nice and everything but is not the
gold foster and perfectly pure
programming are perfectly useless
remember that I mean the whole point of
a purity immutability is only that
allows us to compose the stuff and then
run aside but there is not that the pure
as a some value for sale because at the
end we wanted to solve problems real
problems for here customer and for
example one market kind of architecture
not design that I think that it works
quite well is that if you have this kind
of purity
bubbles then you can pass this tougher
between actors and the actors will do
some dirty work this is also I mean
inspired by our language is working
mullis's so you keep at the deep unity
on the model composition and that's why
you want the purity Motability umbrella
but when you do I tell you go outside
the bubble then you do the side effect
works and you go to fetch data so we
already have it to the conclusion why
functional programming and I don't think
it's because God is it that way I mean
even after I'm doing this stuff for some
years now and I still struggle to to hit
the decoder the first time and so it's
not that that's the point but I'm still
quite convinced that is a really good
thing and so this is kind of a
comparison and then left is the good
things and the right is the bad things
about functional programming what I see
that when you do functional programming
you start to think much more about the
data that you have the problem that you
have to solve
you don't put kind of corner case under
the carpet until later
you have to compose this transformation
and take all the possible result and try
to have types that actually reflected
the data that you need and this
definitely compelled the less bugs and
the much less testing because most of
the unit tests that we were I mean
already big fan of unit testing but most
of unit test is kind of a corner cases
we want to test that all the possible
Canaries when we work with functional
programming basically with tens not
having Canaries so doing testing I mean
it's um how many kind of different
number you want to put the because there
is really no connected
you really want to test it does a
simplified Cohen say and I found that
you really have a less box but you
really takes more time to go at that
point and at some point that they state
that via program because we are doing we
are programs that solver here at
partners it's very complicated that's
why I kind of suggest that actors idea
that the purity bubbles are not so too
big because otherwise you have really
struggled to keep a very very context at
some point they state it became so
complicated that it's really an
apartment okay and there has some
performance issue but don't be afraid
because I mean it's performance issue if
you want to do something like a video
game or we all time incredibly fast
stuff I mean you really want to squeeze
out any cycle from the CPU in that case
functional programming a state some
problem but if you do number four for
gaming like taking stuff from the be
operating using the output the overhaul
double filter program is basically
nothing I mean doing a REST API using
functional style on a style has
absolutely no change in the performance
so okay we assume that they convince
someone about me what about category
theory I think that if you are kind of
serious on functional programming you
should at least give a try to stay the
category theory because it's really
really important and really to learn how
to think about that and to kind of train
your mind on the kind of shape a
transformation and keep all this stuff
in your head which is a very very
difficult not difficult but it's very
different from object orientation and
also that is a bit alike
design patterns in object orientation
that design pattern something that you
should imagine from your cordis not
something that I'm going to write a
builder of a strategy of a bridge with
the facade but something that you could
the kind of tense there and then you
clean up in the same way Manas and other
type classes should really emerge from
your code so you start overwriting some
functional code and then you say hey
this piece I can simplify and a place of
discord with just a moment because I'm
just generalizing on a general concept
okay any questions this is some links if
you wanted to to learn more ok yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
well that that's bender how this is the
same thing that in scholar you do with
the for comprehension in Haskell you do
with the do notation and that's depend
how is implemented how the binding
instance is created and I think there
are already in that I mean is going in
that library is also a bad to
implementation one is a parallel and one
is one is congruent a one is a non
congruent and of course yeah also future
is a kind of monolith if you want so you
can combine those okay thank you very
badly and any question you can tweet me
or email log blog whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
