I started divorce four kids are Africa
an initiative to just teach program
introduced programming to kill children
from a very young age so basically
programming electronics and robotics the
fundamental reason why I started this
initiative is because a lot of our
children when they grow they finish high
school they go to the back universities
or tertiary education various fields now
introduces programming on as a first
year subject because the world is vastly
changing and we are moving into a more
technological age than the industry even
you know introducing technology into the
various field and it might even replace
so because there's a there's a demand
for programming and technology it is
wise to introduce programming to young
children so that they can get an
overview of what programming is about
and as I grow up in life then they would
actually know that what other subjects
is required on top of programming
basically trying to introduce it to
young children and hopefully they have
an interest in future interest into
programming into engineering into
robotics and
and into other scientific fields or stem
field as well so that's a reason for
debacle kids
it's a international initiative so
studied in Belgium be 2012 and here yep
debonair or someone wanted to learn
pogrom me from this daddy unified
materials I started it they are our
various levels for kids event also in
Africa some in Morocco I mean Algeria
some in Tunisia there's also one in
South Africa so it's not only here it's
also worldwide ok so basically to the in
today's event senses are our very first
day we want to just get out the kids
should be interested in to program it so
the first activity they're doing is our
earth where they actually do programming
but using blocks so each block contains
up behind the contents of account so
basically what they do is they play game
and then the game as a has a problem to
be solved and what I do is say they're
both solution using blocks and they run
it to see if actually the block of code
that I've written or they're both as we
solve the problem the second activity
it's also similar to the first one which
is a scratch like programming event but
it's called called code combat basically
what they do is it's also again where
each activity is also a problem-solving
challenge and what they do is they type
code so they will learn now how we in an
industry in a programming industry
actually build solutions or soft
solutions using code so basically the
whole type code there will be a problem
written on the screen they have to
physically type code on the computer and
then run it and then if it solve it they
can go to the next activity and then
after lunch the kids will learn a bit of
html5 css3 and JavaScript so HTML if for
those who don't know is basically the
Internet so everything follows 90% of
the information nowadays can be found on
the Internet and the way it's presented
is through websites and websites are
built using HTML so we trying to teach
them how to build a basic website using
HTML HTML is even used on smart phones
these days
so most of apps runs HTML at the
background so we're trying to give them
that
building blocks on how to good website
today in future they might put you know
smart apps for the phone using HTML many
industries use that Google Facebook
Microsoft both with the application
using HTML so we tryna teach kids how to
build very small websites with HTML and
the quarter cosmetic provided we just
gonna go skim through it and then I'll
have like an hour to try to create
website of their own and see how
creative they come up with and hopefully
they enjoy it at the end of the day and
then we also got present we've got
certificates to hand them you know yeah
so basically it's ought to have fun to
that and see how far it goes that was
for kids we want to take it to the next
level so right now we trying to
introduce programming because in the in
the fields of electronics and robotics
and whatever programming is is one of
the core fundamental building blocks
into engineering and robotics so where
we wanna see for now is trying to
educate guilty to various fields of
technology into robotics into
engineering and then even even make it a
bit bigger so DevOps for kids is
basically given them building blocks we
wanted we want to teach as many things
that we know that we use every day to
the kids and then let's see how far they
go so
that's how far we want to see us out
going and hopefully by the grace of God
we can make it work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
