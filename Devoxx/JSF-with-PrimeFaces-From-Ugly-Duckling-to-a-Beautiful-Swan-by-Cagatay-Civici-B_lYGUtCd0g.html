face session thanks for choosing
primefaces
for for this hour my name is cha tae
it's a hard name to pronounce so I'm a
JavaServer faces expert group member
since JSF - the dough and now we are
working on JSF 2.3 also I'm the founder
of the prime phase project that I'll
talk about right now so little word on
prime tech prime phase is an open source
project but it is backed by a company an
open source support a company called
prime Tech which is focuses on
primefaces
and its previous foundation and it is
related products so any any prime phase
users can anyone raise their oh Allah
okay so it is a seven years old project
started in 2009 in November and that was
the fourth I guess birthday of a cake
from the fourth birthday of primefaces
and it's a quite lightweight library the
reason one of the reasons why we created
primefaces was we were using other
libraries but they were not really
performing well from our perspective we
were facing some you know slowness so
what we decided to do is that cried
something lightweight that when you add
primefaces to your project you don't
feel any you know difference before and
after and one of the reasons why it is
quite popular is it's easy to use so
that primefaces can handle this complex
UI requirements so that you can focus on
the business side of the things it's one
jar file it's small jar file like three
megabytes right now and it requires no
it doesn't require in the dependencies
you can just add the jar
and going with it of course there are
some optional dependencies like for PDF
export there's a dependency to ITEX and
so on another nice feature is that we
are following Java is configuration by
exception design everything is
configured by default but if you want to
change it you can change it easily but
by default you can just you just need
that the library to your class path as I
mentioned since 7 years old we get a
nice rate of adoption most enterprises I
mean prophase is kind of for enterprises
anyway so the users and the clients of
ours are from enterprises so from banks
financial institutions automotive sector
and you know especially insurance as
well so most of these companies are
users and clients of primefaces
and they're also in Belgium we have a
couple of clients especially in
governments lately a government agencies
in Europe and United States also picking
primefaces for their products for their
projects as I know as a major project it
is easy to find you know information
cycle if you go on Stack Overflow there
are a lot of questions and answers also
on LinkedIn or in the job post so it's
there's a high demand on primefaces
especially in the world for example
there's an job post for this one's from
Boston in the United States in the
Europe as well so it's important that
when you are looking for a prime phase
developer for your project it is not
that hard but for example we are we made
a job post like three months ago looking
for a JavaScript front-end developer
that is harder to find at least in
Turkey
so Dizon has recently published the web
framework Paul that is web payment
running on JVM and it turns out it's I
think this has been asked for two
thousand people from different countries
and JSF and spring MVC are the two
popular choices still I mean JSF the
tank
is old technology and it's after ten
years it is still quite popular which is
interesting if you disclose to their
landscape of today's web technologies
likely you get a JavaScript Java scream
work every month right and it's followed
by spring MVC and Vikatan other
frameworks as well so using this you
know 34%
what are the competitors inside JSF
landscape joseph has a big ecosystem
right so in this case we have a couple
of competition competitors rich faces
from JBoss Reddit and Ice faces rich
faces is not very active anymore they
are in maintenance mode and I spaces as
well weird thing is ice faces is a fork
of primefaces 3 I guess so it's
interesting point so there's prime faces
for co-prime faces and rich ways there's
also Oracle ADF faces which is less
popular than these so it's like natural
selection when one species goes up in
this ecosystem the others are going down
so this means that if you are choosing
prime faces so if you are choosing JSF
then it is likely to choose prime face
as well in that 34 percent there's also
a nice Omni faces library anyone heard
of Omni faces it's a nice utility
library from two great guys so it is a
global project so this photo has been
taken somewhere any guesses India no no
yeah so you can see the stickers price
stickers at the rear window of the these
are developers and users of prices they
posted this on Facebook group so I was
very surprised that I mean it's
thousands of kilometers away it shows
the power of open source and they are
they they just printed the sticker and
put them on their cars so so
if I will just describe some stats and
move on to y-prime faces is used in this
country so in Brazil it's crazy popular
more than doubled time of the you know
in United States so this is from October
2015 from visitors to primefaces org and
it's followed by United States and
Germany in German it's also really
popular and followed by European
countries France Spain Italy and then
Turkey as well but in South America it's
kinda crazy popular some some stats
about adoption
so last version has been downloaded by
one hundred and fifty thousand times so
assuming that a a project has maybe five
developers ten sometimes one developer
so we might maybe project it to maybe 1
million users at least maybe and in our
website we get close to more than
100,000 users and interesting thing is
that we are of course monitoring it and
it is increasing so this is what
surprises me somehow I mean as an old
technology maybe this is because we've
fixed JSF into version 2 so so that it
became usable and product to finally and
with 2 point 2 there are a lot of nice
features for you know enterprise
requirements like faces flaws or HTML
markup swear you can use a simple HTML
instead of tags in case you don't like
to reexamine syntax and again as I
mentioned this is kind of interesting to
see increases so enough with the
introduction what is primefaces this is
primefaces actually anything Amit
practices set of UI components right and
they are lately responsive they can work
they adjust the screen widths they look
great
which wasn't the case maybe two years
ago and now they look great and modern
there are charts and all tabs accord
there are more than 100,000 sorry 100
components but probably in a regular
project you you would need around maybe
50 of them but you know some project
requires charts some project requires a
signature component and so on and we are
lately using the latest underlying
technologies like css3 and html5 and so
on you can also do stuff like this if
you are bored like us this is called
fake operating system for from Apple
this is what you see on the screen our
JSF components actually it's a web page
I will show you a quick demo as well
browser support is we are spending a lot
of time on browser support like we
support almost late latest versions of
Chrome Firefox and all that things and
for IE of course it's a problem we start
from IE 8 so IE 7 is not supported
partially supported actually it works
but if there's if a bug occurs we don't
just spend our weekends to fix it so
this is the idea of primefaces when
developing rich UI's the most of the
time time spend on creating or learning
these technology of course it is great
to learn these technologies slow down so
you can just tweak things and change
things and adjust things but most of the
time for the boilerplate that where you
need to repeat yourself writing CSS
JavaScript from scratch primefaces
handles that but important thing is that
since these are like someone else's code
how do you have can you adjust them to
your own is how can you change the look
and feel it's easy to override CSS sorry
and there is a JavaScript I where you
can change the behaviors and call widget
api's and callbacks are probably the
most important things so that you can
who can even
right well you can change it behavior so
this is called schedule for example it's
like a Google Calendar like components
so how it works on the jsf side there's
a piece schedule and of course you can
create it with new schedule API as well
will be to Java API and we render a
simple div and with an ID and the script
part is widget we call these small
widgets like cousins of components
compounds are server-side instances but
widgets are client-side instances and
the widget handles the Dom rendering
event binding Ajax everything else so
it's quite light weights you don't get
are tons of markup for this component
and interesting thing is that the event
and data is sent with as JSON so it's
not it's quite lightweight to use this
component so we are trying to keep
things small and lightweight instead of
a lot of markup we usually create the UI
with at the client side with jQuery
primefaces is jQuery based so accessible
rich Internet applications is quite hot
these days is hot topic these days and
we are spending a lot of time because
there are laws in Europe and United
States like section 508 where if the web
page should be accessible to handicapped
users like for example if you are using
spinner you have to make it accessible
with mouse so that you can increment and
decrement values with mouse if a person
cannot use a mouse and but you can focus
on it with tab key and use arrow keys if
the user is blind you need to make sure
that this compound is readable by screen
readers for example a a complex
component like accordion panel we need
to tell screen reader not to read those
collapsed one so that we need to add
this Aria attribute so we are spending a
lot of time in and in the next version
as well many components that are not
accessible will be accessible by the
next version but the evil who starts
pants
a lot of time on these this topic is
wrong so Ajax in Jessup is quite easy
right you just declare what to update
and what the process in primefaces we
have added some extensions at
server-side we are using standard ApS
but at the client side we are using
jQuery based so that we can extend so
what are the extensions probably the
users proprieties users in this room
already use some of them one of my
favorites is selectors so in in
courgettes if you can only reference
components by it with their IDs but in
jessup you can use jQuery selectors like
updates that last form on the page using
the last Auto selector so it's so that
you don't need to bother with the IDs
and I ID selection is quite slower
compared to jQuery based selectors as
well
resource handling Primus has a lot of
CSS and JavaScript so you need to make
sure it is optimized we compress them we
merge them and send them to the client
gzip is also available and on-the-fly
loading is quite interesting if the
component cannot find its resource on
the page meaning that you have created
it dynamically and edit it with your
Java code like when you do in swing
programming where you can add a button
or a table its resources will be added
automatically so it's fix a lot of
problems so this demo is also available
online this is called prime faces
showcase let me show that fake so this
is the fake Mac or Mac OS X so so this
is the growl component and this is the
dialog I guess this is the actual one
alright they change it then this is
based on the older version and let's say
let's check out the terminal this is
real terminal right and this is also a
jester component well you can just get
the commands and respond
so there's a Java method so then if you
check out the source we have a menu bar
at the top and dialogue and forum and so
on so this is as I mentioned this
selector API for example in primefaces
we can just say update all the forms or
update last form update any thing on the
page that has the UI panel style class
so this is jQuery as I mentioned in JSF
Ajax is declared the right so we can
just say update all the inputs at the
panel but except the Select tag for
example this one say update every input
but not to select so you can even write
expressions the one often nice feedback
we get from the users are that these
search algorithms or search features of
preface is quite powerful compared to
the plane ID based approach of GSS so
for example you have this P autocomplete
component where you type something and
you get selections so there's a complete
method here for example if you can see
and whatever you type that is pasture
here and you can just hit the database
to load data and that's it it's like up
two lines or four lines but if you want
something more complex you can say okay
I need to select multiple ones so you
can set multiple to true and here in
that case you can the component will
allow you to add multiple and add so
it's easy as setting multiple to true
but for us it just took like maybe two
weeks but as a user it is easy as
setting multiple to true so this is the
idea of there's an attribute for almost
everything again select one for example
I'm there's so many components that
sometimes cannot find them so for
example this is a piece eloquent mini
which is editable skinnable you cannot
filters so you can just say okay I need
some filtering and some nice effects for
example so you can add filtering it
could be editable and so on and a nice
component lately that the about it is
signature so we have been getting
requests that you need to sign some form
like like like a CAPTCHA or you can just
say okay I need a piece signature and I
need the basic step or or the JSON
encoded signature as the value here so
we passed that string so you can just
say dev oxic I couldn't write it and you
get it at the JSON so you can just
persistent database and so on okay
moving on there are a lot of data
components for example in the data table
if you just need a page inator
you can just say paginated true of
course right and we get a page inator
if you need sorting okay I need columns
with sort pi and I need multiple sorting
through so we get sorting and you can do
multiple sorting as well the same thing
goes for filtering it is easy setting as
filter to true and we get filters and
it's quite easy because primefaces does
the filtering for it if you want to do
the filtering you assume that you have 1
million records in the database there's
a lazy loading method so that you can
only load a certain chunk of data
instead of all the 1 million records
this is lazy loading if you want to drag
and drop columns you can just say drag
book columns true or draggable rows
through you get events and in case your
users are used to excel it's as easy
said ok editable true and
that's it actually editable true just
makes these cells editable and sounds
data back to the Bekaa if you need that
data grid for the same presentation it's
as simple as changing that tag name with
a data grid instead of data table you
can have data grid so this is one of the
nice new components it's called diagram
that is a diagram model and you can just
add endpoints create shapes and make
them you know connect them and so on
you drag and drop them you can create
your own charts and flowcharts these
were draggable so they are quite easy
because there's a Java API it lists is
one of my favorite components where you
can move things around and it's also
responsive for example if you just you
know make it smaller the buttons icons
everything just adjust itself so assume
that you need a three component right
here is a three of course there's a
bacon model right with the nodes and
valuate children to note and we had a
requirement from a customer saying that
I need that three horizontally okay in
that case here we have a horizontal tree
and to do that you need to set
orientation horizontal but it took one
month to do this for example the same
thing but words on there are a lot of
weird stuff going on behind the scenes
connecting those lines was very hard and
you know regular stuff that you expect
from a compound street like dialogues or
the tooltips menus I think we have more
than 10 menus for example context menus
slide menu I guess it was the high pot
like menu and we had a tiered menu and a
lot of menus so in charts as well we are
using Jakob plot it's old
everything is you know open-source and
included so you don't need to you know
of course you can use high charts or
some other charts that are paid but
these are quite easy to use as well
supports a lot of chart methods you can
even take your photo with primefaces
yes if the chrome ok chrome didn't allow
me to do that much
okay I have another demo with the photo
camp probably to work all the image
choleric galleries and everything all
included so you don't need to look for a
jQuery plug-in to do some imaging and so
on okay so file upload you know it's a
time taking process you need to get the
file write some filters or use the
native API in practices you just need to
say okay give me a file upload and for
example drag and drop so here I have a
file that I credit before the demo so if
I drop it on the browser it will just
display it right but if I drop it on the
component I can just upload it there's
an auto upload as well so when you drop
we can just upload it it is easy as drag
drop support true and all these any
prophase compound or any JSF compound or
any HTML and can be draggable droppable
and you can get what has been dragged
and dropped at the server side so that
you can create you guys like this as
well and some interesting components
that you might not need every day but
you can block a certain part of the page
with block UI so you can block a
component and unblock its to prevent
user access or we have this cache
component so assume that you have this
menu on the left and header on the
header at the top instead of rendering
and using the CPU to render that stuff
you can use the advantages of
server-side rendering okay and just say
okay just cache this part of the page so
that it will be loaded from the you can
plug in multiple cache implementations
as well like e-education hazel cast as
well so
that was a time that I was able to show
all the components I think in in 2010
presentation we had like ten of compton
components so now it's impossible okay
dialog framework this is more like an
enterprise feature as well it's kinda a
single page application kind of thing
where you can stay on one page and
include other pages and render them in a
dialogue so you are on one page you need
to select some data from other pages and
come back instead of just navigating
between pages you can just say okay open
dialog open this target XHTML using open
dialog API from primefaces
and then we generate the dialog you
don't need to use p dialog we just
generate something some a dialog for you
and then move the target X exists ml
inside and then open it and then you can
just get data and test it back to the
master page that calls this for example
here we have I'm on this data XHTML and
I need to select some car so this is the
select car with a data table inside what
I do is that when I click this button
I'm just adding using this open dialog
and saying that I need to open so this
one line creates a dialogue gets that
select car page and movies moves it
inside and it opens like this so this is
actually another page right so when I
click this symbol it takes that car and
sends it back to that main page which is
behind the scenes so here you can just
say okay I'm on the dialog and calling
close dialog by passing that selected
car and here I can get it on car chosen
a call back you can define what callback
to execute so you can create a flow with
multiple pages and you can stay on the
same page so it's kind of SP a it is one
of the popular features so anyone had
requirements on client side violation
when working with JSF or when
working with some one some some other
framework client-side violation
yeah probably many of you add because it
is quite you know stupid to go to the
server to see if a field is empty or not
right so in front JSF has that I mean
JSF does its violations on the server
side
there's no client-side validation there
has been some attempts but they are like
half-baked solutions so in primefaces we
have a very nice and majored client-side
validation framework it's quite easy to
use because you don't need to do
anything you just need to say enable
client-side validation you can of course
disable it right at any level you want
so in JSF we have these attributes like
required saying that that field cannot
be empty or validate double range or for
dates we have converters and so on so
these tags they do their job at the
server-side but in primefaces they can
also do it at the client-side so let me
show you one example here the basic one
so here you can see that this p input
text is required the other one has to be
between 5 and 8 so there is nothing
really specific to the client-side
validation the button just has welded
client true so it is actually can be
enabled by a context parameter but this
attribute is useful if you want to you
know disable it for that button so and
this last button has it disabled you can
see that this is disabled so I'm just
adding some numbers and some things and
calling so as you can see there is no
you know post to the server everything
is happening on the client side and it's
quite fast and we have this mmm the
components ingested they're rendered by
a Java renders it serves that but we
have this client side renders well we
render the compound at the client side
so that the look
feel the same for example if I to decide
to make the validation and search side
you can see page is posted but the UI
same so that the users do not see
anything different between client-side
validation and server-side validation
and we have taken this step one step
further and integrated it with bean
validation so instead of defining your
constraints at the exit stream at the
page level we can just define these
constraints with the data as a metadata
right so that name should be minimum of
two and five and that pass stage should
be before now and you can have regular
expressions and so on as well so in that
case the page is simpler right because
you don't need to have any JSF related
tag so what we do is that we get that
data parse the annotations and send them
to the client-side with html5 data
attributes so in that case here so this
is a form as you can see there is no
nothing related to validation here no
required Novell date because everything
is here with today with the properties
so and for example name should be
minimum 25 characters right so if I type
something client-side validation is
triggered and saying that that name
doesn't have enough correct characters
so it is quite easy to do that and
assume that your requirement has changed
now they're saying okay we are expecting
accepting one character as well we just
need to change the annotation value to
one and then the whole UI you don't need
to go to the pages and change your
validations so and it is quite easy to
write your own validations clients are
validations for example assuming that
you have an email annotation so you have
a custom annotation called email and
whenever you put this on a field
JSF can do validation for your custom
annotation so for example you need to
write a email validator here of course
glance at relations I help write you for
security validation should always be
execute to the server side as well but
this is the part that it handles it and
you also need to add your JavaScript
validator to prime faysville later
client-side API so you can easily extend
client client-side EPS and implement
your own
okay so themes primefaces has a theme
engine there are two types of themes one
is community themes which are based on
theme roller they are free and there are
so premium themes which are designed by
a professional designer so community
teams I think there are around 40 of
them
they are mostly themed roller based but
we also created some for example if you
are migrating from which phases there is
a rich phases theme so that your UI will
look the same but the back end will be
primefaces
and there is a Twitter bootstrap theme
if you like that blueish default theme
of bootstrap and want to make sure that
your page application looks like any
other application on the web these days
you can use Twitter bootstrap and so on
there's also Metro UI so this is the
bootstrap theme so this is simple jar
file you added to your application and
your application looks like bootstrap
sometimes people can confuse that
primefaces based on bootstrap but they
are not based on boo stuff you're just
using as a team it has a theme there's
also Metro UI as well available so
installing a theme is quite easy you
just need to download the jar from the
primefaces
repository and edit your class pet
configure that XML saying that okay
previous team should be re stock and so
on
so let me show one of the three themes
so this is a page with a lot of
components right data tables everything
and we can just say for example
bootstrap and the components start
looking like bootstrap and for example
we have also some a lot of free themes
for example you can have dark themes but
you can see that as of 2015 they are
kind of looking a bit outdated right
because they are based on theme roller
which is itself kinda require some work
to create more modern themes so if you
don't like the available themes you can
create your own using the designer we
have decided to depend on team roller
from jQuery so you just need to open the
designer and for example say ok I need
my header background to be blue kind of
bluish color or maybe red you can choose
borders text colors icons and content
should be not sure why this doesn't work
buttons and everything so I assume that
you spend more time and created a better
looking theme you just need to download
this theme and it will give you a jar
file and that jar file is a theme roller
zip file but they are so it takes a
process to convert that to a jar
primefaces theme luckily our community
members created a tool called theme
roller to primefaces theme you just log
on to this website and upload that zip
file it will give you a jar file so it's
quite easy you just need to design your
theme with the pet palette and upload to
that website and you get your nice theme
and start using there's also the premium
ones which are these usually take like
one month to create but the nice thing
is that this is not just theme we also
provide layout so that for nice-looking
menus for
there's headers logging pages error
pages everything needed to you know
those popular bootstrap layouts
templates that you see they we also do
something like that especially for
primefaces so there's a theme for that
components and also the layout for the
menus and everything so there are seven
of them right now
one is Sentinel these are also
responsive so they look great on you
know tablets and no phones there's a
spark for example it's spark the menus
on the top so we are trying to create a
market where there's a different choice
for different requirements so running is
for example it's like the colors are red
and black real if you are like if you
like material design from Google which I
like it's quite simple and flat you can
get real Madonna which is the bestseller
and adamantium these three are material
design based the latest one is vault
it's more like enterprises and the next
one is Titan you know lately US
government has posted design guidelines
for public facing websites so that every
US government agency should follow these
rules and so that they look same right
instead of if you log in to have
government agency page it looks
different and another one looks
different so if if you follow these
guidelines then the whole governments
utilities pages will look the same so
since Prime face is quite popular in the
United States agencies government we are
creating a theme and layout based on
those guidelines so thanks to Google as
well because they created a nice
specification for material design how
much padding you need to have are much
borders so we created themes based on
that anyone heard of resource library
contracts feature of JSF resource
library contracts yeah that's why I
guess because it's like a hidden feature
anyone used I think Joomla Joomla or
a Drupal from PHP world it's the same
thing so you create your themes and
layout and use them in the same
application so that you can change it so
you create one page and run it for under
spark Sentinel on all these themes by
just changing one configuration it is
called this another previous features
the nice feature of JSF that no one used
because no one has templates but since
we do now we can create templates so
this is a PF contracts application as
you can see I have put all my sentinels
back all these resources on the
contracts folder that's a special name
contracts so we have every resources
coming these layouts are CSS you know
everything so let me first should give
you a short demo of one of them for
example Madonna so this is modern and
everything is here is JSF and for
example this is the chart component that
you've seen and this is the data table
so for example we have different color
variations as well and for example if
you check out the theme you know all
material design features are here so and
what you also get is that this prayer
design dashboards empty pages and for
example you also get a login page for
example for your application start with
tab and instead of you know working with
the designers and of course designers
can change these as well but and you
also get an error page for example so
everything is ready for the application
and you get the main menu on the side
side menu as well and of course it is
responsible right
so so you like more than you like let's
say Santa Nell and you are creating a
product saying that we want different
faces for our products so that for one
client we are going to sell it as modern
and with one glad we need we want to use
Santa Nell
with different logo of course and so in
to do that
JSF resource library contracts are quite
cold so you place the resources of each
contract template in its own folder and
go to leap XML and say use of course or
critic contract view for example like
this bean it's a session scope in yeah
and its default one is sentinel so i
will use some menus to change them to
spark and so on so we are changing the
theme here so it's the theme for
components not to layout and for layout
we need to go to the template actually
so here is the application file so
sample existing as where you created
your file right in regular JSF you use
template so that you can use
placeholders and use multi instead of
repeating the headers and footers the
aesthetic stuff you put down on a
template but the next level is using
contracts so that if these this
contracts setting saying that okay this
page should use what was the contract
Sentinel right should use Sentinel
layouts template so that one is here
that is this template so if you change
that beam to let's a spark it will go
and use this layout this template set so
here for example let's say so this is my
sample page you know this is it where I
have some inputs data tables charts and
so on so it's a long page so this is my
page running on Sentinel right so here
I'm saying
I'm sorry templates I have some menu
items here when I click this menu item I
change the contract views contract
property to spark so that application
runs on Sparkman right now so the same
page running on spark so you can have
different of course menus and things
like that you can go to running Rio as
well and
let's say modern ah the the divan I
showed you before and you know the same
thing functional the same you don't need
to repeat it for and this is a
adamantium where you can have some
customization like I want the menu to be
darker and put it on the left side and
so and last one is we can use Walt so
this is the wall template and of course
this one also has some options like and
so on so but this sample if you can see
the URL it's simplex this Emma but it's
running on different templates so it is
quite easy to create multi templated
applications and as I mentioned they're
responsive right so for example if you
check this data table is tabular right
but if I just or this data grid but if I
just do some minimize my screen the
forms they align themselves and the
dialog as well for example dialogues are
also responsive and the data table
displays it's in itself in stack format
and the data grid changes its grid
format as well and trees pick lists
everything for example this is the
carousel widget where you can display
things with a sliding effect but in a
bigger screen so all of these templates
are responsive so that you can as I
mentioned play with these online as well
so the same functionality so the same
page same baking been everything the
same but the like the window outside is
different the prime face mobile is
another module it is for developers who
like to keep their mobile sites separate
like mobile dot my web my application
com instead of using these responsive
layouts to do it with one page
sorry so the prime phase mobile is an
XHTML so we use the same beam for the
backend but for the UI we need to create
a separate XHTML and there are a couple
of tags like p.m. page in p.m. content
and so on where you can use these
components so there's a there's a nice
feature in JSF called render kit so the
render kit can a mobile renderer can
render a button based on the mobile
optimized button but in a desktop
environment it could be a regular button
so for example it's also jQuery Mobile
based so we have grade created a render
kit based on jQuery Mobile so it here is
about for example let's check the
Twitter application if you check the
code we have the content header and form
buttons and data lists and but since
they are did created by a different
renderer we get a different UI for that
and you can have multiple pages as well
these are not native these are mobile
web applications you can choose whether
you can go to different pages and then
come back and nice thing is that we also
enabled touch events so for example you
have this data table and data grid it so
you want to tap or you just swipe left
or swipe right you want to delete a
record so for example here I guess this
is the one events so in the in the code
we are saying that on swipe left delete
the record so when you swipe left
primefaces will invoke this method slug
car and it will give you the car
instance that you have just might so for
example I will just try to do that with
Mouse but it looks much better than a
mobile phone
so it's like utility to touch it for
primefaces
okay anyone required push anyone record
push in one hat push requirements like
yeah a lot of people so lately VA are
having no websocket api eyes and you
know on standard java appears as well in
in one hood of atmosphere yeah it's a
project from I think IO which is our
friend jean-francois Khan's project and
we actually called them and get some
consulting and we ended up contracting
them to implement primefaces push
modules so that you can use JSF
components and push data from server to
the client anyone connected anytime in
real time format so we are not the
developers of this so they are
developing it for us so it supports
WebSockets and fall deck transfers like
HTTP streaming along polling as well
it's file is scalable it is rightly used
in newspapers and gaming websites all
around the world and it's quite portable
so that you don't need to worry about
changing the servers so that you can
have of course this was a mortis this
problem was a bit more before Java e8 so
the API is quite simple and fun to use
here we have for example counter this is
the simplest one so we have the step
button called key comment button and at
the action I am calling this method
called global weaves increment method so
I'm just saying get the event pass so
event pass is used to publish data and
publish this value to the count or
channel so you can publish lists any
java object and we sterilize that to
json and here we have this socket
component socket is saying that okay
connect the context
so this one is these two windows are
connected right so if I click from one
page and I will get it instantly on all
anymore connected so another maybe more
interesting use case will be that you
need to send message to all connected
users instantly the code for that is
quite simple as well there is an API
called faces message in JSF where you
can display messages on pages you can
also publish that so we are saying
publish to notify channel this faces
message as I mentioned you can publish
anything so
and that one as well so so let's say
hello it works and everyone get that
faces message on their screen and final
demo would be about for example chart so
this one is listening the browser type
and for example it is Chrome and now if
I connect from Firefox and if I connect
from Safari maybe a couple of times you
can see that we are pushing data
instantly and one we hit demo as well
you can push your photo of Apple it will
work
I could not access webcam maybe there is
a security thing because it was working
show you yeah it's open now but this one
doesn't okay maybe we can try between
these two ah
no not now yes so I take my picture and
I was to send that data to anyone using
that API okay this one is quite shy it
doesn't show itself but getting old
pictures and so on so privacy pushes
it's also quite mature it's been two
years since we released this and there
are many banks and insurance companies
are also using push to do real-time
applications
okay last nine minutes okay so you like
this stuff but you don't like JSF what
you're going to do check out prime UI so
primary is a set of jQuery UI plugins
what we have done is that we have
written a lot of jQuery stuff instead of
using wrappers wrappers be encapsulated
um
extracted um so and present them as J
prime UI so word prime is quite catchy
right so you can just put it in every in
in front of a word and it becomes a
catchy project name prime UI prime faces
prime push everything so you can use it
for example rest so if you like the for
example spring and we see where you
define the Vedas manually with jQuery
and things or using a rest pace you are
calling it jax-rs api from an HTML page
you are using PHP and another something
or upcoming Java MVC framework in Java
Enterprise 8 you can use prime right so
the model is quite different we have
regular HTML elements by the way you can
also use regular HTML elements in JSF
2.2 in case you missed it's called
instead of these tags you can use
buttons and inputs regular HTML elements
as well as JSF components so we are
running PP spinner and we are getting
the spinner widget and for tab we have
this ul and divs and things like that of
course the programming model is
different you have to do much more but
you gain things as well for example this
is prime UI the same short case we are
kind of lazy to create a new one let's
check out data table so we have the
remote version the local version and so
on the lazy version responsive version
so if you check out the source you have
a JavaScript array you can put it in a
data table so for example this one is
the remote remote one we are defining
the columns and calling the data source
which is a this one's calling restful
web service and getting the data as JSON
and pushed giving it the data table and
you can have row selections everything
pagination is quite easy as well you can
go to the server if you set remember
that scrollable attribute in data table
we have scroll wheel here and of course
then it makes the data table
and scroll so there are close to 50
widgets the most common ones there is no
signature widget but there is tabs
accordions data table 3 table and menus
which is quite even some multimedia
stuff as well so short prime UI could be
interesting for you if you like the
primefaces widgets but want to use
something else other than JSF and the
new version is coming out soon where we
have added a lot of new features for
data table widget so let's wrap wrapped
up wrapped up there are a couple of
books I have I haven't written them it's
community based so there are third party
other authors have written these nice
books most popular one is prime Facebook
book where you can have different how to
related information it's based on
recipes there are some tutorials as well
and starter beginners guides advanced
primefaces kind of things so in case you
have a problem of course previous
community is here to help we have more
than 60,000 members here and 130 posts
on perform so there's a bit big
knowledge base one nice thing is that if
you downloaded NetBeans primefaces
built-in so there are nice tools for
practice as well there's a if you choose
JavaServer faces in NetBeans wizard the
primefaces will pop up and you can
create your UI with primefaces
and there's a nice netbeans plugin from
oracle where you can't do reverse
engineering and direct engineering as
well for example from tables you can
generate UI with all the ejbs and
backing beans CDI beans and also the
excess temperature so that you can
customize the generated part this one is
choosing the reverse engineering layer
it NetBeans reached the tables creates
the UI pages for you
and nice thing about is that this is
customizable so you can customize what
will be generated so another thing is
that on NetBeans if you choose right
click and say generate form generate
data table it will ask for a JPA entity
with identity notation it will read the
properties and generate for example for
data table it will generate columns for
forms it will generate inputs and all
private space so it's quite easy to
generate boilerplate forms so the
business model of primefaces is pro
everything is free in primefaces
components features but if you need
support you might consider upgrading the
privates Pro this is where the
enterprises are choosing Pro to feel
safe and we answer them their questions
in a couple of hours when they post
instead of posting to the community
forum there's a private gear as well so
roadmap right now we are around 5.3 and
next version is 5.4 for January make it
March probably so there's this new
spreadsheet component coming we are
working on that so that you can have
Excel like features on on the web we
will merge primefaces extensions
components it's a community-based
project but it's quite it has its own
book there are nice components like for
example timeline well you can list zoom
things and other things so this will be
available in primefaces as well and
there are also other components so we
are merging these not all of them so the
good ones to the primefaces
improve accessibility is one thing more
premium themes and layouts are coming
like Titan and we need to find cool
names for them so we will keep pushing
prime UI for the next release new
widgets for jQuery UI users and now we
have turned our attention to
the new world specifications like web
components angular to react where we
feel like it's quite similar to the gsfs
model because Jessop compounds are
server-side web components our clients
at the same tags right so we are playing
to create a new open source projects
around and port primefaces widgets to
these not all of them probably may be
web compounds and angular are quite nice
candidates right now be able ready
started working on it
okay so Twitter handle is at primefaces
it's one of the most followed JVM web
frameworks at Twitter there's a Facebook
group where we give away themes layouts
and other commercial offerings and
there's a that is the block for if you
want keep track so thank you
one minute left so I I'm glad to live on
time so if you have any questions for
one minute you can find me after the
event as well any questions yeah
yeah yeah
no but there are plans for Jessup 2.32
use JSON updates so that instead of HTML
updates there are some plans but in its
in practices component specific some
components use JSON some use HTML so it
depends on the state so it's the days
right now there is no solution
yeah could be a but right now it's more
like force brute force the job updates
everything ok thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
