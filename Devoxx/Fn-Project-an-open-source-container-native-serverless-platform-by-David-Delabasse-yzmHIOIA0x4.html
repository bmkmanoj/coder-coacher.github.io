you really have a girl highs I would
look on you to try to move a little bit
more to the front because I've done my
best but I have a few demos so you will
have to read code so welcome welcome to
this final session of the day my name is
David Robison you can find me on twitter
at the rebus edible swe I work at Oracle
and I basically spent my time on Java EE
Jakarta II and also more and more spend
some times on the FN project which I
will discuss today
so given this is the last session of the
day and given that you have already been
exposed to a lot of technical content I
thought that it it might be good to just
learn like one minute just to talk about
something different so I worked at
Oracle I'm based in Belgium but I do
report directly to H cube so I thought
that might be a good idea to stand like
one minute to give you an overview of
Belgium so I guess that nobody knows
what this building is Stef as my no so
this is a building in Antwerp and it
happened to be the first European
skyscraper night six meter I it was
built in 1900 basically
this is not in Belgium this is the boss
Khalifa in Dubai this is the world
tallest building and it happened that
the ayah spawned in Belgium is below the
top of that building like hundred and
thirty meters below so it's not a small
difference Belgium is a bursa is a very
flat country so Kelly for example we
don't have any mountains we don't have
any mountains but we have food and very
good food we have everything yes that
fall into the food category we have like
1600 a different kind of beer and in
fact I think it was last year or maybe
the year before UNESCO has put Belgian
beers on its Gujarat cultural heritage
list
we'll have chocolates and we're
producing like 22 kilo kilograms of
chocolate for new inhabitants per year
so we do produce a lot of chocolates we
also fries and I want to kill them it
our fries are not french fries are
coming no it's not it's not a joke I
mean there is an ongoing battle between
Belgium and France but fries are really
coming from Belgium they have been
invented in Belgium and then there are
the Belgian sprout anybody likes the
Belgians product okay three guys oh
that's that's huge
well let's kill another meat and let's
pretend that Belgians plant sprouts are
not from Belgium but they are from
France
so in Belgium we also well a lot of
stuff have been invented like the body
mass index so basically how you can know
that you're fat or not this has been
invented in Belgium and this is another
joke imodium I well if you don't know
what Maryam is just Google after the
session but this is again another
Belgian invention and then a lot of
other cool stuff Avilan been invented in
Belgium like plastic while cricket is
not cool but anyway it's about an
invention the saxophone I combination
engine and the World Wide Web
it's often well it's it's it's also a
fact the World Wide Web has been
invented by Tim Donnelly along with the
Belgian guy named Homer Caillou and
finally the fries I've also been
invented in Belgium so let's get to the
meat of the talk but before we do so
this is me in a conference in Sweden and
someone endurance tweeted that it's not
a real conference unless you read Oracle
say fellas that meant at least once so
please enjoy including this is I think
the only opportunity we'll have to read
it this week so today I'm going to
discuss about FN which is an open source
container that if a first platform
I will first pants a few minutes to set
the stage and then I will show you with
an in action so fast function as a
service at the heart of a fast platform
at the art of a function as a service
platform we have function a function is
basically a piece of code so what piece
of code that has a well-defined task
most of the time the function takes
something in input it works on that
input and it produced something in your
boot now it's not a function as we have
in mathematics in the sense that
function can also have side effect
like for example a function might
trigger another function or the function
might put something in a queue or in the
database and so on and so on so that's
important that's something important to
keep in mind
so the function are very well defined
and very limited delimited then we have
this annoying platform that will
basically run your function so the first
platform is basically where you will Oh
stand deploy your function and the key
idea with in a civilized architecture is
that typically you will not to have to
manage that platform it's someone else
responsibility to manage a platform so I
mean that you as the user will have to
focus on writing function deploying the
function and that's it and everything
else will have to take care by someone
else typically the first provider and
we're talking about for example making
sure that the platform is secure making
sure that the platform scale making sure
that the platform is patch manage and so
on and so on so it's someone else job to
do that is that you as the user to take
care of that
now there is well simulus is a thinking
it and there is this very famous blog
post that is titled we could have
college F at the end of the day several
s is just a name and yet there are left
of server behind the first platform they
are server they are firewalls they are
networking equipment and so on and so on
so at the end of the day service is just
a name and even we might not agree that
it's a good name so name that robot is
using so let's keep using that name and
to give you some perspective on naming
and why name is sometimes difficult I
told you that time coming from Belgium
I'm coming from the french-speaking part
Wallonia and in in Wallonia offense then
for something completely different so FN
stand for ferric nacional and if you
look at a big national they are in a
very funky business so this is the kind
of business that they are a sew-in
typically where I live a fan is not
really a very fancy names it has a very
strange context so this is the kind of
business they are in and if you look at
their Aragon branch so this is their
slogan
the world most battle-proven firearms
it's not even battle assisted its
battle-proven so anyway living is hard
you might not think that service is a
good name but that's the name that
everybody is using so we're good with
that
so why do you want to go towards the
civilized architecture there are
multiple reason for that the first one
is that at the end of the day it's
easier given that you as a developer
just have to focus on writing function
you don't have to focus on the line
infrastructure so in your function you
will just focus about writing the code
of your function and telling we don't
want to expose anything from the
annoying infrastructure within your
function so at the end of the day we'll
just spend time to write business code
right another benefit is that it's more
powerful
given that the platform is managed by
someone else everything which is tied to
securing the platform everything which
is tied to scalability everything which
is linked to the ability of the platform
and so on and so on will have to be deal
by that other entity that women have the
platform and again we don't want to
expose any of that within your functions
so you will not have to write any
specific code to make sure that your
function scale for example it so it's
something that is handled by the
platform and given that you don't have
to worry about all those low-level
aspect at the end of the day you will be
able to write more quickly code now so
less is also an economical and a cost
impact in the sense that we have this
function that will basically be run on
demand so we invoke the function it's
run it last form maybe not even one
seconds and then it's gone it's SML so
that in that it gives the fast provider
the ability to have a very fine way of
billing you of charging you and at the
end of the day basically you will just
be charged whenever your functions are
run so if your function are not used you
will not have to pay your time but if
you see if your function are used a lot
you will have to pay out accordingly but
if your function are used a lot that
also means that at the day you are doing
business so it's okay so when we started
to work on that fast platform we try to
set some goals so we wanted to have a
fast platform and we said some criterias
so the first one and given that were
quite late in the game without that if
we want to get traction when
- for something that is not tied to any
vendor is including it us so that's why
with the from the beginning we want to
have a vast platform that is open source
it should also be approachable in the
sense that we are focusing on developers
and we want to make sure that any
developers can easily write function for
our fast platform obviously it would be
very easy to get started but if a
developer's wants to have more returns
kappa BTW well that's something that we
might surface for those more advanced
users it should be continually based so
you will see through my presentation
that basically docker containers are a
first-class citizen within our test
platform and I will explain why later on
on the other hand we don't want to
impose any choice regarding the
scheduler that will be used so obviously
at some point in time Oracle will have a
managed services based on - we will make
a choice for the scheduler but if you
want to take FN and use it on another
scheduler it should work so obviously
we're thinking about the big one like
communities that's an obvious one but if
you want to use warm or Apache Meadows
it should also work on top of those
given that we are focusing on the
rubbers we also want to make sure that
we should make sure that our first
platform is attractive to developers so
we don't want to impose under any new
tools so if you are a Java developers
you will have - well you will write
function using Java but on the other
hand if you are a go developers you will
write function using go and so on and so
on we don't want to make a choice for
you the developers and last but not
least we also said from the beginning
that we want to be platform independent
obviously at the end of the day you will
deploy your function on the fast
providers right but it doesn't preclude
you given that everything is open-source
to take a fan and run it on your laptop
that's what I'm doing here so you will
see that I have a fan running on my
laptop and that is very convenient for
developing for example
you can also take a fan and run it on
premises obviously if you are doing that
we lose one of the key benefit of a fast
platform
it's that someone from your company will
have to do the management of that
platform but if you're ok with that fine
for us so these were basically the goals
that we said when we started to work on
that and the result is FN project so FN
project and open source container native
polyglot fast platform so I will not go
into details about the architecture but
it might make sense that I explain very
quickly some key component that I will
discuss in the rest of my session so we
are f n 7f and server are basically
where your function will be running here
I just have one F and so well but
obviously if you're using a fast
provider it will have a bunch of events
over but that's something that I mean
you will be shalid from the architecture
at the end of the day if you're using a
fast provider but that if that a fast
provider will have a bunch of events
over that will host and run functions in
obviously if you have multiple events
over you need to have an F and load
balancer so it's basically a load
balancer that will be able to do
intelligent routing for example there is
a request coming in for a given function
and the load balancer know that in that
specific ins F and sava we already have
a container that is ready to deal with
that function so in terms of performance
it makes more sense to forward that
request directly to that given is F and
saga that's the kind of thing that the
load balancer will take care of Bragan
as a user you don't necessarily need to
know that given that we are using
containers we also have a registry here
so it can be internal which is to be or
external registry doesn't really matter
then we have the CLI it's basically the
tool that you will use to boot function
to run function deploy function test
function and so on so basically it's
your entry points towards the FN
that former then we have what we call
educate function development kids so
it's basically kids that you can use to
write a function and I will show you
some of the capabilities that are
provided by the Java fdk for example but
on the long run we we should have more
education covering different language
and then last but this we also have a
specific capabilities which is called F
and flow that I would cover at the end
so let's look at F in action it's
so
so given this is a Java conference let's
create the group function
let me try to sum this
but kids me
so this is a very simple function
okay
so if I look here I just have my
function so what I will use I will use
the FN CLI to basically turn this into
an FN function FN in it so you see that
what it does well it found a go function
so it assumed so if I assume that it
needs to use the current time bit make
sense and a funky I'm a lot in credit so
if we look at the funky ml this is
basically a very simple configuration
file
so that's the name that's the version
that's the runtime to use that's the
entry point and let's forget about the
format for now so I have my function now
I can run my function for that I will
use it essentially again I will use the
run command but I will use the verbose
parameter to see what's going on under
the hood and you see that basically we
are using Cocker
so what I find is doing - is basically
turning my function into a container
that is then invoked and this is the
result of the invocation and there is a
nice typo there
so this is basically my function that is
running on on docker right now my
function is locking is running locally
it's not running on offensive obviously
I can also run that function on Nathan
server that's what I will do here I will
run my function on Nathan server that is
running on my laptop for that I need to
use what we call application and an
application is just a way of grouping
function so let's see I have two
application I have the travel
application and the contact location so
I will deploy my function deploy I said
into the conf application
I think I have to specify like this I'm
not sure so I build image it yet I need
to also specify that I don't want to
pull that container to over this way now
if I look at the root so basically roots
are used to reach of function roots I
want to list the root of the application
I now have a root that I can use to
reach the same function but this time
through the network so if I call that
function I have the same result right I
can also use invoke the function
directly from FN so for that I use FN
call I'm calling in the application conf
I want to call the guav function I think
I need to specify it like that and it
works exactly the same way this time I'm
really invoking my function through FN
server ok let's continue on that but I
will create another go function but this
time I will ask the - CLI to basically
bootstrap the function for me I will
don't run to write the initial code so I
want to use the go runtime and I will
call this function Gobi so let's look at
what we have in Gobi we have a function
file we have a yam l file and we have a
test file so we can run that function is
being build again because this is a
different function
and this time it's a little bit
different it's use JSON so let's look at
the code so find out
so this is the code of the default
function that you get so it's it's not
way more advanced it's just used Jesus
so it gets something an input a name and
if there is no name it use it says hello
world and if there is a name it's
basically spit hello that given name the
thing is that this function is expect is
expecting to get some JSON payload so I
need to pass it some JSON payload for
that and what I need to pass is a name
so I have some JSON payload right and
now I can invoke my function so I can
call my function within my goby
application and my function is no sorry
within my I'm not sure I've deployed my
function so let's first deploy the
function within the app conf and the
function is called Gobi no I don't like
to specify the function because I'm
already in that directory so the
function is being deployed
so it's it's being deployed again yeah
it's the end of the days right
so my function is being deployed on my
offense server it's not put outside now
I can pass it some payload through the
network again so FN coal conf and the
function is go beep and it doesn't work
because I've stopped typing too fast and
this was not a space and you see that
this time indeed and passing some JSON
payload to my function and what I get in
return is some JSON payload there is
another file which has been generated
here it's a test file so out of the box
when you bootstrap a function you have a
very simple way to unit s your function
to do that you just call SN test and
your function will be automatically unit
tested
so it has to scenario and both scenario
are passing so if you look at the test
they are very simple so basically we
pass it Johnny and we expect to get in
return
hello Johnny and we don't pass we pass
basically nothing and we expect to have
the default value in the world so this
is working right
okay let's switch gear and talk about
Java given that this is a really a Java
conference so let's create a Java
function now so again I told you that FN
is Agnes run along agnostic so I can use
different language so I will use the
runtime Java and I will call that
function Duke so if we look there what
we have so we have two class which have
been created so we have a function which
has been created so it's a default
function and we have a unity a class
that allows us to gene to unit test
based on JUnit our function we also have
our configuration file which has been
created and last but not least we also
have a pom which has been created so
that means that our function basically
just a Java oh sorry maven project so
given it's a maven project I can open
that function within my ID Duke function
so this is very very small but don't
worry so you see I have the source and I
have the test I can run the test test
file and if everything goes well it will
be green and if not it's red so let's
see what's going on
yeah I know what's going on so does it
it complained that it's Java noggin for
a specific reason I'm used to using Java
8 here but it's not it's not an issue I
mean everything is in my pub so if I
switch to Java 8 if I run my test again
you see that it's great they do a
failure so I mean that's one of the
benefit of F and of the f DK you have
out of the box they are a key to unit
test using a unit your function this is
a pure maven project so that mean that I
have my palm I can easily use an
external dependency so let's bring an
external dependency if I can type
or
Jordan
difficulty we want to use it say Dada
Moni and we want to use the latest and
greatest in Germany so now if I go back
to my to my Jarek a story which is here
you see this is the color of my function
so there's nothing specific to effect
it's just as a class with the method the
method gets a string and it output a
string there is no interface there's
basically pure standard code so maybe I
show I first need to show you this
function running not sure I've done that
so FN run will basically maybe we can do
F and run verbose
to see what's happening behind the scene
and you see that 100 the hood where is
in heaven to build the function and then
it's built into a container image that
is invoked hello world and my tests are
also invoked here so it's a maven
project so I can import any dependency
so let's use a Dada Moni that are just
import so don't remember the name of
that big Manya i'm big money of euro and
let's say a and we're good so i'm using
an external dependency and now obviously
i can use it so you
so if I run that guy again
the image is being rebuilt
I need fail
why
it failed because we are testing the
function and obviously while the result
are different low so let's fix the text
the test and in the interest of time
let's fix 10 that way
I send in the rest of time don't do that
at all right so let's run let's run it
again
and you see the result so hello world
you've won a true and a two are indeed
coming from the external dependency that
is your money so you see basically for
Java developers you are just sticking to
the standard tool that you are using
it's your Java EE it's just Java code
evenly we are using maven if you look at
this function is Java function it get a
string in input and output a string it's
not particularly useful right so what we
can do we can say something like this so
let's pretend that we have a person a
person private string as the last name
and a person as a first name let's see I
need constructor
I need a default constructor I need
constructor and then I need a getter and
salaries let's do that okay so now I
this person class that I can use so what
I can say now for example so instead of
getting a string my function will get a
a person which is a Java type it's a
Java object type right obviously this is
not working anymore and the output isn't
for work anymore because we are
outputting a name which is a different
what which doesn't even exist but what
we can say for example we can say input
and get worked so basically the same
code but this time we will use the Java
object which has been passed so if we
run that again
it fails why well my function expect to
have a person type and it doesn't get
that person type so we have to pass it
that person type and again this is
something that's provided by the Java
idk so the Java SDK will provide input
and output type conversion between Jason
and Java object so what I can do I can
pass it my person object so a person
object has the last name and it has a
first name
now with fire so this is my if I invoke
my function again but this time if I
pass it my payload the result should be
different and you see hello David
you want a true obviously we can do that
for the input but we can also say that
the input is a different type for
example I will in the interest of time I
will just say that my function is
outputting a person type obviously the
return light doesn't work anymore
but what we can say just to make it very
quick so let's say that we will return
the input object but we will just
anonymize so we'll just pretend that the
name is anonymous so if I said that I
run my function again and this time the
function should output some JSON payload
and you see that indeed this is the
result of my function some doesn't pick
up and what I had to do on the Java side
for that nothing I'm just using standard
Java object and the coercion is handled
directly and transparently for you by
the decay obviously you have as a
developer the ability to configure the
coercion if the default behavior is not
the one that you would like to get this
is the kind of thing that out-of-the-box
it works but we are also providing more
advanced capability if you want to use
those advanced capability so
even protect we have the Java in decay
so we have a very good Java support so
we have JUnit test we have scaffolding
we have we support out-of-the-box maven
project we have input and input type
coercion we have a thin flow API that I
will discuss and so on and so on but
it's not all I mean we understand that
Java is not the only solution that is
use on the market so a fan is developed
in go so that means that obviously you
can use go to develop your function
that's what I've done at the beginning
but you can also use other language so
we do plan to support additional
language like Python for example this
one that we would like to well that we
already support in fact Java squid make
sense and so on and so on but you and
given the fact that we're using docker
containers at the ability to also
basically bring your own language so
what I've done to just try to understand
how it works I've had it cut in support
to FN so like 1 months ago cotton was
not supported by FN but now if you do a
fan in it runtime but this time you say
that you want to use cut in you give you
the name
you will have a cutting function created
so let's look at that function so I will
replace that function with a more simple
one first so this is a very simple
curtain function so again this is
typically well so the function get a
string and it will return ello and if
the dough string it is not blank it will
return that string and if not it will
return a world let's run a function f
and run and see what is happening behind
the scenes again
did I say my no I didn't say my function
so
in a world right and if you look here
somewhere here you will see that let's
see
basically I'm using couplets kirtland
see to combine my function and turn it
into an artifact that the platform can
execute and that artifact is basically
well we can see here but it's a jar so
let's go back here so this is the config
function and let's use the default one
so this is the default function if you
do an effort coughing a fan in it cut
clean run sorry a fan in it runtime
coughing this is the function that you
will have again this is exactly the same
idea but this time the function is
taking an input just in fact we can also
say that those are data class so we get
an input data class with name and output
a response class with a message so if I
run that function now this time it will
fail why because basically my function
is expecting again to have an input of
that given type so I need to pass it
that given type and that given type is
just
like that to be okay so captain Jason
it's not mature word that goodness
notice to know
the chasm
yeah okay
that's a cooking
okay
now if I invoke the same function but I
pass it this payload it should work
message a local thing so this is
something that I buzzing well I've
cheated a little bit when I've had it
cut in support because I've just defined
so we have to type of of image one image
that is big too that is use to build a
function and one other image that is
used to run the function so to build the
the building mesh is basically using
contingency but the run images and
basically using the standard Java fdk
image given that I just want to run a
job so that basically means that I get
the capability that are provided by the
Java idk for free light type coercion is
some it's something that I've used here
in my cooking class so I didn't have to
specify anything to say that this data
class in fact will will be adjacent some
JSON payload that will be transformed
into the cutting data class and the true
is also this is also applicable for the
output so this is one of the nice
benefit now if you want to add support
phone over a different language this is
something that is very easy to do we are
just using docker containers so if you
want to have your own very exotic
language well everything is out there so
please please feel free to do so
so moving um
let's discuss quickly state
so I told that function should be a with
our FML so basically the function will
be invoked it will be run and then it
will die so a function will live for a
few milliseconds maybe one second if
it's a very expensive function but not
more than that
so clearly you should not hold any state
within your function if you need to have
some kind of state notion you should use
an external services like a queue like a
cache database a document store any kind
of instance resists that you that will
be allowed and that will be able to
manage the state for your function now
there are use case where it makes sense
to have to deal with state when we have
a function and that's typically when you
want to compose together multiple
function so remember that at the
beginning I said that a function is a
very well-defined animated job but it
might be useful to try to combine
multiple functions together to basically
compose a larger application and for
that of you see you will need some kind
of states so typically I have shown that
will invoke another function and based
of the result of that other function I
want to invoke a third function those
kind of things
so for that we are event low so FN flow
is basically an API that allows you to
compose together multiple function it's
very similar to the compression state
API that we have on Java SE so the
compression stage API is basically
defining this notion of stage stage is
basically nothing whose task and the
execution of a task of a stage can
trigger the execution of a different
stage of a different task so basically
you can define a pipeline of multiple
tasks multiple asynchronous tasks this
is exactly the same except that the
compression stage API
everything happens within a single
process here we are talking about
function invocation
so obviously one we will invoke a
function
function will run in a different process
but it's exactly this idea of being able
to define a pipeline execution of
multiple function invocation and to
illustrate that I have a demo running on
my laptop so it's a typical travel
booking service season so we have like
four back-end services we have a flight
services that you can use to book a
flight but also cancel a flight we have
a services that we can use to book and
cancel anatella and we have another
service that we can use to book and
cancel a car a booking what happened to
be written in Java
another one happens to be written in
Ruby another one in JavaScript and
finally we also have an email services
that will basically be used to send
confirmation of a booking so the idea is
that we would like to implement the trip
booking function so that's the function
that the end user will use so the trip
booking function will have to basically
use all the different back-end services
to book a trip so we want to apply it we
want to book a hotel we want to go car
and we want to sell email now a
confession on my demo I'm using Jabbar
will be and JavaScript I'm not using
pitten and also a dessert the backend
services that are running on my machine
are running on top of FN but they are
just mock-up services obviously I will
not book RealFlight and so on so what we
will do we will use the SN flow to
develop the trip booking function so
basically this function that will
compose together multiple function
so
let's go here
so I have here the booking sorry the
trip function and if we got the job
functions
there's less than what I
interesting so fuels
okay let's try to run that guy so let's
go here so so for that I need so if I
look at the roots I have four
to travel up
list and then
so you see that basically I have
everything deployed on my machine so I
have routes to cancel to book a car to
cancel car booking and so on and so on
and so on so let's deploy the trip
function we want to deploy it to the
travel app
yeah I told you the end of today of
today okay depart now I will invoke that
function so I will invoke the trip
function that will invoke the other
function and for that I have some sample
payload that I need to pass to my
function so FN cold
yup is travel and the function is trip
and well nothing is happening because
it's not very visible so let's look at
so I have some some dashboard that
should help us to see what's going on so
if I invoke the function again well we
basically that something has happened
but it was very short-lived why because
my function doesn't do anything it just
create a flow so what we need to do now
is to basically create this
orchestration of services request
invocation so I have a first request
invocation that involved it doesn't work
the flight booking I have a second one
that invoked a no-tell booking and the
third one that is booking a car and what
I'm doing here as I'm basically defining
this execution of function invocation so
I first invoke I first invoke the flight
booking once I have the result the flow
API will then compose to the best him in
that it will invoke this lambda so this
lambda is basically trying to book a
hotel and once the hotel is booked where
is in exam de so we want to book a car
so let's save that and let's try to
deploy that
so whatever what I have here is
basically a small dashboard that allows
to see me what's going on so I will
invoke the function and well we see that
we have booked a hotel we have booked a
car and we have booked a flight and
finally we've sent an email to say to
the user that ok everything is fine the
thing that we are not really doing here
is that we're not dealing with a row so
if something goes wrong and I have the
ability to basically crush my demo
so it's time the booking car services
will be invoked it should fail right
so if I'm working again the sim services
we booked a flight we try to book a car
doesn't work and we never send an email
to the user to say oh something
goes wrong and we didn't cancel any of
the booking that has been made and it
makes sense if we cut the code we're not
dealing with there so let's start so
this is velocity the same requested
services request invocation but this
time each time we have an error we're
dealing with yellow so if we can't book
a flight we will make sure that we
cancel the booking for that flight and
we send will basically roll back
everything which we have done and we
send email to the user saying that sorry
but something went wrong
so let's invoke that services again and
hopefully this time we should have a
different behavior so we booked we come
to a car we were able to book a flight
and it did not work why because I didn't
deploy my function sorry
so
let's invoke it and let's see how it
goes so we can cannot tell we can't
Recaro we can book a flight and well we
cancel the hotel booking we cancel the
flight we cancel the car just in case
and we also send email to the user that
sorry something went wrong we can look
at that in action using this different
dashboard
so basically well we can cannot tell we
can book the car we can the flight and
then you you you see that we are
basically rolling well kind of rolling
back the transaction so we're invoking
travel fight cancel function travel
Hotel cancel function travel car can
select function and we're also invoking
the mail services but this time to send
to the user mail thing that sorry we're
not able to book your flight so this is
basically the event flow API in action
right now it works using a Java SDK but
we also plan to support to add support
for flow for order idk like the glue idk
for example it's something that we are
working on so basically the flow API
allows you to define those a larger
phone nutrition that are levering a
simple function and so this is a the
distributed execution of a function and
it's also type safe something which
obviously is very important
so that was a very short of a view of
flow so to recap FN project The
Container native club the Gnostic
polyglot open source had left the first
platform continuity use so that we are
using 100 the hood docker container so
it gives us the ability to support any
language if we don't already support
that language it's called agnostic so it
obviously at some point an Oracle will
have a managed services that we use FN
services but given that everything is
open source you can take it on and run
it on another cloud provider if you want
to do so
it's polyglot I mean out-of-the-box we
are supporting who Java JavaScript
Python and so on god Linda and if it's
not enough you have the ability to add
your own language and finally everything
is open source so it's not an open core
in the sense that it's really everything
which is in the github organization is
all the stuff that we are using there is
no close we get people with specific
Oracle stuff
it's an Apache 2v2 license so it's
really an open source project I know I I
also think that it's the first time that
Oracle basically started an open source
project to have at some point in time a
managed services and let's say
commercial offering based on that
project and not yet they will run I mean
we have a commercial services of
commercial offering are at some point in
time real person what we open source it
it here it's really opposite obviously
in FN we are very good Java support so
we've discussed the fdk that provide
type coercion the unit support maven
support and so on and so on and then
there are many other stuff that I don't
really have the time to show to the
alight everything which is tied to the
monitoring and management obviously
that's something which is also very
important so we do support open tracing
we support from a table and graph and
now you can use the fancy write to
extract logs and so on and so on so we
have lot of additional coverages
regarding that and I mean there we are
continually improving other projects so
we are at function so
function hot function is basically being
able to tag a function so that if there
is if I mean the type of container is
able to serve more quickly that function
requests we have a sine function so
fire-and-forget function we have an arab
chart if you want to use kubernetes we
do support jax-rs we also support
sprinkle functions so I mean we're
continuing improving the project so as
call to action I would encourage you to
check FN project I mean everything is
out there you so that it's very easy to
use it's very easy to get started so did
that come / FN project we also have a
slack channel where basically everything
is being discussed development but also
we're trying to help to help the
community using FN so I would like to
encourage you to check that and with
that that's the right word yes okay cool
so I would like to thank you so please
check out FN project and french fries
are not French but they are better
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
