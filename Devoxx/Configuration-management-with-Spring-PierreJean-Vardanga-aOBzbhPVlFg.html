session
my name is Javed a nigga I'm working at
edge laboratories a Swiss company I'm a
software developer there hope I won't
scratch your ears with my French accent
if I do as I'm sorry so we are here to
talk about configuration management with
spring club does anybody familiar with
spring wood yes ok cool and
configuration management for spring also
ok before before I start the demo I
would like just that we agree on a few
definitions first I sometimes hear our
developers speaking about properties
from it's not configuration it's just a
way to express the configuration and in
fact I like this quote from Kevin
Huffman from pivotal who said that the
configuration refers to any value that
can vary across deployments this
includes database credentials connection
pool settings or even API keys to access
remote services that also means that you
should avoid to bundle the configuration
with your artifacts because your
artifact is not supposed to change
across the environment whereas the
configuration is to push to change and
more if you if you keep the
configuration in the artifact you will
have each time which will you change it
you will have to recompile retest
repackage redeploy revalidate and real
push to production so that's really
inconvenient but there are multiple
strategies to manage the configuration
and Alai to classify them into three
different level of maturity the first
is the one that that just talked about
when the configuration is inside the
artifact actually it's really it's
really simple when you start one new one
new application but quickly it becomes
inconvenient and the first the first
things to do is to put the configuration
outside of the artifact the simplest
solution is to use environment variables
or even flat files like configuration
properties actually some called
platforms like Cloud Foundry or Eric who
uses the environment variables to stop
the configuration also to bind the
services between each other and that's a
bit more convenient than the first
solution because you don't need to
repackage the rifts and you just need to
restart your application once the
configuration has been updated and there
is a third a third level when you have
one of multiple services that expose
some configuration to other services of
your system
the solution is bit more flexible but a
lot of most flexible because sometimes
those service can push the new changes
the new configuration to the clients
that needs this configuration and the
configuration is reload at the runtime
without restarting the application so
during the demo I would like to
demonstrate every of those three steps
especially the last one so let's go so
we'll start with the really simple
application so a chipping service that
will provide shipping costs for any
other service like the billing service
so I'm using Springwood the last version
one for one with the some dependencies
so the web depends is to provide the
shipping cost actuator will use it to
refresh some configuration my secret and
JPA because by the end of this demo
we'll see how to manage the sensitive
data like data base credentials in a
safe way
I will also if we have enough time show
you how to use console to retrieve
configuration from its key value saw and
the config client which is the client to
the config server that spring cloud
provides so let's start no I'm not a
robot okay so it will be a really simple
application with one HTTP endpoint and
point exposed and first so as I said we
will go through the three levels of
maturity the first one which is
embedding the D configuration so I'm
sure you all did that once it's really
simple if we start with a simple
controller and we reach read the
configuration from the properties sorry
so the inputs will be coach pin shipping
costs and we reach on the ball where you
get shipping costs three simple and this
value I want it to be injected by a
spring from my properties so I'm sure
that you all did that and that the first
the first step okay the shipping costs
will be very expensive because I don't
want this solution to be put in
production ok so I'm starting the
application it will be very fast oh yeah
forgot to
I'm commencing some dependencies for
right now because we don't use them
we'll use them after okay
let's restart okay it started and if we
go to the end point exposed right here
we have the key because it's really
simple as you can see it's also I'm
using actuator to display these end
points so the flash and displays all the
environment all the variables all the
constant of the environment and as you
can see in here we have this property
sauce dot so our application that
properties it's really simple now let's
go to the second stage second level its
externalizing the configuration so I
created one environment variable on my
computer and by just using it if I call
it and show you that it uses the right
one I remove this one if I restart the
application it should use the
environment variable right so it's
really simple - really simple to
externalize the configuration but now
what I would like to do is to be able to
restart to read to take care of the
configuration and the runtime without
restarting any application so for that I
will use spring cloud config server so I
will create another spring good
application with one dependency which is
config server like that I'm opening it
okay
so there are only few dependencies
config server and the test but I'm not
using it here and we have one 1min class
so to activate the config server I just
add to enable it like that and I need to
setup few properties first I will change
the default port no not to conflict with
the client the shipping service and then
I need to specify the URI where to find
the the configuration I'm using big
bucket right now so I will fetch the
configuration from here if a
configuration that gets and that should
be it let's see what happen so I'm
starting the configuration server server
ok started and when I try to check for
the configuration for the watch
what is exposed by the server you can
see that it returns me one property
sauce with a file which is here
everything comes from big bucket and it
uses the same pattern with spring and
spring boot so if you don't provide any
profile to your application it will use
the default profile so this one and if
you provide a production profile it will
use the production profile because it
should override the default profile as
we can see here the one on top is the
production and the one on the bottom is
default so the one at the on top of your
priorities and the one that are the
bottom ok so we have our config server
now I would like that my client the
shipping service I won't like it to use
the configuration server
so few things to do so here we are kay
application professors in here I should
set up to actually two properties the
first one is the name of the application
it's a general convention with winds
with Springs
even for service discovery of whatever
you want every service has a name and
this is the its identifier to to catch
to fetch whatever you want on other
services so in here it will be shipping
service as you can see it's the same
name that I use on the file and then I
need to provide config server you were
right comfy URI which is on local hosts
8888 one nothing to do before restarting
the application those property are
evaluated during the boost up of the
application in order to create all the
bins in order to do that to do that I
need to rename the application
properties into a bootstrap that
properties ok one things that I'd forgot
so I want I don't want to use the
environment variable anymore so I'll
remove that and as I said I want that
the properties to be updated at the
right time without restarting the
application so I have to set the
controller as refresh level by using
their at refresh scope should be good
let's restart the application
as you can see in the log the client is
fetching the configuration server with
the default profile that's what I wanted
and yeah so we should see the value nine
point nine because I'm using the default
profile on the client side and we have
nine point nine that cool but that the
profit is Alder configuration is still
not refreshed at the runtime so we we
have two solution with spring cloud
either we use actuator there is a slash
refresh endpoint that refreshes every
every beans that is annotated with at
configuration property or with out
refresh scope so for instance if I
change one value here I will put 7.9
okay so now i refresh the configuration
server so the value has been updated in
here but not there and to do to do this
to to trigger the the refresh I just it
called a refresh and point on the client
side and it tells me that the properties
has been reloaded and up to date and
it's up to date 27.9 that's a cool
feature but as you as you saw I did it
manually you can script it if you want
but there is another way to do it with
spring cloud is by using an event bus so
the event bus right now you can use a
young QP and maybe Redis but I'm not
sure that it's released so if we use a
mqp
I have one rabbiting who that is running
on my machine so it's quite simple just
we just need to add one dependency
which is prank loud starter bus AMQP
just like that and if i restart the
application i should see that the
application is listening well I don't
know if it has been refreshed because I
don't see the log ok it's better yeah
you see that the application is
listening on one cue which is playing
loud voice so the client is ready no I
need to change the config server it's a
bit a bit more complex but not not not a
lot so we need the same the same
dependency that sounds illogical they
want to talk with the same language but
we also need to use one more dependency
which is sprinkled config monitor this
one will be used by bitbucket to trigger
changes it will it's like a web book but
like what you used to do with Jenkins
for instance to start a build or
something like that I can show you the
here I set up one way book I'm using
anguk anguk is a small tools that allow
a public IP to eat my computer ok that's
done now i will restart this
and so I will change property on the on
bitbucket and it should be refreshed on
the client-side so yeah we can see that
it also it's also connected to the same
queue so if I change once again this
property let's make the shipping cost
free okay what can we see okay we can
see on the on the config service that it
has been called by bitbucket
to make the change and on the client
side we can see that we read which is
received one message from the coffee
server which says that the shipping cost
value as change so if I already did that
here should be it should be zero point
zero and that's it so here the
configuration has been refreshed at the
runtime that's really cool because now
developers can just push the
configuration on a git repository and
it's automatically pushed on the
pollution but there is still one problem
because in the configuration we
sometimes I have some we sometimes have
sensitive data like that I database
credentials and it's really a bad
practice to put them in a repository so
free cloud provides two solutions to
take care of the sensitive data first
you can use encryption encryption and
decryption using GCE needs that's for
that you need to set up your audios of
the application and there is a second
solution which is using a she cobalt who
knows Asha cobalt ok few few people so
it's that
that has been created to store sensitive
data actually all the data are encrypted
in the in the data store with an
encryption key which is also encrypted
and stored in vault and it's encrypted
with master key which is not stored in a
she cop involved sorry
and in order to retrieve this master key
instead of duplicating the key on every
nodes and on every chart I she called
decided to use a specific algorithm you
need to hand seal a certain number of
shard to be able to rebuild the master
key
so I already I already set up my
environment for that I won't demonstrate
that to you you can find multiple blog
post about that but I would like to use
this feature enabled to store the
credentials and I would like to use
especially another one feature from
vault which is really really interesting
it allows you to manage your database
credentials and by that I mean it can
connect to your database so there are a
lot of the they call them secret
backends there are a lot of secret
backends for my sequel Postgres
Cassandra I think as you are not sure a
w s console or so and it will generate
new credentials it will renew the
credentials when they are revoked for
instance and that means that no one in
your team or in the ops team need to
check the - - to use the credentials one
nothing about volt every data data that
that is taught in vault is attached to a
lease a time to live that means they
will be revoked in the future and so
spring cloud we
volt managed the renewal of the of the
credential so let's see how it works
this is not released yet by the spring
sprinkler team it's still a milestone so
you should take care of how you use it
that's why I need to add the snapshot
repository and also the configuration
works like that no it's on the client
side yes the configuration is this one
so deferred the first one I define a
setup
oh I will interact with volt so first is
the token that allow me to query volt
second one is the protocol that I will
use to query volt and the next three one
I will choose this one is I'm defining
I'm saying that I want to use the my
secret secret back end from volt that
will manage my credentials and the two
last one if you're familiar with
Springwood you should recognize those
two properties I'm just saying to
sprinkle clothe fault to when it
retrieves the credential from volt to
map them into the datasource
properties so that I don't have to
manage anything so that's why I
previously added the JPA and the my
sequel dependencies so in order to
demonstrate that I will just create a
small entity user for instance
using JPA yes private long guide the
private string username with the default
conscious to constructor and the getters
and setters
okay I need are so one repository so I'm
using the default Springwood features
okay and one endpoint that will expose
all my user finds to us get mapping
users public variable user finder and I
will use the repository that I need to
inject to retrieve all my users like
that okay and that seems to be good okay
let's restart we see what happen okay so
here you can see it still fetch the the
crown still fetch is the configuration
server but also it which is the vault
configuration so that means you can use
multiple you can use multiple properties
in order to fetch the configuration from
Jeff different different sources I have
one issue just let me
I mean it's try to find it
so what's wrong we might have it to a
cheapo somewhere
use our history traitor Punto you don't
know entity don't enter I restart the
application I might have been too quick
I don't know okay I can find a jacket
yeah yeah yes right I need to put the
direct in the properties
is it better no don't look better okay
that means I have no credential anymore
okay
and every tree creates the vault server
it will be easier okay so I will unseal
the vault like I said earlier so I need
two keys to do it and I need a token or
so like that then I need to set a vault
so I'm just saying that this is my data
source and I'm after Texas right so that
means the token is I cannot use it okay
did I use the right one what
oh yes thank you yes just one thank you
yes okay I'm sorry I did something wrong
I will pass to the next step the next
step I wanted to show you how to connect
to console the key the key value that I
saw from con sure this one is easier I
just need to include the spring console
config
I also need to deactivate one the W's
nqp configuration because it doesn't
work
or maybe I did something wrong but it
seems that it's still fresh as not
released yet so if I restart the
application okay I want to trick to
retrieve one property from console so I
will do a small controller a you I want
to retrace something that is called vit
private double Realty that gets mapping
it's really written lately and I need to
enable it discovery clients it's a bit
strange but I'm not just I'm not using
the discovery feature from screen cloud
and database once again as I cannot
connect to it let me show you console
quickly so it's a discovery to a service
discovery tool but it is also a key
value store and I already set one value
which is v18 do you have some serious
heat removal of that
oh no not this one
you can use them all the three
properties all at the same times as I
said earlier there are priorities within
between them so yes and here I retrieve
the value from console so I show you
there
we have vault console and not the config
server because it is not it is
deactivated I'm sorry that's it I'm
sorry for the for the issue that I had
but I show you that it works thank you
