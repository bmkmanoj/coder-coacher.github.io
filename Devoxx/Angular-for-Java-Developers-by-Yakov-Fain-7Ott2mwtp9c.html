thank you for coming 6 p.m. and you're
still here and it'll talk about angular
angular for Java developers I do Java
for 18 years and the last three four
years I do front-end as well and angular
latest version for more than 2 years
today today's version is version 5 of
angular and this is what we're going to
be using in this presentation
currently I also work on the second
edition of this book this book is
available only as a mere program as we
write the chapters Manning publishes
them so this is a discount code if you
want I also have two discounts cause for
100% off for people who will ask good
questions all the all the slides and
everything is available online
I also using the site and you don't need
to take pictures of this because it's
very easier a couple of words about
angular in general this presentation has
almost no slides so what I will do I'll
show you a couple of slides and then
we'll switch and we'll work we'll work
on an application will be building
application today so if anybody has a
laptop with you and you want to turn
this presentation into a workshop fine
if you want to have more slides
yesterday I delivered a longer version
of this talk for three hours almost as a
deep dive and the video will be
available in the slides and instructions
are also there so you can kill two birds
with one stone so angular is a component
based framework released in 2016 in
September has nothing to do with
angularjs it's a different framework
basically and this framework that makes
a lot of sense to me as a Java developer
and it's easy to
and to me and hopefully to you as well
it's a component-based as I said every
app is a bunch of components has
declarative template by templates
I mean UI HTML you will be writing code
in typescript language is very similar
to Java and you don't need to write
JavaScript at all unless you decide to
use somebody else's existing library
which is also a good thing dependency
injection is there so the framework
instantiates classes for you and inject
them into component what is a class it's
a piece of business logic that you will
write just a class and you put business
logic in there what is a component it's
also a class but with UI it has
excellent router for client-side
navigation angular is a good fit for
single page apps what does it mean it
means that on every click we don't make
a request to the server and we don't
refresh the entire page only certain
portion of the page will be changed and
router will navigate the user within the
existing code on the client it uses
actively and in many places reactive
programming and in particular library
rxjs is integrated or actually it comes
with them angular if you know that these
concepts like observer observables
operators and so on it's there and as I
said you can write that in typescript or
JavaScript but recommended and preferred
way is typescript and this is what we
usually do when you look at a website
you need to ask yourself say we want to
develop
Twitter in angular or web designer gives
you some design you need to look at the
site and you need to ask yourself what
components are there how can I split
this page into multiple components and
you come up with something like this
when you have a top level component
a bunch of child components for example
up on top you have a navigation bar it's
a separate component on the left-hand
side I have a profile separate component
trends first for the new tweet I can
create a new component and for the
existing ones another one and so on
misery do you know that you can now use
two hundred and eighty characters in
Twitter I tested this morning it worked
and do you know who is very happy about
it
anyone exactly our president president
trop should be happy today it's like
money from home you know two hundred
eighty characters well it's not a
political joke guys let's concentrate on
angular and when the user clicked on a
menu item we want to change something
within the page not the entire page but
something within the page and there is
an area every app will have an area
called router outlet so within that
areas that you will designate you will
show one component or the other like on
the previous slide I showed several
tweets but if you click on the
notifications on top then this area will
be replaced and something else will be
rendered but just remember the concept
around ur outlet we will configure
routes and you'll designate the area for
changing parts so to speak fragments and
what's what we're going to be doing
today we will create this app like a
little online store which has a toolbar
on top these gray rectangles represent
images I'm just using a handy website
called place called dot it you can
specify a URL and say give me a
rectangle of this size so instead of
putting images it's very useful for demo
and there's some description of the
product I will be using JSON data when
you click on the on the title of the
product it'll show a different
under the toolbar showing details for
this product
let's go on the server for this
presentation I'm going to be using
spring boot app so spring boot will be
serving JSON data about product and
angular will be showing the data so this
app will be talking to spring boot and
one last thing before I will switch to
the to creating this app we will have
this setup angular comes with an
excellent tool called angular CLI
angular CLI generates through your
project and we'll do it now besides that
it comes with a little dev server with
cut reloads so we start the app and we
keep working we keep changing code as
soon as I change the code this little
server this CLI dev server automatically
rebuilds the bundles and the bundle is a
bunch of files that are broke together
your app may have a hundred files or 500
files we don't want to deploy all of
them on the web server so we will be
bundling them into small number of files
and the web server will be serving by
default it serves on the port 4200 our
angular app and if we want to hit this
server in my case which will be spring
boot that runs on port 8080 if I will be
trying to do this directly from the
client I will be violating something
that is known as same-origin policy if
the JavaScript piece comes from this
server this port it can only talk back
to this server the same server unless
the other server will prepare special
headers which may not be the case in
many cases in dev mode this is what we
will do we will create a little proxy
file and it'll be sitting in the front
end in the in the angular app and we'll
say whenever the URL the has a fragment
API slash API we will be saying this to
the CLI dev server he redirected to the
servers a transfer rate
when the app is ready of course you will
build the bundles and you will deploy
them right in your spring boot up so
after that introduction you don't need
this dev server so you'll be hitting
directly the server and port 8080
it'll send you the front-end app and
then it'll be talking back to the same
server getting sedate so there's a plan
I believe that's the last slide I wanted
to show you yes thank you so it but it's
it's a bit too early for thank you so
let's start at the bottom of each light
you have it maybe I should bring it back
github.com why pain it's my ID slash my
store if you go there then you will have
instructions that I will be using now to
build this up you'll find slides in
there as well
plus the working app both server and the
client so what I will do now I will open
up these instructions and I will run it
like as if it's a workshop I will be
taking pieces and I will be explaining
what I'm doing from the instructions and
then we'll slowly gradually we'll build
it yet and we have still 40 minutes for
this which would be enough first of all
you need to install node.js
on your computer if you want to work
with angular it's a standard tool that
is used by most of the JavaScript
developers there is a repository called
node.js dot-org where all the packages
are published all javascript packages
and maybe not all but most of them open
source packages are there it's similar
to maven central so we'll be installing
stuff from node.js dorg when you will
install nodejs it comes with npm npm is
a package manager that can install
things from a central repository or
maybe from github
think of it as maven so me even it's a
command-line tool right
you'll be writing in Vienna and
something in this world you'll be
writing npm install whatever you want to
install so after you download and
install node.js you already have NPM
installed and you have a new command
when your command prompt NPM so that's
the first part after you do this you
will need to install this angular CLI by
running this command on your command
line NPM install a angular CLI that
generator that will create your initial
project and the later one can help you
with builds and can generate as a
component and minus G at the end means
install it globally why because you need
this generator for multiple projects so
that of course I have these two steps
done
I have no GS and I have installed
English CLI for the IDE you can use one
of many I am using webstorm or IntelliJ
they support nicely both angular and
typescript you can use Visual Studio
code excellent IDE free open source you
can use different editors so support is
great for typescript so what do we start
with we start with a restarting the
server spring boot server if you will
download this entire directory from
github you will have a folder and in
that folder you will have in particular
you will have a subfolder called angular
for Java devs one level above there is
there is set of files called angular
applied there's a three-hour workshop
that I was running yesterday in slides
but we are interested in this directory
angular for Java tips slides earlier I
have a version of this app that I will
be building ready to go and I have a
server this server that we will start
now the spring server so if if you will
try to run instructions which are here
in the HTML file and if you run
internation you can always try to run
that example but I will be building a
new app from scratch in this folder
but first let me show you the server the
server is pretty simple spring server it
has a controller and in that controller
I have my little database of product six
of them Sheila's this is my database and
I have two api's to rest endpoints
actually one of them is nothing juices
don't trust me if if somebody will hit
the server with slash product in the URL
with a get request
it'll be redirected to this method and I
will be just returning array of products
as is that I have hard-coded values if
somebody will hit this server with the
URL which has product slash and a value
like product pages zero or one or two
then it'll be directed here and we find
the matching product in the array and it
will return just one product that the
rest api that will be easy start to
start the server you can start it right
from the ad or you can start it from the
command line using using this command
MVM spring boot rom hopefully the server
started let me let me check if i will go
to the to the browser local host on port
8080 slash api product yes it works he
responds so i have the i have the jason
from my product to see it a bit nicely
you can use this tool called jason lint
online copy paste and you will see what
data I have see all these products are
there so the back end is ready it works
so we will concentrate on the front end
in angular that will hit this back end
so let's go back to instructions and
that let's do this
now the client portion for this client
I'm going to be using for the UI I'm
going to be using a library which is
super popular in the JavaScript world
it's called bootstrap as a matter of
fact there are different UI libraries
that you can use for creating nine
looking you eyes we use for real-world
project we try to use mmm library called
angular material angle material material
and the library flex layout it allows
you to create really nice modern looking
UI
and flex layout allows you to make a UI
responsive and simplifies little
allocation of your controls on the
screen I work as a consultant so if the
client wants something else if you do
something else for example bootstrap or
there are other libraries as well as I
said so in this case I will be using as
I said bootstrap and the toolbars that
you see or over here for example the
toolbar is the toolbar from the
bootstrap that they are offering
bootstrap for under the toolbar I have a
bunch of components six of them one
component represents one product and the
name of this component will be product
item when I will click on this product
it will show me the different different
component showing product detail all
these six I can't items six instances of
the component will be sitting inside the
home component inside the home component
I'm going to loop through products that
I received from the back end through the
array and for each of them I will render
one product item six of them that's the
plan now let's do it yeah and this is a
product detail that we wanted to create
so first of all I want to generate a new
project as I said I will be using the a
package called angular CLI when you
install that you're going to get the ng
command on your command prompt then you
do ng new and the name of the project
you want to create and it'll create a
directory with its name and it'll
generate a whole bunch of files and
install all dependencies required from Z
and P mgs that work so what I will do I
will go to command line I already have
my store in here so what I will do I
will create a new project my store there
works for example right in the same
level so we are in this folder so what I
will do I will do
ng new my store Dericks it'll generate
all these files all these files already
generated but what it does now
now transcend p.m. install the the
project in JavaScript and many
JavaScript project and in particular
angular they will have a file called
package JSON it's similar you can think
of it as a poem XML in the Java world it
lists all dependencies that are required
the Engler itself is here plus some
other dependencies and we'll open up
this project and I'll show you what's in
there
meanwhile it's still install and let me
do this I will go to webstorm it's also
product of jet brain I will open up this
folder that was just generated which is
which is where the box it's somewhere
here
Belgium anger for Java developers and I
don't see it here apparently I wasn't
there in the wrong directory I guess I
might have been in the directory one
level above see it's not here oh no it
is here it seems anger right let me try
again
hey open English for Joe develop my
store
Dericks yes it is here so let me open it
up the project I guess it was already
generated and all dependencies were
installed already so now we are in web
store I'll open it up just throw you a
couple of things the project is ready in
the package Jason is this as you can see
I'm using version 5 of angular it was
released
10 days ago
difference between four and five minimum
I mean the performance improvements are
there the size the size of the files is
smaller but in terms of migration it's
very easy so the dependency section of
the package Jason shows you the
dependency that must be in the deploy
depth in production the dev dependencies
section of package.json is a list of
dependencies that must be present on the
developers machine they don't need for
production for example there is a whole
bunch of unit tests files library
jasmine karma is a test runner at the V
and you see typescript typescript will
be compiled into JavaScript browsers
don't know what typescript is and they
will never know
so our app we will be writing in the
typescript it will be compiled into
JavaScript bundle up and the browser
will receive JavaScript code so
obviously for production machining you
don't need a couple of words about
typescript you will see some examples
but it was created I believe five years
ago in at Microsoft and that is the
author under Skiles berg is the same guy
who designed c-sharp for example Delphi
I believe turbo Pascal as well this case
it's a really well designed language two
years ago probably not many people even
knew about this language but now based
on Stack Overflow they have survey it's
served most loved language so anyway so
that's the package is also one other
thing we have an SSD directory that was
generated for us it generated for us app
module an app component app component in
this case consists of four files dot CSS
typescript if not spec TS is it
generates for you unit test if you want
because they like boilerplate for the
unit test versus a component then it has
HD file for HTML and it has file for CSS
you don't have to have
files for a component you may have
inline CSS inline HTML but it still
offers you clean separation between
typescript code and the UI also
generated for me a module epidural
save the file this file lists all
components and services that you want to
have in a module a module will be will
be bundled in as a separate unit for
deployment in the declaration section as
we generate more components we'll keep
adding them comma separated so whatever
components you want to belong to this
module you will leave them in the
declaration section also a module may
depend or need other modules in this
case I write for the browser so that's
why I need to import browser module if I
decide to work with HTTP I will add HTTP
client module if I want to work with
forms for example I will let forms
modules all of them will be coming here
so what else I want to say yes there is
a file called angular CLI Jason it's a
configuration file for the project in
particular if you want to bring in other
JavaScript libraries which I which I
will do now I want to bring bootstrap
it's a twitter twitter styling library I
need to bring Styles CSS files from
bootstrap and bootstraps happen to
depend on 2000 JavaScript libraries
jQuery and popper I'm talking about
Rick's bootstrap for so I will need to
add in my configuration file in this
section Styles I will need to add one
extra line for bootstrap CSS and
intersection scripts which is empty now
I will leave those dependent in
JavaScript libraries and then goes
started so and this is exactly what I
wrote in the in the menu replace in the
English or replace style section with
this this is exactly what I'm doing now
style section I'm replacing because I
need bootstrap save now the script
section I also replaced based on what
the wrote in the manuals for the
bootstrap I replace it as you can see I
include files from the directory called
node modules whenever you run npm
install in the project it creates a
folder called mmm no node modules inside
your project that's why i'm referring to
i still did not install nor GS right so
you so this this wouldn't would give me
an error during the runtime so i need to
install it so typically we work with the
terminal window inside the ID so idea so
i don't need to go back and forth to the
command line so I will run NPM command
to install bootstrap which I want to use
in this particular project
once again it's it was just more my
choice to do this where do I have this
npm install here I don't see over here
yes so I want I'm going to say I want to
do NPM I I is short for install I want
to install
bootstrap jQuery library and popper J as
I needed for pop-ups and safe proteins
not only install it but add lines to the
dependency section of the package Jason
so next time I can just run NPM install
it and these guys will be in solitary so
that part is done they are installed and
if you I opened a package Jason you can
see that they are there these three guys
that I just installed for the future
installation I don't need to repeat it
so that part is done
now let me around the yet I want to show
you today that I go by the book and G
serve jail again I missed
oh you mean a fatty piece there let me
double check you oh this one sorry right
yeah thank you all right so angie is a
command angle she'll lie when they do ng
serve it it's what all the script acts
like you know what let me do this you
know how to copy paste better than me I
can give you this control Z like this
yes or no no this is strange it shows me
like as if I selected scripts right now
I did that's the reason all right okay
now it's better and the one above see
this is the problem with highlighting in
Drake chrome now hopefully it's fine so
basically you already know how to do the
jump see we just started the
presentation are you already helping
great so Angie is a command for English
alive when they do ng serve
it'll build the bundles in memory and if
I will add - all it'll also open up the
browser for me on the port 4200 M G
serve serve - oh I'm saying build the
bundles for me and open up the browser
and port localhost 4200 let me see it's
still building initially it'll spend
maybe like five ten seconds to build but
after that as you keep saving changes
it'll reboot them very quickly
she's except this is the Apple that was
generated for us what we will do will
gradually replace the code in this app
with our I will keep the server running
l
alone I will open up the second terminal
window and in there I will generate new
component services and while doing this
we will check to see if the UI is
changing accordingly so let's go by the
book again go to the manual so what I
want to do I want to generate several
components now and one service I want to
generate home component nav bar
component I want to generate product
item components within the home
component I will see this six product
items and when I click on the item I
want to use product detail component I
will keep using angular CLI for
generating those and g-g-gee is for
generate C is for component I could have
written it in a long way generate
component home
- spec Falls means I don't want to
generate a unit test code so first of
all I will open up the second terminal
window and I will do this ng ng home it
generated from e files ts file HTML CSS
and it updated the module file if I will
look at the module file you will see
that it added home component over here
it wasn't there before right so now I
will do I will do now bar product item
and product detail the same way arrow up
and then I will do nav bar then I will
do product item of course it's going to
be boilerplate code but it creates a
folder for each of these components with
all these files it updates the module
for me so it's it's still pretty useful
and deeper detail if you will click over
here you will see that now I have
additional folders he home now bar for
detail and prototype that's great once
again a pro
is sorry a component is a class
unenchanted with a decorator or in Java
code annotation but interpret the code
decorators so check it out I have a
component class its typescript it
implements interface on an INT and this
class is uh not a turd with the
decorator component each component which
has inside selector the name that you
are allowed to put in angle brackets in
other code template URL is where your
HTML is Styles URL is very you CSS is
and there are something else
encapsulation which I will not cover now
it's about fellow Dom how to encapsulate
CSS was in the Dome of the browser I
just don't have time for this and the
mere fact is not needed here this line
so next I want to generate a service
what for to get the date what will
happen is we will use the service
injected into component the service
takes care of the data gives it us and
we invoke the service from the component
and update the UI let the plan since we
are planning to use this service in two
places in home page and in pro retail
page I will generate it in a shared
folder and this is what it says and G G
again generate and now I use the letters
s or you can say serves where in the
shared folder I want to call it product
and I also had - M module because I want
to update something called providers the
dependency injection in angular needs to
know how to instantly is it is supposed
to be just an instance of a class that
you specify product service or you want
to use it for a factory function or
maybe you want to inject a value there
are different ways to do this so I will
I will generate this service and later
on and later on once again shall I
doesn't work I don't understand why I
think I relied commandery now it created
a folder shared for me was this
boilerplate code it has nothing in there
will replace this code and the final
things that you want to add in the
module we want to add router
configuration when you develop an app
that will need routing and pretty much
every app needs routing so navigation
for the user you need to add router
module to your route module router in
the import section of the route module
in this case what I do I do
I map I map I'm saying if after the
service portion URL you have nothing
render home component if you you have a
fragment in the URL product slash value
render probably tail component that's
all there is to it I go to the app
module and in the import sections
I add my router a ID helps me out it
says I don't know what it is what is
router it's red alt-enter
and it's important that thing this is
not a mistake I tells me tears Lynn
sells me don't use double quotes you
single cause I didn't change it in my
IDE I didn't change the setting all
right so routes are configured now let's
try to see if we can start adding
components as I said add components is a
top root component super the top level
component so what do you want to have we
want to have a nav bar on top and
underneath I want to have an area that I
will designate as a router outlet in
that area I will be switching home
component and the Florence AL component
so replace a PP component HTML whizzes
let's do this a PP component HTML was
generated for us I don't need any of
these I will replace it save if I will
go back to this second console you
didn't see it but it it was recompile
during let's see if this is the case let
me go back to my store yep it works
these this text comes from generated
text for the component when I was
generating components if generated this
dummy HTML kong number wars homeworks so
our app work so add component knows that
I need to show now burning underneath
homework now let's replace this dummy
text nav bar with something that we want
what I did for this demo I just went to
bootstrap site and they give you the
whole bunch of different components I
picked in there mmm the bootstrap the
navbar if you follow this link you will
see this code and this is exactly what I
will be using I will not be changing
even one line I just want to show you
that they that you can use it from
bootstrap I go back and I need to go to
navbar component now and replace its
HTML has now bar works not anymore all
right
save see it recompiled recompile the
code I go back let me see how my app
looks like nice you see a toolbar up
there
that's a toolbar from bootstrap of
course you need to customize it that the
menu provide clicks and so on but it is
working fine now home component hmm do
we need to do anything else
no nothing with no bar no I want to
generate product service first if you
remember our spring boot server sends us
products right Jason and the did I show
you that
class in the spring good service I have
the class product and that that's the
structure of this class and on the front
end I'm gonna get the same structure so
what I do here I I want to generate a
new class product es new typescript file
I'll call it product that she has really
need to write it down and I will copy
mmm copy the interface I want to define
my type as interface type script
interface I could have defined it as a
class but interface in this case just
save me some it it will save me some
space or make the size of the generated
code smaller I was explaining this in
the yesterday presentation if you want
you can watch it we just don't have time
I have 12 minutes and we need to finish
the app so there's kind of a value
object type for the value object will be
returned to us by the spring server and
now the product source you have we kept
the service generated by the way I see
it is marked as injectable so angular
will properly injected into components
so we want to replace the code of the
product service with this what do we do
in this class we want to say I'm
planning to use HTTP client HTTP client
is angular object that knows how to talk
to the servers whenever you put
something in the constructor of the
class it means that you want injection
we are basically this line says just
give me the object the instance of HTTP
client so I can use it you don't need to
use a new statement because it's already
there and what I do I start using it
right away see the variable should be
client I'm saying if you pick client get
I am expecting products I am saying hit
the endpoint API slightly press this
products this is what we have in the
spring boot server and the second API on
the front end I have get product by ID
this guy is mm2 to pick a particularly
public
just one so what I will do I will just
take this code I will change this code
as is and I will copy it over and I will
replace the generated product/service of
this code see again copy paste
alright so that's my product source on
the client recompile rebuild we don't we
won't see anything different because we
didn't use this perk service yet next
next we want to use it right one other
thing since I say I'm saying in this
HTTP in this service that I am planning
to work with HTTP I need to declare it
in the module HTTP is a module of itself
so I want to say in my main root module
that I am going to use HTTP client so I
can copy paste or it's better to type
because I mistake HTTP client see id
helps you out
does the import and everything so I said
I'm going to use a typical and much so
we're done with that now prototype them
component 1 components it's supposed to
show me renders II in the product item
the product item component is right
there what do we have here what do you
have there
we are saying that you product item
components a class by the way you will
get a product given to you through the
eight input property at input property
is the way how the parent can pass the
data to the child so this product knows
will should know how to render it for
now we just typed script code and in a
minute I'll show you the the HTML I will
replace the generated code with mine
forgot me I don't understand what's
going on with this Chrome it behaves
weird all right this part is almost
there all right now it's clean HTML for
the product item I'm using standard tags
from html5 there is a tag called figure
which allows you to show an image with
some description prototype and component
HTML done now now that's pretty much it
and home component my home component
will help will render a bunch of product
item components right so let's use let's
use it here let me copy paste and then
I'll explain you what I'm doing home
component it's right there I don't need
this generated code what what am I doing
here
speech is missing that's fine so what
I'm saying here look at this in the
constructor I specified product/service
meaning I want to inject the product
service and I'll be using it that
product service will hit the bootstrap
server and then after the constructor in
your cool special lifecycle hook method
ng own in it in there
I invoke on that service I invoke get
products method and for HTML in the HTML
I want to say I'm gonna get some number
of products I don't know how many I have
I'll have them in this array I want to
loop through the array of product and
for each one I want to render certain
certain thing so what I will do
let the code in g4 in Engler special
structural directive says loop through
the product let product we had a clear
loop variable and for each of them
render a PP product item a PP product
item is my product item the selector
name that was generated is a PP product
items that's why I can use it like a
regular HTML tag that's pretty much it
look through this and generate from is
approach the product let me go and see
if something changed so my stored air
box I see an empty screen I used to have
homeworks at least not anymore that's a
bad sign if you see an empty screen it
means that there is an error and if you
go to the console you'll see an error
404 I knew about this error and it's in
the instruction why it happens the air
this app was brought to me from the web
dev server that runs on port 4200 right
I'm hitting back the server and port
4200 saying give me product right and I
said I don't know what it is because my
products are in the spring boot server
right on port 8080 so what I will do I
will create a little file a little proxy
saying whenever the whenever the URL has
slash API in there redirect it to the
other server that runs on port 8080 to
do that I will need to generate a new
file and you file a little file which
defines the proxy I will create a file
proxy connotation and in there I will
let me show you what will be in there I
will just specify this redirect I will
go to the very root in the root I will
create a new file new file a proxy you
can call it anything
one called not Jason and once again I
missed I missed the EPI what I'm saying
is whenever you see a piece less API in
the URL it redirected to that localhost
8080 don't worry about security I am in
development mode I'm I'm running the
same server so now to to make this work
I need to say that I want to restart
this app using this file this proxy ng
sir and there's a special key word proxy
config and I you specify the name of the
file that you can just configure proxy
Cohn dot JSON let's do - so actually I
already have that window open let it
rebuild the package with the use of that
proxy and then I will go and hit the
same developer server on port 4200 again
here are the errors from my previous I
killed that server
see you then I have the app running they
all the data that you see now we're
served to me by the spring boot server I
don't have much time left
but if you want to follow the
instructions that you have you can
finish it and generate and replace the
code of pro retail component and when
you will be clicking on the title of any
of these it's already linked it'll show
you the product detail by the way since
I was using bootstrap it was it is
already responsive design it will
allocate or relocate the code based on
the on the width of the screen see for
example if you go to the small screen
like smartphones
it'll rearrange the the menus collapse
and the allocation is changed so
responsive web design is you
other things that you might you may want
to look at so at the end of this file
instructions file you also see
instructions how to deploy is the server
this is project a component but at the
end how to deploy it's also not
difficult you need to add several
scripts several scripts in the
package.json comm and then the bundles
will be built what I did now I did not
generate actual files when I did in G
sort all bundles were generated in
memory for their mode it's useful and
it's fast we don't need files but when
you will be deploying you will be doing
in G built in G builder it it'll
optimize a app create the files and we
can write a little script that will copy
the files under the spring boot server
so this is pretty much it this is what I
wanted to say I have like a minute for
questions or I can stay you can ask me
later do you have any questions anyone
yes can we can we have multiple arms
around for some of the page yes the
answer is yes they're called secondary
or auxiliary outlets you just have to
give them names
yes very good question by the way you
both of you will get this code if you
want for the color percent discount of
ebook should you have one or multiple
marks definitely split your code into
multiple modules angle support so-called
route modules like that we have but
realistically you'd have so-called
feature modules for example shipping
module billing module and so on angular
support so-called lazy loading if you
want you can lazily load some modules
only if the user will click on the menu
then you will bring the code pretty
flexible and powerful thing to do what
you what you should do in the real world
project you should create the route the
route module as small as possible only
the core personality of your app should
be there
and then the user will quickly see their
the rest will come from the feature
module and there are different policies
for laser loaded you can create real
orders and it can load them in the
background and so on alright thank you
very much for coming if you have any
questions just stop by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
