introduction to AWS lambda my name is
Oliver guys I'm from a german company
named a bottle which is part of the
bertelsmann group I highly appreciate
that you spend your lunch time and so I
hope you enjoy AWS lambda is one of
three computer options also AWS cloud
service and the most popular one is and
the oldest one is easy to which gives
you a virtual machines you have ecs not
so new anymore since one year roughly
it's easy to container service which
gives you docker container execution and
then we have the lambda platform it
gives you function execution so the
difference between the first two and
lambda is that in the case of ec2 and
ecs you have a complete virtual machine
or container running a little machine
and in lambda you have an managed
execution environment so you can compare
this to manage application server but
without any language dependencies so in
our rough quick overview you upload your
code you configure triggers so-called
event sources which emits event and then
lambda invokes your code with the title
from this event and the interesting
point from a business point of view is
that you paper invocation so if you
compare this too easy to you pay for the
running our independent if your
application is doing something or not in
the case of lambda you only pay for the
duration of your invocation okay
applause you code what kind of code
thank you currently there are three
supported language sometimes it's an
old Java 8 it's pison Python since last
month there was a big reinvent
conference from the conference from
amazon in the united states and this is
always a time of a lot of announcement
and was the time they announced Python
support but in the upcoming months I
assume there will be additional
languages supported like for example go
language or Ruby language the execution
environment is managed but nevertheless
you are not restricted in the way that
their white list or black lists like in
the early days of the Google cloud
platform and you have an amazon Linux
environment your quote had complete
control you can create thread processes
access native code create sockets file
systems and so on so a complete control
over the environment only exception you
do not have root access and there's a
requirement for your code from the
semantics a point of view your code
should be stateless because the
environment is not persistence that says
you can't assume that between in
vacations you execute in the same
environment the platform can decide that
you the next invocation will happen on a
other instance then talking about
programming model and of course they're
different languages supported in every
language has their own syntax semantics
and so on but there are similar concepts
in all these languages your function
handler actual code which gets executed
should be stateless you get the event
data as a parameter to function in no
chairs or to a message in Java and you
have contacts support for example to
check timeout
various or something exists and you can
you have logging support or your lock
locks are written to the cloud watch
lock service you package a pure code
into zip files and with all required
libraries and then you upload directly
to lambda or you upload to s3 and point
lambda to the s3 bucket so invocation
types there are two types in which or
two ways in which your function can get
invoked one is the so-called event type
this is an SN Cronus invocation it's one
way no response and you have the typical
request response like you are familiar
with rest interfaces or something like
this so your code gets executed and you
will provide a result and this is a
synchronous invocation and besides of
the invocation types there's the
question of integration model to this so
called event sources this is a rather
rather general concept so in some cases
lambda pulls the event sauce so there's
a loop going on inside of lambda and
this is polling on the on the event
source or the event sauce has special
lambda support in it and invokes lambda
directly so to make this more concrete
two examples one for the pool model the
kinases sink about penises roughly is a
Kafka q I will talk about penises
tomorrow in the cookie and lambda holds
this this Q and every time there's new
data in it it invokes the lambda
function so you only pay if there's data
available and there's a
looping going on I think 200
milliseconds currently and then and the
function gets executed there's another
example for the push and this is M s 3 s
3 has a direct support for a lambda and
you can configure s3 to invoke a lambda
function if something happens inside of
a three for example someone uploads a
file to a s3 bucket and then you can
react to this in Orlando function here
I've prepared an overview slide about
all the EWS services which are currently
integrated with lambda and you'll find
the services on the left and then it's
mark if this is a push or pull and model
integration or and if a call is
event-based one base just informing the
function as a lambda function that
something has happened or is if it's
request response so you can yeah modify
the behavior of the of the calling
service okay then this is everything
what is built in from from the side of
Amazon but what about you a code so only
man invocation and you can of course cos
lambda API directly from your coat your
back-end code or mobile apps and there's
also support inside the Mobile SDK and
there's special support inside the one
of the newer services AWS API gateway
which the sole purpose is to receive
rest codes and transverse this map says
to lambda function and also rather new
is
terms or option to use scheduled
invocations so you can configure clammed
up to configure totals will execute your
code every five minutes or every hour or
something like this and desk on
expression support to also built in is
monitoring so you get the meatrix how
often your code gets executed how long
is the duration everything is stored
inside of cloud watch AWS monitoring
service and like explained before also
order locks are stored inside of cloud
40 lakhs okay this is the idea of lambda
is to be the glue codes between a
processing pipeline to give you an
example consider the use case of
resizing images for different purposes
like for example you are your
application uploads photo tool s3 bucket
and then you can have a lambda function
which gets triggered every time the
photos uploaded and then it's called
image resizing functionality you can
code a use native code which is running
on Linux and resize the image start back
to 2 a 3 over it fits and you have no
server to manage for this use case this
scaling is completely managed and if you
have one image uploaded per day or if
you have thousands of images uploaded
per second it's completely managed and
the scaling and the number of invocation
is managed by the demand which is
triggered by the a number of uploads to
as3 balikatan so some miscellaneous
remarks at the end and behind the scenes
as a container below and this is not
documented services Linux you have
something in between and Amazon calls
this a container and this container is
managed and there is something going on
of freezing and thawing this is not
really documented but you can find some
blog posts and some support information
in the forums and this means that Amazon
behind the scenes manages the process of
putting the number of lambda functions
to a big cluster of ec2 instance and do
this maybe with some kind of container
in isolation or some homegrown
technology this is not documented but
you can notice the effect of this
because after roughly five minutes so
your first invocation is a little bit
slower than the remaining ones and this
also brings us to the topics of codes a
tap x which is language independent and
the keynote mark Reynold mentions
startup time of a Lunger of java virtual
machine so there needs to be a time
where this java virtual machine is
initialized or the class loader gets
initialized and your class is loaded and
this is much slower than for example no
chase and amazon is working on this and
in the past months there was some
progress but it still knows it
noticeable and this has a cost impact
minor one but it has a one so a
conclusion what are
pros forces set up its release manage
you do not care about server management
a cluster management and so on its
twenty four seven without any ops
intervention it's auto-scaling you paper
invocation and so this is this is a
model and on the contrast side of course
this is completely proprietary in amazon
stuff it's not an ejb model or container
model from Java world or something that
exists but rather specific interfaces
but the vendor lock-in for my opinion is
not very hard because it's just
scrolling interface and you can migrate
such kind of architecture to a
self-managed cluster as easily and
second thing to remember is the way of
the different cost model this is a topic
of its own to calculate the number of
requests and number of used memory which
is aligned to the cost model and the
number of milliseconds the unit of
payment is also a unit of course is is
100 millisecond millisecond and
execution time so this is my final slide
so my time is up thank you and if you
have any further questions I would be
happy to answer this in front of the
room or the other you need thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
