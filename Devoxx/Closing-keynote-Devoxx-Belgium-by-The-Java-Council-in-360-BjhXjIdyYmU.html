on twenty sixteen years almost over
apparently okay like I'm gonna be
eighteen that's what happened all the
content is blin and gone already and any
notes that you put in our country
because you don't have the baptism hello
at the end of this conference where we
have all this criteria will lead right
speakers and all the stuff that we've
that we've experienced or have we learnt
from this conference well there's been a
big thing around machine learning and
robots are going to just yes you already
touch them down we're seeing the queue
of that is still have a little bit of
way to go so that's what I see we can do
the reverse during this and see for you
and converse of the robot and see how
that goes right so yes who are the
opening keynote okay so this is awesome
Felix up and I'll a go anytime and
and I'm uh I guess I'm going to find my
keys on walk and has an equation hi
hi okay I what is high what is that ox
ox what what what these headaches let me
ask my friends awesome he walks what
well that was a conference which is over
15 years old solitaire document was
called jobless it is now a global
conference in the US in France in
Morocco in the UK and Poland k box
conference into an exam referring to
talk to bottom so high right is the next
president of the United States hi okay
what is that
what is the president of the united
states united
music must turn up music oh I
just giving up already the question
asked about you as traditionally really
holds more unexpected money by taking
our employees yeah sorry and we're
ansible i'm suspecting our homeboy is
extremely close java and pass them the
deep and meaningful relations very
different when it's not the first
question come from the California region
the largest economy just going to brush
it burning technically number six or so
we're going to ask the equation what's
the best vintages it has come out of the
California wine region
she was accompanied with easing into a
non-profit ravanelli breaking records
infants all vintage moving on the 2d
topic around a bit I think it's
fantastic I worked through a an early
access book O'Reilly by Paul Becker he's
head of the crown and with his
colleagues and so openly teams in the
value of it what are the concerns that
myself and colleagues at the London java
community is spoken about this kind of
the fear that framework and library
North is a particular lag in terms of
marginalizing their popular frameworks
libraries that we will take part on
utilities this is something that
horrible that is planning to an
educational front I find you like
is this something I or we require is
worried about so part of a little design
is driven by the knowledge that not
everybody's going to migrate at once
because I new office isn't like that it
would be stupid of it easy so it just as
with generics you can i rid of their own
code to wait for libraries that you used
to migrate erics the same is true with
on migrations already have an existing
system of jar files you can I respond I
great many cases need to wait so you
know yeah there's a learning curve here
and we certainly done that don't expect
everybody to knot it right away you have
to go learn some stuff and understand
the benefits and motivated to do it okay
i would say working particularly worried
you know it will not be the case that
it's adopted as quickly as plans because
the lambdas are kind of a point feature
you can you can let leverage them really
well in the small you know
changes models are average it's okay if
it takes of your views because it's them
together I'm going to take a quick
stroll poll actually here annuities has
somehow motorized a hat either through
maven modules osgi cheney las motos with
some other similar current credit system
via razor heads okay so i think we
consider in which is a good sign thank
you it's quite good so on to the next
question and actually couldn't connect
with one word point is under steer this
conference today made the assertion that
car behind later that you will pretty
much half an odd rows even if you wanna
sale classified you can copy handle for
the next 20 years c java saluting
backwards compatibility between diaz
so I have here some plans which would
suspiciously like me gifts actually
there's a pandemic so a lot of time
developers by to get this information
right costume so we're quite happy with
what we seen in the future this thing's
like value types is the amt coming into
Java nine and pink palace to everyone
but there is one concern we have we see
the global attend being applied to a new
core library class called wall could you
comment on that because I believe
everything all quite possibly yes so
yeah I guess I can't rid of it I said
somebody's really thinks that well we
need to make a great again
I me today so frankly I'd say to school
right I'm sure you can eventually find
in some drier islands and never nobody's
laid back here positive da first
heavy-hitting quickies nuts yeah I
wanted to I wanted to ask you some
questions around your career I keep your
visa much off it's the wine I'm Indian
yes so what kind of made you want to get
into penalty do you want to do is just
kind of accidentally fall into well you
know my daughter like she's not in the
same thing okay what I comp a second
since we did with real exam
well I would when I was a kid you know
computers were these large things and
data centers he's easy and Senator this
a while ago seeker here so you know
physical place that's what i did there a
long time that eventually ground out of
middle school computers like this is
intolerable that I can you know very
plastic you can kind of do it alone mix
whole universe and that's oh my god do
you guys like em both of evil whose
books you read inside you to come into
it or was it more just from the joy in
the building i would say at first it was
it was marketed it was more than
building as time went on of course you
know i developed my heroes i remember in
high school saving my allowance for a
while and then making a pilgrimage my
family night with outside of
Philadelphia making it a little bit on
the train into the city to the bookstore
and when I ain't got my money to buy
while he was 12 the three pink bear even
love my very proud and I felt good
writeup all the way call
is going to be in your way at some point
right that's why gold is before my
Kindle because if I carry my Kindle
around the knowledge will end up in my
clothes I mother Hector a table top
Oracle engineer leaner off sage or a
keynote but i think it's happened a bit
about you we've introduced ourselves
with talk to mark let's talk about which
java versions you guys are honest
embarrass people who is using and look
who is using the latest and greatest job
and I great great great people asker's
using in production of who is using a
production yeah
eight knots on Java right wow that's
pretty good I just hang Chang we learn
to all the 70 / 6 it's almost more on 60
70 that's the month going for he's
working in the face you're gonna have a
shot are you android developers sorry
notice the dark side you can let's talk
about who you are in terms of where you
from and I know that was in Europe
specifically about him I'm cheer about
you who's from and be brave the numerous
news from North America
we found a droid this year in general do
we count anyway you're excluding the UK
including solid solid information so
yeah that's what you said we need you
decided to stay home from Africa
cheer up any son mr. Hanning like Devils
everywhere we went we lost a couple of
political Gator writes it and North
America whatever is happening there
there's a reason why this is happening
do you know why what's happened I don't
want to offer an opinion shut up I need
to talk seriously to my greatest friends
and whatever i'm ill to run you that
seems happen in the past and bad things
might happen in the future may see a
proper what happened earlier this week
voting for either Trump of children so
if I go and say maybe hold the trump are
you done it again give it if I say vote
for Trump and people don't like me and
we'll do the opposite thing then might
go to URI maybe takes a good or bad
thing if you want something to really
master you I thought about a cockiness
or in Paris will custody brain so
Hillary Clinton Donald Trump treasure
let's keep remembering the times of me
used to sit in the carbonized a drink
red wine and I used to talk about my
dating words but i'll talk about that
we're gonna be winter is to be dating
we're so we're going to talk about and
we're not going to match up with a new
career sometime I'd be disappointed
other and we are going to do like two
minute interviews with respect to people
in the community or failing that people
we can find in the audience
point out and we're going to do a few
quick questions I meeting with Mark
about like how you got where you are
today we're going to shoot you happy
with what you got today so oh yes how
many of these i'm going to do so until
we're not i guess yeah man 19 minutes
left so we think we need necessarily a
few sites are just around the audience
of excellent yes please take the random
by the corsage duty to correct me are
you missing your water an England target
anyway makes it no well does he 16
kilobytes around and you oughta
programming it because you wanted to
kroger on the eggs yes yes it would be
games but of course it in graphics asian
games you know test I think I love no
idea what you're talking
did you have any role models and I kind
of encourage you like either one or just
people you kind of suppose it would be
my sort of not right but sort of my
career it would be time is you kind of
like learn more or you just kind of role
models favorite line from the English
language and you got to talk about
coming really any other questions I had
like I'm westerns are they okay I was
just like removing the androids but you
were it was like a lot more kind of
right so what else someone else someone
else think Thank You Simon
that's right it's got a legacy papi
Ortiz you just kind of pretend you know
intimidating it's all right something is
there all set in his armchair entertain
right this is just so that you can kind
of like have your eyes following
something while you drink three sectors
okay how did you get started in
technology oh boy Walter young my father
actually a world eight seven computers
yes we had a chance to 86 back to the
house and as I started to question is
basically like how old it was ready bc
and did you have any role models as
you're coming into this or like any
physical people rather than like so so
much Holly I was in a group in Taiwan
and literally just me and the computer
and there was nothing else yeah I had to
read books I got even know anyone really
oh you will not see the technology field
back in and it had to be books I don't
remember anything right I just know I
don't even read English at the time but
you have to type all the leg
right so that's the first time I've
learned how to pipe and I don't know who
actually wrote a book to be honest yeah
but wherever wrote a book in Chinese
overtime any kind of yoga guru and you
had conferences and anything that stuff
did you kind of accumulate role models
like Pokemon all kind of stuff talked or
did you just kind of like depend upon
your own because my first party there
was no internet so I really had to just
read but then I think that I some
welcome to jungle Java is pearl so I was
not a price on a pearl it's only about
only unsafe thanks ray
yes one of somebody's going to say on
face you know people to see anyone is
fun okay okay i might have changed up
for interesting now because now
everyone's heard the question now i just
find a way to ask the hard questions ask
the hard questions like where you see is
up in five years time let's March
himself in five years time when he still
turn a trick so anyway moving technology
so please hello I'm Catherine Roman I
work for box excellent and so how do you
get to technology programming
specifically I guess so my older brother
Ben it was doing my civic Yumi's the
game's pretty much the adventure games
like pick up a hammer goes all in them
yeah from it kind of grew from there and
that I didn't do anything about maybe 15
years to technology I went to this kind
of technology warriors like I'm gonna
study math kind of ignore anything and
then I needed a job
and actually I I try to be a lawyer and
then funding issues money self-funding
horrible it's not the fact you met some
lawyers and decided
lawyer be decided yeah pretty much i was
working wearing three jobs at one point
I determine in the Cure shop when things
are really bad and then a restaurant
evenings and the chocolate shop right if
you dropped with chocolate and then I
Sheedy people right you guys know there
is something called a botch options and
from the outside it's kind of a sec so I
know that he's a few he has a piece on
stage and we're going to stress like you
guys
that's you so one of the symbol of Java
and wants to make these ways somebody
goes camping the drawn-out talk or go to
think bad blood and really pattern of
you believe in it it's someone who work
at 80 drama and try to improve it every
day all right someone efficiently cares
about each other wants to do right by it
for the whole world yeah oh yeah oh yeah
welcome to sunny because I can you know
wrong now but if you're special case
Rizzo a microphone in
so we go immediate answer view their
jobs for to the bathroom so that's why a
cheap industry so I'm all for Java does
have other people that do you like that
money um so what yes each other so 2017
the opportunity it's very busy at the
engine a Yale initiative every week
we're going to pick a different Pollock
to get each other and I need some roll
eyes are bleeding or requests from just
only retire champion it is a random job
and concealer project always doing the
running day locks against damage girls
and their accountant cities so if you
might be involved and actually they're
talking about Joseph Adama actually
practically doing something
come in us and what you optical
everything you want us to come here for
that you like sharing community very
much from the get-go very clever square
is like like any community so it's
always cannot try to keep the momentum
pushing is that how you see yourself or
you very much so I think so still in
terms of things like we're driving
schools briefly Kevin's community was
one of many community to tending towards
their leads to other example John right
leading some of the testing and if it's
around drive right to help get outdoors
are we done by the opportunity
particular and will not see that the
first thing where if you go to work on
week one week job in line testing so we
encourage ourselves everybody air and
you run the broader ecosystem to take
drive around for a test run and you all
the lead back to the squad unsuspecting
organization is other engineers
okay and submit a million members only
on all jockey situation but they listen
to me if you wanna all I want involve
Cassandra if you get my to Sondra if
people won't turn more about what a good
job Chinese are how they can get
involved champions how their communities
where will people where do you need to
go to get more information about sort of
the URL the exact URL is escaping me if
you go to community or calm and then
search on Java champions you have an
external facing space that will have you
know we're going to eat are going to
start doing a weekly blog that kind of
correlates all the content these are
doing every week and then we're also
going to various initiatives that
information
there's actually also periodic half of
the damage have you sold all the score
champions because you have to notice
java champions on 3 1 has created a
website where we were friends java
champions and ii ended up in the world
