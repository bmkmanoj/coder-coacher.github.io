Heinz Heinz no no yeah not Kathy Kathy
Katherine Katie cat Kate they're all
fine but not Kathy what's wrong with
Kathy are you the scrimmage against all
Cathy's out there yeah Heights for me so
I just every time I hear the name Kathy
I hear the Cape this is bad mother
father
okay that's fine it may be talked about
sue no yet no no yeah Jake sit wait one
day that would be cool sorry I wish to
talk about you oh he talked about well
what do you in a chocolate I want to
talk about shooting yourself in the foot
with Java 9 but you might want to talk
about something else
well you could maybe talk about shoot
yourself in the foot birth with Java in
general yeah okay all right teach me
something
well my favorite is null don't you love
null null is brilliant I have come to
rely on no allows you to any at any
point of time to any piece of code to
use of the foot it's absolute
fantastical basis if instead of
returning for example an empty array or
an empty collection to return null from
a method that's the service is a
fantastic yeah I don't know why they
just optional it's such a waste of time
just give it all back I personally enjoy
null checks the objects ladies it makes
the code so much more readable yeah that
and if you're using an array sometimes
empty and then you have to use if not no
and not empty yeah because if for so
empty you're kind of in if it's empty
you're not going to do anything anyway
that's true that's what you do have to
check for null so the cool thing is you
could just say if if not null and if you
have multiple fields it to take would
not know it makes a code so clear
crystal clear doesn't it
offensive and in list of lists of lists
real interesting like you could you can
actually make a do matrix out of
aerialists of
legalists yantras oh that's fun and
expensive in memory as we learn the
weekend that's only you know that's any
in theory you know the hot spot proffer
could optimize everything I'm joking of
course bees don't do this alone
so how how else can we Bend Java code
what else can we do sorry I can't hell
is coming burn Java code well as I said
I think my the number one mistake is
sort of people using nulls in the wrong
way and also the JVM the JDK libraries
are full of that as well so it's all
over the place and then another place we
have seen a lot of people make mistakes
as with exception handling incorrect
exception handling
and so we've checked exceptions were a
sort of a practical joke gone wrong it's
only language that has this stuff and
they're sort of admitted guilt sort of
in Java 8 when they introduced the
unchecked IO exception because I
exception at something like a hundred
subclasses so i exception oh it's got a
huge number of subclasses all right
it's like 87 or 89 or so it's a really a
lot of subclasses or maybe even more
you've got for example malformed you're
all exception found that found exception
I think remote exceptions i exception as
well and so you've got I accept at the
top then you've got you know like huge
number of subclasses and within each one
it's one exception could signify lots of
things that go wrong sometimes you just
get a general IO exception which could
be a disk full exception what could be
somebody pulled out the USB stick you're
writing to you just know it didn't work
you don't actually know what didn't work
so the AI exception as is one of those
that I find particularly amusing and in
order to make it to work with streams
and with files and so on they introduced
this thing called an unchecked IO
exception where they should have just
said let's make an unchecked exception
to make anything unchecked but they
didn't they don't have the bravery for
that yet maybe maybe in the future
maybe I did really enjoy your example
it's so so a vision of you talk at
another conference and I really enjoyed
your example of circumventing the Java 9
security the class loading well what
other class I think yeah yeah the class
that what they actually you mean to to
deduce your own classes
well that's it's something which stuff
needs to be possible because the the
Javad almost not developed in our
sedation people develop parts of Java
all the time and so they'll develop a
few classes back them into module and
into you know a separate jar file like
for example the the java.util concurrent
and that is to develop separately from
the rest so the so it's absolutely
needed to be able to create a patch now
in the past this is very easy its impede
compile the class and secondly boot
class path when you're done but nowadays
it's far more difficult because it
requires three steps the first step is
you have to see you have to actually
compile that class as a patch you can't
just compile a class called Java it'll
ArrayList or anything in twelve years
old it's got to be in your own package
not a java new tool so the first thing
is to create a patch with that clot was
there package name and after that the
next step would be to to compile your
code against the patched version and
then the third step is to run it against
the patched version so there's like
three steps whereas in the past you
could just come part without any special
effort and then when you ran it you just
say my slash minus X boot class path and
spec but it's a good class path to start
it up why are your eyes glazing over
mrs. Beaumont because I'm trying to
understand why you say it difficult for
me to process him reaching into my mind
to the visual examples in the talk I was
remembering the IDE you using I could
explain the full I'm glazing over
process it's difficult it's difficult to
follow
I find it difficult sorry I would find
your topic the figure to follow to see
the problem we have is that when we work
on one particular thing after a while of
looking at one particular thing it
becomes kind of obvious - yes and
everything else might not be serviced
but that is obvious so if you do machine
learning you'll gonna come on this
simple artificial intelligence something
like I won't understand it either it's
completely normal
see the problem is every time I read
about class loading I think I've grasped
it and then if someone asked me what
class loading was I'd really struggle to
explain it so I need to draw some more
pictures
yeah well the whole idea of class
loading is sort of you need to be able
to have multiple classes with the same
name and package but which are different
in one virtual machine otherwise you
can't build application servers and that
basically is it that's it nothing else
to say I'm just gonna write that down
and memorize it right - 20 times yeah
thank you very much pleasure Katherine
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
