the devoxx experience so far is it good
bad anything up great yeah thank you
actually for attending today let me
introduce myself first my name is Mari I
am a developer advocate and I have I my
name is demo and I am a body an expert
and a framework developer at Verdun so
how many of you have heard about modding
before raise your hands up yeah that's
an impressive number just to recap
really quickly so warden is a java you I
very work our main goal is to make easy
for you to build amazing web apps hey
but we are not here to talk about one
right yeah let's talk about technology
in general today we are more interested
about how technology look like so back
in time we had this like six years ago
or something like that we had this move
toward the cloud nowadays it's no longer
an argument to convince somebody that
your next web application should run on
the cloud that's just a default now and
also recently it happened that web
developers enterprises and decision
makers realized that they also need to
reach people on mobile devices that's
something that started to appear
recently and I think most people now
believe that reaching more audience we
need to be able to have a handheld
friendly website or mobile app but the
question is how the future will look
like after this how the near future will
be shaped actually statistics and those
kind of a little bit old statistics two
years old or something like that we
noticed that the internet traffic coming
from mobile devices exceeded this coming
from desktop devices that's why we need
to take a decision here we need to take
action those of you who are building web
applications for desktop need to take an
action
but the confusion is most of you have in
your offices nice display big screen
you're using heavy software for coding
or video editing or photo editing and so
on you have high powerful processor and
moreover you have high stable connected
internet so having this mindset in my
hand and having this as my daily job
whenever I go to my job I have to use a
laptop that is powerful with powerful
processor and having a real reliable
internet makes me wonder how come people
are increasingly using mobile devices
this just doesn't work with me as a
developer the answer is most of you demo
myself we are a Content producer a
Content producer is a person like most
of you probably who is building a
software or building a web application
or building maybe even article on the
internet most of our time is spent on a
laptop a powerful device but we need to
make a differentiation here between the
mindset of us the content producers and
the rest of the world in other words in
your next web application which audience
you want to reach is it this little
orange portion or the blue portion don't
do like us we are a framework people we
are targeting the orange part most of
the time but we are striving to make our
framework able to make you as a
developer reach the blue part that's why
we need to rethink about our web
development strategy a lot of research a
lot of statistics and I can share from
me with you some big trends for example
those statistics show that the number of
users who are using mobile web is only
thirteen percent so even though there is
a lot of effort of making web mobile web
applications look good
still the portion is a little bit small
and the interesting part is those of
eighty-seven percent people who are
using native apps only eighty percent of
their time is spent on only three apps
so I'm looking at myself I have almost
like I don't know 200 app on my mobile
device but still I'm only spending most
of my time on only three apps so there
is some something missing here right
actually this chart show it correctly we
have a web application that is
guaranteed to be up to date all the time
it has the latest feature and it's
connecting with the latest server and
latest database and everything but it's
missing capabilities that's why native
apps are emerging people prefer native
apps or apps installed from the
marketplace because they have native
capabilities so another another
interesting statistic show that the
number of apps installed let me ask this
how many of you actually remember
installing an app within the last two
weeks or one month for example oh by the
way a divorce app does not count
actually statistics show that the number
of app is told from the marketplace per
user per month is zero I don't remember
installing any other except of course if
devotes but i don't remember installing
any apps recently i have like tons of
apps and more annoyingly i have this
notification that keeps popping up and
telling me hey update your app every
second day update your app so let's
let's think about it i have 200 app on
my mobile device i am only using three
of them but still i'm getting those
updates hey update this app and update
this app and this is a creature of
Mumbai continuing so what is what is the
story here to fix this we need to take a
look at this chart one more time and
probably adding more capabilities to the
mobile mobile web app will make it more
appealing for users
use it we've done a lot of research not
us only but many companies many big
players in the market they have done a
lot of researchers to show off what are
the capabilities that we can do here
that's why Google for example came up
with yet another acronym called pwa pwa
stands for progressive web app it's an
approach where if you build a pw a app
you are moving toward better app that
will be more reusable which means that
having web workers in your app offline
support push support and so on now now
that i listened to the list that you
just ate the Bush notifications and
stuff I at least noticed that I'm doing
this on a daily basis with the framework
and I guess most of you have to do some
of these things every single day exactly
pwe or progressive web app is actually
just a hype word it's not a standard or
anything maybe it will be standard or
maybe not we don't know but it's just a
way of listing capabilities that if you
are following them then you will have a
progressive web app that hopefully will
be more engaging with your users so
let's take a look on how to build a
progressive web app but before starting
how about we take a look first about the
current state of an application for
example can we build a Java app for
example right now and see how it look
like okay finally something for me to do
I've been waiting for this so I'm just
going to go here and open up my Eclipse
switch screen switch the screen oh maybe
yeah the font is really small can you
see it definitely not maybe I need to
switch for home i displace a show or
increase the font sizing ah demo effect
references
font it's a stage you increase this yeah
I think it should be big enough nothing
no no no that was wrestling I think the
idea is is clear so maybe you can keep
going yeah maybe it's close enough so uh
I have here a spring boot application or
actually a spring boot back end that is
using this thing called work out this is
my basic bojo it contains information of
my sports activities like how long did
it take how many calories did I burn
what kind of sport i was doing and when
did i do it so this is a basic just I'm
just going to make your a basic data
view of the things that I have in my
back end and because I'm not just long I
cannot actually go and talk at the same
time so I'm going to need you to do
something for me okay so probably you're
now defining a new UI for your
application so I can see this
application is already running how it
look like right now right now it looks
like a white label error page okay so
it's not working it's it's like showing
an error page because there is no UI so
that's why probably he decided to start
to create you I it's calling it sport
sports tracker you I cracker and I need
a data grid to display the data yeah and
I'm going to need some data in there
so be knighting container to wrap the
data from the back end and push it into
the grid and then set size for prolly to
make it occupy the whole screen and
finally make it the root content of our
application and then some spring magic
to actually get the repository alright
so injecting the repository inside your
application and populate it inside the
grid as well and are you ready I think
so i'm just going to restore the
applications as to make sure that
everything is updated ok spring boot
starting up and I should have here whoa
that was quick actually they'd agreed
alright that looks nice it was quick but
yeah do I have to use spring now you can
use CDI you can use whatever java
libraries you'd like you can if you have
figured out something awesome that we
are not yet using an hour demos at
button you can always tell us today
here's this awesome thing please show me
how to use it ok but the interesting
part here is that we want to know how
much compatible this app with
progressive web apps so there is this
lighthouse extension demos that we have
here that you have been bugging me for
two days yes for the demo I think and
this extension actually is available for
chrome and it's my google it somehow
kind of tell you or generate a report
for you to show you how much your app is
compatible with a progressive web apps
yeah but you were actually talking
something about offline support should
we try to see how this application works
in offline mode maybe yeah we can try
that first ok I'm just going to kick up
here go to the network tab and click on
offline do you think it's going to work
offline mm well a server connection lost
just connect reload the page oh yeah my
favorite game ok ok stuff like let's not
play now let's just go back
the report generator so please go back
online okay just get about go back
online and let's reload let's try this
lighthouse so a lighthouse is somehow
generates a report for us to see how
much the app is compatible okay we are
back online and hopefully there is no
inspector running anymore so just doing
some tests making sure that it's it
looks nice on mobile and it works
offline apparently not so what what is
the score what's our score dad oh no
yeah 22 is it a demo effect I think not
because I think that we haven't included
these features in free meerkats oh ok so
look like that report here is telling us
about why our app is not pwa compatible
there are a lot of things to fix so
let's first take a look at what is
actually pwe what are the exact
guidelines to build a progressive web
app so can we go back to the
presentation sure we can get back to the
presentation there you go I actually
summarized the building blocks for
progressive web app into three important
points the first point is real
reliability so reliability means that
your app works offline so even though
tamo was very happy to see the little
dinosaur because probably he doesn't see
it enough in his office but we need to
think about our users who are going to
be really annoyed to see this little
dinosaur when they are using our apps so
we don't want to show this at all we
need to give a response a feedback at
some point we want to also make sure
that the app is fast enough which means
that the initial response time of the
appt even just the initial skeleton of
the UI need to be retrieved as quick as
possible again studies show that forty
percent of users would
up using the app once it'd take more
than three seconds to load so this is an
important metrics that you need to take
into consideration also the third metric
is engaging engaging in an is a little
bit open term here and i would say it
contains a lot of thing how to make your
appt engaging enough but i summarized
the three most important stuff here
which is making it immersive and
immersive here means that the app
shouldn't run inside a browser the user
doesn't want to see the address bar and
the menu and so on you just want to see
the app full screen the theme we need to
also make sure that it look like a
native if it's not native already and
the orientation so changing the
orientation of the device should reflect
to the app as well for the home screen
it's a future that is starting to be
available in most of a browser right now
where you can actually have an icon of
the app on the home screen from where
you can launch the app probably similar
to the old school bookmark that is used
to be in iphone devices but here we are
talking about something a little bit
more advanced you click on the app it
opens in a full screen with a splash
screen it works natively we're going to
see this a little bit later
notifications notifications push support
it means and probably we had push in
many mobile apps since a long while
right now but what I'm talking about
here is push through web workers so you
don't actually have an app installed on
your device I didn't go to market place
to install an app I'm going to have push
through web workers without actually
installing anything on the device so
those are probably the most three
important summarization for making your
app engaging and you can see for example
here believe it or not but I got lost on
vacation without installing air berlin
on my device and on the other side here
united airlines notifications coming
from google and it's again without
installing
anything on my device so a pure mobile
experience without any app yet I'm
getting notification about important
updates so what do you think Tim oh do
you think we can start implementing
those things inside our java application
to make it more pois friendly I think
that if I take a look at some examples
again sort of borrow bits and pieces
here and there and actually make a few
hacks to get the pieces in place and
actually get it up and running in a
progressive web app friendly way all
right let's see luckily there are a lot
of open source examples on how to get
started with progressive web app to
create a template out of it so do have
something yeah I actually did some
homework beforehand and I actually have
one already installed and up and running
so just going to go back to tech chrome
over here switch screen yeah switch
screen so people can actually see what
I'm doing why are you not taking the
full space ok so in here I have a server
running in port 3000 called non Java
progressive web app example so actually
this is a template retrieved from an
open source project called generator pwa
and it generates the basic stuff you
need for creating a progressive web app
enabled up but hey let's test it let's
see how much it's competitive game so
this should give us a sort of guideline
on what we are trying to achieve what
kind of score we need and oh really so
it's 79 even though the square is not
really high but it's still on the green
side and if you scroll a little bit down
we can notice that the problem right now
is actually the HTTPS side because I'm
running on my local device right now and
I'm not installing the app on an HTTPS
server one of the aspects of having
projects involve app is actually having
it's secure so that's only that the only
reason why the score is a little bit
lower than expected but other than that
it looks like we are having all the
things
green so please impress us show us how
we can have that in our java application
okay so i would assume that this since
this is basically it's just an HTML file
and some JavaScript that I can find some
things in the source code okay so
copying from the source code copying
from the source code at least I can
immediately tell that there's a viewport
included here that is basically setting
up some settings for mobile devices so
that they actually scale the page
correctly ok so I'm going to add these
two to choose my do I over here I happen
to know that we have this thing called
viewport annotation it takes a string
fixed import and that would be one step
but i'm pretty sure that this is not
enough so you have been talking a lot
about the service workers so we could
try to take a look at those how those
are actually done okay look like it's
included down there yeah I'm pretty sure
that it's this app tjs that is providing
the service worker yet it's already
talked you'll adjust worker so this code
is something that I i'm going to
directly borrow from them yeah not steal
but this one is basically the code
responsible about registering a
serviceworker inside the application so
up to jas into the static folder copy
files i'm pretty sure i need to modify
something's here at least i'm not going
to build here the hierarchy so it's
going to have them in the same folder
and I'm going to need the service for
service worker that JS file LS well so
I'm just going to copy that as well okay
and I can tell you that some of these
things students make any sense to you
avoiding application so it's just going
to sew those are lame a files and
they are not relevant to us right now
yeah i'm just going to comment that one
out because i have feeling that we might
need it a bit later so that would be the
sir
worker and then I need to somehow
include it into the page and this is not
something that I can actually do like
out of the box into the bootstrap page
so I'm going to need to do a little ugly
hack here but while I'm once again doing
some coding you can entertain our
customers here well I'm not really good
at entertaining but maybe I can explain
what he's doing right now so basically
because he decided to use what an
application for obvious reasons so he
there is a default servlet provided by a
violent application and he's trying now
to modify the default servlet the idea
is we want to serve some static files
along with the default servlet that is
provided by the Varden application so
what he is doing right now is overriding
the servlet initialized method and then
he's going to try to inject some extra
hitters inside the application those
hitters is basically to serve at least
for now the JavaScript service worker so
bootstrap listener to modify the
bootstrap of the Varden application and
then modify the bootstrap by I'm just
going to put script into the header I
don't know it's not the place where it
was in the example but I think that it's
going to be close enough let's see and
I'm going to need a piece of string from
the index over there
and I think I need to escape those
quotation marks and remove the folder
structure semicolon at the end and I am
done so basically he modified the
bootstrap of the application to include
this extra step and this extra script
will register the service worker so
hopefully we now will have a service
worker in our application do we so at
least right now when I'm looking at the
bootstrap edge it actually contains the
JavaScript port and there's the view
port port so instead I think we should
test it yeah so let's see how much
progress table managed to do so
lighthouse again for testing the
application let's see the report so yeah
I didn't Jade I'm sure sadly okay look
like a offline also is now supported all
right so 46 that's not bad it's like
looked like a work in progress maybe we
can do something about that what else is
missing in this report yeah the https of
course because i don't have it running
on https let's let's not fix that at the
moment let's look at the other problem
okay so this is talking about a manifest
file so what what is it basically the
manifest file is another files that you
should include in your progressive web
app that provide information about how
the icon that should be used how the
splash screen should be should be
defined the theme the background color
and many other definitions so having
this manifest file is also another
aspect of building a progressive about
and having this manifest file is also
the piece of code that will allow you to
have this add to home screen
functionality to your app so can you
please add it as well so yeah I found
this link rel equals manifest in the non
Java example so I'm just going to
since I already have the structure here
it's going to be really easy just add
yet another line to the header sounds
like easy happened and that one over
there and some escapes and we should
have well of course then we need the
manifest a JSON somewhere so I guess
that we will find it over here manifesta
JSON we can actually take a look at the
content of the manifest file to see
exactly what I'm talking about it's a
JSON file that define the icons the
theme color and so on oh but probably we
don't have all those icons yet in our
static folder so what what can we do
about it let's see if I can get a bigger
on this screen so yeah it contains all
all kinds of irrelevant information I
think we need to modify this a bit we're
going to I think we don't have those
icons yet now adding those icons is also
important for our application okay I'm
just going to simplify it and just copy
one of the icons okay for the sake of
this demo since we are testing on Chrome
only maybe we can keep the chrome icon
for now but of course if you want to
reach multiple browsers and multiple
users then keep the old icons and
probably also keep multiple icon sizes
that's a good practice but for now let's
just copy this piece of icon for now the
chrome icon and have it in our static
folder to be able to serve it as
progress a web app so ready now I think
I have no all the pieces in there right
i would say that we could also cash the
image just incredible idea and we should
be done let's restart and retry I wonder
what's what's up with my eclipse it's
using weird colors but I
so in here again system each priority
restart let's generate the report is
fine okay so now we should have one more
piece of the puzzle in place so while
generating the report we can notice that
it actually started to work offline no
more dinosaur let's hope for a better
results this time let's see what that is
76 out of 100 actually yes that's a good
number what else are we missing do we
miss maybe the shortcut name https know
everything else seems to be fine so I
guess that my application is loading a
bit slow because there is a vaudeville
in application there's this client side
piece which is a bit bigger I could
optimize it to be smaller in size or I
could try to make the service worker
actually cash it also named file from
the local local cash instead of
downloading it again so probably because
we also in a development mode our
application is not that fast right now
stell job application and uncompressed
but at least we have now a good green
score obviously we can still work on
this we can add push support we can add
more pieces to make the application work
talking about push maybe it's not so
easy yeah so switching to the
presentation so talking about push and
all these home screen stuff let's let's
actually see how this look like so if
you don't have access to the
applications atomo belt right now
probably you have access to the
Washington Post if you open it right now
inside your handheld device you will
after some time of usage you will find
this little notification down there
telling you add to homescreen if you
click on it then you will get a
notification that the app has been added
to your home screen and then if you go
to your home screen you will find this
little nice icon telling you that you
now have an app in your home screen we
didn't go to app store
we didn't go to Google Play we didn't go
to any kind of marketplace we install an
app just by visiting it from the Chrome
browser or any modern browser now to the
next interesting part when i click
actually on this app what will happen is
you will see a splash screen showing
that the app is getting loaded and then
when the app is loaded you will notice
immediately that it's not running inside
the browser anymore it's occupying the
full screen and it has almost native
experience so this is the idea now we
have something similar to what we used
to have few years ago when desktop
applications we're moving to web and to
cloud we have now mobile applications
that we realized that it's not really
the best idea to make application that
need to be updated more and more and now
we can have them actually almost with
offline support and almost looking
native and that's not everything
actually if you go down there and click
on that task switcher you will notice
that the app is actually out there as a
standalone app so this is something that
has been working progress since a while
many vendors started to adopt it as you
can see Washington Post and air berlin
and many other web sites maybe
Aliexpress as well she heard about it so
all of those kind of websites are now
supporting this and more websites are
starting to move toward this more and
more instead of installing an app from
the market place you can now have the
app that you want on your home screen no
longer updates no longer worrying about
notifications no longer worrying about
having up out of the date application
and so on so what Tim we did right now
was basically the lighthouse test it's
just some kind of testing to know how
much your application is actually
compatible with a progressive web app
but I have one more experience for you a
practical test how to practically test
your application is progressive web app
or is good for mobile users I summarize
those into three steps the first step is
mobile first design what does that mean
basically when we build our components
at violent or when you build your next
web application put in mind that you are
testing on mobile first and that's it
which means that when you are building
something first of all make sure that it
works on a mobile device when it's
working fully on your mobile device and
everything is good here then you can go
to the next step and see if it's
compatible with desktop so this is a
little bit different than how we use to
build apps nowadays when we are building
it for this stopped because this is the
most available object right now and then
after that we try to optimize it and cut
pieces and make it shrink and make it
look nicer on mobile devices let's
switch the strategy and this strategy
has been adopted by big players again by
actually having the app work on mobile
device first the neck the next test
strategy is called offline first design
offline first design is similar to the
mobile first design in which you
actually test and assume that your
application is going to work fully
offline so imagine that your next web
application is going to be used as a
desktop application fully offline your
user will reach your application for the
first time ever and that's it probably
next updates and next iterations will
happen on the background using web
workers so adopting this thinking of
having offline first will give you a
better user experience actually I
installed the Twitter progressive web
app on my phone like two days ago and
they're offline because I'm abroad and
my roaming doesn't actually work so I
heat the offline page every now and then
when the wife is going down and actually
they are showing me a page that is
telling me that I don't have
connection to the internet right now and
I can try again later well even that is
offline first yeah absolutely so a
Twitter application of course relies on
being online all the time it doesn't
make sense to have twitter offline right
so having at least a response to the
user telling him that this application
can't do or perform this specific
functionality right now is way better
than a dinosaur the third test or
practical test that i have for you is
actually a coffee first design this is
actually a name that i came up with it's
called the coffee first design where you
give your sister a mobile device running
your app and a cup of coffee and see if
your user will be able to use all the
functionality of your application
without dropping the cup of coffee so
basically maybe you can call it the vamp
first device of vamp first design where
you make sure that everything in your
application is accessible within a vamp
holding the device if the user has to go
with the second finger and make suming
and click and zoom out and so on then
you have some problems in your user
experience most of the users just want
one bump to be able to navigate
everywhere so probably add those
practical tests in your head when you
are developing your next application it
will eventually increase your engagement
and user experience so that was all
about the progress of web app another
standard that we know about is the web
components actually how many of you hear
about web components of course everyone
hear about web components right so I
don't need to go over the definition of
what web components because I feel that
it becomes standard when I was here last
year I was like still defend defining
what is web component but i think i
think everyone now realized that it's
just a standard now browser
manufacturers started to adopt this and
we are starting to see more support and
more
more progress toward that and we had
well and also started to think that
having web components in a java
application on in whatever other
application you are using is important
that's why we also in our research lab
started to create web elements so what
is the idea we've been in the market for
almost 16 years now and our components
have gained a lot of attention from most
of the developers they really love our
components but they are not really web
components that's why we decided to
extract them from the Java framework and
make them available as a separate web
component if you go to our website
you'll find those show highlighted
component they are mature and ready to
use others are still in the lab you are
not listed yet and we made them
available for polymer users angular
users react users and pretty much any
JavaScript user so the idea here is that
we are making our components we are
abstracting ourselves from just making
out components for Java developers only
and we're making them available for
pretty much any user over here so I'm
going to use it getting them out of the
java and but actually all i see there is
just JavaScript everything is JavaScript
so where's to Java we have to talk about
Java and JavaScript we got your back
actually so now as other people are
complaining we want those web components
inside our application again in our
research lab we started to experiment
with some add-ons like this so this is a
screenshot taken from my our add-on
directory it's called elements add-on
and it allows you to have a web
component inside your java application
so if you want to have this cool web
components that you found out there in
the web and you want to start using it
but still with java this atom will be
your guide we also working in progress
with that we have some colleagues who
are starting to experiment this so the
took the elements are done and
implemented something
similar ways for example date picker
it's our polymer based picker and
started to make it available as a
separate add-on actually today morning I
was reading our blog and I noticed that
my colleague alejandro also started to
do the same with the combo box so it's
now available for you as a Java
developer okay I feel that there's a
catch somewhere in this actually who is
going to be making this who is going to
be updating this ah let's see you are
working in a framework team right yeah
then it's you all right so basically
this is the result of intensive research
and work we have been open to the
community about our research and our
probe yourself in this progress in this
so we have a lot of open source
libraries and tools available on github
that shows what we are building so for
example angular 2 polymer that allows
you to use pretty much any polymer
component inside an angular application
we have also implemented this GWT API
generator that allows you to generate
java api for pretty much any polymer
element we've also this GWT elements
polymer elements basically it's a
successor of the previous library where
we generated elements for pretty much
all the polymer components available out
there to make it accessible for java
users and and to a response in the
community we have the Korea I mean who
shared with us this nice application you
can go and check it out it's fully
written in Java yet it's progressive web
app it's based on the official google
template for creating a progressive web
app with polymer so if you happen to use
polymer CLI and create a progressive web
app using later template you can now
generate it as well with java so what is
the state right now what is the future
how the future will look like I think
it's now clear that we can see the
future is going to be a mobile web apps
we can learn from our history we can
learn from how native apps on desktop
devices are almost non existing now
except for content producer of course
you don't want to have your IDE on the
web just yet but the same thing is
happening now on mobile devices so it's
moving more and more toward web users
eventually will not be needing to
install their apps and go to market
place and do all those kind of hassle
the apps will be just available in
whenever you visit them for the first
time we have also done a lot of research
in our lab so we've created this nicely
looking application totally in polymer
so this is a progressive web app build
one hundred percent each polymer using
violent elements that I just showed and
also with other polymer elements and if
we open the source code the HTML source
code of this app we can see clearly on
the downward part that is just a set of
web components placed in the browser but
we have built this again rewritten it
totally in angular the theming here look
a little bit different because of
reasons but it's totally the same
application exactly progressive web app
building angular and again if we open
the source code we can see clearly that
it's written with angular and that's not
everything we have rewritten the
application again but now totally in
Java the good news here is all the hacks
that mo has been doing today we have
been experimenting inside our Vaadin
labs and we have been doing a lot of
experiments to see how how far we can go
with this we managed to build a
progressive web app totally in Java
unfortunately this is still internal not
public but I can tell you that once we
feel that it's matching at the market
and it's ready to be released probably
if you're following our blog you'll be
the first to hear about it this is by
the way the HTML source code and you can
see clearly that it's completely
different it's generated of course it's
generated but it's based on web
components so you can see a piece of
code of web components injected in the
browser all the links mentioned today
are available open source in our github
proposed idea if you just google it and
you can see all the demos as well if you
are really interested about this java
demos that i mentioned at the end please
visit us in our booth and we can explore
more about that as i said it just still
an internal internal research that we
are doing it's it's there it's doing a
lot of nice things i would say as a
summary that we are there already we are
going to release this at some point of
the time we have you backed up if you
want to use polymer and you want to
continue on JavaScript for enterprise
developers who still want to use Java
for their application because Java is
consistent and object-oriented and
widely spread then we also got your back
you will be able to use our technology
either ways following the hacks that Tim
you did or with our next product you
would be able to have the latest trend
in technology with our framework now if
this is all cultural transition or maybe
our t-shirt caught your attention and
you would like to have one of them maybe
you can ask me a question now yes go
ahead
java component okay so 30 pts question
for everybody he's asking if I'm using
voting component can I use Java 8 can
you answer well pretty much you can of
our old version or actually the current
stable version version 7 is using java 6
but it is java 8 compatible in the sense
that we have tried to make as much of
the api's java it compatible as possible
and we are not limiting you from using
any java library unless there's some
kind of a conflict between dependencies
and that requires some tinkering but
basically all the features of Java age
should be more or less directly usable
with valid but I hear that you are
releasing valdon 8 yeah and board innate
thing we're building right now is
actually using Java 8 and the new
version of the quit we are doing all
kinds of method references from
functional interfaces slammed us all
over the place so you are going to learn
a lot more about Java 8 in the upcoming
version yeah I think I think the
strategy is Valda nate is that we are
going to drop all support for nuns of a
previous version of Java 8 and involve
insane we are still supporting java 6 or
java 7 if you still want to use those
old version of java yes okay thank you
you have earned a nice renderer other
questions and now from the other gender
female question no don't be shy okay
please go ahead
well I can I can tell you that at least
the demos that I show right now has
polyfill but what exactly we are going
to do is something that I don't have a
concrete answer full I don't I cannot
tell exactly what his answer for that
but I can't tell you that we are just
measuring how much valuable it is to
support all browsers versus support the
vast majority of users but what I can
tell you for sure as a confident answer
is right now as of what and seven we are
supporting till internet explorer eight
and that's something that will not
change at least within the next two
years and the Dame was a team the demon
was a table nice music the team we did
was actually based on 17 so he got a
progressive web app with 17 that can
work on and to explore it isn't that
yeah yeah thank you more questions yeah
I'm sorry I didn't catch all the
questions so
okay so the question here he's asking is
that part of progressive web app is to
have an app shell which is a menu and
sidebar and stuff like that I've seen
that in many templates that are
generating progressive web app but my
humble answer is that no it's not
required maybe it's cool to have but
it's not mandatory as far as I know
maybe there is a change in that but I've
seen a lot of other templates that are
generating progressive web apps and does
not necessarily have that right more
questions we have the framework guy here
so it's a good chance to ask him nice
question as well please go ahead I'm
sorry Apple users what about them all
right so as long as we are waiting Apple
to support this in Safari we are going
to have that as well the good news is
with Safari the latest version of Safari
that has been announced a few weeks ago
it started to show support for polyfill
and stuff like that it's not there yet
not one hundred percent supported yet
but I believe that they eventually will
do that because it's just becoming more
and more viral becoming more and more
standard and important does that answer
your question okay III don't know when
Apple would support that for sure maybe
ask Steve Jobs or something but I really
don't know yeah more questions yes
let's let's I can answer your question
so you are asking like when when do we
when don't we anymore need these ugly
hacks basically and the answer is that I
started working this morning for a pull
request to the volume project that would
enable these more or less automatically
basically we want of course our users to
have all the nice new things that they
want to have and apparently the
progressive web apps is something that
people want to build and actually since
testing it for this week I do understand
why because it's really easy to get it
on your home screen it opens
automatically from there so we have been
discussing this topic a lot on this week
when we are going to bring it to the
framework I hope in the near future we
can maybe even go so far as to provide
it for the 7 version of button I don't
know I'm not giving any promises because
i am not the product manager I'm not the
product earlier I can make these kinds
of promises but at least we need to make
it easier for the users do we spend a
lot of time figuring out all the hacks
that we need to make them real small and
visible changes instead of trying to
like pulling all the extra features and
do all kinds of modifications and do do
oculi hugs we try to make it small and
simple and in in my opinion this should
be a framework feature automatically
available for each and every single user
rehab so I can I put it straight like
that that we showed that it's possible
we showed also that there are a lot of
add-ons available all ready to help you
do that get started but as I said it's
an add-on it's not like built in future
having it as the building future I don't
know when it's hopefully very soon as he
said all right still more questions okay
but in designer so but in designer what
does it produce I but the designer is a
drag-and-drop you I building feature
that we built commercial one at that and
basically it is generating a decorative
HTML format that describes a set of
components that is in a body in UI or
apart portion of avoiding you i maybe
maybe you can visit his quickie he's
making a quickie during lunch break and
yeah break I can I can there's the vc
taught valine to start devoxx just can't
go there and we ask you a question and
you will get a more in depth answer you
can basically the moles basically the
designer is producing a HTML file and a
java corresponding java file more
questions yeah TV support that's a hard
question actually i actually it's
outside of my expertise i I really don't
know I don't know how it works you know
no I have no single idea how it works
sorry if you have some awesome idea on
how we could build but in applications
for televisions please contact us yeah
more questions I yeah
no no how what in actually works so the
question was is Java code compiled into
Trevor script and no that's not how
wedding works the body works in a way
that we have our server side component
implementations and you listen to events
on the server side and when you add
actually one of those event listeners
there's a deemed client implementation
that is going to handle the user input
and know that you are interested in this
kind of an event from this component and
it will send the information to the
server and your application code is
executed on the server and not on the
client so did you have a continuation
question ok let's say that the question
repeating was about Varden and java 9 so
let's say that after seeing the keynote
yesterday and watching how the jigsaw
works and how the model stuff is built I
think that once we get some time to go
through it we are going to make vaadin
into more or less a module for Gemini so
that you could we try we should minimize
the amount of modules that we require
and then provide a body module that is
going to contain all the warning stuff
and maybe even split that into pieces so
that you can leave out subsets of you're
avoiding wedding dependencies does this
answer your question all right I think
we have three more minutes so more
questions yes
so question was we rely a lot of spring
a lot on spring which is not actually
true I happen to use it in the demo and
basically I could have used Hawaii
environment I could have used CD I to do
the component injections I could have
used any java you Joe even I could have
used couchbase to make my back end I can
use whatever I want with pardon it just
happens to be so that spring boot and
spring data repositories are
surprisingly easy to set up I know at
least a couple of users in the baden
user community who use groovy bit Varden
there are some helper libraries I think
and there are some examples available on
the internet basically googling budding
and groovy you're going to get some
example code I guarantee you all right
questions very interesting questions
today actually yeah no more questions
yes finally
in the case of this so the question is
how can button make a application of
line in this case it happened to work
because it was cashing just the right
things more or less by accident so the
offline mode if we are going to
implement that progressive web app
features dividing we are most likely
going to provide a way for you to build
a offline page that is in the same way
as Twitter telling the user that hey you
need to be online to actually use this
button has a built-in feature about
disconnections so if you are online when
you open your application and it's up
and running it will actually notice when
your connection goes offline and
reconnect and you can actually use the
application at least the current view
while the connection is down all right
one last question no or you know okay
that was impressive thank you so much
for attending thank you Tim oh for your
coding skills if you have more questions
or if you want to see more in depth
about this java app thingy please visit
us on our booth it's just in front of
the door on the right side thank you
again for attending and enjoy the
