to ide for ide tooling for javascript
just out of curiosity how many
javascript developers do we have in the
audience ok how many java developers ok
both ok so first before we get going i'm
a little background on me I'm actually
the author co-author on two books ejb3
in action and also the NetBeans
certification guide no I'm not too
heavily biased towards the NetBeans I'm
so depending upon which I de you use as
my contact information i'll have it also
up at the end of the presentation so
feel free to drop me a question if you
have any questions afterwards about the
presentation or the ID support so my
favorite thing to start out with is are
you still coding a notepad I've actually
still run into developers actually still
do JavaScript development and notepad
and so as part of this I always say do
you really what your tools tools are
constantly changing just like languages
and the JavaScript frameworks so you
should check in every so often to see
you know are you know how had the tools
changed is the tool the tools that you
are using keeping up with the current
state of the art you know and also
sometimes by switching between tools you
can actually learn different things so
in this presentation actually I use all
of the ides I will be talking about in
this presentation so I'm familiar with
all of them and I hop between all of
them depending upon which project I'm
trying to would you know the project
that I'm working on what I'm trying to
accomplish so it's very important to
reevaluate in to check in every so often
and check you know whether your tools
are still up to date so because this is
primarily a Java conference I'm going to
focus on the three Java IDs NetBeans
IntelliJ webstorm an eclipse which
probably means that depending upon which
one you are by the end of this
presentation a third to two-thirds of
the audience will probably rating
negative on the presentation depending
upon which one this seems to be a lot of
people most people have already picked
their IDE that they're going to use and
feel quite passionately
that especially if you're coming from
what I was at a conference recently
where they were I think once the
JavaScript developers are either using
them or emacs so that does inspire that
sort of holy war between the two of them
but i'll be talking about each one of
them i'll probably be focusing i
actually will be focusing on webstorm
and IntelliJ a little bit less just
given the market share that that one has
in the fact that the other two we're not
it used as frequently for JavaScript as
intelligent or webstorm these are you
know by far you know there's also other
people use other editors as well you
know Adam sublime text then Emacs it's
all over the board so I'll be focusing
on the Java IDEs and also talking a
little bit about how you can interact
you know bridge that world between Java
and JavaScript so the key JavaScript IDE
features that i look for are you know
first one was powerful editing
autocompletion validation refactoring
you know checking the code and helping
me along as i do development you know
being able to provide intelligence you
know auto completion so they can see
what is there because my background is
primarily in java development debugging
browser and also a client side so
debugging both the sort of that's just a
server-side debugging both the browser
being able to debug what's going on in
the browser from the ID so you can
actually make hot swappable changes so
we can actually make changes in the the
ID and have them take immediate
immediate effect over in the browser
which is very important especially when
you're trying to troubleshoot CSS and
layout problems and then also server
side being able to debug and find out
what's going on the side of that nodejs
application without using you know
console dot output package management
being able to you know honor and pull in
stuff from mpm and Bower and also add
that into the auto completion so that it
can find the stuff that's in there
unit-testing being able in the ID to be
able to kick off individual unit tests
and debug them and find out what's
actually going wrong with them framework
integration react angular the projects
that I've work doesn't have used either
have not actually used angular
used either react or jQuery on projects
so having support for both of those that
you know as intelligent support that can
help me along is important can put in
preprocessor more recently I've had to
delve into jsx and Jade so having an ID
that actually provides some help as I'm
trying to learn those technologies and
also you know checking what I'm doing
and not not putting me back into notepad
where I'm trying to code everything a
notepad then run it and see if it works
framework support and then finally
integrated project code analysis so
being able to tie everything together
give me information about the project
and allowed me to see what's going on
inside the project and basically
integrating all together debugging the
code editing quality metrics etc so I'm
tying everything together so my
philosophy and the IDE ID is not just a
glorified notepad with wizards I know
that's some people's approach oddities
is that it's just you know they're
they're superfluous you can get
everything done in D or E max I've you
an IDE as it should be basically the AI
ni de should be an instructor it should
help you improve your code and i can say
that over time that probably most of the
improvements in my coding skills have
been there as a result of the IDE
telling me no that's not a good way of
doing it right so the compiler will
happily compile whatever I write the IDE
can use you know other tools like lint
or the one for java that will tell you
you know know this is what you've done
yes will compile a little rum that's
probably not what you may have meant it
is not good for long-term you know code
evolution or no you should be using this
new feature of JavaScript or Java 8 or
something like that so I view of you
know very very strongly that the idea is
the instructor that helps you you know
improve your code and move and move
along in your career now in terms of
features support the challenge with this
one is that there is always a plugin so
I was trying to figure out for some of
the different because you know I
primarily do the react stuff over in
IntelliJ generic JavaScript prototyping
Express stuff over in
netbeans you know Kevin can the IDE do
this you know does doesn't that be in
support type script which I don't
typically coated or would not typically
use netbeans for that you know does it
support that so there's always a plugin
for it the caveat is always does the
plug-in work with the most recent
version and does the plug-in work with
the other plugins that you may have so
you know I can tell you the number of
times with it clips in the password
download install the plug and unbroken
something else so that's one of the
that's one of the challenges with this
the i think the objective is to i prefer
to have as much in the IDE that's been
integrated that's been tested and
integrated so I'm not sitting on a
bleeding edge you know running into an
error that it says there's a problem
with some JavaScript code and no it's
actually the JavaScript code is valid
the IDE is confused and can't see
something so that's that's something
that I always you know I'm kind of
concerned about them and then in terms
of framework support react i said no
mainly because it doesn't on the Eclipse
IDE doesn't support the j sx editing
from what I could tell and there's a
plugin for angular support in terms of
JavaScript versions of course everyone
that is most interested in with the
latest deck in the script six but the
Ides do allow you to switch between the
different language support depending
upon the project and the codebase that
you're editing because you're not always
editing the most recent code for
something or the you know the target
users may be using an older browser so
IntelliJ Webster definitely does have
the most extensive set of light of
language support of the Ides that I'm
covering in this talk i should mention
that NetBeans does support the react JX
stuff they have a file template for that
so that's why it's not included there
but they have a specific setting in
IntelliJ that says react jsx which I'm
not quite sure how that's different than
the ecumene script six content that's a
file type eclipse probably has the least
most recent you know until last year
till it came up with the club's neon
they were really only at x tekken the
script 3 which was a javascript from
1999
in terms of mobile development now with
by mobile development I do not mean you
know writing a native application for
for the phone I'm talking about is the
html5 applications that you can write
and deploy to the phones and they look
like native applications so all of the
Ides do support writing and developing
html5 applications that you know get the
nice little start icon and look like a
native application on the phone so they
all do support Cordova IntelliJ /
webstorm support react native
applications that actually gets compiled
down to native I've not actually used
that support in Webster map because i'm
not doing react native applications at
the moment so i can't quite evaluate how
how good it support is but it is there
and they do they do have capabilities
for that but all of the IDS do support
this ability to generate and run native
applications on the phone with netbeans
as we'll see you can actually start out
with an html5 project and then converted
over to a mobile html5 phone application
so you don't you're not picking that up
front of your saying okay I'm only doing
a Cordova application and then you're
stuck with that or I started out with a
you know a mobile web application and
now I want to turn it into a phone
application with netbeans you have the
flexibility to switch between the two of
those approaches cost now I don't think
I mean my opinion on tooling is I have
no trouble paying for licenses for tools
you would not hire a carpenter to come
into your house and he'd have saved
money by using hand saws instead of
circular saws so both NetBeans and
eclipses are free intellij has a
basically subscription model for both
their IntelliJ and Webster mogadon the
differences between us two IDs and which
one for Java developers they do have
separate pricing for individuals with
individuals and students and every so
often they do do sales I think a couple
years ago they had some major sale in
like Christmas Eve or something like
that so if you're paying attention to
your email you get it for like that some
of the ideas for like ten dollars but
anyway so that's that's basically the
cost of the different IDs and you pay
for what you get
in terms of the support features all the
Ides you do have to install the java
script tools so pretty much all then we
have to install nodejs is kind of the
lowest common denominator so you have to
go in there and so that they don't do
anything magical for for you on that so
if you're going to use grunt here and
have to go into the command line and
install grunt in order to use it
netbeans provides nice links and
instructions for this is what you need
to run in order to install those
different features so I like to say with
this presentation if you're getting up
and running with JavaScript projects are
trying to you know try out something new
that NetBeans is probably the easier
route just because it provides a good
you know sort of starting instructions
for that so with that I'm going to jump
through each of the ids and sequence and
then do basically a kind of a comparison
look at some of the different features
between them now there are so many
features between some of these ideas
that I'm not going to sit here going
over you know this one has this key
combination that one doesn't because
it's hard to keep track of all of those
knots perhaps too fine grained so I like
to think of NetBeans just like accuracy
I do have any NetBeans users in the room
okay wow that's okay so NetBeans I like
to think of it as a dark horse when I've
given toxin NetBeans in the past
Neptune's html5 support mostly people in
the audience have not actually known
that you could actually use it for html5
support so it does natively support
html5 projects it supports css3 html5
ECMO script six and has you know
extensive support for syntax hiding
highlighting autocompletion cold
floating a full-fledged bugger the nice
thing with the debugger is that actually
integrates they have a chrome plugin
which will show on a second which allows
you to actually debug from the IDE into
the web browser it's not as powerful as
the debugger in chrome but it does allow
you to do hot swapping so you can change
code in the ID and habit expect in the
web browser without having to redeploy
your project reload the project the page
it also is nice and that it forces the
resources over to the browser if you've
ever been one of those situations where
your changes aren't taking effect and
you think jeez you know that the browser
cache that darn thing on me you're
sitting there you know hitting refresh
refresh in on emptying
restoring it trying to figure out if
your bug is just a cache issue it does
support unit testing grunt support SAS
and less support and also as I mentioned
the Cordova mobile applications so this
is basically a list of all of the
different there's more here constantly
finding more that it supports or
supports incidentally of the frameworks
that actually you know advertisers out
of the box is supporting that there's
actually editor oee support for that so
it does support 11 framework that the
other IDEs in this comparison don't
support which is oracle jet that's an
open source framework from oracle that
actually wraps up several other
frameworks into like a tested package so
i think it has you know it can use
either angular react with handlebars and
a bunch of things but it's it's a
prepackaged javascript library from from
oracle there's other presentations
online if you're more interested in what
that one does but these are the
frameworks that supports out of the box
as i mentioned to to get the debugging
in the web browser you have to install
the chrome plugin for that they when you
go to run a project if you don't have an
unsold or bring into a nice little page
and you click install and then you're
off and running with debugging now the
one thing when you're doing debugging
with netbeans and Chrome's then you
cannot use the chrome debugger right so
if you want to use a chrome bugger then
it disconnects NetBeans netbeans you
know you can always reconnect them back
and forth ihop between the two depending
upon what i'm doing sometimes I'll use
the chrome debugger I'm looking for
performance problems on other times you
know we're just doing simple CSS stuff
and fiddling around with layout stuff
will use it at the NetBeans one one of
the nice things with netbeans is out of
the box it's got extensive support for
different file types so it does have a
JSON editor the support creating react
jsx files does work with jet it does
support different unit testing so it'll
actually you know you can say new new
flight new silk swinging and mocha
testin will actually create a file for
you that's pre-populated you're not
creating a new file that's empty and
then trying to figure out what to put in
it it does have the capability for
generating given an endpoint our
JavaScript code for you know calling a
specific web service so you can say okay
you know I want to generate something
that calls us web service it will
generate the code for you so it's got
you know very extensive and easy you
support and it's not these file types
are available to all the projects in
netbeans so if you're working in HIV
project you can still create a
JavaScript file and get the editing
capabilities of it it doesn't lock you
into one you know you pick this project
type so you don't get these file types
anymore right so it's not not hard
hardwired in that event now when you go
to create a new project in netbeans it's
got a bunch of templates that it
provides as a starting point for you to
actually get up and running of course
you can pick something that has nothing
and then start building your application
from that and I'll actually have a demo
where I go through a couple of these and
create some example apps but it's got
you no html5 JavaScript application a
node.js application which is a
server-side application and it sets up
the initial codon you know things up for
you an html5 jas application with nodejs
which will use you know the Express
framework and Jade as the front end for
the ability to create JavaScript
libraries it also has the capability for
working with existing project structures
so that if you have you know you're
pulling in an existing code base and you
know you was created by a JavaScript
developer or too little or you know as a
part of some other pod you know somebody
created in another ID it's got the
ability to pull in that project and you
can specify where all the resources and
the files are located so it's adaptable
it doesn't say okay you have to have
this file format for me to in order to
to work with the project and then the
last tour is the cordova and the crudo
of application on the html5 application
up at the top you can actually switch
that you know that would be the one that
you'd think if you're doing like a html5
web site or a single page application
and have the capability of turning it
later into the Cordova application just
going to
the property paying for it in addition
one of the nice things that I like with
netbeans they provide a bunch of sample
projects so you go through the ID so say
you're not familiar with you know
angularjs and so you want to see an
example angularjs application what does
the full application look like right so
you can you can click on that and it
will create a start a starting
application for you to start you know
it'll create a fully functional
application which you can then run and
see you know what does an angularjs
application look like you know how does
it how does it work and it's a little
hard when you're reading a book or
trying to learn one of these frameworks
to see the bigger picture how does
somebody actually develop an application
with it so provides a bunch of nice
starting points so years ago when i was
looking at knock out you know trying to
figure out not god i went in here and
created a sample project you know that
the knockout sample project to figure
out how is knockout work right so it
provides a pretty good bootstrap to get
you going and help you explore some of
the different technologies it does have
you know code editing so it does flag
you know common mistakes where you're
using you know equals equals instead of
equal equal so it is doing you know
analysis on the code that you type in to
make suggestions it is configurable in
the IDE so you can open up the options
and configure the different options for
the code analysis it does have auto
completion with with documentation along
with it that shows you you know
basically example codes that pulls in
has extensive online documentation for
you on the same thing is that when
you're using nodejs it'll actually
download the sources for node for you
and then give you access to the sources
so you can actually dive through that
look at the comments there it's got the
debugging with chrome as i mentioned so
as you can see right here i'm actually
stopped on a break point inside of the
ide you know looking at the book at the
state of the data as it is in the chrome
web browser so from that means i can see
what's going on inside inside of chrome
sees you know variables that can set up
watches into all the regular stuff that
you would expect with CSS it does have
does do dome debugging so it allows you
to within the IDE to basically find out
you know you can click on different
elements you know click on things in the
web browser and find out where the code
is for that you know how did that get
generated where is that coming from you
know why is the padding on that so you
can look at the padding for sitting oh
look at the padding look at that look at
what the actual computed CSS etc was
after it rendered the page to see what's
going on it does have css3 editing
capabilities so you have you know if you
don't you can easily don't have to
remember all of the tags in order to do
and this is one of the nice things with
an ID is that it provides all of this so
will you know tell you it'll you know
has pop-ups allowing you to easily find
CSS things and then as you're editing in
the CSS editor here it actually if
you're using the chrome debugging your
CSS takes effect immediately right so
you can start with a blank site go into
the CSS file and immediately begin
editing and having the page you know
repaid will refresh without you even
having to hit refresh on it it's got
support for less and also sass and so
you can see where the generated files
are placed so it takes care of that for
you working on our projects with either
of those two technologies it also has a
customizable palette for doing html5
work so you can actually create and
store elements in the palette which you
can then drag that back out onto the IDE
so if you have like snippets of HTML
code that you're using on different
pages you can actually store them on the
palate and drag them out you can
organize the palette however you want
and it sees it does support mpm Bauer
and
the content delivery networks so it has
a nice editor for each project that
allows you to go in there and we'll see
that you can actually search for
dependencies and have it download and
add them to the project for you so you
don't have to go out there and you know
Google on web find out you know with
what is this you know what's the latest
jQuery ill actually as a dialogue that
will display that for you in a while you
to see that it's got gulp integration so
it actually the tasks will actually show
up under the menu allowing you to invoke
stuff netbeans has been very nice i mean
i'm a java with our aunt support
actually used aunt as the way back when
as the main build system so they've
always kind of used the native build
system they didn't necessarily try to
reinvent the build system for their
project type so it's been the philosophy
that they've taken over time and then
you can customize the menus and specify
which gulp tax tasks you want executed
when you do different actions in the IDE
so when you do the bug project which
gold tests do you want to do you want to
run in terms of no Jas integration it's
got fully full integration for nodejs as
i mentioned i can find modules it's got
its integrated with the express
generators will see so it makes it easy
for creating these sites and then for
it's easy as i mentioned to take project
and convert it over to a Cordova
application i'm doing with cordova is
that you can actually even debug stuff
that's running on the phone so you can
have the phone tended to the computer
and you can be debugging your JavaScript
application that's running on your
iPhone and the IDE so it does both it
does for Cordova it does android and iOS
I'm allowing you to debug and deploy to
both of them so this is the demo and
then after the demo will happen to
looking at eclipse and feel free to
interrupt negative if anyone has any
questions we go along
so I have my beans idea here you go and
going through the project wizard there
is no it's not necessary you don't have
to install any additional plugins
there's only one version although they
have several different downloads on a
NetBeans page you can pick the download
all or any one of them and then you can
activate the features later you're not
locked into a particular thing so the
features are always there so if i click
soon rjs application click next create a
package that Jason will actually pre
create several different files for us a
bower json grunt files etc click finish
you can see the JavaScript online auto
completion
and we ran it so the node.js application
around we can set a breakpoint
it's going to start up connect and we're
now debugging a node.js application so
it's fairly easy now that's of course it
always looks easy in the demo at the
conference when you get into more
complicate complicated projects that
does work let me hop back to projects
over here we'll create a new project
something a little more meaty html5 j/s
application with nodejs it's going to
take us through this this was you're
here so do to enable express support add
less support and turn that on by default
click next we'll use a package.json once
again and it's going to create the
project now the thing is going to
highlight over in red here saying that
we've got a problem with their project
so i can say resolve project problems is
going to say i'm missing several nodes
dependencies for this project so i click
on next unresolved and it's going to go
out and run the MPN codes to pull them
down for me so it's going to run the NPM
installs to pull down what I what I
needed hopefully it runs quickly case
okay and so we've got a demo project
that's using nodejs with Jade and it's
got a you know basically some sample
things out some sample code and so this
is all set up for us we didn't have to
go out and figure out okay how do we lay
out this project you know what are the
MPN so you decided that you want to use
node you want to want to use jade how'd
you know what dependencies do you need
how do you pull it together and then one
more than multiplication to the html5
application
so with the html5 application very often
you're not starting from a blank slate
you're going to use you know one of the
you know an angular see the boil up
html5 boilerplate and so as I mentioned
before I like to use netbeans is kind of
like a learning tool you know how do you
use html5 boilerplate right so you can
actually select them here you know you
want to use html5 boilerplate on line
one
downloading it behind the scenes oh and
what a little do is on a little creative
project that's using html5 boilerplate
with everything set up for me yeah
Cheryl how to create all the files and
so as you can see you've got your you
know browser config across domain that
XML file as also you know there's an
initial cross domain that XML file so
you've got a bunch of things all set up
for you allowing you to get up up and
actually running because you know most
most of the time you're starting from as
you can see the project comes in as
html5 boilerplate comes in with
moderniser framework all set up so it's
got a bunch of things that you know if
you're building up you're not going to
start from a blank page and then build
your app build your application from
that you're gonna have a starting point
that's what that's what that's what it
helps you do and helps you get off the
ground and running especially if you're
primarily a Java developer
so with that I'm going to move into
eclipse and eclipse neon so prior to its
been a long time since I've actually
used eclipse prior to neon which came
out last year eclipse was basically
stuck at javascript from 1999 for the
most part sony on mark marked a major
evolution in terms of eclipses
JavaScript support finally so they
finally do support echamos script 6 now
the word plugins that allowed to use a
coma script 6 which I'll touch on
briefly during the presentation it uses
Nash horn for the code execution it has
support for nodejs mpm bauer gulp grunt
chromium debugging they introduced the
JSON editor and also a separate district
ide distribution for javascript but it
also has a Paget cordova support so you
can create Apache Cordova projects now
it's a good step jay jay SBT 2.0 which
is the javascript the website of eclipse
is a good step forward but there's still
some performance slowness with it which
if you watch the Eclipse presentations
are talking about they were working on
they're going to use a Google closure
project are going to be enhancing it
going forward and also had limited
front-end debugging and hot swapping
code capabilities just to name a few
things and to be honest with you I had a
lot of trouble actually getting projects
up and running on this laptop I was
never ever never able to get code
completion to work I don't know why I've
seen videos where it is working why I
can't get it to work when I downloaded
it to my new laptop i am not exactly
sure but i can tell you i spent probably
around four hours googling and
troubleshooting that thinking I got to
get this working for the demo why
doesn't this work so so anyway so with
ESX 6 you've got two different options
you can go with you can use neon the
most recent or you can install basically
the turn Eclipse IDE which is available
through the marketplace is basically a
plug-in or it is a plugin for Eclipse
which gives you
echemus script six support and code
editing now so I'll go we're both of
those and show you both of those so for
now when you install eclipse if you
download the most recent version you
have the the JavaScript 66 support comes
with the Java EE developers and also
they have created this new JavaScript
for web developers installer so when you
go to install it now you get you can
pick one of those two you get you get
the JavaScript support with both of
those the one down here just as missing
all the EE stuff so if you haven't like
some of the people i know i haven't
updated you know clips in the last five
years it's quite a few changes now when
you go in to create a project unlike the
NetBeans or IntelliJ your you have a
limited set of choices for creating new
projects so you have basically the
JavaScript project wizard you can also
create a static web project or if you
have to each other east of a web project
do that and then afterwards as we'll see
so the javascript javascript project is
basically your starting point and then
you go in there and afterwards to add
the MPN support so although this is
Bauer in an MPN in it you think would be
or might assume that it's a grating of
NPM based project that's not actually
the case you want actually be able to
get through that wizard until you create
a JavaScript project so in order to use
bow or mpm you first create the
JavaScript project and then you run the
bower in it or the npm in it from the
menu that we just saw and so it takes
you step through so on the MPN one you
punch in the you select your progeny
your project in your workspace that you
want to add npm support to and then it
takes you through the rest of the wizard
for setting up the initial mpm file so a
little for me up a little
counterintuitive for getting the NPM
support in there and then after you
create it they've got as a part of it as
a part of Eclipse neon they now have a
JSON file editor which gives you you
know gives you some help and
intellisense with the file fights code
editing and checking capabilities
cetera so it's one of the other new
features with Whitney on and then you
know once you have your file you can
then install they have a right you can
right click on your package file and run
NPM or on your projects and say MPM
install or MDM update etc same thing
with running you can click on javascript
file and say run this javascript file as
a node.js application and you can also
debug it so you can actually do both of
them they added grunt support and so as
expected once you create your grunt file
for your project so it doesn't
automatically create a grunt file for
you so you have to go in there and add
the grunt file to it and then it shows
up with a little icon I then you can
click on it and then run your grunt
tasks alright so its up its up to you to
actually create those files now backing
up there's also the the turn Eclipse IDE
which is what is used by jboss tools my
Eclipse life raise and studios etc you
can read more about it up on on this
link to learn more about it turn is
based upon turn j s and so turns out J
yet so it's so turns out java's based
upon turn J Esther no Jas is a
standalone code analysis engine for
JavaScript it's used by other editors in
addition to this turn Eclipse IDE so
it's what's being used by Emacs vim
sublime text ex-mate etc so it's being
it's providing infrastructure the
JavaScript support for the other IDEs as
well so it's gonna with that so to to
create it you go into the hard to read
you go into the ID you go into the
update Center select the turn ide and
plugins and then after you what you do
is after you download install you create
a JavaScript project and then you
convert your JavaScript projects to a
term project so you go into the menu you
right-click and say turn into a term
project and then after you get that it
will actually take you through a wizard
and prompt you for which framework you
want to add support for so if you notice
I didn't talk about Jake you know
explicit jQuery
Porter handlebar support in the IDE with
with turn it you know then pulls in and
gives you additional documentation and
help with it the other thing you have to
do is actually set it up initially its
set to echamos crypt five so you then
have to switch it over to echamos crypt
six for your project if you were going
back in the script six and then you get
the the code sense this is the only way
that was actually able on this laptop to
get the autocomplete to work was by
installing turn I'm not exactly sure why
I also was turning at the embedded web
server to work which I wasn't able to as
getting errors on that so as I mentioned
autocomplete doesn't work it's got much
limited functionalities compared to
NetBeans it's not as well integrated as
limited source code analysis especially
compared to the IntelliJ and limited
information online and documentation so
most of the stuff that you'll find on
Eclipse right now we're using it is for
the previous version of Eclipse not the
most recent version so it makes kind of
finding things kind of hard now IntelliJ
IntelliJ / webstorm this is basically
the gold standard for html5 web
development so with with webstorm
webstorm is focused exclusively on
JavaScript whereas IntelliJ is kind of
everything so if you're going to use
IntelliJ you actually need the ultimate
edition if you want to do the JavaScript
development the community edition will
not give you those features so it'll be
kind of limited in that regards so only
so with the ultimate edition you get
support for JavaScript typescript CSS
less a stylist coffeescript it's amazing
the number of things that they support
out-of-the-box a nice thing is that with
it you get you can have these hybrid
projects so you can have you can have a
project where you're building using
Gradle and the web artifacts are using
nodejs underneath the side of it and
you'll get all the features you know
you'll have the the JavaScript to be
able to j sx files you'll be able to
pick up great old has to be able to kick
out your node tasks so that's one of the
nice things with the IntelliJ ultimate
support is that you have you know you
kind of you if you're working in both
the job and the web projects are both
job and the web world where you know the
you know the the Java code is going to
the back end and
the front-end code as all via the newer
web stuff it integrates fully integrated
and gives you full code editing
capabilities in that case so it has
definitely it definitely does have the
best editor I know you know the napping
spoke so excited that you know that
there are shooting for intelligent
trying to beat IntelliJ on the code
editing capabilities but it does have
the best editor it will see some of the
differences I'll show some of the
differences between the editors in terms
of what they're able to support does
support client-server debugging with
chrome does have nice things that those
have built in JavaScript profiling
support as i mentioned hybrid projects
code quality analysis tools it can also
auto generate the SS yes sorry the
JavaScript five code using babbles so
it'll actually prompt to you and say do
you want to do want to generate that it
is an extremely powerful tool this list
doesn't do it justice with all the
features that it has in it now you have
to create a new project it gives you a
wizard so it's got you know more options
than you have with nip I mean you can
create all these same types of projects
with netbeans but it gives you you know
a different a different basically a
different set so you know the html5
project that we saw with netbeans would
be equivalent to the empty project and
then you know the different projects
down below now the thing I would say is
that IntelliJ 6th reem Lee powerful you
have to somewhat need to be familiar
with the frameworks before you you use
them here so it has a little bit less
guardrails in terms of you know a lot
you know what you can do because you
have a complicated project just like
NetBeans they have the plugin for chrome
so you go to the chrome store you
install the chrome plugin and have both
this plug-in and also the NetBeans
plugin installed at the same time and
work on two different pages right so
it's got built-in support for that it's
got this babble integration so I started
editing a file you know I used some HTML
html5 stuff but it noticed with the code
it says you know if i watch or do you
want it to transcript I
I echamos reply using Babel I say yes it
pops up this little thing saying okay
where do you want me to put the
generated code and it doesn't transpile
and for me built-in no i didn't have to
go through a thing about this is that if
i normally I don't use I don't usually
use this I use web pack with Babel to
generate my generates my code that way
but if you're trying to get up and
running without having to delve into the
end to web pack that's a good way to
start I'll hop over to the editor at
this point project we can start off with
say a react application
in a new window
there we go it's actually going to pull
down some stuff from create the project
called react to lower because of an
empty i'm naming restriction okay well
that was unexpected anyway i'll go with
this project right here as you can see
we could take and do the same type of
thing that we did in the other one we
can run the file to run it over in
safari which is the default web browser
on the computer and also save the bug
and now it's going to launch over in
chrome you've got debugging capabilities
you can see there's an unexpected import
token with a debugger we can actually
set let's see here greg files over you
have the same capabilities over in
netbeans that he can drag files in this
way and as you can see the nice thing
with this was i dragged over this person
jas file and it said well i noticed that
it also imports his other file so it
included that other file as well right
so I said you know this person jaesung
depend sorry it depends upon the other
file so it imported both of them for me
and now we could actually step through
in the debugger and try troubleshooting
this application has the same capability
so you have
we've got lots of stuff and turns on
pull up the project settings we've got
lots of integrated code quality tools
you know Jas lens closure linner yes
length so they've got its Mork and it
provides more sophisticated feedback as
we'll see then the NetBeans IDE and
definitely the Eclipse IDE but you pay a
lot more forum okay so browser
comparison so let's look at some of the
differences between the two code two
browsers so in this case I'm using some
ESX six code where I'm basically just
dynamically defining a method name right
so I've specified the method name up
here now i'm not sure why not some a
feature that I typically would use in
code unless I'm really trying to
obfuscate and drive my co-workers nuts
so if you want to hide methods from
co-workers this is very way no they're
two completely dependent upon the idea
this is a great feature to use right so
you wanna have the secret method give me
five minutes to do it you find it so in
this case IntelliJ flags that says you
know I can't resolve this method now the
hardest thing with JavaScript on my java
code is that it's done typed in this
kind of freeform it's our it's hard for
it to figure out everything so it
doesn't it's like this is unresolved now
you might say over an intelligent
ellijay does ascertain that means it
doesn't flag it as as an issue right so
you might think I'll cheese it figured
this out no it didn't if you click on it
says I don't know where that method is
so it's kind of the caveat between with
the javascript stuff just because it
says that it's okay or says that there's
a problem doesn't actually mean that
there's a problem so in this case right
here it's saying it looks like
everything is fine because there's no
color coding there's nothing over in the
tray on the right that's saying that
there is an issue but it's not actually
actually analyzing the code to find out
it can't actually see this case if
there's a problem intellij flags that as
a problem but there's not
actually a problem because the code is
actually correct right so this is where
you get into some some of the things so
you know nice and with IntelliJ is you
can you know right click and say you
know ignore this warning but you know
you have to kind of be careful with
things like that in terms of the auto
lookup capabilities between the two of
them so now I'm just going to focus on
intelligent netbeans they both have
similar you know in terms of output and
netbeans has many more methods that it
pulls up there seems to pull up
everything including the kitchen sink
IntelliJ tries to appears to try to trim
it down a little bit more but both of
them are usable and give you the options
there and include you know documentation
so you can see in both cases right here
they've you know they found that you
know the height the render methods are
here intellij put some more up at the
top that being started out with
prototype you know it was a little bit
more unordered the next one is sloppy
code currently NetBeans doesn't see any
problem with this code it doesn't say
that there's a problem with the code
IntelliJ which is where the instructor
kind of comes in capabilities where I
said it's flags bar saying that that
should be a let recommends they use a
left it also notices that the console
dot log down here is not reachable and
flags that as a potential problem and
also notice is that the function isn't
being used anywhere which is you know
sometimes intentional sometimes is not
intentional but you know it's nice when
something isn't working you realize that
you're not actually calling it or you
forgot to include the file that's why
it's not getting called and this one
right here we have basically some eight
to some echamos script five code there's
a better way of doing it with XML script
six neither IDE suggests better approach
right so you can remove the function and
this is a simplified version hakama
script six the neither IDE flags that
and says that this is the better
approach for doing it so this one's the
draw and neither ID need to either IDE
one this one on the next one imports
IntelliJ and this import capability also
works with the react jsx files so well
if you start to include to react j/s
component it will automatically add the
import up above like you are used to
with your Java code
can be handy so you don't actually have
to go up there with netbeans you still
have to go up there and add the imports
with IntelliJ we'll just add the auto
it'll do the auto importing for you and
also to clean up for you so in this case
right here and IntelliJ is notice I'm
using this I start using this box clasp
it says wait a minute you're missing the
import for it and you can hit alt enter
and adds import for the for the for the
for the javascript class IntelliJ
doesn't actually flag it as a problem
that you haven't included it but when
you go to try to use a method it says
well it's undefined I know that it's
unboxed jas for the Sun defined in this
file right so it's definitely scanning
the entire project it just hasn't made
to link that as I'm tied it back into
the import logic so I don't know whether
that's intentional and one of the other
framework supports that with netbeans
they have this nice UI that allows you
to go in and edit your mpm file so you
can go in there and say you can search
for jquery and it will pull you up the
list of all the NPM packages with jquery
and you can then select which version
you want of jQuery or of react or of
that so it's got a nice visual editor
that allows you to sort search the NPM
registry for for dependencies so very
often young i'll use IntelliJ for code
editing then I'll go over the NetBeans
and I'm trying to have packages to it
just to do with that just to make my
life easier so I use both ids on the
project at the same time that beans for
launching stuff you've got more
capabilities in terms of you know
watching it on a device so you can
launch a web project on a on the
simulator to see what your web what your
html5 application is going to look like
on a mobile device for instance so to
launch the iOS simulator i'm on a mac or
on android this is a key win for
IntelliJ it's got the capability to
refactor code so i can click on this
person class here and say rename and it
knows where that class is being
instantiated and goes through does the
renaming for me I'm until it NetBeans
more focuses on file renaming so you
rename the file you rename the class it
doesn't it doesn't have refactoring at
that level or knows that you renamed the
javascript class and that you have to
change wherever that javascript class is
being used
so it makes life a little bit harder a
little bit harder to refactor code so in
terms of wrapping up and considerations
you know are you working on existing or
a new project you know where you are you
tinkering are you trying to learn the
new JavaScript technology that drives
which one you're going to use are you
doing hybrid projects where you're doing
something that is java ee your packaging
everything up into an here or a war file
and you know is it using you know do you
have javascript developers using webpack
and sass and less and so forth so that
that kind of drive elks drag your
decision are doing mobile browser
applications so depending upon your
mixture of your answers to these
questions will determine which ID or
both ides that you actually use in the
end some resources there's these are
video links links to the jst GT 20 site
and will compete pages with more
information on what what is new in
Eclipse as I mentioned it is finally
moving forward and they're building it
out and there's the newer features that
are coming in it so they're actively
developing so it's no longer just stuck
so in the past I would I didn't even
look at it clips now they're moving
forward again with development on it
which is a good thing netbeans which is
actually note which has been donated to
which is actually becoming an Apache
project Oracle has donated it to the
Apache organization you can see some of
the links in html5 gurjen the NetBeans
guy has a bunch of excellent blogs he's
always linking tweeting sending out
notices on tutorials and everything like
that so there's tons of research we have
tons of resources on html5 support and
how to do things I'm an intelligible for
it and tons of documentation helps that
so in conclusion IntelliJ webstorm is
the powerhouse JavaScript ite it
definitely has great great features I
know when I've talked more in front of a
JavaScript audience most people are not
aware of NetBeans as much it is the Dark
Horse Oracle has made a significant
investment over the last six plus years
in his JavaScript support and so it has
come a long way they've really focused a
lot of
effort on the JavaScript capabilities
and it is getting better it is the the
editor for work of the idea choice for
Oracle jet and being heavily promoted in
that direction so it's been a really
heavy investment in that so netbeans and
IntelliJ or my two choice are the two
choices I hopped between both of them
depending upon the project that I'm
working on so and that's if anyone thank
you and if anyone has any questions okay
