live stream feature around up i'm joined
by Manny stocker and fellow itself hello
and you might know Simon from the be jug
and also from zero turn around / r /
labs and many is a new recruit for co
durance and a trainee software craftsman
having a premiership print friend
Francis that's right that's like that's
like the posh type of coding where you
just look down on on normal coders right
yeah I don't know if it's called that
but it's it's you are one of them
initially and then you learn how to
become the posh in your words it's not
it's not the right it's not exactly and
it's funny you're doing about being an
apprentice I'm gonna hit 10 you asleep
two star wars which leads me to this
morning's keynote where we were enjoyed
by Professor Lawrence Krauss you led us
to our the history of the universe 13.8
billion years or so in a contrast you
mark Reinhold you led us through 20
years of Java yeah my taking from this
morning worse java nine looks great
that's for interesting points there and
it doesn't mean anything because in the
avast infinite basis of space and time
and all this is meaningless it's all
insignificant I think any words
everything's in significant the
conference this interview the Mars will
just go home I guess okay but what is it
tour do know is that how you feel
something well not really but might as
well might as well make use of the rest
of the three wonderful lace dress was
able to you have these depressing
findings as a result of technology first
about yourself you know these things you
don't just have a hadron collider belt
of Lego that's right i mean if you see
the amount of work that's been put in
that and if he's comparing that to the
20 years of work in java then he has he
has some standing there i don't know
what do you think about that Simon well
i mean i think it just puts everything
in perspective really about what we're
doing
and and some of the things which may in
our roles and in the Java language may
seem critical importance you know there
are I guess I guess more important
things that we could be we could be
working on actually maybe we should just
last like I say go to note it's the
future okay no Jo the JavaScript guy
here Red Hat right best in their days
foundation you're very interesting bacon
to other one last week one of the big
announcements that new JavaScript
framework that they're working on I
think it's jet yeah okay gori announced
that already yeah it is well they
announced it but it's not been really
hugely hyped because I think we knew
about that a few months ago when we all
met I don't know if allowed to talk
about that here but it's not rumbling
from the first yes I didn't know there
was going to be a JavaScript node.js
like to Linda in the making but now we
can put the chicks up pieces together to
start playing on that yeah well i'm not
a huge javascript fan although i like to
have asked if not quite sure i'm now
going to spend my time to learn this new
JavaScript frameworks interesting of it
it's very interesting that we all the
big players are also investing in it I
mean you have oracle you have IBM you
know with with bluemix for example or
all pushing and adding their support
it's it's clearly it's clearly being
seen as something substantial like that
you know could potentially rival java in
the future so i guess it's the next
people keep talking about it or even
like John champions list as well to put
placing node as the potential rival for
java don't fall okay the thing about
notice that you don't have to have
either or do you there specific uses for
them the different places and the eco
system and it kind of its great but I
guess it's a logical leap for java
developers to start thinking up to add
to their arsenal and languages and
having this kind of cohesion in the
community behind it is going to be great
for people like you become its
conferences like Derek start talking
about more at things like node you can
kind of it's easier to learn things at
modern community space and having to go
from place to place but having said that
what's the coverage of JavaScript at
devoxx 2015 anybody knows is are they a
lot of talks on JavaScript or no GS I
think I heard something there was one
talk on golf GS and then there's
probably what yet another one on another
another Java JavaScript related topic
but there hasn't been a lot of that so
in terms of talks that take 10 works
2015 what are you looking forward to
what would be your top ticks and you
might be chained to the boot but if you
go to anything what would you like to
learn about actually have the yeah you
had a Java about home luckily I prepared
for this oh you know rookies here you
see so I mean yeah there's a bunch of
sessions I'm just a couple of a couple
of the sessions which I think are
actually really really relevant and
really really useful rather than go into
the big one hour sessions I always think
they like the ignite sessions and the
cookies are really really valuable
here's a one-hour ignite session you
will see like you know whatever it is I
don't do my maths in front of everyone
but I'll say 12 5 minute sessions yeah
on tightly different topics sometimes
technical sometimes not technical and
it's not like you know you can sit there
and your thing oh this is a rubbish
session or anything and waste an hour
you will see loads of concessions and it
keeps you thinking about totally
different things but I think I think
I'll second Simon on that because the
research has shown that our focus is
only about 25 minutes and so you have
this technique called the pomodoro
technique where you find yourself to 27
and if you basically pine box yourself
to even shorter blocks of tough time
frame in which you do a certain activity
it actually seeps into you much better
so those those 5 or 15 or 20-minute
cocks whatever they may be call are
probably more effective than sitting in
like three hours like I was doing
yesterday and it's not effective vote
for the person who's delivering in and
to the person who's attending it because
even though we had a break
we didn't observe as much if we had a
break every 25 minutes for example or we
had short talks like this and I agree
because for me presentations isn't just
about trying to purvey you or provide
information to the to the people who are
attending it's equally about or in fact
for me it's more about getting people
getting the audience excited about about
understanding the concept you're trying
that you're trying to put forward and
you can't you can never educate someone
in one hour on it on a complex topic so
if you can if you can give someone that
information that they can then go away
and learn more about it themselves for
me that's how a conference session is
successful absolutely so I mean even for
me personally I don't know about you but
I don't remember a whole lot of stuff
that's been spoken during the keynote or
even had the two sessions I attend in
the last couple of days and I would
think that if those sessions were broken
on the smaller pieces of 15-minute
sessions for example mmm then I think I
would have got a lot more out of it wait
are you suggesting your conference
microservices yeah I'm Francois gonna
come up with those buzzwords and names I
think I'll leave that to do a few to
come out of it but I think one of the
biggest problems is getting speakers to
that kind of conference because if you
try if you try and say to someone we
want you here for a 15 minute talk yeah
well you paid one thousand two thousand
dollars to get here hotel for 15 minutes
it's gonna be harder for to justify that
con it will help you have a point there
but what they could still do is they
could break down the upper presentations
into 15 minute blocks where each 15
minute block is focused on one thing and
then they transition into the next thing
maybe Archer five minutes break or a
tree minutes break and it's good for
them and it's good for the ones who are
listening but again it's something not
being tried out what about people like
me who only have like five minutes of
useful information and then I just know
if you have another room where you have
that before break Oh perfect yeah
perfect oh maybe breaks but once your
question I think that the the session
that stand out for me Sam Newman's
microservices tour I think Sam's always
a great speaker equally unfortunate it's
clashing book chart Charlie Nutter right
so I think fam newman's on our loops
that you can watch that one yeah yeah
yeahs Bible I would still suggest i know
you some we had a conversation earlier I
would I sit like patrick and i would
suggest this docker talk because it's
not about docker he's talking about all
kinds of tools in
the container ecosystem and he's done an
amazing work in doing that presentation
in what was it 30 min an hour or less
and and he did a short demo as well it
didn't work but he made it work he's a
great speaker yes and he covered the
whole grounds and now you can go home in
and you know pick up the things you want
to want to learn but I mean the other
thing as well whether it's javaone
whether it's dev ox the range of
speakers I mean there's there is there
is an orgy of technical content and
technical speakers on show fear it's
like it's so hard to kind of pick one
you know we looked all those through
sessions were actually crashing in the
same in is just tell me about a job is
saying that all the stream online and
you can yeah watch it the pretty of your
bedroom enjoy it and in the keynote of
course it was mentioned that all
sessions also shenzhen in devops will
now be available on YouTube literally a
couple of hours after their delivered at
devoxx which is like incredible it's
that only in only the university
sessions are the ones that are gonna be
recording today as well okay thank you
what's the channel called host my gas
board and that will be streamed on
YouTube but will also be linking about
our rocks there is all this we on one
hand I'll rely on your link up soon as
they come dig that Google Google's
better than yeah get it get some hips
yes yeah since I google a job
compensation should we ask you know
YouTube is also owned by Google so if
you just actually YouTube yeah well
vimeo as well yeah well vimeo videos are
gonna take a little longer as stefan
mention it so yeah it's correct yeah but
yeah well thank you very much for
joining us today and thanks to their
face if people are in decided maybe
sways for the sessions there mm-hmm oh
there is of course one big session that
everyone should attend oh you gotta be a
shameless plug again this is a shameless
plug even if I wasn't on this session I
would still say it's amazing bucks new
advertiser honor that it's the Java
counsel counsel them say zero turn
around oh I said you may be say the java
the java council is is a community
podcast yeah and is actually the
community podcast OGG was created
because the java posse guys were taking
home last year they left i don't think
we can take over i think we're all just
turn on were an old turner
but yeah I'll after a few months of the
java posse finishing we thought it was
extremely sad and we thought let's let's
create a new new podcast in a similar
vision but we wanted our own our own
style we don't want to you know kind of
duplicate it absolutely but Stefan was
very very kind enough to give us a slot
here on the on the first day so at 550
will will be there we've got mark
Reinhold with for an interview we've got
a we've got an ignite talk a blind
ignite talk which is where you don't see
the slides but that's going to be tough
yeah we have a couple of panels we have
a bit of fun with just a job a minute
which is little game show that they're
all part of the Java Council session
that is all at once yeah so they are
actually running another conference
within that submits a micro macro
confirmation conference yeah that's why
I was even going towards those five and
15 minute presentations yeah yes I see
bit mad genius so can I do a shameless
plugs well since he's done the Java
Council shameless slut so tomorrow
evening just before the movie there's
going to be a buff the adopt openjdk
buff please come there we are planning
to we are not promising to get beer and
eatables for whoever comes there so
happily show up there you'll be there in
a sense oh yeah you could do a coverage
for us thank you very much Lucy hey
thank you very much to do thank you
thanks Lacey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
