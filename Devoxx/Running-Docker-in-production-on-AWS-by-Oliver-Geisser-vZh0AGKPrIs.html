back and production on AWS I've 30
minutes and I hope I keep the time and
first disclaimer if you ask me how to
run da kine production well answer would
be don't do it so talk is over and so at
least without being aware of the risks
so production is like the name explained
production so you need to take care of
the risks and dr. ecosystem is the young
and evolving a lot of new releases
breaking changes and so on so move
carefully and gain experience and start
with low-risk systems and don't start
with the emission particular application
listen to the critics but judge yourself
so for example there's a blog post just
published this weekend Dokken production
history fela read this read the comments
and judge by yourself okay if you stood
with me then my agenda would be some
challenges all the challenges you need
to solve from going from your
development environment to a production
environment with soccer and I will talk
especially about using docker in
combination with elastic Beanstalk um I
will give you a demo sis and afterwards
a little bit discussion of alternatives
and so just let's start with the
challenges so you have your application
you have duck arised it it's running
locally so what do you need to solve if
you're going to production first thing
of course you need to infrastructure on
AWS this means an ec2 instances and
security groups and load balancers and
stuff like this you need to set this to
create this you can all
this do this manually but of course this
is not production ready so you also need
to solve the problem of to install the
daka engine and you also need then to
handle these multiple containers on
different holes on different notes so
you need to orchestrate them to start
them to stop them to deploy new
containers and you need to configure
these containers you need to give them
some information about the environment
you need to integrate with AWS at least
on AWS it makes sense to use your
already existing services like RDS for
secure databases or all the other
services that are available in AWS and
you need to scare maybe to auto scale
and you need to do monitoring and lock
management and as saying this is not a
complete list but just start of things
you need to consider so aw elastic
beanstalk what is it what is it it's an
application platform as a service this
docker support it's fully managed by AWS
and it's a service to deploy and scale
web applications or web services and
there's also support for background
so-called work applications and you can
combine multiple so you can do kind of
microservices architecture is it but the
the blueprint architecture of elastic
Beanstalk the sweet spot is web
applications it has a good integration
with other AWS services it's also highly
customizable if you understand low-level
pieces and we'll come back to this point
later on so like explains the typical
Beanstalk application is looking like
this you have a load balancer you have
dns entry pointing at your load balancer
you have one or multiple
and dep server applications running
these are typically configured with auto
scaling you have no you're a secure
database and maybe some other stuff like
a no secure database or catching us all
so on but in the Attic awaaz this is a
typical application so the talk is about
docker so elastic Beanstalk in token how
does these two pieces fit together
Beanstalk originally started with
language specific platforms so for PHP
for Ruby for java and later on dr.
support was added and these this doctor
support is based on another aw a service
called elastic container service which
is specifically targeted at managing
containers and is the lower level
management service you can of course use
ecs alone but later on i think i will
explain why in what's out Vantage's of
using it in combination is elastic
beanstalk so easy s how is it working
it's working like most of the other
container orchestration tools out there
and most of these have some similar
architecture you have set a cluster of
machines on these machines of course is
a dhaka diamond which is that stops
matched containers a container are
running on this different nodes and you
have one component this is called ecs
agent something similar you finally find
in all the other solutions to and these
agents are talking back to the master
service master controller and which is
responsible for cluster management and
for scheduling scheduling means to put
your container on a specific instance of
specific node and if you have
dhaka you're familiar with dark eyes you
need docker images and these doctor
images needs to be stored somewhere and
this is the container registry and part
of the ecs or combination complement to
to to ecs is a easy on the container
registry running by EWS you can of
course use docker hub too but yours if
you're using AWS you have a private
registry and bit in so what to do three
steps to deploy an application with
elastic Beanstalk and Dhaka first thing
you need to have a doctor right
application and you need to push this
image this application into and registry
where it is available to get pulled from
from the Beanstalk orgams ases you need
to create an upload a so-called
Beanstalk application panda in simple
words the Beanstalk application bundle
does not contain the application in
itself this is a case for the names
comes from the history of being a
language specific and in the other cases
its application itself and like in my
example is Java case it's a war file and
in the docker case it's just a reference
a specification pi pointing to the to
the image so think of this as something
like Doc Ock impose file and you can
have some more information inside of
suspender which tells the system how to
run your container and then you need to
actually start this process is to deploy
application deploying the application
means you need to deploy this into an
environment you can have multiple
environments per application so in
production users environment is
typically not alone you have test
environment integration environment
production environment and this is I
sings very common and
scenario and time the Beanstalk system
supporters and if there's knew it no
environment existing then an environment
will be graded so in explained with
graphics this is again first step push
the limits second step upload your
bundle third step manage create starts
application so then it's demo time and
let's see if this works let's first have
a look at the console there is also the
elastic beanstalk console and I could
see here this is sorry this is a welcome
screen and there's no application no
environment deployed yet you can use a
graphical user interface but i will use
something else which is called the
elastic Beanstalk command-line interface
in short I be so let's see what is my
demo application and Madam application
is just the JP application could be
anything else but japes de creates a
complete application and it's perfect
for demoing this stuff because this also
creates dakka dakka five so I already
have this locally this is the game
application like you can see here it's
created using Jacob star and you can
find shape's that's the application
generator project and I did not modify
anything just generated application out
of the box it also generates dhaka fire
but it doesn't matter you can also write
it on your own and it also creates and
compose file to run this locally so
let's see first step
I've already built and compiled this to
save some time so we will start with
step 2 to build a docker image this will
just copy the war file into the
container image and afterwards we will
have a docker image which we can run
locally so to see this let's see there
is def ox and this is a new image just
created one second nine seconds ago so
next step is to push this into the
registry but let's check this out
locally before so we will run just for
demonstration purposes this application
locally in environment and development
environment this docker compost fire
will starts actual applications of java
application and also a second container
the my secure container and then this
job application will connect with local
my secret in container and everything is
running locally and see it is and let's
check this and yeah like you see this is
a java hipster application just
generated i can log in and behind the
scenes says all kind of stocks stuff
coming from spring boot and you will
have health checks you have log files
and so on but this is just coming from
from j hipster and what I want to
demonstrate it this is running locally
on port 8080 so then let's stop this the
developers with the boxes we are ready
to run and now you won't like to go to
production environment or maybe
integration biomed first and so we need
to Texas file but before I've explained
i'm using the AWS regular rugged three
so i need to login and then i need to
check my file and like you see here this
is like you referencing to the end ECR
the AVL AWS container registry so this
means don't start on the cop but stored
in side of AWS and then you need to push
it and this pushes this to the ETS
registry and so step one is it's done
now we need to create our application
bandar and to start up the application
and this for this I need to switch to
this other directory this is typically
setup of the command line environment
you have a directory with some
specification files and I the start up
the process in the beginning and
afterwards explain a little bit because
it uses will take a couple of minutes to
to be ready and this command line then
now talks to the 220 to the service and
that's a little bit of stuff first thing
is set it up loading this zip file so it
sipping the local directory and the zip
file is that uploaded 2 s 3 and this is
exactly what I've explained before is
this application bundle so this is step
2 this is not done and then the next
step is it has created this application
called devoxx for this demo
and now it's creating environment called
prod and this needs some time and while
is this is working i will explain a
little bit about what is happening
behind the scenes so in this moment it's
safe to control these or we can stop
this and let's switch back to the
presentation or not no there is it so
and this was you a user interface step
one push the image that to upload the
bundle and tips that recreate the
application or deploy application theft
step 2 and step three is combined
combined with the Zeb command-line tool
and what happens behind the scenes
behind the scenes elastic Beanstalk uses
a lot of the other stuff you don't know
this in the beginning but it's helpful
if you want to customize it so elastic
Beanstalk does not do the work on its
own it just creates a so-called cloud
formations thick cloud formation is
another service which is then
responsible to to read the
specifications a stick specification and
to execute all the things which need to
be done and to create all the resources
which I need it so what are these
resources of course like I've changed
before we need to note so this is our
easy two instances and so Amazon ec2
cloud formation is calling easy to to
create the VMS and it's also creating a
so called ecs cluster and this is an
organizational concept and this also
creates a load balancer which are
positioned in front of the instances it
also creates an entry in route 53 which
is a dns service and then it's a create
auto scaling policies inside of cloud
watch and you can also customize this
process by inserting and adding your own
concepts so this would be that there are
other resources it would would be
created to for example you can create a
cache layer using alas acacia ready
or something like this you can create no
sequel services like dynamo DB or
something like this so and then let's
have a look what's happening for this
I've switch to the console and if i
restore this then I've see that this is
already have created the d'box
application inside of this des
environment called prod and if I go
inside of this then I can see the events
which are happening and I can see that
it step-by-step creates all the
resources so let's use a time and look
into the Beanstalk specification fire
what we have here is that we have the
main part this is what I've explained
before this is a specification file file
called da car on AWS Jason and it
contains the actual container
definitions so it gives the container
name it tells or specifies which image
to use and this is exactly the image we
have just pushed up to the registry in
the step 1 some more specifications like
like and if it's essential this means
that you need to restart this container
or this this whole system if it's not
running so ecs and behind the scenes is
also monitoring this and restarting the
container if it's get stopped um you
need memory specification you have some
port mappings and so on this is very
similar as a docker compose fire and
if you are coming home this is just a
little bit different syntax but in the
end it's the same idea in development we
have used 8080 but in production I would
like to use port 80 and and for this I'm
using a second container and also to
demonstrate that you do not you are not
restricted to only one container but you
have an airy like here in JSON file so
we have a large a hipster container but
we also have an engine X proxy in front
of it and this allows me to show you was
this link concept that's this one
container this engine X container is
linking to the japes the container and
to proxy it and this also show allows me
to show your concept of let's bundle the
application pander because I'm mounting
a source volume this on the onion on the
host and what's inside of this directory
it's it's the unpacked tip fire which in
this case also contains engine X proxy
definition so you bring in the proxy
definition from this from this
application bundle and then the the
container picks this up by and by this
bold statement and what do your ads have
in this directory you have the actual
configuration and this is how you inert
this the default environment and this is
running a mighty container tocar I've
explained before this could be also Java
etc but you have most it was the most
flexible solution is to use docker and
the region so all kind of AWS specific
stuff about environment which reason to
use and so on
more interesting as this is mostly a
configuration for the eb command-line
tool but for the deployment there's
another directive you guys is this
called EV extensions like I've explained
before this is customizable so you can
put little piece of snippet of
configurations lipids into this
directory and modify the system for
example I've also changed from
development to production this that I've
proxy in in front of this but I have
also removed the my secure database and
this is because i have set up an RDS
database which is running outside of cl
a sickening so an environment to reuse
it typically in production you want to
assure that your database is not lost
and as in separate life cycle of your
application so for this I need to
configure the environment how to connect
this and I and I also need to configure
that the security groups of fireball
roots are allowing me to connect to this
RDS instance and this is some example of
extending of extending the cloud
formation specification to say ok also
puts this auto scaling group all the
instances from this auto scaling group
into a secure security group called
database and this is configured to be
allowed to connect so arias and the
other thing is the data source
URL and of course you can use other
kinds of circuit configuration but this
is easiest one so let's see if it's
working okay just in time and now here
we go poo smoking and and we have the
same application like in development but
now with with pot 80 because of the
proxy and connecting to the to the
database in our early s not on the local
machine so this is the end of the actual
live demo let's go back to my slides and
let's see good okay elastic Beanstalk
dot-com and like I've explained before
the whole ecosystem is really evolving
very fast and they're a lot of other
options on the market so if you need to
check one of these solutions I present
you a little checklist what you should
test or check or have an eye on and if
you compare the different 2 solutions of
course and you need to check cluster
management how do you manage the
infrastructure below you need to check
how container scheduling is working
configuration management like we have
seen before and specific case of a
special case of configuration management
at secrets management and service
discovery how do you find your your
entities your services network
management house is configured load
balancing is it set up is that internal
it's an external can
you combine this storage management how
r williams handled service integration
elastic Beanstalk is very good at
integrating with AWS services of course
and there's another philosophy in other
solutions more to be a complete
abstraction layer and this elastic
Beanstalk is more open and shows what is
behind of it and monitoring logging I've
not demonstrated this but they are also
solutions like for example cloud watch
also supports logging and central lock
management and monitoring and if you
then look at the landscapes then there
are two choices on one hand you actually
AWS building services like at explain
before there's Beanstalk the in stock in
itself is based on ecs if you use it
with docker and ecs is a more low-level
container management but it's missing a
lot of features because you found these
features inside of elastic Beanstalk and
then there's also a solution called
opsworks and objects also integrated
with is ecs or with a chef and but the
integration is not as good or as deep as
the Beanstalk integration and then of
course you have the possibility to use
party software not built in and then
there's a lot of this different
solutions on the market you have Cuban
it is this is from the google guys you
can find one of the educates and in the
floor below and you have dhaka as a
company itself with islam or daca cloud
or daca data center and you have the
Apache project mrs. marks on you of
course freed you have heavy co-op no
Matt you have salon do Stoops not so
much known but also interesting coming
from an operational perspective and my
personal recommendation would be
if you invested in AWS currently you
have some service already running and
one to manage service so you don't want
to hassle the hassle of managing the
control plane by yourself then go with
elastic beanstalk if you have some main
power and skill and are adventurous and
so on to operate a platform on your own
and then yeah you should check out Cuba
letís Cuba that is compared for example
22 elastic beanstalk and ecs is more
advanced and but a production great set
up and running this in production not
application but Cuba Nettie's in itself
is not an easy task and you need
specialized and evolved operation team
for this and I think Kobe latest has a
bright future but currently it's in
infancy and especially if you are
thinking about ya sinks like long-term
stability it's like I've explained in
the beginning it's just the beginning of
the whole ecosystem and at the end of my
talk thank you and if you have any
questions I will be available for
questions and because we have the end of
the talk and it's time is up like
explains here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
