five years ago the company I work for
Heroku published a manifesto called the
12 factor app this manifesto is really
just a collection of principles and best
practices that lead to more scalable
maintainable and portable applications
it's derived from what we've learned
from our platforms of service which
hosts about 5 million applications and
handles 10 billion requests per day but
it applies to any kind of deployment
whether it's to the cloud to your own
infrastructure or whatever so when this
was when this first came out in 2012 the
state of the art for Java deployment was
taking a code packaging up into a war
file and then dropping that war file
into a running tomcat or JBoss container
or application server so this type of
deployment which I called traditional
job deployment sort of has sort of an
impedance mismatch with the 12 factor
app but over the last five years of
people have begun to understand the 12
factors of what they mean and frameworks
like spring and spring boot have adopted
these principles and today we have a
great selection of frameworks and tools
that use modern Java the deployment
where we take our code we package it up
into a jar file or set of jar files and
then we can deploy that jar file
anywhere to the cloud your own
infrastructure whether it's the only
external dependency of that jar file is
the JVM
so it's truly portable in that in that
sense of Java being portable so this is
why we hear people like Josh long saying
make jar not war the modern Java
approach to deployment uses executable
jar files so these are the twelve
factors I'm going to try and hash over
them as quickly as I can in the 15
minutes I'm also going to try and
refresh them a little bit these were
published in a time when there were
there was no talk of micro services
there was no docker and containerization
was not as well understood so there's
been some modern developments that we
need to update it for I'm also going to
try and tack on a couple of factors that
I think should be included if it were
published today
so the first one is code base this is a
principle that states you should use
version control now some of the things I
talked about you're going to think are
obvious and they are some because
they're just common practices others
because they've been adopted very well
in the last few years but this principle
goes beyond using version control it
also states that you should have one
version control repository per
application and then you should deploy
that repository or that application to
multiple environments so this is
essentially discouraging mono repos
where we put lots of different apps or
services into a single repository
sometimes including like mobile apps
this is a principle that at Heroku we've
lightened up on we actually use mono
repos internally a little bit but
personally I still discourage it I find
that having multiple applications in a
single repository sort of breaks down
the decoupling between those apps you
end up with commits that apply to
multiple apps within that repo and kind
of blur the lines of their distinctions
so keeping those that isolation and
ensuring things are packaged up well
also relates to the next factor which is
dependencies so in the 12 factor app you
should explicitly declare and isolate
your dependencies and you should never
rely on the implicit existence of
system-wide packages so in other words
your dependencies everything your app
depends on except for the JVM itself
should be defined in your pom XML or
your build.gradle these should be
managed dependencies and if you do that
it becomes very easy to make jar not
Worr when we deployed war files the
tomcat container or our application
server was an external dependency of our
application that was unmanaged we had no
control over its version or its
configuration by inverting the model and
using jar files we we can tightly
control that how our application
executes as the next factor is
configuration so in the context of the
12 factor Aplin when we say
configuration we mean anything that
changes between environments so your
dependencies are like a type of
configuration but that's not what we're
talking about here those your
dependencies stay the same between
environments
configuration that changes between
environments should be strictly
separated from your code it should be
stored in environment variables in the
environment as opposed to in your code
repository so in other words don't check
passwords in the get now I know you
wouldn't check your own personal
password in tickets but you may have
checked in a database password or an
Amazon token and if you did so you're
probably justified it by saying well
this is a private github repository no
one can see these things but private
github repositories are stored in clear
text on a server somewhere probably
California I don't know and therein is
the problem private repositories are not
sufficient for protecting secrets so
these secrets these configuration
variables should be stored in the
environment as environment variables
which you can then consume from your
application so a good litmus test for
this principle is can you make your
application open source at any moment
without compromising any of the secrets
any of the credentials in your
application if you can do that you're
probably well on your way to satisfying
this factor so this is tightly related
to the next factor which is backing
services backing services are any kind
of service that your application
consumes as part of its regular
operation so your database Postgres some
kind of caching services these backing
services should be treated as attachable
resources and they should be attached
via a single entry point a URL and that
in that URL should be stored as an
environment variable so that it can be
changed between environments so a good
example of this is if you're using
spring the spring data source URL
environment variable is automatically
picked up by the framework and X takes
precedence over just about every other
type of configuration such as Yambol
files
I think options on the command line are
the only thing to take a higher
precedence ok the next factor is build
release in lung a 12 factor app is
deployed in three discrete steps build
in which we turn our code into some kind
of build artifact artifact or artifacts
in our case these are jar files release
in which we combine those build
artifacts with the configuration for a
particular environment because that
configuration is separated from our code
and we create some kind of release image
that release image it's format to
on where you're deploying to so if
you're deploying to Heroku it's
something we manage internally is us
call it a slug if you're using docker
this is your docker image the final step
is you run your application from that
release image so that every time you
launch a new process or restart your
application you're deriving it from that
same immutable image which gives you a
guarantee that each of those processes
will be act that are executing will be
the same now these three discrete steps
should exist but ideally they are
automated into a single step it's going
to Heroku that's a give push roku master
using Cloud Foundry that's a CF push if
you're using docker it's docker push but
the key here is to automate the process
the next factor is processes processes
should be stateless don't use sticky
sessions after that is port binding
support binding states that the 12
factor app is completely self-contained
it should export HTTP as a service by
binding to a port so this is in contrast
to how we deployed war files where we've
lied on the external container to bind
to the port and sort of curry requests
into our application in the 12 factor
app your application knows how to do
this so Tom cat or jetty or Nettie
becomes a dependency of your application
and your application exports its
services so again make jar not war we've
seen a large number of frameworks modern
Java frameworks that are adopting this
kind of pattern of course spring boot
probably the most popular but there's
also drop wizard which i think was one
of the first to really present this
wildfly swarm play framework Rat Pack I
believe that all of the orderly four to
choose a framework at this at this stage
in the Java lifecycle it should have
adopted these principles or it's out of
date all right the next factor is
concurrency your application should be
able to scale up which the JVM is very
good at doing but it should also scale
out and you scale out by decomposing
your application processes into
individual apps or processes or process
types that do specific kinds of jobs
well in the past we would sort of favor
doing this as having multiple thread
pools within a single application
and we typically did that because
infrastructure was not cheap right if
you're deploying on premise you would
have to purchase a new server to scale
up but today with the cloud and
especially with containerization these
types of and resources are essentially
cheap so it pays to decompose your app
into different background web and worker
processes so that you can scale them
independently the next factor is
disposability a 12 factor app should be
quick to start up resilient to failure
and graceful to shutdown I think the
best way to illustrate this is with an
analogy to pets someone said our servers
are not pets or at least in the past
we've treated them as pets we wanted to
keep them healthy we wanted if they were
sick we would nurture them around to
keep them alive forever keep them
running forever but servers are not pets
especially in the cloud they like cattle
servers are a commodity if a server is a
sick we kill it we get a new one
we go to the market and we buy more
servers there so treat them as a
commodity treat them as disposable
resource the next factor is dev pod
parity which I actually think is the
most important of the 12 factors this
factor states that your development
environment should be as identical as
possible to your production environment
into every environment in between the
place we see this most commonly violated
is that the database player if you're
using Postgres in production you should
be using Postgres in development this is
very easy today especially with tools
like docker and docker compose but we
also see it or in the past we've seen it
with our application container so if we
I've seen many apps where developers are
using Eclipse to run and development
they're running on Tomcats and staging
and then ultimately in WebLogic or
something in production but today with
executable jar files and the sort of
spring boot model of deployment we can
embed the same server into our
application ensure that we have the
exact same underlying server for each
environment so again yeah make jar not
war so the reason I think this is the
most important factor is that parity
between environments leads to
reproducibility so if you have parity
between each of your environments it
becomes easy
to stand up new environments new
developer machines new test environments
and and that in turn leads to fewer
consequences when disposing of
applications so if you can have this
parody you can quickly replace a crash
process or quickly stand up scale up for
new instances it also leads to build
release and run and some of the other
other factors all right so the next
factor is logs in the 12 factor app you
should treat logs as events so that is
you should have all of your applications
logging to standard outs or I'm sorry
all of your processes logging to
standard out you should collect those
logs into some kind of funnel probably
piping them into some system like Kafka
so that you can then search and filter
but the key is to treat them as events
the last factor is admin processes admin
processes are things like database
migration background jobs one-off jobs
these kinds of admin tasks should be run
as isolated processes in other words you
should not SSH into your production
server which is running your java web
app and run some command and this is I
think easier to do with containerization
when you stand up a new docker container
for a web process you can also stand up
a new docker container or Heroku Dino
for those admin tasks okay so those are
the 12 factors there's a great book
called beyond the 12 factor app and it
sort of introduces some other concepts
that I think should be included in the
in the 12 factors that they were
published today I'm going to talk about
two of those real quick one is telemetry
Kevin Hoffa makes this analogy to
deploying to the cloud as if you're
deploying a probe into space this thing
is not coming back to earth so if there
is a problem it needs to be instrumented
so that we can have all of the history
of what happened and what led to that
that problem so we should be collecting
telemetry on performance metrics we
should collect domain specific lengths
of telemetry you know that relates to
the domain objects in your application
you should form health checks so that
you know when your application is up and
working and then ultimately should have
system logs just like we talked about
with the log factory so there's some
great tools for this Prometheus
is a metrics client Graphite's and then
of course just regular JMX
the next factor is security a modern
application should take security first
it should not be an afterthought we
should use HTTPS Everywhere we have
let's encrypt now very easy and free way
to get certificates you should also have
role based access even if you don't need
to restrict access role based access at
least allows you to retain some kind of
audit trail so you can determine what
user made what operations so you can
learn more about the 12 factors at 12
factor nets on my blog at jaqen or
github bio I write about 12 factors and
other things as they relate specifically
to Java
I go by code finger on the web I work at
Heroku where I am the Java platform
owner so if you ever deployed to Heroku
and it didn't work it's my fault and you
can come talk to me down at our booth we
have down on the conference floor we'd
love to talk about 12 factor apps and
cloud and in Java thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
