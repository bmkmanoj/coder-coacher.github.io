to our talk get reactive this talk is
about RX java about reactive extensions
on the JVM and in the first part of the
talk i'm going to give you an
introduction to the base concepts of RX
java and later on Pascal is showing you
how to apply those concept to on android
now reactive extensions were created by
Microsoft and for the.net word and
report it over to the JVM by Netflix and
this is a quote by of the jetta page our
java is a library for composing
asynchronous and debate based programs
using observable sequences for the JVM
now what does this mean i think this
graph here depicts this nicely it's
inspired by ben christeson of netflix on
the very left of this graph you have
sources of band sources of data coming
in could be a network be your database
could be a list or some object that you
have available in your code and as you
can see this is a timeline your items
are dropping in and going to the right
and each colored shape is one item of
data that was emitted by an observable
those observables are let's say wrapper
for those data sources and those
rectangles are the operators that
operate on the observables they
manipulate them or combine them so you
can see on the top there are two
observables that get combined together
or below the triangle gets flipped
upside down and at the very end you just
have one observable left and it's of
type clout and this is what you're
really interested in so you combine all
the data coming in that you have
available in some way we will show you
how to manipulate them and at the very
end you subscribe
to the data of a certain type that is
really meaningful for you at this point
in the program now first let's see some
code though this is a simple observable
at the very top you create the
observable with observable from it can
take a list of objects it can take an
area and it emits those items and below
this are three operators the first
operators the field operator that throws
away one of those items then there's the
count operator that counts the remaining
items in the stream and then the final
operator the map operator moves this
integer to a string so you go originally
from an observable of four integers to
an observable of string at the very end
but what you see here is not the
execution it's just the definition the
Declaration of what you want is
observable to do nothing happens as of
yet it only starts to happen when
someone subscribes it's comparable to
Java 8 streams or you only the stream
only runs when some young consumes it
but in contrast to Java 8 streams you
can subscribe to this observable
multiple times and works in two streams
you can only consume once now this is a
simple subscriber at the very top you
subscribe to your object with the
subscribe method and to get passed in a
subscriber object and this has three
methods the most important one is on
next this method will be called whenever
one item is ready for you and those
other methods are called either when no
more items are to be emitted anymore
that's uncompleted or when something
goes wrong on error will be called with
the exception that was or the throwable
that was thrown
now let's see some of those concepts in
more detail first of all of course you
need to have an observable available for
you you have already seen this
observable from call and you could also
use observable just where you can put in
arbitrary objects from one to nine
objects and exactly those objects are
going to be emitted you can create a
range of integers you can create
observables that emit item an item at a
certain point of time you can create
observables that emit items at certain
intervals and of course you also can
create your custom of zero say you want
to rub your cursor in hand right you
could do this this observable create and
observable create is not necessary the
operator or the creating operator you
knows use the most but it's the most
interesting one so I'm going to a bit
more detail about this one so again at
the very top you have this observer will
create it's a static method and it gets
an object of type unsubscribe and this
object is a callback which gets past
this subscriber and the subscriber if
you remember this initial graph is not
necessarily the subscriber at the very
end but any operator is a subscriber to
the observable now in within Europe
create method then you call those
callback methods to the subscriber you
call a net or next whenever an item is
ready say when you are at the next row
for of your database you call us on
completed when you're done with it and
should anything go wrong you should call
s on error now this is where too simple
because a subscriber when it subscribes
gets back a subscription object which
the subscriber can use to cancel the
subscription say you have an endless
stream of items coming in the subscriber
at one point of time wants to tell you
that it's done with it
and so you should always check if your
subscribers to subscribed so wrap every
omission of objects are a callback
method with this check if it's on if the
subscribers unsubscribed then do not
omit anything do not call uncompleted do
not call on error just break out of the
loop and end this method so when you
have created your observe loads of
course you also have to consume those
you have already seen the subscriber
itself there are multiple overloads for
a subscribe where you can pass in some
lambdas to just subscribe just use the
stuff you're really interested in say
you're not interested in the uncompleted
call back you would just pass in to
laundress instead of three for example
but the important part here is that you
should not leak anything especially on
Android we have very limited memory and
it's important not to leave anything and
so I've shown you an anonymous in a
class for the subscriber you should
consider to use static inner classes
instead and you should use this
subscription object that you get back to
unsubscribe so at the very latest in the
on destroy method of Android unsubscribe
from your subscription mmm there is a
project arts life cycle that helps you
to do that so that you do not have to
care about this yourself the most
interesting part of RX java though is
how to get from those initial events to
this certain data type that you're
interested in to the cloud in the
initial graph and you have all kind of
operators in Java I think there are
about 150 operators available and you
can also create custom operators should
those not suffice
and with apparatus available you can
transform the items submitted so they
derived of a different type you have
already seen this map method where I
transformed from integer to a string you
could filter elements so that the total
number of items emitted will be reduced
you could use in conditions so that
items only get emitted when a certain
condition applies or that items start
emitting when a certain condition
applies and of course you've seen this
in the nation graph you can also combine
different observables to just one
observable that you're interested in
enteric can aggregate them you've
already seen the count method but you
could also return all items in the
observable as a list for example or
convert the observable to a men now
let's see three operators in more detail
now first of all this is a marble
diagram every operator on of eric's java
is documented with these marble diagrams
the arc java documentation is really
very good and at the very top of those
diagrams you have the source observable
and those colored shapes are the items
emitted in the middle of the diagram in
this box you have the operator and at
the bottom you have the resulting
resulting observable and you've already
seen this flat map where you went from
one object type to another object type
and flat map allows you to do something
similar but as you can see in the
operator flat map the function you are
using within flat map returns an
observable of items of some type and if
you would just use this you would end up
with an observable of an observable of
some stuff that's not what you're
interested in you want an observable of
this some stuff so what flat map does is
it gets rid of this inner
observable and merges all the items
within this that are emitted within
these inner observer birds as you can
see here at the bottom it's really
emerging it's not that first all red
items are emitted then all green and
then all blue but the green and blues
are intermixed with one another and
often you have an API where you can use
observables same retrofit for example
that allows you to get your net records
your network results back as an
observable of a specific type then you
would use flat web for example now this
is a combination operator you have two
observables at the top and of course one
remain remaining observable at the
bottom and it always combines the latest
are items of each of the observable can
only start emitting items when both have
emitted items but afterwards it always
combines the ladies so that's why you
have three diamonds at the bottom and
then you have another shape but have
still the same color because the color
is still coming from the item before at
the top observable contrast that with
the operator it also combines two
observables but it does so by keeping
the position so it combines always the
first item of the first observable with
the first item of the second observable
then the second item of this fierce
observable the second item of the second
observable and so on and you can imagine
that this might lead to problems if the
first observable for example emits art
was much faster than a second observable
you run into a problem that's called
back pressure this basically happens
when one observable presume would use
these items too fast for the subscriber
to cope with that and you have to deal
with this of obviously
so there are different race how you
could do so one way is to simply drop
items so you could take just one item at
one every 100 milliseconds for example
another is to specifically request a
certain amount of items that you know
that you can cope with from your
upstream operator and then the upstream
operator will only emit as many items as
are requested then waits with meeting
until more items are going to be
requested by the downstream operator and
this request hasn't been supported by
the initial create method that I've show
you if you want to support this
repressed operation you would have to
use a producer and gets fairly
complicated if you want to deal with
that or if you want to read more about
that I recommend to first go to the wiki
page of the arc java of the arc java
project start there then go on to the
block advance our Java which covers
creating operators and creating well
observables in much more detail and
covers back pressure value well now so
far everything that you've seen is
running on the same thread and most
likely that's not what you want to do
especially not on Android not only
online right and to move stuff to
another threat RX java uses schedulers
schedulers simply define a strategy to
select a threat where stuff runs on so
there are different strategies for
example schedule as I oh can be used for
an arrow bound toss for blocking tasks
and it selects a threat of a growing
threat pool and schedulers computation
in contrast uses a thread pool with a
fixed size of threats and the number of
threats is to be determined by the
number of course of your CPU
and so the SUBSCRIBE encore you pass the
scheduler into the subscribe on call and
the subscribe on column moves the
processing chain to a different thread
by using this scheduler and the observe
on coil is used to move the subscription
on a certain threat so that the coal
beds will be called on the main thread
which is important if you want to
manipulate the UI in android so what you
usually have listened you would have a
subscribe on call followed by a cell
phone call immediately before you
subscribe to an observable now error
handling on RX Java allows you some
options now the last line is not
entirely clear correct it should be your
subscriber subscribers observer is an
interface and the subscribers and
implementation of the interface but
usually usually you're always having a
subscriber so this honor is the callback
that you've already seen but when this
callback is called your observable is
test you can no longer and use it and no
more items will be emitted and in
sometimes you do not want it sometimes
you want other items to appear or one
last item to appear if you want just one
more item you could use an error return
that returns a special object that
should be returned in the case of an
error and afterwards uncompleted will be
called or if you want to go on the
different observer you could use on
error resume next so say you have an
observable for a network or it's bound
to go wrong or it could very likely go
wrong so you would consider using on
error resume next to switch to an
observable that use a state data from a
cash to display in the UI instead
now testing observers could get very
ugly because of the callback methods and
you would have to remember the state
somewhere in your unit test code and
react to this later on and to avoid this
rx Java provides this test subscriber
object and this test subscriber can be
used by you to access all the items that
have been emitted so far to see if the
error has been thrown or to see if the
observable has completed already and you
can use a special or those operators on
the top to create edge cases say you
want to test if your error handling
works as expected you could use
observable error to create an observable
that just cause on error directly while
you could use an observable not empty
that will call on completely directly
and not omit any items so you could test
use this for example to test if code
rates properly to an empty results at in
the database and observable never will
never omit any other item and will also
not call on completed it just keeps on
running and you can test this to check
if you cope with this situation well and
if your unsubscribe tuned for example
works perfectly
now finally you might want to debug
observables and this is also not so
easily done because of the callback
nature if you set a breakpoint saying in
the initial example before the filter
method to check what's going on there it
wouldn't help you anything because the
code would stop during the declaration
phase of the observer but you want it to
stop during the running face when
actually the filtering takes place and
the only way to do that properly is by
setting the break point within the
operator that you want to be back most
likely that's not very not feasible for
you so you have other means to work
around this limitation you could use
this do our next call for example to
listen to to the current state of the
observable so if you put in user do our
next color within your chain of
apparatus whenever the observable above
this door next call amidst an item it
will be passed to this do our next color
you can use this then to lock this item
and the observable afterwards proceeds
normally as it would otherwise and then
you could put into our next call after
they're interesting operator that you do
not understand properly or that works
differently than you expected and then
you would see our items emitted before
and all items permitted afterwards and
could see why it doesn't work like you
expected another thing that's
interesting or might be interesting are
those hooks you can use the hooks to
listen to certain events happening in
our drama for example whenever an
observable is created there's hook for
that and whenever someone subscribes to
an observable there's also hope for that
so this has been about the basics now
let's see how to apply those to android
okay i will tell you how this works on
android in especially with some examples
the yeah what is our x android as this
dependency called RX android if you just
write your business logic in our java
you don't need Alex Android to run this
code on Android RX android is a super
small dependency it only has one
subscriber there's no more logic in it a
little bit but the main part is to
subscriber and this makes an absorber
run on the UI thread the main thread so
you can manipulate you I of Android and
I recommend adding the dependency to RX
java because it gets more frequently
updates and yeah updates are always good
so at both to your android project and
yogurt so i will talk mostly about
android UI because android is java there
may be some callbacks to the gyroscope
or something else but it's mostly about
the UI ok many of you will know this
code i just find a button on my UI and
set a click listener and when somebody
taps this button it triggers an action
supercenter of course we can do this if
our eczema and I show you the very first
code you would write to get this and you
create an absorber we saw this before it
gets on subscriber and you need to call
on the subscriber on next method every
time to user taps on this button so this
is very simple it also supports this
unsubscribed thing so if the consumer
unsubscribe from this observer you don't
get items or you don't image items and
yeah the code below is just how you use
this you subscribe to the my button
click
and every time somebody taps on it or
next is called and you trigger the
action very simple but don't use this
code in production yeah he'll just in
Hindi if you are not familiar with
regular retro lambda or lambdas in
general because we are still stuck at
Java 7 and yeah don't use this in
production because I haven't handled
unsubscribing we heard it before you can
unsubscribe from the subscriber and even
without imaging an item you should and
cancer in this case the onclicklistener
set it to nod again but is not handled
here if you want to see the real source
code how this should be done you can go
to our expanding expanding the library
which provides all those observables for
views and it looks like this is it calls
RX you that clicks for click events and
you just give the interview and
subscribe to it but what can we do with
an absorber why do we need that the main
strength of our java is that you come
can combine observables and you can move
them up from the main threat to a
different fret or you can do everything
so here's an example i just delayed a
click not sure if this is useful and i
observed this on the io thread so my
frigate trigger action will call on the
io thread so we talked about this arcs
binding library and down for every kind
of you really every kind of view
observers here's just an example and so
whenever you have an UI element you can
use this library and even for the
support library or the android design
library to support design library it has
a lot of callbacks and it always gets
updated and receives if there is a new
widget and which is commonly used it
will get
date soon so don't write your observers
for widgets by yourself only if you have
something create custom use this library
okay combining your I events this is an
example of an login view everyone uses
examples of login views that's why I
don't use it it's too easy and whenever
I see example of login views it's too
easy for me and it doesn't fit so I
built a registration view a registration
you is a little bit more complex because
it may have optional fields for example
here the user can provide a username and
a password and a full name if he wants
to and this changes something okay what
do I want to do I combine those
observables to create a new model of my
registry a new registration model and
then I will filter if the registration
model is valid I can do every finger
maybe I make a netbook call to a server
validated there and when it's ballot I
subscribe I enable the submit button so
very easy but if you try this it may not
work i did this personally in a project
i thought hey this is perfect i need to
combine the latest items image it and
then i show the submit button in a
neighborhood if everything is filled but
it doesn't work because my filter method
was never called and I couldn't figure
out why and this is the problem of this
combined latest combine latest combines
the latest items but if an absorber
never emits an item there's nothing to
combine so this rx full name the full
name of the user never emits an item
because it's an optional field and use
on might not have given his name so here
just a quick reminder this is the
combined latest and
you see for the first item there is no
item image at the bottom only if the
second observable on top emits an item
and both observers have emitted an item
it combines them and emits an item so
yeah I saw this and here's the quick
solution I merge my optional fields with
an absorber which emits an empty string
very easy basically I did this for every
text you i have in this registration
view they always emit at the beginning
and empty string and I'm fine and now my
absorbable works as expected it checks
off to registration modulus ballot and
enables the submit button okay then it's
not only about you I most of the time
DUI trigger something something like a
network or or very heavy calculation and
yeah I wrote an example I was searching
for github repository so I created a
search view and whenever a user type
something in it I show the repositories
analyst supercenter for the request i
use retrofit to and it gives me nice
interface with absorbers and always you
can do both you get the normal java code
which gives you a call back or you can
get absorbers or even singers and singer
is just a single item and after the item
is emitted it completes ok yeah how is
the soft in the android way i wrote a
different kind of race how to solve is
the android raid beginner RX android way
and the RX java away how you should do
it and so this is the android way i just
set a listener to my search view check
if the text you to check if the query is
empty and if it's not empty i create my
network or and here you see you to call
back and inside my call back
yeah I check for network failure and
otherwise i checked the response if it's
successful i show my response of the
tories a repositories end otherwise I
shall a narrow view on mt view it
depends but yeah you see a lot of
callbacks it's not good code yeah when I
first started with our Android and I
would have written code like this I
first created a search view observable
with this dependency i showed you before
and yeah then I filter otherwise if I
have an empty text I will not mind my
observer should not continue at this
point so I filter and then I stop my
service to do network call it's the
retrofit service so I just it's in a
retrofit service but it could be any
service and that's why i put subscribe
on here for retrofit it's not required
it automatically runs on its own
scheduler but here i just put it to the
io fret so my network role will run on
the i/o fret and when it returns in
observe on i will move my work to the
main threat again and subscribe to it
and on on next so the success case i
show my roof spas repositories and on
the arrow case i show on mt view yeah
this works this works but it's not very
good I'll show you why first this flat
nap and when I started Alex Java i first
learned to operators its map and flat
map and basically map is when I want one
object move to another object and flat
map if I have an object and I want to
create an observable out of it so i
always used flat nap but it doesn't work
in this case because it's important the
order is important of the request so the
request may take different times bands
and if the first request takes very long
and the second request is very quick i
get the second request first and then
the first request which is older and has
not a better data yeah flat map doesn't
care about ordering it just moves the
observable to the chain and image item
to my observable below so I change it
there are a lot of operators so i can
use concatenate map and yeah it cares
about the ordering and because I my
search repositories function only
returns a single item because I know
it's a network call it shouldn't return
more items I can use this khan academy
booth out if this would be an endless
absorber I concat map I possibly
wouldn't get the second observable the
data of the second of silver but i only
get one item maybe I could change it to
singer but Jim it's only one item yes
okay this works now the ordering is
correct I show you now and the output of
my lock head I locked it and I saw
something strange whenever I write
searching and this is what i typed in
into the box and then you see the
network cross and you see the first call
here is just for the d the second call
on the bottom is for de for the second
searching and then i continue and it
keeps continues requesting data and i
already stop diving but it continues a
requesting data and here at the very end
i got the final result of the last typed
item and it took me about two dot three
seconds which is quite a long time and
during typing i got a lot of flickering
inside my list and I don't want this of
cross the problem here is back pressure
I haven't handled back pressure so
normally if I'm typing and the network
cross dance I don't want to start
another network called if my first
network oil doesn't return or haven't
returned
it so i added throttle last and debounce
to prevent that every character gets
sent to the network for the last words
like this you give a period of time and
at the end of this time it admits the
last item which was emitted during this
interval and debounce workers like this
when you are typing and you hit a
character it waits 200 milliseconds and
if not another item was emitted during
this time intimates and yeah I got this
questions why have you used for the last
with 100 milliseconds and depons with
200 milliseconds it's you I I tested it
it felt the best so I wrote a lot into
this text you and check the output and
this was the best compromise between not
imaging too much items but get fast
responses and the last thing here is i
added on back pressure latest and maybe
if my netbook call takes very long i
even with this for the last and d bonsai
amid too many items and i basically I
don't want to my absorb of to crash so I
added on back pressure lives because I'm
always only interested in the latest
item so before I do the network all I
throttle and D balance everything and
then I wait and always use the last item
I don't care about the other items yeah
okay this is my output with for the last
and D bounds and this is basically what
I wanted because I'm a fast typer as
everyone here I wrote devoxx and after I
stopped roaring devil's this D pounds
period started of 200 milliseconds then
I got this network all and yeah got my
data within 103 seconds so yeah I saved
1 seconds and I saved a lot of
flickering yeah here's another thing i
also want to support
that when I'm typing I get immediately
results while I'm typing and because
this looks like yeah I just wait until
someone stops writing and then I make
the network request but it's not that
simple here's an example I I go own I
search for devix talks about it's a
repository on github and here's the wild
typing i also got requests so you see
the requests are not mix they are always
one after each other so here's the first
request I get a response here's another
request I get a response I get another
request to make a response and it goes
on until I reach the final request and
show my data and during this interval I
also show my data but it's not that hard
flickering as I would make a network
request for every type character yes
here's another thing handling errors so
what the Twitter and know the ketchup
API has one limitation and when I do too
many network requests i get an error
because here i do too many traffic and
this problem results in a narrow and
whenever an absorber emits an error it
stops so i will never do another network
request I will never update my list
again whenever I get a error from the
network so how can we solve this I will
focus on this search repositories method
and that's why I put it in extreme
effort yeah here is how it works and if
I don't handle an arrow here it emits
you an error it will go into the on
error method and then my absorb on top
stops with an arrow and it never emits
items and doesn't solve my search
repositories method works
with my solution I do my normal network
requests and maybe put it on another
scheduler and on error resume next we
heard it before whenever i get an error
i return an absorbable instead of the
arrow and here i return an empty
observable because my observable below
of flat mapping this method shouldn't
care about arrows it just should receive
items and my arrows I I caught them
handle here in this method so if i get
an error here i could show some your i
may be an error screen or dialogue i
don't know but i should not return this
error or letters arrow through my
observable so i returned absorba empty
and at that point when the observable
below receives an observable empty it
stops and waits for the next item so
yeah I'm a big fan of eric singer and
it's one item it only has some success
on an error case not on complete case so
it's very simple and perfect it's very
perfect for network requests so you can
use this with retrofit and i'm just in
your interface you refine and instead of
an observable you define a singer and
you can use it but singer has no
uncomplete so single does not support
absorbable dot empty and this is a big
problem and that's why i currently I'm
using absorbable the roof retrofit and
not singer but I should use single and I
haven't found a solution for this so I
use absorb the empty in the error case
and it works pretty good another bit big
benefit of using retrofit is you can
create your or not only about retrofit
but um making network calls s
observables because I was in a sprint
review
the server was not working and I want to
show a network call and it just didn't
work or maybe the Wi-Fi wasn't working
and yeah I just hacked a quick solution
put instead of my retrofit dependency I
use my own dependency and use absorb
we'll just put a list of data items in
their delay it to make it look real and
return this just for mocking it's
perfect yes one thing you should
unsubscribe a non-stop so if you have
your exhibit activity lifecycle fragment
life cycle you have to unsubscribe in
some way otherwise you would leak your
activity and maybe not a non-stop if
you're using something like a location
provider you should unsubscribe in on
pause but anyway on some point you
should unsubscribe otherwise you would
leak and there's a library by Trello
it's called RX lifecycle so you can get
events based on the life cycle of the
activity or of the fragment and combine
those with you absorbers and if for
example on arrows on pulse is called
your life cycle observable emits an item
and your view absorbers automatically
stop emitting items and complete you can
also use I personally use this for use
when I've used and create observers I
always use when I am it an item when my
view details there's another observer of
this view binding dependency I showed
you and you can write RX u dot detached
and until that you can use the until
operator and if this observer emits an
item only if the view detached from the
window it automatically stops and in my
projects I person
use one of your presenter it helps me
during configuration changes because in
my example when I rotate the screen and
I have typed something rotate the screen
and may be rotated back I still want to
see results and even if I'm requesting
during the configuration change I want
to see results and yeah that's why I use
a presenter I recommend using Mosby or
nucleus I've used both libraries then I
started using my own library because
yeah both doesn't fit perfectly so I use
the best of both and use it as an
internal library very small and it just
helps me to have a presenter which
survives the orientation change I do all
my network requests inside of this
presenter and when of you after the
orientation change attached again to my
presenter i omit the items i received
during your configuration change yeah so
we were very fast yeah of course you can
also subscribe to us we are on Twitter
of course and if you have any questions
we have plenty of time I see please
questions yes please
yeah the question was when the
orientation change happens how does the
presenter survive this orientation
change because it's normally bound to
the activity I had the same problem
that's why i was using most be at first
and then nucleus or other way around
they added support for this it works
basically how my first implementation
was I use a fragment and set it to set
retain and it automatically saves during
your configuration change and then I
check the source code how they solved it
with the fragment how this happens and
there's a method in activity called on
non configuration incidence you just
return your object there and in oncreate
you can call get non configuration
instance and you get object they're back
so that's how I solved it and I created
my own activity which entrance this by
default I give it a presenter on it
automatically saves us during
orientation changes this method is now
deprecated but they mention fracking
women too you should use the fragment or
retain state but this solution also uses
this duplicated method so I don't think
it's a problem using a reciprocated
method other questions no thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
