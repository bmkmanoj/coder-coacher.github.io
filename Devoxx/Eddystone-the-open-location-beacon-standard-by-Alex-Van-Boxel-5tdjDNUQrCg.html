quickie the three topics to cover so the
Eddystone proximity beacons the
proximity API cloud service and the
nearby messaging API a mobile services a
mobile API so first of all i'm alex from
voxel in my daytime i work at want
exclusive this is nothing to do with
beacons and but man my night job is will
developers expert so that's more related
to this so beacons with our beacons i
have a few here so hardware beacons
these are very big ones with large
batteries but are a lot smaller and are
available beacons they just transmit
some important or relevant information
granted where you have control over
beacons became a reality when the
bluetooth low energy became a reality by
now every new phone has like low-energy
enabled on them so that's nice and also
you now have like a platform where you
can run something on a microchip and on
a battery for a few years running if you
would that do that on bluetooth the
previous standards that wouldn't work so
Apple was actually the one that
pioneered like beacons day they came out
with I beacon that just a trend
transmitted an identifier and you could
do there there's something on a an Apple
device also Android piggybacked on this
a bit which was quite quite limited so
he came out with like a more specified
standard where they specified for fixed
frames and that the Eddystone standard
and it's a standard it's an over
standard it's available
he tub can do poor request if you have
some nice ideas that's the URL you will
find our reference implementation also
scanning implementations for mobile
devices and the name comes from a
lighthouse and the southwest of England
is a very dangerous place because there
are already three Louis lighthouses
destroyed so it's a very active space
one of the four frames that are defined
is the URL it's an enabler for the the
physical web so just transmit the URL
it's very interesting if you want to try
it out just install the probe the
physical web app or if you have good
chroma and our iOS on on iOS you also
have the possibility to receive those
who you or else so it just does one of
those beacons just sending out a URL
this is me this is me just a link to the
Telex website well as lots of
applications like you could have like a
dog tak that sends out the URL of the
owner if the door is lost you can call
the owner and horror parking meter that
sends out a URL if it's then easily do a
payment that due to the limit a limit
limited space you have to do lots of
tricks to compact everything you have
only 20 bytes to work with so the first
byte is the the frame type 0 is for the
URL every this toner tak will have like
in the second bites are transmitting
power what is very interesting to see
how close you are to the tag because if
you have like a lot of tags and you just
find a tag like at the end is not so
interesting but you're more interested
in a text you are nice around to it and
then the rest is specified a compact
space too
to compress the URL this is an example
of what we did on the on on Chrome that
receives one of those things on iOS it's
a bit more involved on iOS you have to
install the chrome extension in your
today screen so to try that you probably
will receive the URL the next frame is
the unique identifier is comparable to
the ibeacon the ibeacon user identifier
it's an uuid it's divided in a namespace
and identify you have to prevent in your
text with that identify with that
identifier and it's it's handy so you
can manage them yourself rewrite them
and repurpose your weakness for another
tale for another thing so again those 20
bytes and the third one is a telemetry
frame that's one of my favorite ones
because can you imagine if you have like
in a city thousands of battery power
tags and you have to maintain and see
how long was how long ago did we change
the batteries on all those tax you can
imagine it's like a nightmare because in
the city of Amsterdam there's a
deployment all over the city with a lot
of tax and it's a nightmare to manage
that so the telemetry frame will help
you with that because it sends out
actually telemetry data of itself so
what is the what is the power of the
battery how many frames did I send out
how many how long ago did I boot it up
and so on if you send it out and you
have a lot of people with your wrap
receiving those telemetry data and
sending it to your server you can
imagine you have a wealth of data that
has monetary information on your tax so
that you can see
we have a few of those texts you're very
low battery leads to some maintenance on
that and replace the batteries before
they go out this is the fourth and the
the newest addition to it is the
encrypted ephemeral identifier so you
can imagine an identifier is very good
for static stuff so like a chair room or
something but you actually do not want
to have like an identifier carried
around on a person unlike a server
version because then you have like ways
to detect or identify a person some so
if I know you what your IDs of the
luggage you're carrying I can try to
track you down but with this kind of
frame it is a frame that constantly
changes of the identifier that it sends
out but with EE that you have and that a
beacon has the combination well the
shared secret that you have you as a
user can only you and the service you
are talking to can identify you so
samsonite will next year bring out the
system where you you goona could enable
this when your luggage to keep track of
this could be interesting your if your
luggages on the bell on the belt and
your Apple notify okay your luck is
coming out but if you lost it for
example you could also do the crowd
sourcing of all the people that have
that app to search for you for your lost
luggage because sit then searches for
that that identified and only you the
provider samsonite will know this is the
day that we are looking for so this is
already cooled so we have all already
four frames so it could do a lot of
things which we can yeah implement our
own back-end but who also has a
proximity service where you can
provision all your your tax and so this
is the place where you can start with so
there are some standard things you can
already define like latitude indoor
floor level so if you're alive from
building interesting information and
places ID these are all standard Google
Maps identifiers and attachments those
attachments are standard meta data you
can add to you each individual tag so
with those metadata you do not need to
work with the identifiers in your app
you just read out your meta data you can
easily get started with the dashboard so
one of those beacons I provisioned like
on Monday in the hotel and I already
noticed that it was wrong because the I
it wasn't to tell but I put the location
yet it was already notifying me so
there's also one of the benefits of any
standard platform where you can
piggyback on the Play services and some
other services is defined the Google
service on device they can be back and
give the health information there so you
have a standard app you also have a
dashboard on the web so already
mentioned the attachments ilysm is the
meta data that you have that was very
handy for for adding stuff so for
example we could have like location
reception or details if you have like
the complete value is 1 1 identify and
other is put well for example you are
very free to do whatever you like that
you're only limited with the size of 100
bytes per day or per attachments then
there's also beacon ownership with the
ownership you can define different
levels of ownership so of course you're
the owner of that but could be that we
like devoxx are an event organizer and
the venue already had some tax so which
if you have like a shared platform they
can already provision those tax for them
for different events but they can give
access to you so we can add metadata to
that that we can reuse in our own app
just to be clear it's not done here it's
just nice to have what would be cool if
that can happen we has done an event
organized cannon at X rot tax all over
the place like it at every boot and even
boot owners can go Bor fine-grained also
available in the platform is the
monitoring I told you the telemetry
frame already send some stuff and in the
middle you see active that's one of the
things you can see if after a while a
beacon has not been seen you will see
it's missing or when the battery is low
it will monitor in that it's all
available for free you can use it
everything is has an API so you can
already extend those things but you do
not have to worry about like the
registry and a monitoring at all this is
a recap so you have ownership the
attachment management and the monitoring
that has been defined in the service of
course you have an API on the mobile
device it's available for Android and
iOS Android is part of the Play services
so it will get updated along with the
rest people are running programming
Android are very used to those things
it's part of the nearby API nearby api's
meant for talking to things nearby like
persons or the devices playing games but
beacon is also another device so
that's why it's part of that API the
attachments the matter data that you
provided is a provider is pushed to your
apps with messages and it's possible to
do foreground and background scanning of
course the back the background scanning
is a lower battery mode so it has longer
latency and less reliable but if your if
your app in front you can activate the
foreground scanning and it's more
precise so this is the Android example
just have to register with the API key
and you listen to on the receive message
and almost methods and that's a bit it
you have the parsing of the attachments
where you just see oh which namespaces
it is it it's in so the cloud project
that you provided is the namespace which
type is it in which they tie do you have
so that's a bit it um it's a quickie for
something so it's quite easy you do not
have to buy big tax but there are tied
beacon star from from maybe 15 door or
more you can have beacons play around
with them didn't they do not for the
proximity API didn't didn't do not have
to be this one beacons but of course
it's preferred because you can do a lot
more with them and then yeah right your
app and that's it so thank you any
questions you right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
