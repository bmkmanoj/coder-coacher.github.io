Vlad hibernate developer advocate
so irony you're talking about a lot of
the performance bottlenecks what is some
of the most common ones you can expect
and how do you get around them well the
most actually I could say that one of
the biggest issues that people have is
that they have they fetch much more data
than they need visually that there's a
number one cause of the issue actually
I'm going to talk about also today in
this person and I'm going to give and
but they're also there are many many
things like the way you manage
connections not doing batching when you
when crude and which is actually when
you're using hybrid is transparent you
can switch from non batching to batching
easily but we don't take that into
consideration also statement caching is
very important settlement caching is
probably one thing a very easy win
because you can set it up you can just
but declaratively and you easily gain a
lot from you especially when you lose
the frame of a hibernate it's a bit like
stored procedures in sequel well not not
not really like that you know because
hibernate happen it doesn't work like
that it's much more based on statements
you know it's based on the Korat
statements store procedures are good you
know when you want to do well if you
have to process tons of data and you
don't really need to have them in the
yard application doesn't make a lot of
sense to move a lot of data from the
database on the network and then into
the application to do some calculation
and then to just save the result back
it's much better if you can do it just
in the database because you save a lot
of networking bandwidth and processing
so but I wouldn't it not that's one side
I know of operating with that a database
hibernates it's much more focused on the
OLTP side like when you want to you have
a web application want to see to update
data to insert delete and to get instant
the feedback of what you're doing which
is very important because we still have
this requirement
to the day we still have that that's how
that was the main reason for using a
burner do you think one of the reasons
people you said the number one thing is
achieving more data than they need
mm-hmm I think one of the main reasons
for that is incorrect object design or
do you think its use of hibernate so
just from my personal experience we had
an object that was wrapped around a
collection of objects and inside each of
those objects in the collection they had
objects inside them listen it's when you
pulled it back to do simple how many
objects have I got in my collection yeah
actually the problem is that you know
it's like a double-edged sword you know
it's very easy to use but anything it's
so easy to fetch much more than you need
and you don't even realize because the
the abstraction it's it's it's I'd say
like on a high level
and you don't figure out because if you
don't lock the queries you we have if
there's an even option you can write
unit size to a certain number of words
but people don't do that and when you
look at the code you know having is just
some methods and you don't instantly
know how much data you are going to
fetch or how many queries so that's why
somehow you're disconnected from the
database and if you don't if you don't
check the logs if you don't know the
queries you're going to lose because in
the end it still boils down to the query
so even if they out automatically
generated it doesn't mean you don't have
the responsibility of checking and
ensuring that those queries are the ones
that you really want it to do if you
were doing it manually so yes it's so
easy to use it and to do the wrong
things but then you have the
responsibility of doing the right thing
you know like Spiderman said with great
power comes great responsibility
that's exactly so apart from checking
logs there any other tools that
developers would use to make sure that
the query that they're using are optimal
well of course I think want one of the
best thing that everybody should have
and should Woody's
that way in that they need to know SQL
because hibernate is not a tool that you
know just take this response rate in a
way you still have to know how databases
work you still have to know SQL and not
just standard SQL database Oracle
Postgres MySQL is a the thing that are
specific because you know even if you
have a standard everybody every database
takes its own different course and and
yeah you have to know that and you have
to understand it when you look at the
query you have to know what's happening
and sometimes you have to you have to
realize that entity queries the way that
they are offered by having it there only
makes sense if you extract data that
want to modify otherwise you need to use
video projections and even native
queries because yeah so you have to have
this mindset and actually that's
probably the one of the biggest things
in a really good game if you know SQL
you will know how to use also hibernate
properly it doesn't work the other way
if you know hibernate but don't know if
you you're going to lose because in the
end it's just SQL and JDBC so yeah so
probably better than the tool is the
knowledge the skills that you need to
have even yeah like hibernate and also
the data thank you very much thank you
very much for having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
