thanks for coming we're gonna talk about
Java 9 we're gonna talk about a few key
parts Java 9 itself is very one of the
most powerful improvements to the
language we'll talk a little bit about
that and then we'll focus on what we
gonna talk about in this presentation
well looking back in time over the past
few decades Java has had been very
stagnant and not very many improvements
over the years and suddenly all that
changed with Java 8 if you really look
at Java 8 itself you could say Java 8
was somewhat of an opt-in to a certain
extent as a programmer you had the
choice of saying I want to adopt these
things are I want to wait out and maybe
adopt later on while Java 8 was
extremely significant from the
programmer point of view Java 9 is
significant from every single person
point of view it doesn't matter what
part of Java ecosystem you are dealing
with there's going to be an impact
related to it and that is one of the
really interesting things about Java 9
as it is probably we could claim the the
most significant change to Java ever
even more than Java 8 itself in that
regard so I want to talk about Java 9
and there's you know if we can come up
with a laundry list of all the features
in there and a lot of times there are
two problems with such an approach one
is the list is very big and the second
problem is we don't remember any of
those when we just look at a laundry
list of features so I step back and ask
the question what do I want to really
talk about in Java 9 and I realized that
there is actually three different groups
we can look into when it comes to Java 9
so I decided to classify what we're
gonna look at into three different
groups the first one I want to put them
into a category called improvements and
changes what I mean by improvement and
changes is these are things you already
do in Java 7 or Java 8 but you can do it
a little bit better and that is always
nice because hey whatever I'm doing
before I can do it a little bit better
that makes me off reductive that's
awesome so we got to look at a few
things that I would like to call as
improvements and changes the second
category is what I would like to call as
additions additions are things that did
not exist before but we can use them now
and as a result benefit from some of
those things that are available so I'll
call them as additions and and the third
category I was kind of wondering what to
call it so very politely I decided to
call it as advances meaning disruptions
it's gonna hurt you gonna kick and you
can scream and then eventually we come
out I had you know enjoying it so that's
what I want to talk about these three
groups in the in the next about three
hours or so we have together I want to
talk about these different three
different things um so let's get started
with the first category here
improvements and changes let's talk
about interfaces well in Java
of course we've had interfaces from day
one which is one of the things that
really excited me I came through the
background of programming in C++ years
ago and when it comes to C++ we had
abstract classes we could have you know
abstract a classes with pure virtual
methods but the concept of interface has
never sunk into me and I remember the
day I got you know I looked at Java's
interfaces and interface inheritance
that's an unforgettable moment in my
life I still remember that after these
many decades because that really changed
the way I look at the language and on
how can use it so interfaces have a
special heart in my in my mind so we
could call an interface here called util
let's say and in this case the interface
let's say has a map that I want to write
in this case we'll say it's called get
let's say number of course for up for
example well I want to know how the
compiler deals with this so I'm gonna
output right here just the word okay and
you can see that the compiler is pretty
happy with what I wrote so no big deal
it seems to be hey you're happy writing
Java I'm in good terms with you but if I
go here and try to implement this method
maybe I say return for for example
immediately Java will give me an error
obviously saying what are you trying to
do you know Java it says well obviously
we cannot put implementations into
interface or at least that's the way it
used to be so my definition of inter
face in Java is or was it was an
interface and where an interface is
something that told a lot about what
it'll do but it never does anything kind
of like my boss I always say that so so
that's basically what it was but this
has improved quite a bit thankfully now
we can write implementations but we can
put a default method in it in Java 7
sorry Java 8 of course so we can create
these as default methods that's it
that's really nice but let's step back
for a second let's talk about classes
well when it comes to classes you
normally write public methods and
classes but occasionally you will
realize quickly that multiple public
methods require the same they know
implementations and rather than
duplicating that inter implementation
because we know that if we start
duplicating things we're in violation of
the DRI principle so rather than
duplicating that implementation we say
we want to really reuse that function so
what do you normally do in a case of a
class well he will take that common
implementation and roll it into a
private method within classes the same
concerns appear here as well with
interfaces it's quite possible that
multiple methods default methods in an
interface may have common code and if
there's a common code where would you
put it well you could roll them into
another default method that's one option
but if you roll it with the front
default method that method you rolled
into from other sub methods become
available for inheritance by classes
become available for use and maybe
you're saying well I want to roll these
methods together but I don't want you to
really use it from the outside it's for
me for my internal purpose we call them
as helper methods the same exact idea it
is available for interfaces too so for
example if I wanted to really call this
as a helper and whatever the helper is
gonna return I'm gonna return from here
I can say private int helper in this
case let's just return that for right
here which I wanted to really maybe
reuse in other methods I can definitely
do that as well but because this is a
private method it is hidden within this
particular interface not available not
visible and and so that is there's one
of the things now of course you know
that you can only put a static method in
interface you can alter a default method
an interface you can also put static
methods also so for example I have you
know some method foo here that is going
to be a static method well in this
example of course you may wonder if I
have static methods and you know default
methods what's next do I have private
methods
well they say be careful what you wish
for so you actually do have that now you
can have private methods but what if I
want to really share this method with
the default method versus a static
method how would I actually use it well
if you have a method which is going to
be used within a static method we'll say
in this case helper do well obviously I
want to use helper to within the static
method so I could say private in let's
say in helper 2 and let's say in this
case I want to return the value of 5 but
unfortunately though in this case we
don't know what that means
so we get a little compilation error
saying I cannot reference the helper 2
from a static scope well obviously in
this case you would say static right
here and then that would be calling that
well that that's the question
do I really need to say default over
here because after all this is for a
default method versus this is for a
static method and the answer is no you
cannot so if you want to really write a
private method which is for access by
default then just write as a private
method if you want a private method
that's useful for static context then do
sprinkle the word static in along with
it as well and so as a result you can
write private methods and interfaces too
and essentially these are for helper
methods that you're going to write and
then tuck them away and so you can reuse
them across multiple methods as you may
choose to so that's one nice little
improvement in the language where you
can have these reusable methods you can
provide really nicely and that's
basically what you're you have available
one other little improvement goes back
to Java 7 feature so for example if you
have a class called resource let's say
and I have a constructor for resource in
this case I'm going to just output let's
say created right now and then of course
I want to implement let's say a method
will call this ass up one and all that
this OP one method is going to do simply
is let's say output op one well that's
my little resource class but I want
meant a fairly good cleanup of this
resource so what you could do in this
cases in the class of course you can
write a public void closed and the close
method simply is going to say in this in
this implementation all I'm going to do
is clean up well okay so that's a
cleanup method I have implemented but I
want to use this resource class and make
sure that it is going to perform a
proper cleanup operation how do I go
about doing this well rather than having
to spend the time and effort doing this
we could simply say implements for
example and you could say our toe
closeable and other plausible of course
expects a public closed method to be
available but the benefit that gives you
is you can put a try block and say
resource and then once you create a
resource or object right here you can
say equal to new resource you can go
ahead and call the methods you want to
call for example in this case you could
call resource dot up one but when you
nicely leave the block of code right
here the close is going to happen for
you automatically without you having to
put any effort we call this the try with
resource or a RM or automatic resource
management well this worked really well
there was one small edge case if you
will this really required that this
object that you are putting around as a
resource constraint is being born right
there in this call well well that is
really a good idea most of the time
there may be a time when you acquire
this object from somewhere else or even
even different what if this object is
passed to you in your function call well
you may ask why would you really bother
about it well remember that what two
letter word we all occasionally think
about di dependency in inversion or
injection so if you have a dependency
injection you want to be able to receive
that being given to you rather than you
calling a getter to get to it so what
how do you deal with dependency
injection well in the case of dependence
action maybe I have a function you're
passing this as a parameter to my
function in which case this object is
not being created right here so it's
going to be available outside of this
maybe it is you know coming from
somewhere else like a parameter to a
function of course I'm creating this
right here but silly me but it could be
coming in as a parameter for somewhere
but you don't want to put a constraint
around this resource and say you know
what you created you're giving it to me
but I'm the owner of this object well
that restriction of the try with
resource as been removed now you can put
that outside so it could be given to you
um I don't want to mention that I'm
always wondering whether this is a
feature or a flaw because this could be
you know really misused as well so I
would use it with a grain of salt if you
really have a good reason to do this
then use it if you're not very convinced
is a good idea usually I ask for help I
go to a colleague and say I have this
evil thoughts in my mind can you review
my code and usually they set me right so
the thing is that don't assume this is
actually a good thing it might be good
in some special cases a lot of other
times this might not be a really good
thing one of the reasons we have to be
careful about this is while the object
is being cleaned up you notice that it
is calling the cleanup right there and
I'm gonna say done over here notice that
done came after the cleanup but the
object is still available to us which
can really be problematic if you're not
very careful about it so use that with a
grain of salt don't don't just assume
that because you can do it that you
should actually do it so that is just a
feature and it's I think it's useful
like I said I can think of a few
different reasons why this is good
di is one of the reasons I can think of
and and butt out about it but again you
know use your judgment whether whether
you should use this or not well moving a
little forward let's talk a little bit
about what a few other languages
normally do well if you look at
languages like GRU we are Kotlin in
these languages when you have a
parameter coming in as a lambdas
parameter you can receive the lambda and
you can give a name like E and you can
print the value of E like this but
programmers sometimes do something some
other things like they say k and then
print line K and then somebody else says
you know L and then print line L and
I've come to the point where I realize
these variable names are absolutely
random and one day I was working with
the code and I was trying to predict
what the next variable name is going to
be and I totally failed at it it was
that random and then I figured out
finally the way these variable names are
given is programmers don't actually type
this they are coding away they get
distracted and they look around their
character Italy walks on the keyboard
and whatever key they step on become the
variable name and they love their cats
so much they oh wonderful you gave me a
good variable name now go play while I
cut into code and they just scored away
well if you're gonna come up with
absolutely ridiculous random names I
would rather get rid of the ridiculous
names and let the language take over so
in these languages what we can do really
is rather than writing these ridiculous
names we can simply get rid of it and we
could say it for example and in this of
course the H stands for you know the
first and the only parameter that's
coming in on the other hand if you look
at language like Scala you would
similarly write a lambda but in this
case you would you may potentially get
multiple parameters but you use an
underscore for that in fact in the case
of Scala you could even use underscore
multiple times and in this case you
could even do something like like that
if that makes sense in the context and
this would be where you're receiving one
but not not one but two arguments to the
language or to the lambda I have to say
the jury is still out on it I've only
seen two kinds of JA Scala programmers
those who love this and those who hate
this there is nobody in between I think
so and and it turns out the people who
hate it are more than the people who
love it also so this is a little hard
for programmers to get used to it but
Java is still not sure Java in the case
of Java the jury is still out
I think they're sitting there and
debating a group of people saying this
is awesome and the other group saying
are you out of your mind
so they want to take the time to decide
well they take the time to decide
whether they want to do something like
this in Java or not they wanted to take
a dips on that variable so in Java eight
the underscore was made as a warning
if you had a code where you used
underscore you'll get a warning in Java
8 but now that turns into an error in
Java 9 so for example if I said equal to
4 right here and then if I wanted to put
put the output now why in the first
place I used the underscore for defining
4 because we cannot we can all agree
that makes the code so much more
readable isn't it so as a result we want
to use these kinds of beautiful syntax
so but when I run this code you notice
it gives you an error it says a release
9 underscore is a keyword and may not be
used as an identifier and so they don't
want to use it so what is the answer the
other day I was talking to a programmer
and he was quite content with that he
said hey that's not a problem if they
will not allow me to use underscore I'll
use two of them No
so this is not a good idea and the next
thing you know there are programmers
doing this and all guys like me have a
really hard trouble because now I have
to start counting the number of
underscores I mean if your goal is to
make your code unreadable I mean there
are several ways to do it still don't
use this means so the point really is
this is not a good idea
and clearly in this case you can see
that the language doesn't really bother
if you do this but other stuff I should
really do that and what did it put
console dot log bad things happen when
you do that ok so you can see that it's
the real output right there and I'm
gonna even try to put that in there and
see that's ok so don't go there
definitely
so the point really is that underscore
is no longer available and so what is
the answer the answer is give it a
respectable name for it whatever that
meant give a good name for it and then
use that name and and be happy with it
no need to make the code really cryptic
after all so no underscore well that's
great so far but let's talk about Java
eight one more time well in Java 8 I
absolutely have to tell you that I love
streams you probably know this already I
just enjoy using streams but when it
comes to streams let's say we have a
collection of values to work with so in
this case I'm going to say integer will
call it as numbers is equal to arrays
start as lists and in this case we'll
say I have 11 I have a 32 let's say a 12
may be a 54 may be a 67 and 81 and then
sixteen and then let's say you know what
twelve alright a fifteen well maybe what
I want to do is I'm gonna say print only
values greater than let's say 55 well
how would I print only values greater
than 55 I can say numbers start stream
and then I could say filter given an
element element greater than 55 and then
I could say for each and system dot out
and I can simply ask to print that value
well well that's really easy to do what
it really happens in the case is the
filter operation it gave us the 67 it
gave us the 81 it did not give us
anything afterwards because those are
not really greater than 55 but it picked
up every single value and decided
whether to take it or not so here's a
way you can think of a filter think of a
filter as a flap which we'll be doing
this back and forth back and forth so a
flap may open and close and open and
close it may stay open for a little bit
closed for a little bit I can go back
and forth so a filter is like a flap so
when an object comes in it can either
let it go or when object comes in it may
block that object and drop it and then
maybe let the next value go through our
block the next one it can go back and
forth this has been around in Java eight
which is really nice but there's one
deficiency in Java
eight however well what is the
deficiency let's step back for a second
in the case of this one we had a method
called limit and the limit will tell you
how many values go through so I can say
a limit to for example if I said limit
do it only allows me to let two values
go through this is already in Java
eight similarly there's a method called
the Skip and the Skip method will remove
two values and let the other values go
through notice it started with 12
because we skipped two things again
that's available in Java 8 so Java 8
gave us methods like filter and then on
the other hand methods like you know
limit and the methods like skip while if
you look at this there's a disparity
here if you looked at the filter
what is the filter do the further took a
predicate and and that's basically how
the filter worked it took a predicate on
the other hand unfortunately limit took
a count and and the skipper took account
of so a number well wait a minute though
what if I want to limit not on a fixed
number but what I want to limit based on
a condition so in other words if I want
to say go ahead and keep bringing values
for me but the minute you see a value
that doesn't meet your condition don't
off the switch and stay turned off so
the way this limit can work is it'll
stay open but I've been a condition is
met it closes and never to open again
that would be really cool isn't it
well one way to have done that is we
could have said limit a limit while but
if they called it limit while they would
have been consistent with limit and in
software development we should never be
consistent so they said we call it take
wild because that's so much better so
we'll call it take well and in this case
we will say given an element will say
element is less than 55 well notice in
this case we're going to take less than
55 so this is going to be less than 55
less than 55 we keep going but 67 is not
less than 55 turn off the switch
close the gate never letting anything go
after this so the last member is going
to be 54 and nothing after would ever
show up because you close the ditch at
that close the gates at the door and and
went away so that is take one
similarly remember you have a skip over
here would let's say value of four this
will drop the four values or skip the
four values and then give you all the
other values starting from sixty-seven
likewise you have what is called a skip
while but they could not call it skip
while because they'll be punished for
being consistent so they called it drop
while that's really really nice so in
this case you say given a value e.e less
than fifty five will drop everything
less than fifty five and bring
everything else after that so that is
basically the take while and drop while
which are the cousins of limit and skip
except that they are condition based
rather than a fixed value based I don't
have to tell you that I'm really happy
for these functions because there are a
lot of times I would be writing code and
streams and I would suddenly realize oh
my gosh I want to break out of my loop
but there's no real good way to break
out of the loop and that becomes really
hard this gives a nice way to break out
of your loop are to continue at the
proper point so in other words take well
and drop while are really you were
continue and break a equivalence in
imperative style of programming where
take while is equivalent to break and
skip is skip Boyle or drop while is
equivalent to continue so these are
extremely important functions that make
our life a lot easier without these it
was really hard to program with the
functional style and I'm really glad
that that's been added to the language
so definitely a really good welcome
addition to the language so this is
another improvement we talked about now
the next thing I want to talk about here
is when I talk to people who are doing
improv the style of programming I often
encourage them to move towards the more
functional style of programming so this
is Java 8 again one more time Tom and I
introduced a qilin and skipper drop
while but in this case going back to
Java 8 I can do the following I can say
far in I equal to zero I less than 5 I
plus plus and then I can simply output I
right here well in this case as you can
see that's a traditional for loop we
wrote
well the equivalent of this in Java 8's
I can take this one and say I want to
use a stream in this case we would say
in the stream into stream dart
range from 0 through 5 and then I could
say over here for each and in the each
of course will simply say system dot out
and we will go ahead and print out this
particular value from our expression
well the output is exactly the same as
the other one well this is a much more
civilized way of writing this this is in
Java 8 I'll try
but what if I had a less than are equal
to in the case of a traditional for loop
if you had a less than or equal to this
will be range closed
rather than being range close range
itself so arranged closed will include
the last value whereas range will not so
if you put a range it stops one shy if
you put a range closed it also includes
that value maybe you are helping a
colleague of viewers who writes program
in imperative style and eats imperative
style for breakfast and you're trying to
convince your colleague to start writing
code in the style but you know how
sometimes people are not really that
convinced and your colleague comes to
you and says oh yeah so how do you do
the following I equal to I plus two and
you're gonna say you win and you're
gonna walk away because in Java
eight this is not really easy to do and
even if you try to do this after you are
done you will still have to face your
colleagues that's not going to be really
fun at all
so you kind of say yeah you're right go
be go be happy write in a parody style
well thankfully that has changed in job
and nine before I talk about Java nine I
want to just quickly remind you stream
that Ito rate is available already in
Java eight stream iterate in Java eight
will take an initial value and then
after that it will take a lambda which
will keep on producing the next value in
the chain whatever that you want to do
so this Internet is already available in
Java Java 8 but in Java nine you have
something even better so in Java
nine you can say in the stream and and
before I talk about this iterate method
I want to emphasize one thing I'm a huge
fan of api's that are intuitive I I
really love ApS are intuitive because
when ap is intuitive I quietly calmly
sit down and program when ap is not
intuitive I'm forced to read the
documentation and a lot of times the
documentation only irritates me even
further I want really things to be
absolutely clear when I look at it so
let's talk about how clear and simple
this could be when you look at this this
an initial value that we call as a seed
value so you put a zero now take a look
at this closely for a second what are we
doing given a value I you are telling
whether you have hit the limit or you
have not hit the limit in other words
that result of the highlighted piece of
code is a true or a false Tara we know
exactly what that is in functional style
in the function package that's called a
predicate well there you go you figured
out what you really need
that's a predicate so given a variable I
tell me I is less than or equal to five
that becomes your predicate and as a
result you turn that little boolean
expression into a predicate lambda
expression in your iterate method then
you take a look at this part right here
what does that look like given a value
you return yet another value and you
know exactly what that is
that's called a function functional
interface tada that's exactly what we're
gonna use a function so you simply say
given an i I wanted to turn an i plus
two so you replace the equals with the
dash and you got what you really want
and then you say dot for each and then
of course in this case system system dot
out and then print line I really
appreciate what they have done here is
they've made the code so easy to
understand and intuitive so this is an
example of how you can do a looping with
the iterate and that makes a life lot
easier well and and while we're on this
topic there is one small improvement you
can also do you know that this part is
extremely critical sometimes you may
increment sometimes you may decrement
sometimes you may step over by seven
sometimes may decrement by four whatever
you do it's perfectly fine you can do a
plus three if you wanted to or a - you
know but - and so on you can do that
however you also notice that in this
case this actually is already done in
Java and you don't have to put it right
here so what you could do is you can
remove this so in other words the ether
rate is overloaded so the iterate is
overloaded where you specify a seed
value all the time then you specify
either a predicate and a function or
just a function if you want to only give
a function then replace this with the
limit and in this case of course you can
put a limit on it or you can also
replace this with the other cousin of
limit which is take wild or you can use
a skip or a drop while you can put all
those combinations of things depending
on what you want to do and so drop while
and so on so you can use those flavors
as well so either use iterate with three
arguments where the first argument is a
seed the second is a predicate a third
is a function or use iterate with two
arguments where the seed and the
function and then use something to limit
or put bounce on your infinite stream
like a limit or a take while or a skip
or a drop while and that way you can
control the looping in in the way you
want it so that gives you a nice little
flavor as to what you want to do so that
is basically an improvement to the
in-stream you can use it without bounds
or you can use it with bounds as well
and as you saw here the bounce is
optional oh talking about optional let's
talk about this other optional that's
available in Java well what is optional
let's step back to Java eight again well
remember effective Java what is
effective Java tell us about this if you
want to return a collection but you have
nothing to return then well return an
empty collection and not know so null is
a smell we want to avoid null as much as
we can and you know you don't want to
return a null pointer null pointers poor
people's they don't really have fun
programming with it so you don't want to
just return a null just return an empty
collection that's what effective Java
said and I think most of us have been
following this really nicely but what is
effective Java say if you want to return
an object but you have nothing really to
return then return you know what
no well unfortunately that's what we've
been doing right you return a null and
that's no fun you get into a null
pointer exception what is wrong with
null pointer exception if you don't
handle it it blows up if you handle it
the code begins to really smell bad and
so there's no real good answer you get
beaten either way you go you're doomed
if you do and you're doomed if you don't
so would it be nice to have a compile
time error to tell you you need to
really maybe check for non-existence of
value that's exactly what is available
in Java 8 with optional so as a result
we can take a list of numbers here for
example numbers start stream and I'm
going to say dart filter give me an
element greater than 5 but find the
first value for me so what is the find
first to say the find first is very
defensive the fine first says you know
what I may not have a first element
period the given collection may be empty
or the given collection may not have any
number greater than 5
in that case sorry I don't have an
answer for you so in this case if you
run this notice you got an optional 6 on
the other hand if you said 50 because
there's no value greater than 50 the
first element that's greater than 50 is
optional empty as you can see so this
only worked in Java 8 which was really
nice but unfortunately optional had a
very few many rough edges so when you
picked up optional there were a few
things that you always said yeah these
could be really better let's talk about
a few rough edges the first question is
how do you get the value out of the
optional well one way to get the value
out of the optional is to use the get
method if you use a get method it gives
you the value
sex but unfortunately if the optional
we're empty what is gorg 8 going to do
get will blow up on your face and that's
no fun at all in fact you look at this
and say wow isn't that what I try to
avoid in the first place so if you go to
the people who wrote this method they
will tell you if there a time machine
they will go back and remove this and
this is one of the most terrible methods
in the JDK so I have a best practice
recommendation for you the best thing I
would like for you would get is forget
so don't even bother it never use it not
a good idea so well then what Crudup
could I do
you could use an AR else and then
substitute a value for it if you want
there ok that was there already we could
use that but let's talk about other ways
to process and empty was just non empty
optional well let's go ahead and save
this away so we can easily talk about it
so let's say optional integer over here
and we'll call this as first is equal to
and we'll just save this away into this
optional now that I've saved into an
optional you could have said first dart
over here a first dart is present and
then you could do some work with it so
if it is present you could do this if it
is not present you could maybe say
something else about it saying that it's
not present so that's one way to deal
with it
well that worked really well that's
still an imperative style of code and
you don't want to really do that ok
strike that here is another alternative
you could have done you could have made
this a little bit more functional you
could have said if you could have said
first dart is present how nice that is
and then you can say given a value I
want to output the value E so this works
really nicely but the problem is what if
the value doesn't exist you are kind of
left in in a no-man's land
well how do I deal with it and you kind
of sit there and scratch your head well
there is no way to put a not operation
on this so it kind of feels a little
weird you have to maybe go back to the
imperatives
Tyl after all that is not very pleasant
and maybe one day you sat there and said
wouldn't it be so cool to have if
present or else well why not so you have
an if present
or else method you could actually use
and you can imagine what this is going
to look like this is going to take a
part but it's also gonna take an else
part and as you would imagine the if
part is gonna take a value and do
something with it and we know what that
is something that takes a value into
something with it that's called a
consumer but we also know something that
doesn't take anything and doesn't give
you back anything that is called a
runnable so in this case you want to
just say I don't want anything and in
this case I can output whatever I want
output may be a word nope over here to
say I don't have anything at all to give
you as a response back well in this case
it's if if present or else and I can
tell him what to do in the absence off
it so you can see if present or else
takes an if part and a nice little else
part as well and you can pass those two
parts and deal with it if the value
exists the if part kicks in till the
value doesn't exist the else part kicks
in so that is a very nice little
addition or improvement to the language
JDK of API that's really nice to him so
that is about using the if present or
else but on the other hand let's step
back again and talk about two different
functions that behave a little kind of
differently talk about the map function
of the optional what does the map do it
took me a little while to get a grasp of
map what a map say says if an optional
contains a value so optional let's say
width value is called and then you say
in this case this is our pilot value a
dart map if you call this with a
function let's say F which is going to
take a value and transform it what you
get out of this is an optional with a
value so that's a response you get the
type transformation could happen maybe
the value of type X maybe the F is going
give you an object of why and you may
get a value of y out of this but on the
other hand if you have an optional empty
and you perform a map of X this will
give you an optional empty back to you
except this is optional empty of type X
on the other hand this is optional type
of empty y so you do type transformation
but you continue with an empty so notice
what map did map will so here's a way to
summarize what we just saw here a map
map transforms optional with value moves
does not touch does not touch empty
that's what it really is right when I
said that's not touch it did a type
transformation but it didn't really do
anything with it useful that's the way
map works on optional on on the empty
but on the other hand if you take or
else or else is kind of the opposite of
this
what is our else do our else says if the
value exists you know do not touch
so just just pass it so if a value
exists what is our else do it quietly
gives you the value it doesn't do
anything with it doesn't mess with it
if the optional is empty on the other
hand or what is or else do inject inject
value so in other words the our else
will inject the value if the value
doesn't exist it Valley exists simply
moves it forward if you noticed notice
it to a certain extent these are kind of
like the opposites map will transform
the value but quietly ignore the empty
or else will quietly move the value
forward doing nothing with it but inject
a new value if it's empty but on the
other hand what if I really want to do
the following I want to do the following
where I say if the value exists move it
forward if the value exerted is empty if
the optional is there is empty optional
is empty what do I want to do you inject
a new optional
so in other words here's a way to think
about it in the case of the map the map
is so to say injecting a new optional
when the value exists and doesn't do
anything if it's empty in the case of
this you want kind of the opposite if
the value exists just move it forward if
the value doesn't exist inject a new
optional into my into my hierarchy well
how would I actually do that so that is
exactly the purpose of our instead of
our else so if I say our over here and
if I say our say our else for I'll get a
compilation error because our else for
is a number whereas I'm putting into a
optional I cannot do that but in this
case I'll say R and I will put a
supplier and return optional of let's
say 77 so what's going to happen now if
the value exists you simply get that
value out of this let's output the first
right now so you will notice that when I
output the first it is the value six
it's inside optional if the value does
not exist then I get an optional of 77
so R is to inject an optional and then
you can continue programming with the
optional moving forward in except that
our else will kind of give you a
primitive or whatever the type is
whereas in this case it lets you
continue even forward which is really a
nice thing to do so we talked about if
present or else we talked about our but
there's one other beautiful thing you
can do with optional moving forward and
that is if you take a function will call
it as process so I have a public
function right here called let's call it
as process which is going to take a
stream of integer and in this case I'm
going to case stream right here and all
I'm going to do is take the stream for
each and call system dot out and print
it so this is really nice and how can I
use it well already we can use it as we
can say process and then call number
starts tree
and I can just pass it through and have
it printed that was really nice wasn't
it how well were what I really want to
do is take this collection so I say
numbers dart stream dart filter may be
given an element element greater than 5
and then dart find first now that I have
a value on my hand I want to take this
value and pass it to process so that I
can iterate over the value now you may
look at this and say does this make
sense well I think it does and the
reason it makes sense this this is
saying I'm an iterator how many values
can I iterate a iterative process
oh gosh an iterator may process zero
values one value or any number of values
what about an optional and I feel is a
special case of it an optional may have
zero values or may have one value so
what why shouldn't I iterate over zero
our one value I should be able to do it
but it doesn't matter what you and I
think the compiler says you cannot do
this because you cannot pass an optional
to where a stream as expected so what do
we do well you could do something silly
like this you could first of all figure
out if the value exists here the value
exists
you could then create a stream of that
one value if the value doesn't exist you
can create a stream of no value and then
you can call process that's going to be
looking really ugly why not just simply
do dart stream and be done with it and
that's exactly the whole idea so you can
take a stream sorry take an optional and
convert it as a stream and then it
becomes a iteration over one value if
the value exists what if the value does
not exist I run the code and the
iteration did work and it didn't print
anything because a value doesn't exist
so you can see in this case I'm gonna
output done and when the value is
greater than 5 you can see it printed
the value 6 and done if I put a 50 you
can simply see done being printed
because there's nothing to eat irate
over so you can take an optional and
convert to a stream very nicely and
that's basically yet another thing we
got so that's what I'm gonna stop about
improvements and changes that are in the
language and I would I would say I am
really happy for most of these changes I
think they are really good they they
have improved quite a few things we can
do I'm sure there's more improvements to
come in the future but I think they have
done a fairly decent job in my opinion
so if I were to give the grade I would
say a plus grade really nice changes to
the language I'm pretty happy for what
they provided so far in this case so
that's our improvements and changes now
let's talk about some things that are I
would like to call as auditions so what
are some of the additions to the
language well when it comes to auditions
you know one of the things is we always
want to get get more fluency there is
that's one thing the other thing is we
often have programmers who constantly
complain are not complained but
constantly compare and complain to maybe
if it was me and who constantly compared
to oh oh you could do this in this other
language and and you know when you sit
down and code in Java it doesn't really
help to keep saying this works really in
this other language right and I always
have this feeling when you're coding in
a language talking about this other
language that you used to program in is
like talking to your current girlfriend
our golf boyfriend about your ex that's
not a good thing to do in general it
only makes everybody frustrated
including you and that other person so
in general we shouldn't really salivate
like that and say you know what I'll
just live with what I have right now and
the past is past the future is future in
the current is current but having
accepted though it still is kind of nice
to have this is one thing that gets
really programmers excited right you
show them a little feature and they're
like oh that's so nice to have and I
wished my language had it so we always
do this so it would always say when will
Java have all these other wonderful
features from all these other languages
I'll tell you first of all the goal of
job is never to do what every other
language does actually I do have to tell
you they took Java and they added every
feature from everybody
beautiful language that's out there when
they finished it they renamed clear
Scotland so it's already there right so
if you want everything from every
language go you Scotland be happy with
it but Java says I'm gonna selectively
bring some features I'm not gonna be in
a hurry to bring those and there are
some really good features in other
languages but maybe I don't want those
features right now because it may make
really good sense in those languages
maybe it doesn't make sense in Java to
have it so they've been really I know
I'm not really the word reluctant
they've been selective in bringing
features but one thing I'm really happy
they did bring is a nicety about
creating a collection so if I have a
collection of 1 to 10 right now and I'm
gonna output numbers right here you will
notice that it says 1 to 10 that was a
collection we created but what kind of
collection did we create we had to
really create values in place I don't
want to use dart add dot add dot add
that's kind of boring to do so I don't
want to be verbose and boring so what do
I do
well I can throw these numbers using s
list we've had this for a long time in
Java but unfortunately though is this
immutable oh is it still verbose Oh what
kind of object is it creating so if I
ask for get class over here you will
notice it's actually an ArrayList class
that it created it doesn't matter how
many elements you have notice that if I
had three elements versus 10 elements
versus two elements it doesn't really
matter I got an ArrayList well
thankfully you don't have to do this
moving forward in Java 9 you can say
list dot off one two three four five six
let's say and in this case I have
numbers created as lists off notice the
type in this case is list and now list n
that's a specialized to type but this is
also immutable so if you say numbers
start add and I want to add a seven to
it now when you write this the question
is this will not work but the words this
will not work is a very loaded word what
does it mean well will it give me a
compilation error well the answer is
no of course not because getting a
runtime error is much more fun than
getting a compilation error well it
cannot give you a compilation error in
this case because you you are dealing
with the list which is a traditional
list the compiler really doesn't have
the information to tell you that you are
wrong so it'll wait until you run the
program to tell you but in this case
when I run it it says unsupported
operation exception and then it tells
you that you cannot do this and gives
you an error at this point so that is
immutability but even better when you
look at the class notice it says list n
but I'm going to then go ahead and
remove these few values down to 3 that's
a still list n bring it down to 2 this
time it's a list 2 if you notice not
list n bring it down to 1 value as you
would imagine it's a list 1 and bring it
down to 0 values that becomes a list 0
so there's no list minus 1 ok so the
point really is that it really is a very
specialized collection that it creates
and as a result it can be better in
performance as well so these are very
customized implementations and of course
the question is how many can you
implement well you can try to push the
limits one two three and you can go all
the way up to maybe a value of 10 and I
was able to really put these values and
run the code you can see that it's a
list of n it provided what if I were to
take this and add more values to this
even further and then even further and
then even further at some point you
should say dude you are doing this wrong
so the limit should be our sanity rather
than the compiler so even though people
talk about limits you can try to push it
but you obviously won't go to a very
large value so that shouldn't be a
concern in general I say asking those
questions is a sign of bad design you
don't want to say how many can I have so
that's basically the idea is you can
create a list like this well this is
nice we had a list off in a similar way
you can also create a set off as well so
for example you can go back here and say
a set dart off and you can create let's
say in this case let's say John and
let's say this is going to be a Sarah
and let's go ahead and say we have
another object let's say Tom over here
so this is a sect obviously and we know
that set is unordered and essentially
when you notice the output it's not in
the same sequence
it's an unordered collection you can do
a set-off in a similar way you can ask
for the get class on this and that's
optimization as well so if I don't have
a Tom right here and run this code you
can see that it's a set - likewise along
the same lines you can also create
nicely and this is something I really
like what they have done map dart off I
can say a comma 1 B comma 2 and then
maybe C comma 3 and in this case of
course as you can see we can create a
map with key value pairs given together
which is which is really nice but of
course what if I give a key but I don't
give a value for the very last one this
is even more beautiful you get a
compilation error ok it really got mad
as you can see so you can get
accomplished an error at the point and
tells you you need to give a value and
John will never mind lis tell you right
it throws a big error storm I'm sorry
I won't do this again so that's the best
way to learn so you can actually put
that value then you get an error and you
can deal with it
so the key and value both are required
and as long as you give it that's great
I also noticed that one of the other
things I like is nice little type
inference is kicking in right here which
is also a nice thing to do what if I
said 3.0 right here in this call well
then the type is going to be elevated to
a type that fits into it so you got to
be a little bit careful but hopefully
what your sign on the right side will
get inferred what your assigned on the
left side will help you to infer the
type on the side and deal with that so
so type inference works in more places
in Java now compared to Java 7 so we've
been really going in this direction very
nicely so that is basically what you do
with this nice little off method so um
the next thing of course is about
completable futures well in the case of
completable futures one of the nice
things completely futures as has a two
different little features when you
create when you create a completable
future in the past you could create a
completable future to do some
and if you were in my previous talk I
request you to just be a little have a
little patience with me so I can cover
this for people who may not have had a
chance to look at it so I can create
over here let's say concurrent in this
case I want to bring in a completable
future so I'll say completable future
and in this let's say integer we'll call
it as some kind of a future here let's
actually say dart in this case supply
async and with this let's go ahead and
write a function we'll call it a sample
let's call this as you know Factory our
method that's going to generate the data
well in this of course I can then call
this and say then accept and we can
specify what to do when the data comes
in maybe I just want to print out the
value so out print illan you can do that
print Lin like that or you can say then
run in which case you will just do some
action without the data that you don't
care to receive that can be very useful
with the with the run so in this case of
course this is going to wait for the
Dare to arrive and then it's going to
display the data for you what about the
factory method though well in the case
of it to scary things okay skur factory
method right now is the factory right
now this is going to return an integer
value eventually but what am I going to
output right here well in this example
I'm gonna take some time so I'm gonna
say sleep dart sleep let's say I want to
sleep for about 5 seconds and then I'll
return let's say a value of 42 from here
so that's gonna return that value and
eventually we're gonna print the value
out and be happy with it so when I run
this code what is going to be the output
like well maybe what I'll do here is
just give a sleep to wait for it so that
it can be displayed and we can take a
look at the value as an output well
that's my little code to work with this
completable future but it turns out what
if this value this particular call is
never going to complete or it's not
going to complete in a very very very
long time well if it's not going to
complete in a very long time this would
end up being a waste waiting for the
events to happen maybe you want to know
that things are never going to happen
there are two things you can actually do
about this one is you can save away this
one into a completable future of integer
right here so I'm gonna put it into a
completely future of integer and then
let's go ahead and call this as let's
say future is equal to and and then
we'll come here and say future dot but
while I'm waiting for that one I can say
future over here so this is a future if
you future there we go
so given this future what I can do is I
can say future dart and in this case we
can say complete on time out well this
gives a way for you to declare the win
and say I'm gonna send a minus one after
maybe only about two seconds and this is
time unit dart seconds so you can ask it
to bail out with that value only after
about two second delay if the process
finish really fast you will get the
result if the process did not finish
really fast you will get the minus one
and you can move on so that's basically
what this is going to do but of course
if a value successful or the completable
failed already you'll get the failure
and not your time out at the point so
right there is minus one this is useful
to feed some you know premature value to
close and move on on the other hand if
you really want this to fail rather than
continue this way what you can do is you
can go back to the completable future
you can do this while you build it out
afterwards and in this case what you
will do is simply say dot our our you
can say a time out so you can ask it to
time out with up time so you can say to
comma our time unit dart seconds so in
this case you can ask it to timeout at a
certain time now clearly in this case
it'll generate a exception you would
have to then handle the exception down
below using exceptionally and things
like that but this allows you to timeout
also as an error rather than giving in a
dummy data to deal with so that is one
thing they provide
with a completable future the other
thing that's available which is also
pretty neat with this is the ability to
copy completable futures and what copy
allows you to do is you can take a
particular completable future and you
make a copy of it and then you can
execute them at the same time so this
can I love you to take certain
algorithms and create a branch in the
algorithm and execute different parts
and see how they behave and of course
you can deal with them the parts
completing separately versus the
originals completing and you can play
with it then the next thing that is
pretty interesting to have in here is a
is a stock not a stock a stack Walker
yes stack Walker so what does the stack
Walker do well imagine you are dealing
with exceptions remember how we always
complained that exceptions exception
stack is really really huge well there's
a good news it's really huge
but you can now process it using the
streams API so it doesn't feel that bad
anymore right so if you want to really
go through the call stack and process it
you can do filters and maps and reduce
and stuff like that you can take a call
stack and you can apply a stream
operation on it and then you can walk
through it very nicely so take a look at
stock a stack Walker if you are somebody
who has to deal with a stack trace day
in and day out there is some kind of
relief for you and you can use that one
of the features I really like as an
addition is J shell so what is J shell
well J shell is a pretty amazing tool in
my opinion and what I like about J shell
is it's a ripple that you can use I'm a
huge fan of ripples almost any language
that you care to use today has a ripple
for example node is a ripple for
JavaScript you can say 2 plus 3 right
here or console hi and you can see that
work right there that's a ripple for
JavaScript similarly you have a scar a
scholar a ripple and of course in
scholar ripple you can say print
let's say you know hello and that is
Scala working right there
so that's Carla's Ripple this is Haskell
triple if you want to you can say add a
B is equal to a plus B and you can call
add one and and three or two you can get
the result of three almost any language
has a ripple well I really like ripple a
lot and the reason I like ripple is I
consider ripples to be this is of course
stands for read evaluate print loop it
reads what you type evaluates it prints
it and loops over why should we care
about it one of the reasons I really
like about repple is it is a facilitates
what I like to call as a fine-grained
incremental development now I'm a big
fan of automatic testing I'm a big fan
of writing unit tests
I write test write code write test write
code write this write code but even then
I think that cycle is too slow for me I
have a test that's failing I've got to
make it pass but when I look at the code
I'm like huh wonder what what kind of
functions I can put together here well I
don't want to really think about it
write it and watch the test to fail even
that's relatively fast that's still in
and order magnitudes really slow but
instead what I normally do when a
program in these languages is I flip
over to the repple try out a little
experiment a little code can you imagine
where this can be really powerful
imagine you're working with the spring
application we imagine you're working
with the web application and you can
inject you ourselves into that
environment using a ripple and now you
are interacting with your server-side
data and you can start really querying
for things this is like you are given a
power to you know minimize yourselves
with a micro-level and then inject your
salts and you're able to see the world
around you
that's awesome power right it's like
taking debugging to the next whole level
in my opinion so you can sit there and
play with the environment I know this
quite often when I programming languages
that have ripple and I've really done
this for several years I was working
with a developer not too long ago and
and he said how I wonder how would this
be and I said weren't you try this in
the dipole and he said yeah I should
really start using the ripple more often
because this is a habit we develop over
time so it's a micro
incremental development that's really
nice it's nice to prototype a little
little examples you can play with it
it's a great experimentation tool and
it's also a really good learning tool
when I teach my students of our
different languages it gets tiring if
you have to set up projects by the time
you set a project you forgot what you
have been there for well you open up a
ripple type in a few examples and I
would just you know save that as a
script and send them and say go try it
on your machine they can open either a
pool and play with it all so that
becomes really really easy so the first
thing I want to show you is how do you
start the ripple to start the ripple you
will type J shell and in this case that
brings up the repple one of the things I
learned very quickly is when I get in
somewhere I learned how to get out so
ctrl D game brings you out that's one
way to really exit there is also another
way to exit you bring into the shell if
you want to exit you can do ctrl D and
get out very quickly but maybe it's a
very slow day at the office
maybe there is nobody and you feel
really lonely then you can type exit it
will even say goodbye to you which is
really nice so you can use either of
those more depending on your mood right
if I want to really get my work done and
going or did ctrl D before and I have a
conversation with Jay shell also it
slash exit but this also tells you one
other thing when I bring up Jay shell
you know sometimes you have this right
you you have somebody asking you
question they are talking on the phone
they are asking you question they're
talking on phone at some point you're
confused you're like are you talking to
me or on the phone well that's exactly
the problem here when you're typing
something are you typing that to Java
the JVM or are you typing it to Jay Chou
well if I type something here 2 plus 3
that is 2 the JVM if I type slash over
here and help that is to the Jay shell
so slash is commands for Jay shell
without slash you're sending commands to
the JVM here's another beautiful thing
you can do here if you ever had to teach
Java to somebody remember that that
fateful day they came to you and say yes
Java EC you said Oh Java is simple don't
worry about it
can you teach me something simple how
about teach you hello world and they're
taking a piece of paper and say yes I
want to learn
word you said let me show you hello
world and what did you do first you went
to the editor for them and the first
thing you did was you said public and
their hands goes up and says what's
public you tell them you don't need to
know that right now they take notes
public no need to know that right now
then you set class they say excuse me
what's a class oh you don't need to know
that right now then they say class no
need to it right now then you said hello
world and and there's a glimmer of hope
in their eyes they're like finally and
then you put a curly bracket and they're
like okay what does that mean then you
said public they immediately a very
smart student they look up their notes
public I know that no need to know that
right now then you sit starting and they
lost they completely lost it and they
ask you is static also something that I
don't need to know that right now and
that is a lot of baggage on our
shoulders isn't it well we don't have to
do this we can simply say system dot out
dot print learn and I'm gonna say hello
and isn't that beautiful and for the
first time ever Java with no semicolons
this is awesome
this is amazing isn't it so you can just
type that little snippet and you can let
it run you kind of even wonder right I
mean the other day I was writing code in
Java and the compiler said you are
missing a semicolon and I had this
argument I said I'm not missing it
really you see and the point really is I
don't want to be doing all the stupid
things I don't have to do thread darts
sleep 5,000 I'm sure you've had this
nightmare right you are you are trying
to call stated sleep and the compiler
says you will handle the exception and
you spend a sleepless night thinking
what do I do with this exception now
well you don't have to just call the
sleep five seconds later you get the
response back as you can see that works
really well also so this shows you how
you can remove some of the sory morning
of course if you're gonna write a method
you'd have to bring in the semicolons
and the necessary try blocks because the
methods that you write have to be
complete in the syntax and also we can
take these methods and bring it over to
code and that can be very useful so we
went in and tried a little hello over
there these are called the snippets of
code and we can try different snippets
for example I can say
4+3 here to get the value of seven I can
deal with that really nicely it even
saves it away into a variable which is
dollar four so dollar four plus twelve
right now is 19 as you can see that's 12
plus 7 which is 19 so you get that value
really nicely also so you can use those
kinds of expressions and then we talked
about exiting also but here comes the
charm you can use the up arrow and the
down arrow back and forth and you can
reevaluate the things you already wrote
so you can use the up and down arrows
and then similar if you want to go to
the beginning of this you can do control
a you want to go to the end of it you
can do ctrl e if you want to go to the
other words you can navigate in other
words I simply blindly started typing
things I'm already familiar with in the
command line and almost everything
worked here as well so that's one of the
nice things is all those things really
work nicely so you can do that and then
of course here's a control you to get
rid of it and and I'm a person who could
like to keep things clear in front of me
I have this habit of typing control L
all the time to clear my screen and that
works also really nicely control L to
clear your window that can be really
powerful so you can use the up arrow
down arrow control a control e and then
comes along something really really
exciting let's say I create a string
greet is equal to let's say hello and of
course I want I'd greet right here but
remember how some developers tell you
they love I des because in the IDE you
put a dart and before it could blink
your eyes it would oh here you could do
that's really interesting isn't it so
you can get a list of methods as well
well you can just do that very nicely or
you can say concat type minimally and
hit the temp and then something even
more beautiful you type the tab and then
you type it one more time it even gives
you the Javadoc
can you believe it I literally cried
that day when I saw this this is like
this amazing so I I'm in when I'm on the
flight I don't have to go look for stuff
I can put a dot and see that right here
I don't need to use as you know IDE if I
don't want to I can just look at it
right here
so that's really nice as well and you
can take a look at the beautiful
capability just double down - a double
tab rather this is the documentation for
it - which is really nice
what if I wanted to repeat a command I
just typed so for example if I want to
type over here let's say hello well I
did type hello but I want to repeat it
I remember slash as a command to the J
shell 1 I'm asking you to type the
command 1 that was whatever the command
1 was and apparently that was 2 plus 3
or I can type this over here and say
slash bang and that is saying execute
the previous command so this is much
like you were UNIX environment where you
can put a bang bang and run the previous
command in this case a slash bang
executes the previous command for you
and you can use that so that's a nice
way - n is to go execute that many
commands further out so - 3 is the third
command moving backward from here
similarly you can look for your current
imports so you can say imports and see
what imports are already loaded if you
want to really use your own environment
obviously you have your own classes you
have your own stuff and you want to be
able to look at those when you start J
shell use - - class - path not class
path class - Pat and when you say clams
plan star - path you can load those
classes in your class path for glacial
to be using then you can start querying
your own classes import them and use
them or you can set up a script which
will import them ahead of time you don't
do it you don't have to manually type it
then well but if you don't do any
changes
these are the default things available
which is good and bad in my opinion what
is good they said you will give you util
for free which makes sense have you ever
written code without using util most of
the time we use it nice welcome io mat
ok net yeah maybe they think concurrent
is needed this is the one that really
surprises me they think that we need to
have reg X all the time but anyway you
can have that and you can deal with it
that's available for free you don't have
to be really do import that's nicely
available and you can use it if that's
what you want to do so that's your
important you can do a list
didn't save which is really nice to find
a listing of all the source you wrote so
you can say list over here and that's
all the code we wrote similarly can do a
save and put it into a file name and so
after you type all of this and play with
that you can dump into a file similarly
if you already have things in your file
you can just open it and execute it
right so you can load it as well which
is really nice I want to know what
variables I have in my Corp so far we
will tell you what your variables are I
don't know if you remember but I define
greet and that's there and the other
internal variables it created you can
also do var if you want to do it's the
same thing
similarly M for all the methods you have
similarly T for all the types or classes
that you have had you written a class my
class over here and now you say T you
can see my class is appearing right
there so that tells you what types you
have interfaces classes and stuff like
that but one of the really cool things
about this is not only can you add these
things but you can also do a couple of
other really exciting things so for
example I have great over here and I
want to change it to high for example I
can change it this way but you can also
do something a little different you can
do a slash edit and then you can put
greet right here and it opens up this
beautiful little if it you know what we
call it a display and you can just go in
here and change this to some other value
right here and then when you're done
with it you can click on accept you can
quit on it and then you can ask for what
greet is isn't that cute that has that
value right there why is this something
you should do well if I want to do a not
a exit but edit well I can just do I
edit without anything as you can see
then it actually gives you a lot more
broader scope of things as well which is
really powerful so if you want to
quickly make some changes or put a
little bit more multi-line functions
it's a little I know hard to do this on
the command line you can open up this
type multiple lines on it then click a
save and it accepts it so this can be
very very powerful way to really make
those changes so slash edit gives you
that little thing to play with as well
so you're not confined to just the
command-line available to you what are
the other real beautiful things I
already talked about semicolon try and
throw well the drop is a really
phenomenal function so V tells you all
these things I'm gonna drop dollar eight
over here and I drop the variable now if
you look at the variables you don't have
eight over here you can drop all kinds
of stuff so I have a class called my
class drop my class and in this case I
drop the class no longer present so you
can drop them from your environment as
well well what if I said void foo and in
this case I'm gonna say output a fool
called and then of course in this I'm
going to call a function called bar
semicolons are required and I'm gonna
close it well you know very well we
don't have a bar so it gives you a
little warning it says created method
foo however it cannot be invoked until
bar is declared
you know how programmers are when you
say you cannot call it they want to call
it so what is gonna happen if you call
it it says I told you don't call it
right so attempted to call foo which
cannot be invoked until method bar is
declared so that's what it tells you now
I'm going to create a bar method in this
case of course I'm gonna output a bar
and then of course I'm gonna close it
now bar is available now I can call foo
and that called the bar but then you
come along and say aha
I'm gonna drop bar and maybe the
jeschill is sitting and shaking its head
right now it's like what are you doing
but then I call foo it says big here we
go again
you're not supposed to do this so you
can drop stuff you can put them back
there's a nice little experimentation
environment it's it's it's a playground
isn't it this is when Java is actually
kind to you and just have a good time
playing with it and you say is it ok if
I don't use some icon and it says we are
just having a good time keep going and
then you can play with it so that's
basically what this is doing it gives
you that ability to just be playful and
tries write write some code there are a
few limitations of course you have to
run into up from time to time you will
cut off a run of
but don't be too unhappy with it for
example J shell doesn't really care
about final so if you try to do final
let's say in a equal to 4 J shell says I
thought we were having a friendly
conversation here now you're trying to
use legal terms on me don't do that so
it doesn't want you to do anything
really strict and you know a really
formal just kind of play with it be
happy so there are a few little
restrictions that you have in this case
and we started finding variables you can
also infer the variable using a really
good shortcut key which is called a
fixed shortcut key in this case it's
kind of like what you do in editors like
IntelliJ you define a expression you
press that key it'll fill in the pipe
and a give an opportunity for you to
define a variable name you can try to
find variables as well really nicely and
then of course you can define it as a
different type also because remember
this is just an experimentation area you
can define methods we saw that you can
redefine methods you can define classes
you can define interfaces to find the
methods find the types you saw me do all
of that we did it forward reference also
remember I call foo without defining bar
so I was able to call call bar in it you
can also look for history what should
have just been history and list list is
a listing of your source code history is
every interaction you had with the J
shell environment so if I say history
over here notice that it's a drop and
the bar and everything sitting there
list will contain only the code of
course so you can look at both of those
and look at whatever you want to look at
in terms of looking into it like I
mentioned earlier I really have to tell
you that I love J shell it is one of my
favorite tools I like to really get
instant feedback and play with things
and I'm just experimental in nature
that's just the way I'm wired so this is
a tool that I really definitely like
I've used ripples in a lot of other
languages and as a result I like ripple
in Java also some really happy that they
they have that in Java 9 well that takes
us to the end of the second part in here
we talked about the improvements and
changes we talked about the additions
now we want to talk about the last
category here which is the advanced
as I would like to call it and in that
area I'm going to pretty much talk about
one big elephant in the room which is
modularization now modernization is a
very key feature in Java 9 maybe the
most disruptive feature and here's my
take on modernization modernization is
like parenting children never appreciate
you when you are parenting them and they
eventually come back 4 years and say
you're not that bad thank you and that's
the way we're gonna feel about it that's
my optimistic mind telling me we're
gonna kick and scream and complain about
modernization now but in the longer and
when the dust settles I think we'll be
thankful that we have this so we got to
talk about marginalization but I think
we should do that in the next module if
you don't mind so why don't we take a
short 10-minute break when we come back
we'll continue with modularization after
that thank you
all right thanks for coming back let's
get started with the second part here
we're going to talk about modularization
let's talk a little bit about the
problem we are trying to solve and how
modulation can help us with that but
before we talk about it let's talk about
something we've seen in the past well
we've had solutions like OSGi available
in the past I have used Royce di I've
really liked it
os di is extremely ambitious it does a
lot of things Java modularization does
not do enough of what OASDI does so it's
a very small part that motorisation
actually solves in that sense Java
Nine's motorization is not ambitious
it is rather very practical and
pragmatic they want to take one problem
and find a fairly good solution to that
problem or our small set of problems
then trying to make something work for a
lot of different combinations and
possibilities so so the objectives and
the goals were extremely different but
what are some of the problems we deal
with the very first problem is the jar
sizes does anyone remember the size of
our T dot jar there you go still
counting right so that's 68 Meg's in
size that's a big big jar raise your
hand if you you swing okay very few
people right but the rest of us don't
worry about it you have it with you and
if you ever need it never worry about it
right it's there you can reach and
that's like saying you got to carry
these three bags on your trip what are
these three bags don't ask the question
just take it with you right that's how
it feels
you got everything bundled up together
whether you want it or not and you just
keep lugging it around and that's
basically what we have been doing is
this manola take big blob you've been
carrying with us there is a lack of
clarity of dependency what does your
code depend on and there's a little gulp
ants like well let me see let me find
out the other day somebody told me hey
don't you think you can find this using
maven
and it reminded him nobody uses mavin
mavin uses you so it's something you
have to keep in mind right so it drags
you in beats you down and says sit down
now and then you start using it well but
I also keep in mind whether it's mavin
are Gradle or any tools that you use a
gain of greater self falls back on a lot
of mainland repositories to get the
details but the point really is it
doesn't matter what tools that you would
use all of those are compile-time
dependencies what about run time
dependency well the short answer is
there is not a whole lot to deal with
that information we are pretty much
lacking in that area the other problem
is public is too open
you write something and say hey don't
use this please and then people start
using it it's like I told you not to use
it but you said please so I kind of took
the liberty well but public is to open
what if we want to create something but
very much clearly dictate permissions us
to use it or not that would be really
nice and the last thing is how does the
classpath behave in the classpath you
have two options you have a fail late or
fail early which one you think is better
fail later fail fail early fail early is
better right fail fast is better well
imagine you leave the room without the
keys it would be nice if you can know
that you left without the key by the
time you leave the room then walk you
know three kilometers and then find out
you forgot the key back in the office
that would be really painful well in the
same way let's say you deploy your
application it runs for five days and
that on that fateful afternoon the user
hits a feature and that's when the
classpath bunks on you and and I always
feel like Java when you compile Java and
start running it Java looks at your
class path and says oh this is going to
be fun and it's just waiting for you to
fail eventually right that's not really
fun at all because you would rather know
that this is now going to work when you
start then to be known later on that
this is not going to work so fail fast
is very important we're gonna see this
all in a little bit and see how this can
work so this brings us to the so-called
modularization technique but one of the
really beautiful things about this is
packages now go into modules but what's
really cool about this is that the JDK
itself has been modular rights how many
modules do you have in the JDK well
let's find out
so I'm gonna go back over here to the
command prompt right here and in the
command prompt I'm gonna ask the
question let's kind of break bring this
out so in the command front I'm gonna
ask the question Java and I'm gonna say
list modules list modules tells me all
the modules that's available for you in
Java
here we go boom and that's all the
modules how many are there well let's
take a look at it that's how many there
are that one little orchid our jar well
one big our tada jar we saw has been
broken down into all of these things
let's see what are the some of the
things we have we have Java dot
activation we have Java dart base Java
dot base is one of the most important
things this is a while where your java
lines and stuff like that are contained
then there is java dot compiler and
there's java dot core it never goes away
okay so you can see that all these
things are sitting there and you can see
all these modules and how many are there
well you can see if you notice wc- l my
gosh 94 modules in this case so keep
that in mind 94 module sitting in there
that's how our JDK has been broken down
into all those modules well some rules
the first rule is no cycles at compile
time the every single module depends on
one module which is Java dot base except
Java broad base itself doesn't depend on
Java copies so every ma other module
depends on Java base and as a result you
have this hierarchy built up in front of
you and you have clear dependency being
specified and you have all these things
with no cycles at compile time so what's
a module a module is a collection of
code packages you know source code while
compiling to bytecode obviously
data and then of course you have
resources and stuff like that
a module has a name a name is simply a
reverse DNS name so make it as unique as
you can so that's a name and then it has
two other things it has usually a
requires and you have exports requires
tells you what you need exports tells
you what you are giving well a couple of
things to keep in mind about exports and
requires and modules so the very first
thing to remember is when it comes to
requires the requires only modules you
always require modules you never require
packages and then when it comes to
exports exports only packages so you
will require modules and you will export
packages it may appear a little strange
in the beginning but once you apply
logic to it it becomes really easy what
your your module contains packages so
you will export packages you would say I
have seven packages I want to give you
three the other four are my business I'm
not going to give it to you so that's
why you export packages but why not
require packages the reason is that's
based on this on the release reuse equal
MC principle the release reuse
equivalency principle says there
everything you use is what you should be
releasing as one bundle not part of it
that would become reusable so you would
not want to really request for parts of
a module you get the entire module so
you give modules you give packages but
you get modules on the other side so
that's just where you are going to build
this and you're gonna have these kinds
of facilities available now given this
of course we are gonna build around
these modules let's take a look at
example of how to build it now before we
do that couple of small important things
the first thing to keep in mind here is
that when it comes to dealing with let's
say Java 8 Java 8 was all about how you
modify your code isn't it well that's
the way Java 8 was built it's all about
how you might you know change your code
how do you design your code that's
whatever it was
all about well that whole game changes
when it comes to Java 9 Java 9 has
modularization has very minimum code
change it's almost all about how you
actually work with code so to make my
life a little easier
I've got a few scripts here from the
command line no belts and results no
other tools purely Java Java C and Java
are we gonna use to build this stuff so
let's get started with a little example
so the first thing I want to do is to
build a module so to build a module
let's first take a look at the code
we're going to create so for this I have
a directory called one underscore
creating modules I'm gonna open up all
the Java files in here and you will
notice that I have a class called
Fibonacci well where is this located
it's located in a package called calm
down agile developer dot util so that's
the name of the package I create comm
dot dot util and then of course it
imports this my helper from this other
package and Fibonacci says excuse me you
will notice that it says well it's
purely Java code nothing really exciting
close that out then comes along helper
interface that's also part of util great
then comes along my helper my helper is
part of impl
and it kind of gives us a wind you will
not want other people to get access to
your impl package directly so we won't
export this well great so i have this my
helper sitting right here and my helper
also has a hidden if you notice we'll
talk about all these and see what we can
do with it later on so that's basically
what we have so far now comes along
one interesting file called the module
info dot java now what is module info
dot Java notice the file name module -
info dot Java if that name looks weird
to you it does definitely YZ weird so
there's only one other file that's as
weird as this which is package info dot
Java package info Java was created or
was introduced a few versions ago in
Java and it contained by far the most
useless information a little package
love documentation model info is not
like that it actually contains some use
something useful
what are you put within the module info
the first thing you put in module info
is module first of all a wait a second
stop right there
module wait a minute well does that mean
module is a keyword so step back to Java
Phi for just a minute what they really
wanted to create was for each and then
string name in names would that that
would have been so beautiful isn't it
but they couldn't do that why because
the problem was what if people are using
for each already they actually found out
a lot of people are using in as a
keyword so this was kind of like gosh
what do we do about it
so they figured out let's put a stupid
colon in here and as a result that's not
a keyword we can use it every time I
type this I go into a corner and cry
because this is not as elegant in fact I
was on the flight yesterday writing some
code and I had inadvertently typed in
that's my deeper inner likings and I say
in and Java says I don't know your
syntax of course you don't know and and
I start coding away after that right so
that's really awkward but you had to do
that that's because the keywords are
significant in languages and as sort of
so they couldn't use it
fast forward to Java Java 8 what did
they want to really do in Java 8 they
wanted to say interface and you have an
interface called util you want to write
a method called foo but the method foo
had to be implemented so you want to say
that you are implementing this method
not abstract but you are implementing
you could have said implemented right
well you cannot do this because I'm sure
somebody has a variable called implement
at some place in the world so what did
they do they were very clever
they said default there's a reason why
they called it default because default
is already a keyword in the sewage
statement so they hijack did and I'm so
happy they use default rather than colon
one more time so I'm happy for that
right
this is really good but the point really
is we are back to square one aren't we
every time the language needs a keyword
you're like gosh
I'm gonna compete with the world of
developers using the keyword now enters
module now what now well thankfully
module is a very interesting variable
module is a keyword only within module
info dot Java if you're using module
anywhere else in the code whatever that
means to you
it doesn't mean this module and that's
one of the nice things
so it's a very contextual keyword rather
than a very broad keyword in your
language so in this case module and I'm
gonna give a name for my module and I
called it as comm dart agile developer
call it whatever you want to call it
with a proper you know the end reverse
DNS oh by the way you cannot put a
number so don't don't play to put a
number into it it doesn't work with
numbers just be little civilized and
give a good name and be happy with it
don't get tricky on it so this is a
module name that's what you're providing
so there are thread there's the module
and then you said calm down idle
developer in this case I'm gonna make
some mistakes as I work on this some of
the mistakes are intentional some of my
mistakes are not intentional I won't
tell you which one is which so in this
case I'm gonna just leave this as a
module for now and notice what I'm
missing I don't have any requires I
don't have any exports well what I could
do here is I could have said requires I
could say Java dot base this is totally
unnecessary
because every single module
automatically requires Java dot base so
you never ever have to say this and
remember have you ever written a program
where you did not include let's say Java
dot util mostly we use it and yet you
have to always say import well
thankfully you don't have to do that for
things like job at our playing days
because things like Java dot Lang or so
you know useful you use that almost all
the time well so absolutely it's going
to be available for you all the time so
you never
have to require so in this case that's
all I created what is this gonna do for
us let's go ahead and compile this code
so up to this point what has been
different only those two lines are
different right
everything else was Java eight code are
Java 7 code or earlier just these two
lines are the only different why does
this module info dot Java go
well back here I have a directory called
comm dot adult developers under which I
have comm as well developer under which
in pull and you told but if you notice
right at this level under the comm agile
developer I have the module info dot
Java so in short the module info sets
are the same level as the beginning of
your package hierarchy so if your
package is called a dot b dot c wherever
that a directory is there put the module
info in that directory so that's where
it sits well with all that said let's
now take a look at how this is going to
work so i'm gonna blow away my output
directory I'm gonna create a EM Lib
directory under output then what am I
going to do then I am going to ask it to
perform the following I'm gonna create a
directory classes compiled Java C minus
D notice no magic all I'm doing is
compiling every single Java file in my
directory including module info dot Java
so all that is just to run Java C but
when you run Java C Java now knows that
special named file called module - judge
a module dot info - info and I put a jar
compile it into util dot jar again
jarring doesn't appear really that
difficult at all
different at all occasionally you can
give a module number to a jar file let
me just get that out of the way by
talking about it right now module info
has no module number has no meaning
whatsoever so module info information
will contain the module version number
the version number is a glorified
timestamp nobody cares about it nobody
uses it so so if you want to put a
module number be happy and put it maybe
in the distant future we may have
use for module numbers right now we
don't so that's basically what we did we
just compiled it
well once we compile it let's actually
compile it make sure it compiles and see
if there are any errors hey good news
there's no errors let's look at the
output directory M Lib there's our util
dot jar sitting a module is just a jar
file but it's not just a jar file it's a
modual file well how do we look at it
how do I know what's in here well to do
this let's take a look at the jar and I
would say in this case minus D minus D
will give me the description of this jar
so I can find out what's in this jar
file so minus D is a useful command so
I'm gonna run the minus D on this and it
tells me my jar is containing a module
called comm dart agile developer it only
tells me that the module contains that
but it also contains a mandated Java
base it also contains an in pull as and
the Narrows contains a util so it tells
me what packages I am holding on in my
module that it tells all so well but I
didn't export anything keep that in mind
for a few minutes so we created this we
requires and exports we quite didn't do
that don't come back to that later now I
want to use this on the other side how
would I go about using this in order to
use this let's go ahead and go to this
second project and play with it this is
going to be using this code so if you
notice right here i have something
called first user the first user is part
of the comm dot agile developer dot user
and in this case what is the benefit we
guard out of this well let's talk about
this real quickly when it comes to class
path if I have a package in my in my
class in my jar and I have a package of
you know internal class somebody could
come along and say I got a great idea
they could create a jar with my packages
in it and and then of course they get a
backdoor to talk to my classes and what
does Java do when it sees multiple jars
which have the same packages in it
job alicetin says well these are very
interesting people and that's all it
says right it doesn't really complain
about it well that changes now when you
have modules a module cannot exist in
two jar files in the same directory so
if you have two jar files in the same
directory and if both are saying the
same module name John will give you an
error if you have two different module
path directories but you have jars with
the same modules with the same name in
both it'll take the first one ignore the
second one so you will never have a
conflict in there and a collusion where
you can probably bring in inappropriate
classes and start interfering with this
that that safety is there now you have a
first user main I bring in Fibonacci
with an import code looks exactly the
way we write code in the previous
versions of Java and then of course I
call the Feb up in tada I have a use
helper what am i doing in the use helper
I'm asking for the Fibonacci's helper
which is the helper interface and I'm
printing it out let's leave it at that
we'll come back and see what this is
going to do so now this is called comm
dart agile developer dart user but what
do I want to do I want to create a
module for this so I'm gonna say module
and then I'll say come agile developer
dart first is the name I gave for this
module again no requires no exports at
this time well maybe I could do an
exports who cares
so exports and what am I going to export
right here I'm gonna export the you
tillage that I have with me this guy
this guy saw a user package I have with
me I'm gonna export the dart user ok so
that's all I did
let's go ahead and compile this and see
what it's going to do so if I compile
this now I do a Java C I provide the
minus B that is for the module path not
your class path so going forward we use
module path and we will not use class
path well I'll change that statement a
little bit later during the plate of
transition we may use a class path but
in general we'll use module path then I
say where the destination is compiled
all the files in the underscore
to underscore using modules directory
and once you compile jarred them all up
using first our jar and the main class I
want to use here as the first user so I
put the main class when I compile the
code and then of course I'm gonna blow
away all the all the classes this will
not compile unfortunately why wouldn't
this compile well the reason it will not
compile us in the way this actually
works is think about this as a handshake
I can I may extend my hand that doesn't
mean a handshake happens you have text
in your hand as well for a handshake to
happen so both of us have text in the
hand for handshake to happen so this has
to export this has to require if I did
not export or if you did not require
then there is no handshake well in this
example I did not export my package and
the first Pam module did not require my
module either so there's no hands
involved at all so there's no handshake
so it's gonna fail so when I run this
let's see what it tells us I got an
error let's look at the error
it says package comm a dil-don't for you
tell is declared in the module comm a
july / but module comm agile developer
first does not read it I have to admit
this to you the error messaging is
beautiful it actually is something can I
finally understand usually when you get
an error you call a team of people to
ask you to read it for you and everyone
has an opinion this one kind of spells
it out really nicely right so very
well-written messages I really like what
they have done here so what am I going
to do to look at this well the very
first thing I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna go to the agile developer module
and I'm gonna say exports and I'm going
to export calm down agile developer dot
util I'm gonna export it notice I did
not export the calm Dajjal dot impl impl
is mine to keep I'm not going to give it
out right now but I will export the util
for other people to use so as author of
a package I have exported one package I
have with
the other package as internal to me and
that's what I'm keeping at this point
well that's great so far now on the
other side what I'm going to do here is
I am going well this is not a nerve
right so when I go to compile this core
I still get a compilation error why
because you're not reading it still so
what am I gonna do now I say read well
requires and what am I going to require
in this case comm dot what wrong place
pardon me I'm gonna go to the other
module which is going to be the one we
are going to use in the two so this is
gonna be module info and this is from
the users and what am I going to do with
this module info well with this module
info I'm gonna say requires so requires
and this is gonna be com dart agile
developer that's what I'm gonna require
remember you always require modules you
exports packages so in this case the
first is requiring comm agile developer
and the comm adele de l'opÃ©ra is
exporting util and of course my class
wants to use Yuto
so everybody is in harmony so when I go
back and compile this code in this case
notice that it did not complain anymore
well that's great
no complaint anymore so let's go ahead
and get rid of this information so we
don't see the output but I want to run
the code now so what's gonna happen when
I run it here are two ways to run it
Java minus P give me the module path
minus M which is for module name and
tell me the module name or tell me the
module name slash and the name of the
class you want to run as the main class
so if you don't give me the main class
it uses the main class already kind of
compiled into otherwise you can change
the main class by so notice that in this
case you don't space a the main class
alone you say the module name slash main
class to run it so let's see if that
works so if I go back and run this code
you will notice that it calls the
Fibonacci and it did right there is the
output it also was able to get the
helper and print it out notice it says
my helper because a real class is my
helper even though the interfaces helper
and then of course you can see that it's
a hidden method
I was able to find out it has a hidden
method we'll come back to those and talk
about it I just read ran it second time
and you saw that appear both the times
when we ran it so those are the two ways
to run it I'll remove the one way to run
it so it doesn't appear so noisy so we
can look at the output when we run this
and it displays the Fibonacci value this
plays the helper object and also tells
us what the my helper contains those are
the information we saw so far so what
did we do up to this point we looked at
readability at this point we also did
exports public is not the same anymore
in in this case notice that I have my in
this in the in the code I have so far I
have a class called my helper remember
my helper is public my helper is public
but it is part of the imple package
remember I never exported the IMP imple
package I never gave it the imple
package so what's gonna happen now
because I did not give it the input
package if I go to the first user I got
the helper here as you can see but if I
say over here my helper dart helper in
fact I'm not even gonna do anything more
just put it equal to null as innocent as
status all I'm doing is I'm mentioning
the name of this particular class right
what's gonna happen when I mention the
name it immediately says you shall not
mention such names right so it's it's
unmentionable because it is completely
hidden it is you cannot see it so you
cannot talk to it that's what you just
saw here so you cannot really talk to it
because talk about it because it's
supposed to be things you don't see you
are completely hidden hidden from you
we'll talk about that a little bit more
public plus exports is visible now well
notice how we had our Bonacci class it's
public but it's part of the package
which is you told that was exported so
we are able to access fibonacci public
with no export is not visible and this
is true at compile time and it's true at
run time as well and that
one of the beautiful things about it
notice I go here to this code I am not
accessing my helper now but what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna quietly use
that using reflection so notice I went
to the helper and I said a helper do me
a favor please you are an interface
could you tell me what your class is
yeah yeah I'll tell you my class is my
helper but you're not supposed to know
that it's a string you cannot do much
with it then you say hey you get me your
method called the hidden it says okay
I'll fine I'll give you a method called
hidden you got the method called hidden
well notice when I have the output shown
up here you can see the method hidden
being displayed right here and now
you're like oh this is awesome
let me get this done before anybody
looks at me and then you're gonna say
method dot invoke and Java says I've
been watching you right and it says hey
I this is this is how far I'm gonna let
you go not anymore and slap and back to
your desk now right so that's basically
where you can't do that job so when you
run this now what's gonna happen well at
this point bloom error first user cannot
access class my helper in the module
because module agile developer does not
export impl to the module first that
couldn't be any more descriptive right
really nicely done and they tell you you
cannot access it because you cannot
touch it it's not visible to you you
didn't ask for it they didn't give it to
you well okay so all right let's comment
that out for a minute but before we go
any further I want to show you one more
thing which is extremely valuable and
that is let's go back and run this and
make sure it's all working fine and
notice it worked just fine great but
let's go back here and only grab the
Java command right here put it on the
command prompt directly and that is
working not a problem at all but I
quietly sneak around and I go to the
output directory and I believe
eat util dot jar so I got rid of fetal
dot jar in the world of class path what
will happen in the world of class path
you'll start your program and Java is
just sitting there and chuckling there's
going to be fun let's just wait and
watch
well and then it's gonna crash and burn
later on this is all about fail fast now
notice I got rid of the you till now I
go and run the program with the first an
error during initialization of boot
layer find exception module agile
developer not found it is required by
first this is because the dependency
graph is available at the beginning of
your program every module specifies what
it depends on dependency is so Java is
able to quickly build the difference
dependency graph and verify that all the
members of this graph are available if
any one of them is not available it can
immediately tell you sorry can take off
this is really broken we don't want to
fail mid hair right that's what it's
saying really so so that is already
built in as you can see I'll just go
ahead and rebuild it to regenerate the
util class and things are working again
as you can see so that's what we saw so
far one small detail I want to quickly
talk about is a slight variation if you
go back to your module info and this
module info where is this this one here
here's something you could do notice how
I said exports calmed art a jalopy dot
util well maybe you say exports calm
down agile developer dart I am PL but I
don't want this to be available to the
world of programmers I could say to my
cousin right my cousin only gets this
not everyone else if you want it you
gotta be my cousin too well the point
really is I can specify my module that I
am exporting it to this feature also has
another name it is also fondly known as
bad idea so you know it's
usually not a bright thing to do so
don't do this too often this could be
something you do very rarely if this
reminds you of friend in C++ that also
tells you why this is a bad idea
friends generally are not not a good
idea I mean I'm talking about
programming voice so keep that separate
keep it clean why is this such not a
good idea the reason it's not a good
idea is all of a sudden we are now
introducing coupling to other module
names that can make our things brittle
right so then as you start expanding it
this can become really messy so in
general don't do this if you did this
this my cousin module will get access to
this
I am piell's public stuff but no other
module will get it but in general don't
do that so so let's get rid of that so
that is about export too that's why I
avoided that it's better to not do that
but let's talk now about employed
readability
so to understand employed readability
let's go back to the problem we have at
our hand and understand what's going on
now notice in the first user the first
user says I am using Fibonacci well yeah
sure you can because the agile developer
exported it you are importing it awesome
not a problem but when you look at this
over here this guy has a method called
hand over what does hand over do hand
over says I'll create a Fibonacci and
give it to the caller let's understand
the consequence of this let's say we
have a Bob over here and Bob has a
module we call it as Bob module and Bob
module is going to export the packages
well we here have Sara module and what a
Sara module do Sara module you know
requires Bob's module so that's working
really well now bob has a class called b
sarah has a class called x now what Sara
does is sarah has a function or a method
in class X that
says a get B well look what just
happened
sarah says I am generously taking this
object B and giving it to anybody who
asks for well now I have a let's say in
this case Jane module what does Jane
module do james module says I am going
to require in this case and I'm gonna
require Sarah's module well good news
Jane can use X right so X is available
to Jane because Jane and Sarah are
shaking their hands now at this point
independent of anything right nothing to
do with X if I say newbie this is an
error right why is this an error because
I did not shake Jane did not shake hands
with Bob so you cannot get Bob's class
because you don't require it well so you
cannot do this great but I am going to
then say the following instead of this
I'm gonna say well X well B object B
equals let's say new X dot get B if I do
this now what just happened well I am
accessing B over here but I'm accessing
be using the object X which is allowed
which is legal but when I get B it
returns an object if I said object B
equals new B this is fine this is not a
problem at all Java will not stop you
Java simply says this guy gave you some
object you're holding on to it play with
it that's fine right on the other hand
if he changes to be no we have a problem
because you don't have access to be
directly because you never request it
for it now this can be a bit painful
isn't it let's see what we can do about
this pain so this is the hang handover
method so to understand this let's go to
this third implied readability
let's open up all the Java files in here
here is my second user second user say
I'm gonna use first user hey no problem
this is like the Jane and and the Sara's
class I get the first user how do I use
this stuff very simple my package is
called another so I go to the module and
say module come angel' dart ii so ii is
a my package and i'm going to say
exports and what am i going to export
from here i'm gonna export this another
package i got a do a requires requires
calm agile and this is gonna be you the
first that's the module I'm gonna bring
in so all this is fine so far right we
brought that in we're using first user
everybody should be happy so far so
let's go back over here compile all this
stuff together and run the code so far
now when I run this code you can see it
is going to compile all the code in the
three underscore employee readability
bundle up to do a sec a second jar and
then just call it so when I run this
hopefully it should all work just fine
with no problems at all so let's go
ahead and say build darn Sh and see what
it does well there you go you got the
first user no problem however now I go
back to the code and say hey hey you go
ahead and second user go ahead and ask
for Fibonacci from the first users hand
over this is exactly what we are doing
right this here wants to reach over to
this but through this in other words we
are doing this what's gonna happen now I
got the Fibonacci and then I want to
call the method on it the short answer
is no you cannot do this because you're
not really doing a handshake you have no
direct dependency on it so when I
compile this code you get a compilation
error and the compilation error says
module a jold over second it cannot be
used in this case right here's the error
and it's saying sorry ii does not read
it there are two ways to solve the
problem one way to solve the problem not
a very elegant way is to go to the
second and say requires come agile
developer this is a boring way to do it
if I go back and run the code this time
because I did a requires that is
perfectly fine it worked but that's kind
of boring instead of doing it this way
why is this such a not a good idea the
reason is I didn't really need it
directly I'm using it because first is
giving it to me and I'm using it through
first so rather than having to take this
pain there's another way to solve the
problem and that is let's go to the
module info but this time we go to the
module info of first and here you say I
require agile developer but I'm not
going to require it for me I'm going to
require it for me and everyone that
requires me so I'm being generous here
right I'm not only gonna take it from
you but I'm gonna take it from you and
give it to everybody that is taking
stuff from me to and that you do by
providing before I go further I want to
make sure I removed the other part I
thought I did yes I did let's make sure
the code fails before I fix that and
there it failed okay now let's go back
here and say requires but this becomes
transitive
right so you're making it transitive
transitive means I require this but if
any one requires me it's as if they
require that one so by making it
transitive you have now drawn a
relationship from here all the way up to
here automatically for this so making
this transitive draws this bridge if you
will right so now it's as if this guy
has made a require on this particular
object and so as a result that ties it
down to that right now
so that dependency comes in let's see if
that works so go back and run this now
and you can see in this case oops I did
I save it so so that's got to be
transitive oh you know what wrong place
isn't it it should be in the first not
in the second I was sleeping at the
wheel God God hold up the wrong module
file so let's fix it so I go to the
other module file first there because
that's where I want it to be so that's
going to be transitive
so transitive and now that we made it
let's go back and run the code and
that's what we are doing is going to
bring the access to it okay so we saw
how to make this implied readability
right so this implied readability simply
gives a nice way to take your reads and
make it available for the the modules
that require you let's talk about
reflection and encapsulation and
cancellation says you cannot use what's
public you can only use what is public
and export it either export it to
everybody or exporter to the cousin
right to the specific module so you ask
where it's being exported to that's
basically what you are asking for so to
do this to understand this let's go back
to our code here in the fibonacci class
the Fibonacci class returns get helper
returns helper but what is helper helper
is my helper
well my helper is is public but my X my
helper belongs to you pull and input has
not been exported so for all practical
purposes my helper is hidden you're not
supposed to get to it if you look at my
helper I have a method called
hidden you and you call it it says
hidden method called that's all we have
right now as a result when I go to the
first user in the first user I am going
to get the helper and then I'm going to
print the method then I'm gonna invoke
it and you saw this earlier it gives you
an error so it says sorry you cannot do
this so there are two things to keep in
mind the first thing to keep in mind is
when a class is hidden in this case my
helper is hidden you cannot touch it at
compile time period sorry
end of story go home you cannot touch it
right so if I want to use my helper you
cannot use my helper why because my
helper is hidden it's public but the
package has not been exported so if I
try to cast help her - my helper
we'll get an error let's not even go
here to the invoke yet this is a
compilation error you fail at
compile-time right
it says no you cannot do that it failed
at compile time let's go ahead and go
ahead and comment it out real quick and
compile the code one more time to make
sure it compiles and you can see that it
compiles now so model the story you
cannot touch it at compile time but what
about run time
hey hey wouldn't this be cool I'm going
to say over here a class dart for name
and I'm gonna provide the name of the
class to be able to get to it right so
I'm going to ask you to get me the class
well what is it gonna give you it's
gonna give you a class over here and
this is gonna be class that you get out
of this well but notice this is class
not you were my helper so you even
really tight this to my helper still
this will still work but I cannot still
use it by the name well if I cannot use
it by the name how do I call the methods
on it right
well hmm here's an idea I can go here
and say I have this thing called helper
so why don't I say helper Dart hidden
well not so fast
if you know this helper the interface
helper has an ADD method it is
implemented by my helper
I can call add because add is visible
through the interface the implementation
is going to run it but hidden is not
visible through the interface the code
won't even compile now right because a
code doesn't know what hidden s on the
helper the only way can call hidden is
to cast it to my helper timeout I cannot
cast it because I cannot touch it in the
code compile time hmm all right because
it cannot touch it using the call
compote compile time why not just sneak
around use reflection well I cannot use
reflection either because it's
encapsulated so when I run this code the
code compiles but it fails during
runtime we saw this earlier so that
didn't work
also hmm where do we go from here well
let's step back and understand this if
you want access at compile time exports
the package with me if you export the
package what's going to happen then you
get if you exports you get access at
compile time and as a bonus at runtime
you may argue what's the point in
getting access at compile time if you
cannot access it the runtime right so
make sense however I don't want access
at compile time but I want access at
runtime right it's ok I don't touch it
during compile time but I want access
during one time can you give me that yes
and the way you do this is you go back
to the module info there are two things
you can do in the module in for a moment
the input was part of this is part of
this I can say Oh pen this will open
every single package in your module for
reflection access that what this does if
you put open up there don't do this too
easily right let's see if that works
so go back and run the build and when
you do
did you notice hidden method called
because you opened up access to it I
still cannot touch it during compile
time right because I didn't export it so
during compile time my hands are tied
but you're in runtime I can sneak in and
get it all right one thing no but I
don't want to do that why not because I
have seven packages as an example and I
don't want to export all the second
packages what do i do then well then
opens and I'm gonna say calm agile
developer dart I am PL
so I'm opening just that one package for
access only not everything else
a quick note please notice the word
opens versus the word word Oh pen right
little subtle difference you're all
pulling the module the module opens this
package that's why it's called opens
right so just a little s in the end this
one is a little bit better than putting
open at the module level much better is
not to use it at all right so that's
basically what you can see now that I
removed all of that what is going to
happen in this case of course if I don't
open it then we're going to get into a
compa one-time error because that's no
longer visible and as a result you get
the error so what did we learn in that
part what we learned in this part is the
reflection is closed but you can get
access to reflection by either opening a
module or opens the package so that's a
little way to break through that so far
so good but I got a lot more to talk
about let's talk about service API
service Lord API what is this about well
okay so this all work really well but we
want to really work with interfaces that
are implemented by multiple different
implementations if you want to do that
well how are we going to support this
kind of operation so to understand this
let's go to a slightly different example
here the example we want to go to I'm
gonna make sure this is compiling now
okay the example I want to go into is
going to be this in this example I got a
series of files I want to take a look at
and understand the first thing I want to
show you here is something called rates
let's take a look at rates rates is
going to contain a module info which is
empty rates also contains over here it
also contains a class called vendor an
interface called bender J as a java
vendor dot java is a get name and a get
rate that's what I have here okay that's
an interface this interface is in a
separate module what is the name of the
module
I'm gonna call it as calm a developer
rates so I'm gonna say Marge you come
agile dole operates this exports come a
developer rates right so I just kept the
name same not a big deal
so rates module is gonna export rates
which means vendor is exported awesome
so far so we'll keep it that way the
next thing I want to do here is I have
rates find the rate finder so let's go
ahead and look at the rate finder and
the rate finder also has a module info
we'll come back to that in a minute
but the rate finder also has the class
called rate finder dot Java the rate
finder dot Java says I'm a rate finder
so I'm gonna take grab that put it as a
module name rate finder and what am I
going to export exports rate finder dot
that one now within the way it finder I
have a main function it says query
vendors and I don't know about specific
vendors I don't want to depend on the
specific vendors it's a plug-in
architecture tomorrow you can throw in a
new vendor or you can get rid of the old
vendor right I don't want to change any
module and couple to it so I'm gonna
find out how to get those vendors in
just a few minutes we'll just start with
this baby steps so but one of the other
things I need to do here is I'm gonna
say requires and calm agile developer
dart rates the module that I'm going to
bring in that way I can talk to vendors
notice I need access to vendors after
all here is that this guy so I'm gonna
bring in the require I don't have the
specific modules yet so we'll worry
about it little later on let's go ahead
and do the build on this and see if it
takes us anywhere anywhere at all when I
do the build built on it line number two
is having a trouble on module in foreign
rates let's go ahead and fix it so this
is module info in rates well let's go
ahead and fix it - info and this is
under rates there we go
so line number two is XO exports there
we go so let's go ahead and try this
again so this is going to tell us well I
have a thing called vendor one and
vendor two and I've not really required
those it's toking up that's ok well
sit in just a minute by just removing
the build and we'll come back and add
the build a little later on so what I'm
going to do is let's just go ahead and
comment out all of these will slowly
build this one step at a time so what's
a very first step the first step is I
want to compile my code for the rates
the second step I want to do is I want
to compile all the way down here
I want to compile my rate finder so
let's go ahead and compile that also so
hopefully those two parts will work
properly and produced no no error there
you go so but I don't have any vendors
yet hmm
how am I gonna bring a vendor well the
way I'm gonna bring a vendor is let's go
to vendor one and in the vendor one here
is my vendor one dot java
vendor one says I'm implementing vendor
I'm having a default constructor and my
default constructor simply says vendor
one created so your constructor with no
arguments then get name and get rate
from the vendor you know obviously to
make this work I need to require vendor
module with the vendor so for that I'm
gonna say this is my first vendor so I'm
gonna go to module info module vendor
one that's the name I give for it and
I'm going to say requires and requires
what requires comm agile dart rates so
that way I can get the vendor let's see
if that works so I'm gonna go to the
build file here is my vendor one I want
a compiled vendor one quietly so when a
compiled vendor one now that I have
included the build for it it should be
fairly happy I would think let's make
sure it is actually true and it requires
it actually helps me to type this
properly let's do that so here's my
module info for the vendor one and
requires there we go so try that again
so we compiled vendor one nothing really
special in vendor one yet we'll change
that in a minute
similarly we go to vendor to vendor do
is a little different just to show you
an illustration of a difference this is
going to be module and this is going to
be calm agile vendor two
and this requires also the race however
let's look at vendor to vendor to does
not have a default constructor vendor to
says I got a boolean preferred but
notice I have a static method called
provider
so what java is gonna look for is either
a constructor which takes no arguments
if a constructor doesn't exist like that
it looks for a method called a provider
that's it you don't have to implement
any interfaces for that
it just looks for the word provider it's
a static method everything else is the
same so let's make sure this compiles
too so I go back now to my a build file
and I'm going to compile this also but
when I run this code it is going to be
happy with all these dependencies so
compilation should pass but how do I
actually use this well to understand how
to use this we need a few more details
the very first thing we need is a set of
you know contracts we're gonna use
inversion of control your code says I
need a vendor somebody save able to give
it to you service loader has been around
for a while in Java that's been enhanced
in Java 9 and so the service loader a.p
I say is you first of all use this X
what does that mean uses X well uses X
simply says if you go to the rates
finder in the rates finder you have a
module info in here you say uses come
agile developer rates dart vendor you
tell me what interface you are using so
what does Java do Java will come around
and say hey I saw your dependency
description and you said use this vendor
that means you are a consumer of vendor
so when I find vendors I'll give it to
you right so that's why you said uses
great now the second thing I do is I go
to the Edit vendor 1 module info
and here I'm gonna say provides calm
agile developer a vendor one what is the
name I gave for the vendor one right
here vendor 1 dot vendor 1 width
provides that with come agile developer
rates dart vendor so I'm sorry the other
way around so this is providing this
interface vendor with the class with
what class is it providing with the
vendor one so it provides that with that
class so this again tells Java hey I
have an implementation in my module you
should know and I'm implementing the
vendor interface so the wiring can
happen now so this is on this on the
site similarly I'm going to go ahead and
add it in here vendor 2 dot module info
and I'm gonna say right here provides
but this is going to become vendor 2
right
this is going to become where's that
file so this becomes vendor 2 so let's
okay so this becomes provides this is
vendor with vendor 2 and this is vendor
2 almost there almost there let's make
sure all this is working actually
together but we need to still know how
to bring it in but we'll do that in just
a few minutes so compile it it's still
happy now let's do some fun things this
is purely configuration so what are the
things we did we said uses we said
provide user interface provide interface
with that class implementation why now I
want to go to the service load in the
service loader I am going to now say
let's look at this guy this is the
beauty let's use the service loader to
query all vendors but before this I say
service loader vendor vendors 1 is equal
to service loaded art load vendor dark
class
here comes the charm this does not
create any objects it is lazy evaluation
so at this point notice I just said load
it did not expend any effort to create
these objects so when you look at the
output it still say is querying for all
vendors then I say far vendor vendor
coming from vendors 1 and what am I
going to do here output and output what
are we gonna output at this point vendor
dart get name and similarly I can call
vendor not get price or get rate not a
big deal so when I run this now what
does it do now notice in this example it
printed this and only then it created
vendor 2 printed vendor 2 only then it
created vendor 1 printed vendor 1 that's
how lazy it is right so we can get these
things you say no no no no no I don't
want all the vendors there are several
vendors but I want to cherry-pick the
one I want right now
vendor with a certain flavor how do I do
that well you can do that very easily
also to do that let's get rid of this we
can say vendors 1 again but this time
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
call upon vendors wondered stream this
gives me a provider so I can say dart
filter given a provider I can say
provider dot type this gives you a class
the Big C class once you get a class you
can query whatever you want to query on
the class you can query for name query
for patterns query for annotations you
can do any kind of query on it so if you
know your own annotations you have
created you can see if that vendor are
that particular implementer implements
that particular annotation I'm not going
to work with annotation here so instead
I'm gonna say contains and I'm gonna
look for the word too so in this case
I'm gonna say if you have a do then I
want to talk to you not otherwise
so then what am I going to
dot map I take the provider given to me
and return provider get this is going to
create an object then I say for each
this is gonna be my vendor and I'm gonna
output output what am I gonna output a
vendor dot name so vendor a vendor dot
name get name right so you can query for
things and you can use the provider and
get things also so when I go back and
run this now let's see what it's going
to tell us in this case oh that's not
good so um
it gave us a error on type a get name
isn't it
so type dot get name so because it's a
class and then do the other work so
let's see if that that works so what am
I going to do in this case I get in this
case if it has two when they're two
created not vendor one because vendor 2
is the one with the word two not mentor
one so this gives you an idea about how
you can use a service loader API the
real load is for you to recreate all
your objects so you can say give me a
new fresh objects also and you can load
it so it's a very slow or not slow but a
lazy evaluation which is good I will
have three more topics I want to talk
about in this area well the next is
something really charming which is a
linking custom runtime images I want you
to remember to remind you one thing one
more time when you go back and say Java
- - list modules remember that we had
ninety four modules keep that in mind
well good news
they are modularized bad news they are
still there and if you if you whether
you want korba or not it is just sitting
there right and sometimes it annoys you
it's the go away I'm never gonna use you
right so what can we do well here's an
idea let's go back to one more example
in in this example this is purely about
linking nothing to do with compiling so
I've compiled the code
use the modules already and they're
sitting happily in a directory what can
I do well this one here is purely about
building I blow away the agile developer
directory in this directory I use a
program called the jail link jail link
where is all the modules for Java where
is all my modules and then add modules
agile developer and I add modules agile
developer dot first and output to agile
developer and give me a launch name
called agile developer what does this do
what does this j-link do let's only run
up to this part right here not anymore
so when I go back and run this part
alone notice what just happened well
before I go any further this directly
had only the built now I go run that now
this directory contains the build and
the agile developer going to agile
developer there is a bin directory go
into bin and beautifully you see Java
this is not any Java it is my Java it is
my precious right and you can ask this
Java Java what do you have list modules
word count - l 94 no three I contain
only stuff I need right so this creates
a very targeted custom image in fact if
you ever said I really miss running
programs with clearly defined my own
names
that's your named program welcome to C
programming right so you can create
dedicated executables to moving forward
right and that dedicated executable is
just a binary created that's your Java
you are
yes and as a result you can create a
very small customized distribution and
imagine you don't have to install the
whole boatload of stuff on your systems
you can spin up your servers with
minimal things you care about and
nothing else if you want to put this on
devices if you want to put this on
whatever that you want to put it on
you're just loading essentially what you
care about and nothing else at all
that's your custom image using j-link as
you can see right here so jailing can
create the target image and then you're
able to run it by either by the
application name are able to run it as
java also then you can look at the list
mods
pretty nicely and with that said how do
we go from where we are to over there
well to go there from where we are we
want to talk about transitioning I'm
going to talk about a couple of
different transitioning techniques the
first is I have nothing to do with Java
9 I have Java 8 I'm happily running it I
don't want to really do anything with
Java 9 right now but I just want to
deploy it and see how it runs what you
could do is one thing you could take
your jars and put them into class path
like you do run in class path just like
the old way of doing things no mention
of module path Java run Java 9 put in
the class path what happens it runs like
the way it runs and when it does those
classes belong to what is called unnamed
module remember how when you don't put a
package it gets a default package it's
the same similar thing when you don't
give a module name it becomes an unnamed
module when you're an unnamed module
everything lives in this unnamed module
and they are happily sitting there and
working and it works like the old stuff
not a big deal so you can still do that
that's an initial transition period I
can continue to run with Java 9 and move
forward but I want to recompile my code
want to use modules I want to get ready
for this stuff how do I do that
well for that we are going to talk about
how do we transition from the old to the
new and to do this let's say I this is
van kits module and when kits module
depends on let's say over here is Sara's
module well there are couple of problems
venket wants to change it to java 9 it's
like go for java 9 go for jonathan i
want to change it sarah says hold your
horses I'm not ready yet
why because two reasons Sarah says not
now no time or Sarah says you know what
I love this change I'm gonna make a
disruptive change which is not helping
me so these are two options right a
disruptive change are no change so we'll
talk about both of these one is no no
change not now another is disruptive
change if Sarah doesn't change anything
then I still want to use the old jar
right now in my Java 9 if Sarah
discipline jizz things I'm like I'm
sorry I don't have time to make all the
code changes to use your new version
Sarah thank you I'm gonna move to Java 9
but I would rather use your old jar
sorry I know you're supporting Java 9
but I'm not ready to use your version I
don't have time to change to all your
disruptions so in both cases I want to
use Java 8 of a 7 module we call it as
old old old jar right jar not the module
this is module how do you deal with this
good news you put rank it's module and
the Sarah's sorry not your module right
jar Sarah's jar both of those into the
module path just take the old jar and
dump it into module path venket module
comes to life and says hello I'm a
module here's my module info and Java
say is awesome
come on over
what do you want in my module info what
am I gonna do requires Sara right jar
I'm gonna specify that and Java says
Sara jar let me check it goes to the
module path and says oh there it is but
this is old stuff it doesn't have a
module info no worries I'll use your jar
name as your module name that is called
automatic module ik automatic module
link is your jar name becomes your
module name almost if my module is
called food dart jar sorry if majority
is called food jar what's my module name
foo if my module name a jar name is food
- all dart jar then what is my name
Fuu dot all the - becomes a dot
automatically if my module is our name
is foo - all dot one dot two point three
point seven dot jar what does that
become food at all period that numbers
are ignored so this is the automatic
module or you say hey Sara I know I know
you have a new module I'm not really use
it but your new module has a completely
different name you gave a new name in
your Java 9 module you know what and
that is not Sara jar if I use Sara jar
when I decide to use your job and I'm
Mario I gotta go change my code so could
you do me a favor
you open up here all the jar go to
manifest put an entry for automatic
naming and use the name you will use in
the future and that way I can be safe
that when I swap your jar with the
module my code will still work so one
recommendation is if you're not ready to
build for Java 9 yet you might want to
at least change your manifest file and
give an automatic
name if your jar does not have an
automatic name in the manifest then Java
will give one for you if you give a name
in the manifest Java will use that name
it's better that you give a name then
Java give a name for your my if you for
your jar and that's how that's going to
work and so finally you can just throw
that in there and things will come to
life and be able to support you and that
is one of the biggest benefits you get
out of it so the summer is what we
talked about Java 9 I think is
incredible in terms of its power by far
it is probably the best set of changes
in the language the most significant in
this talk I divide this into three parts
I talked about what I'd like to call as
improvements and changes what are the
call as additions and as advances and
the improvements we saw several things
that are making our lives better from
Java 7 and Java 8 in additions we saw
new things we can do including ripple
and list off and a few other things
including the callable futures
completable futures things in advances
we pretty much focused on the
modularization itself so it's definitely
a lot of fun it's going to be a bigger
learning curve and effort as we
transition but overall it's also a very
powerful change as well that will come
back to benefit also and so overall I'm
very positive for what's really
happening in this area I hope you found
that useful and if you want to download
the code examples by tomorrow morning
I'll post that on my downloads link you
can download and play with the examples
