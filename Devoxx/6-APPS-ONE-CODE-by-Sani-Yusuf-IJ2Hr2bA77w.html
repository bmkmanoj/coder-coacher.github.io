started everybody so hello everybody
thank you very much for attending my
talk yes so as you can see the title of
my talk today is six apps one code with
ionic in angular and I'm gonna run you
through what I mean by six outs one code
and I'm we're gonna show you how we can
create multiple applications using the
exact same code so to begin let me get
the boring stuff out of the way I'm
gonna tell you a little bit about myself
and what makes my life great and what
makes my life not so great
mostly not so great so I'm the fan of
hybrid a small company consultancy in
London which basically means me myself
and I just three people you know I'm a
Google developer expert as well so not
quite sure what that still means but
yeah it's supposed to be a fancy title
and I recently got so yeah and I'm the
lead instructor of UI dog school which
is a thing me and my partner my business
partner I created so watch out for that
and has anybody seen the Avatar movie
has anybody not seen the Avatar movie
would good good good good
exactly because we can not get along
like we cannot get along you haven't
seen the Avatar movie so go see that
movie all right with all that nonsense
out of the way let's actually start so
so today the web is everywhere what do I
mean by the web when I say the word the
web I meet you know like just the web
technologies and so of course we don't
want to get into semantics of what the
web actually really is I'm certainly not
talking about spiders but yeah I'm
talking about like HTML CSS and
JavaScript technologies and how we use
that to create applications and it's
everywhere it's powering your mobile you
know a lot of the apps you use a power
are built with the web we also have the
traditional web applications what I mean
by traditional web applications is
basically everywhere by application you
use out there that is huge screen you
know on your monitor and stuff like that
and we also have the standard desktop
applications so a lot of the desktop
applications that you use today are
actually built with HTML CSS and
JavaScript and not a lot of people know
this so these are
the web applications also IOT any IOT
fans in the house and Internet of Things
people yeah great so if you want to know
about this this literally Google my
friend Yuri shake it like he's the god
of IOT this guy would sit at his room
and like invent I don't know Mars and
with JavaScript and we also have
server-side rendering we know Jas is the
one of the reasons why the JavaScript
community has really grown because as
soon as George es came to the
server-side we can render stuff on the
server-side and now we have angular
Universal if you're using angular you
can see that even the web powers
server-side technologies now TV
applications a lot of the TV apps you
see are actually built with the web like
those people with Smart TVs will know
what I'm talking about those
applications are really build to the web
so we have even proprietary devices what
do I mean by proprietary devices I'm
talking about Xbox Playstation when you
go on the plane and you know you do not
find first-class like me and you have
that little screen and you wanna watch
the movie to make yourself feel good
about yourself yes some of those apps
are actually built with the web
especially in Norwegian area like the
tablet and Norwegian if you flow
Norwegian on your cheap like me then you
know what I'm talking about
so we're gonna play a little game and
this is what I want to get everybody
involved I need everybody to play this
game with me I need everybody to go to
that website SLI dot do and it's gonna
ask you for an event code and you're
gonna enter V or X X so I need everybody
to go on that website we need to play
the game this is a live game so this is
not like a later thing or um I'm
literally sparing minutes of my talk for
this game come on the winner gets a free
Tesla by the way exactly
I didn't say what type of Tesla it might
just be a picture of a Tesla but it is a
Tesla so can everybody see that
everybody access you should see about a
question right good okay so this is the
game can you spot the web application
here the first one here is on top beer
any beer drinkers in the house yeah we
can see all the alcoholics now uber
sworkit
slack
and vs code so you need to vote and you
can choose multiple things what is that
which one of these is the web
application here that is the question
once again alright okay so while you
guys are voting I actually have the live
results of this so let's actually go see
how people are voting let's see who won
who are not gonna make it to the next
level yeah okay
so this is actually the live results
right now so untappd we see a variation
of opinions so what is actually the real
answer like what is the correct answer
of this okay so the correct answer is
actually all of them so this is a very
smart crowd because we have most people
actually saying all of them so yeah you
know what give yourselves a round of
applause everybody yeah you deserve this
so that's the thing but not only that we
do we have all of that we also see a
variation of opinions some people think
this some people think that and the
whole point is not to say who knows what
or who does not know what it's just to
see how we have these perceptions of
what we think of when we think about web
applications because some people do not
believe that it's all of them some
people just say and I it's only this one
or that one
we have these preconceived notions of
where that well what a web application
is and and there are some of you in this
room maybe that's to like you know what
this is impossible it's not true and for
those people I say follow me everybody
trust Gandalf right exactly come on this
guy saved the Seven Kingdoms you should
trust him exactly so it's all about
devices when you're talking about
application it's all about devices it's
all really about how we use devices
today our apps today run on different
devices right you have the same
application on your watch on your phone
on your Google glass on anything right
and your applications functionality does
not change what you use your application
to do does not change you can still read
your email on the your desktop you can
still read your email on your phone you
can see read still read the same email
on a tablet but it's just the experience
that changes that's the most important
thing so does show me now how important
the experience of an application is it
would reverse the functionality
and it's all about screen size and
accessibility you know when we are
coding a lot we just code for example
people don't know why you should use
label in when you're using an input tag
in front-end application why you should
give it a name or I should give it an ID
these little things because we get away
with it we forget that a lot of people
use the web with proprietary devices
clickers they use the web with
accessibility as a needs and because you
know we are all good we think that's all
we need to do it's all about input sizes
and devices matter so if you can look
here you can actually see the same exact
application who uses this application so
some of you would know this what app is
this good
this is Spotify so you can see how
different the same application is in
different places it's like you have on
your phone and your tablet that's the
thing it's like you probably wake up in
the morning you enter your shower you
play Spotify on your Alexa you then move
on to the Train
you played on your what's your code on
your phone it's lunchtime you want to go
for a jog what do you do on your watch
you're driving home what do you do the
same Spotify in your car you get home
you know you want to work a little bit
on your desktop Spotify you know and
then you turn on your TV in the evening
what do you do the same exact
application so you can see how the same
exact application has moved between
different devices but the user is still
able to do the same exact thing now this
is great right we want this we want all
our devices to have our as a user you
want to be able to do the same thing but
as a developer today this is a nightmare
because oh as a manager and a business
owner this is even worse because each
one of them is money
this is money money money and then it's
like a lot of money so it's like how do
you do that and then so what's the issue
why is it that way well this is the
reason if you want to create a OS
application you need to find some very
very bad person that still writes
Objective C then the most beautiful
language in the world or you find
someone nice that I write Swift and they
probably you know Apple developers are
interesting people and no offense any
Apple developers they don't even want to
work full-time for you they will
probably want
percent of your company and the still
wondering you to pay them a lot of money
if you're lucky enough to find a Java
developer that actually knows Android
not just Java because like actually
knows Android you don't want people
writing you know Publix tactic main on
an Android app that knows Android studio
you pay a good amount of money if you
want to support the web the same thing
to tomorrow you want to support the Mac
the same thing tomorrow you want to
support Windows Universal the same thing
if you have with users like to use
Windows Universal that is so a bus hits
a guy from this team what do you do you
cannot replace him that's it the team is
broken and all of them hate each other
if in case you have not noticed it's
like because they all feel like they're
using the best tools slightly Android
people hate the iOS people the Android
people are the ones I get the most hate
you know exactly let's just be honest so
they all hate each other so you have not
only now a big problem you also have a
team problem because all your work has
hate each other even though they are
building the exact same application
that's just crazy okay then this guy
gets hired everybody knows this guy the
new manager that just walks in on Monday
everybody I want to see the spreadsheet
everybody I want to see what you've been
doing for the nine plus nine years and
where you worked for the past nine years
we know that guy he gets hired and the
first thing every new manager says is
there is no budget oh we need and we
need food there's no budget whoa our
toilet doesn't have tissue paper there's
no budget we need air there's no budget
there's never budget for the new manager
and then he asked you it's too expensive
we're gonna have to let some of you go
because we need to find a way to replace
the team and I don't want to be let go
so what do we need to do and he makes it
your job it says you go find it this is
you because at that point what do you do
first of all you have to look at some of
your friends and let them go and you
have to find a way to reuse all the code
which most people hate each other
remember and create an app that actually
works and you have a life tooth so you
start to think is there a better more
efficient way for cross-platform
development that's you know whenever
we're worried we start to think what
what do we do what do I do and these are
the things you start to think about
ideas start to come you know when we are
hungry ideas come through you know have
you noticed that whenever you wake up or
you're hungry in the morning all the
ideas come when you're having a shower
so you're suddenly the smartest person
in the world it's like ah I didn't think
about that and by the time you get to
work reality hits you and then you're no
longer smart again exactly because
you've had your coffee in your breakfast
exactly so you start to realize that
every modern device is capable of
running web technologies right every
single modern device out there and web
technologies are relatively easier to
learn and use no disrespect to any other
ecosystem but web technologies are
really I can teach a kid how to create a
simple HTML web page in like a couple of
hours but I'll probably not get as far
as what public and private means if I
was trying to teach him c-sharp or Java
la what is private
well there's polymorphism and
encapsulation what some of us have been
have 20 years in this industry and you
ask a simple question like what is
encapsulation exactly and web developers
are everywhere like you can find a web
developer I'm promise you they're
probably like web developers are
homeless on the street and they can
still code you can find out everywhere
exactly so why can't we just use the web
everywhere this is the simple question
you start to ask yourself why can you
not use the web okay so let us create
this mythical billion dollar application
who wants to be rich with me you don't
want to be rich with me oh that's fine
I'll keep all my shares so let's create
this mythical application yeah we have
this great application somebody is just
giving us a billion dollars to build you
know so we need to have iOS Android and
Windows for some of the people that just
don't want to buy a new phone you know
and we need to support the web we need
to have desktop application a mobile web
application we also need to have PWA and
the desktop we need to have Windows OSX
and those guys that I like to debug
everything Linux people I mean don't
tell them I said that okay so let us
solve the mobile problem first right so
we solve the mobile problem this is what
we want to achieve we want to code once
and
web technologies right we want to be
able to access hardware features because
today if you want to do something as
simple as taking a photo of somebody
from a web application it is crazy five
years ago you needed something called
flash and you had to detect what version
of Flash the person had and then you had
to be the further person to download
just to take a picture literally good
luck getting your location it's getting
better now though with new browser api's
but when you're creating applications on
the web it's really really difficult and
you want to access the same device
features because if I am creating an
application for iOS and Android and I
want to be able to access the same
device features the same way
it just makes much more sense that way
if I lose my leg the next day somebody
else can just come in and they know what
they are doing exactly this is where
something called Apache Cordova comes in
what does what is Cordova it's
originally called PhoneGap and and open
source and part of the Apache foundation
it's basically what bridges the gap
between your web application in the sits
in the webview and the device API so you
can access the camera the blue to the
GPS NFC and whatever they create
tomorrow or whatever Apple decides to
remove from their phones tomorrow you
know every year they remove something
Hey headphone jack off button off next
year they remove the screen
Alex iPhone and people will still buy
for some reason and we want to support
all the major operating systems right
because we don't want to lose the users
and so Cordova gives you that and it has
a plug-in interface for all the device
features as well so have we solved our
mobile problem
yes and no but why this is the reason
different mobile operating systems have
different UI SDK libraries they give you
different components the users have
different user experience this is
Facebook on iOS and Android I don't even
need to tell you which is iOS and
Android the iOS users wouldn't know
which one it is the Android users will
know some of you are going to be loaded
I would is that because you've never
seen that version of Facebook you
experience different user experiences on
the IRS you have a button just one
button on Android you have three on the
Windows Phone you have a dedicated
search button don't ask me why because
nobody uses being
but for some reason they put it there
and this is what it looks like on
Windows the same exact application but
different user experience and and some
have the dedicated back buttons
we'd also not forget the tablets and
phablets if you don't know what phablets
are they're those devices that are
confused whether they want to be a phone
or a tablet one day there are tablets
one day their phones just depend on the
day or how drunk you are
and then they become so how do you reuse
at this level you have an app that works
across these but the experience now is
even suffered how do we how do you use
let me visualize the information for you
the native apps when your beauty native
app is like this it's like wait I want
you to build a house and I give you like
the door you know the roof everything
it's like Lego just connect the dots on
paint right good everybody will be able
to build a house there but if I want you
to build a house and you can also access
all the device API but with the Cordova
application all you have is the webview
and then in HTML gives you like divs and
span and tables if you still use them
things like that it's like say hey build
me a house here's water here's the
cement here's engineering degree go
study and by the time you finish
building the house I think you'll be my
67 generation and your HTML code so how
do you reuse how do you offer this level
of experience without writing six
hundred and ninety thousand if and else
statements right that's the question and
this is where ionic comes through now
what is ionic if you google this you'd
see five hundred thousand different
answers which is scary ionic is simply a
web SDK for creating mobile applications
that's all it is that's what it will
always ever be it's open source it's
built to the web with HTML CSS and
JavaScript
it supports Android iOS and Windows
Universal as first-class citizens and
this is what the ionic stock looks like
so you'd write your own code with HTML
CSS in JavaScript you would use ionic
component I only components it on top of
angular framework so use the angular
component and the framework all the
features and then you have the webview
and then you have the native container
inside of the webview which means you
still I
in a native application and Cordova is
hiding somewhere there just basically
like the messenger hey get me a picture
Cordova okay guy I got you I'll get you
a picture features of ionic so this is
the same application running across this
the same code running across different
applications different devices but you
can see how they all look different by
default I didn't have to do anything and
you have a powerful icons library ionic
so you don't have to go look for your
own icons and you can customize and
configure it because your manager wants
to know you can use your company colors
and things like that you know how
managers come up with it I feel like
they just their body itches the money
how do I make your life miserable today
I want you to invent Mars that's what I
want and they just make these business
decisions and but it would be nice if
you able to configure and customize and
ionic lets you do that on a high level
who here hates to configure web pack and
all of that a who likes doing that let's
see who is who needs medical help
okay so good but we don't like to deal
with all these types going on the days
where you created a web application you
could press refresh and that was it
today you have to transpile you have to
do web pack gulp and all these things
not me
this is why the first class CLI - helps
you assess pre-processing tactically
transpiling
and it also has error reporting for you
built in then you have the code bundler
with the three shakin three shakin is
you get rid of the dead code that is
never going to work in your application
and you also have other features like
right-to-left support and
internationalization imagine if I came
to Switzerland and gave a talk about
something and I did not talk about
internationalization probably start a
civil war somewhere I don't want to do
that and there are some pro tools as
well who's using ionic everybody wants
to know who the cool kids over four
million applications are we generated
110 plus countries we had an ionic
Zurich meetup just three days ago
eighteen thousand members on the stack
community who are willing to answer some
of them want jobs some of them want to
take your job pretty good of Stack
Overflow an active forum we have there's
more than thirty thousand thirty four
thousand stars on get up and your feel
free to commit and send a pull request
companies like Microsoft
the Dow Jones and short kid and even be
like the NHS they all use ionic to build
the applications I think if Microsoft
uses it we can save to say that yes okay
this is pretty ideal now so to get
started we ionic simple you install the
CLI you start the app you give it a name
and you set aside a template because
there are different types of templates
tabs side menu blank and you just go CD
into your app you're an ionic surf and
you're good to go
don't believe me let's go turn oh no no
no no no no okay
let's go and start so I'm gonna open my
terminal here everybody can see this
pretty good bigger
perfect okay let me sit into my desktop
I'm gonna start this application ionic
start I'm gonna say boxed and I'm gonna
use the tabs template and let's see no I
do not want you to add that and this is
gonna go to the NPM install and
hopefully we do not bring the entire
internet down and this completes on time
because I'm being time mister Internet
so yes so this is just basically gonna
go pull from the ionic github and pull
all the things that we need to do and
yeah it is finished and we click no we
don't want to use the pro SDK so we're
gonna do CD into boxed and here what do
we do we just run ionic serve or ionic a
lab so I'm gonna run the command ionic
lab before I actually do that so let me
actually run ionic lab and let's see
something so you actually might see an
app that is not even my app because I
have a lot of server caching issues so I
might need to clear my cache on that
particular place so I'm just gonna go
ahead here and I'm gonna inspect this
element and I'm gonna come here and I'm
gonna clean my cache because this our
this is some app I've already worked on
and if i refresh this yay we see our
application so I can add android windows
and let's see so who you can see some
differences you can already see some
differences right we can see how the
alignment the icons the font size the
colors everything is different so
here we built our application so what do
we do want to do with this application
actually let me show you what I want to
do with this application so I'm gonna
just go open it here I'm gonna save oxd
where is the V not you visual studio
code this guy okay so I'm gonna open it
I'm the best IDE in the world Visual
Studio code I know so what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna go create this
application where I have this list of I
have this API to host head here so this
is life I have this API that hosted here
with a a bunch of movies and I'm just
going to go ahead and actually use this
API so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna go to my app this is an angular
application the first thing I want to do
is import the HTTP client module which
allow me to make HTTP calls and it
should automatically import so I'm just
gonna go to the main page here and the
home page which is the home tab and I'm
just gonna do this guy here I'm gonna
remove this guy and actually before I do
that let me go ahead and make the HTTP
call to that particular place so I'm
gonna say public my movies and I'm just
gonna do that of type any of type
observable any and this is an observable
so I should probably put like this to
just know that it's not an observable so
I'm just gonna say here private HTTP I'm
gonna call the HTTP client that's
automatically imported for me
so I'm just gonna say this dot movies
equals I'm just gonna use the observable
here and I say this done HTTP GET I'm
gonna make a cat call and what am I
gonna do I'm gonna go to this API here
I'm gonna pass that get call and there
we go and we have some error for some
reason it's a expected one argument with
God zero
oh it was just thinking all right so we
have that we've done so now we have this
observable here so what we're gonna do
is I'm gonna create this card so ionic
has a lot of components I'm gonna use
the card component and I know for sure
that the card component has a card
header
and it also has a card oh let me do this
it has a guy on card content so this is
what I'm gonna do actually I'm just
going to use the header oh I don't even
need the content so I'm gonna add an
image here so I'm gonna have an image
and like the name of the movie right so
here I'm gonna do an NG 4 which is like
a repeater so ng 4 and this is all
angular stuff let movie of movies here
because this is an observable I can
iterate over the rebels I can only do
eatery tables so I'm gonna use something
very cool called the async pipe which is
from the angle library that allows you
to on automatically subscribe to
observables and here I'm gonna bind to
the source property and say movie that
so let's actually see this is the
typical one so we're gonna say movie
that we're gonna use this thing called
that poster so let's use the poster that
poster and in the title here I'm gonna
just use movie dad what's the name of
the movie title title so I'm just gonna
save that and let's go ahead and voila
we have an application look some of the
great greatest movies of all time you
know you can see these great movies of
course Vikings or Vikings give me more
give me more
great movie so so now what do we do
let's go back to our slide because we
are quickly taking our time so everybody
agree that we've solved our mobile
problem right we have three mobile
applications that we can send to the app
store iOS Android Windows Phone and you
can see how I'm still writing code once
but we get me three applications so what
next we need to solve the big boy which
is web right for the web is all about
adapting the screen size because
different web is different some people
are still using dialog and they have
like this this very great browser called
Internet Explorer 6 and 8 and 9 have you
used it really good
I know website adds $20 to your check
out anytime you use Internet Explorer
so that you pay for the support yes we
should yeah yeah that's very fair so
it's all about you should also consider
keyboard mouse click her all these input
devices that's what you need to do when
you're designing for the web that's how
you can see the same application running
on the web and don't forget about
accessibility please do not forget about
accessibility very very important I'm
saying this to you even I forget
sometimes so let's see here you see the
demo dude okay so the problem is we
already have a web application because
this is web right but this is the
biggest problem here this is the problem
it's this guy
nobody likes this guy imagine you want
to buy a ticket quickly and you go to
the website and it is this guy that's
there
everybody hates this guy no because we
keep telling him go on a diet come on
man nobody likes this guy so how do we
solve this guy ionic has a great system
that allows you to basically go around
and shape things so to save myself some
time I have like her code I'm just
literally gonna copy you did not see me
copying this by the way so I'm just
gonna copy this bit here and does just
that bit and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use the I on a grid system so I'm
gonna say I on grid and I'm just gonna
use a row right and inside a row what do
you think I'm gonna use anybody call him
I on call so but at this point in time
is basically the same thing I've created
so what I want to do is I want to put
some it's not I want to say hey if
though it's a 12 column based grid so if
you're in a small screen by default your
column 12 but if you're on a small
screen a really small screen take the
whole screen take 12 12 spaces right if
you're on a medium screen take 6 spaces
per column so you would have two rows
right and two columns if you're on a
large screen take four spaces so how
many would you have if you take four
spaces three exactly if you're on a
super duper large screen take three
spaces so you'd have four things in one
row make sense right big bigger the
screen the more we should see all right
so I'm just gonna take this ng4 here I'm
gonna remove it here and I'm gonna put
it on the column level because we want
to repeat over the columns and I'm just
going to take this our card
here and just put the card inside the
columns because we want them to show and
then I'm gonna save and then we're gonna
go see voila
hey pretty nice now you believe in that
this is a billion dollar application
yeah yeah we get the Swiss government to
finance us and all of that so we have
this so here we this is a huge really
huge loss screen so I can reduce this
and say all right what if we have a
smaller screen like this guy
then we take three spaces you see more
per item what if we go down to a much
smaller screen like maybe a flap phablet
you see more but to speed what if you go
to like a really really small screen
then we see one and this makes sense so
if you're in a small phone you see if
you're on a much bigger phone you see if
you on a tablet you see more if you're
on a TV that's hard that's how you can
really scale as much as you want to
divide and that makes sense because when
you use the TV apps you see multiple
titles on the screen that makes sense
you're making good use of the screen so
finally this guy decided to go to the
gym and now he's healthy he's fit look
at him
six six packs no four packs you know now
we have a look yeah we have four packs
more packs than me so pretty good so so
we solve the problem right well what
about the progressive web application
this is the issue what about the pwe how
do we saw the PWA does anybody know what
a PWA is good because PW is one of those
things that everybody's talking about
but nobody's actually doing you know
it's just the truth it's just it's like
big data
oh we do big data in my company no you
have glorified if and else statements
that's what you have you're not doing
big data you're doing really tiny data
like small data exactly
so BW stands for progressive web
applications a web application that
actually works offline you know it can't
be installed on a mobile phone
it runs full screen with an icon and a
splash screen just like a native app it
works thanks to something called the
manifest Jason and the service worker
the service worker is something I will
talk about a little bit more this is the
space state of offline in 2018 we have
sent people to the moon Lord we have
invented
intelligence in fact there is a game
artificial intelligence that even knows
how to beat the champions we have
eradicated smallpox on the surface of
the earth yet this is the best thing you
can see when you go offline I came I am
not joking this is the best thing you
can see when you go offline I came a
dinosaur game how ironic
interesting exactly and for those people
that might not know when you go offline
on Chrome and you press your spacebar
it's a game you can play a game so yeah
so this is how the serviceworker works
the serviceworker basically is a proxy
that sits between your application and
the server so before you send a request
it hits the serviceworker first and it
goes to the server I wonder the request
is coming back here's the serviceworker
first so what you can do is you request
an image then it's every Sokka sends
that to the server one is server the
request is coming back the serviceworker
can cache that image and the
serviceworker has access to unlimited
storage in fact you can even lock the
storage to stop your system from
deleting this is being worked on so the
next time the user wants to get the same
resource the same image what does the
serviceworker do nope we're not going to
go to the server I have this copy and it
sends it back and that means quicker and
much more better experience exactly and
the serviceworker lives independent of
your application so when you close your
application the serviceworker is still
running it is a system level event not
an application level event and allows
you to process on its one serviceworker
per domain so if you have facebook.com
there will be once every smoker for that
if you have twitter.com there'll be one
service record for that I wouldn't be
surprised if they start saying you could
share it these guys will do anything for
your information mmm exactly and it
solves the problem does anybody know
what life I means life is when you have
toolbars on your phone or like one and a
half bar and your phone makes you
believe that this service know your
phone is confused like well what am i
what are those I need service and you
believe in oh it's not working no you
don't have service yeah let's see this
in action right the PWA to solve the PWA
problem ionic has a pretty simple
progressive web app what's it called
setup all you do is you just go to the
index.html they already have the
serviceworker there this is the
serviceworker
and the manifesto JSON you can come here
change the name put your logo everything
you can do what you want to precache
what you don't want to precache and you
can just come to this serviceworker here
and all you do is what you just come
here you uncomment this script and then
you put this here that's it
job done I save and we refresh the app
so you see this app working right and
then we refresh the app again and if we
go to the inspect element and we see a
application tag you can actually see
service workers and you can see that oh
my Chrome has crashed great wonderful
demos always go well you see so my
chrome is freezing because it doesn't
want me to show you guys Oh finally you
can see the service workers activated is
running this was when it was received
you can send a push notification with
service workers so what I'm going to do
is very bad here because it will most
likely require me to enter my my details
again is I am actually going to go just
turn off my Wi-Fi I know you probably
already figured out I'm crazy by now but
yes I will do this live on stage and if
this does not work we just pretend
nothing happened we just move on
you did not see this I did not see to
and I'm gonna go try to refresh my
application and my application will
still work offline you don't believe me
let me go to Switzerland calm no
actually I should be careful what type
of websites I go to exactly and we can
played a great game the best offline
experience and we're night and we're not
even good at it so but our apps that
works and we can refresh 600,000 times
and our app was to load this is pretty
good because imagine if we had watched
one movie we're trying to watch the
movie offline while we're flying the
movie will load because why it is cached
imagine if users your Facebook imagine
if it was your email imagine if it was
your Twitter you can still see the old
stuff while you don't have internet
that's much better
so what do we do next let's go to this
guy so we solve the PWA problem ok maybe
we need to turn off our Wi-Fi now mmm
right agreed let's turn this back on I
hope he doesn't ask me for my
I swear it would be the first time I've
been on stage we're good all right now
let's solve that stop that big boy in
the house any Linux users in the house
security yep I've seen that there they
are good stuff that stuff has a lot and
come up with the web because it's all
about the same screen sizes right we're
never gonna have desktop on a mobile
phone like it's the same screen size and
they do have noticeable differences
because also each Linux has its own you
know bunt was his own skin Microsoft has
his own skin I am a sex has his own skin
and people want to be comfortable with
that skin so it has a new level of
reduce ability as well offline is a must
imagine if Photoshop would not work if
you didn't have internet
imagine if Chrome would not work if you
didn't have internet not really cool
Chrome now work and if you didn't have
internet don't pay attention to me and
they all have different skins like I
said so how do you ensure reusability on
this level okay
electron is something that is your
friend electron is basically the Cordova
photo desktop it's as simple as that it
allows you to access the native API s
it's open source supports cross-platform
development across Linux and all these
platforms you use web technologies some
electron apps you use today who did not
know that electron was built with this
until now anybody okay so we conceived
with people this is what electron is
built in electron as our builds alike
this is what visual studio code and
slack are built with electron they're
all just web applications it's crazy I
using a web application to create web
applications with Visual Studio code
that's that's that's cool I think yeah
it's broken so you use HTML to fix HTML
nice exactly
let's see time to see the black pant and
I mean the demo exactly so how do we
work with code or electron with the
electron is actually pretty easy just go
to electron comm if the internet would
yeah so you go to electron and basically
what they ask you to do is go to the
github and pull their starter
you have a starter and I have that
started already on my on my desktop so
I'm just gonna go to my desktop here
here and we can see the starter
electronic quick starter so I'm just
gonna double click that and this is all
life so electron quick master right and
I'm gonna open this here in visitor your
code and all I need to do here if you
let's pretend we don't know these
electron it just says clone this
repository package the JSON points it
the main file and you run npm install
and all of that so let's just go ahead
and run npm astoria let's run npm
install now lets us bring the whole
internet down ok so we run npm install
interesting alright this is pretty huge
48 megabytes
ok i'm not sure we're running the
correct npm install here oh you know we
are so we just gonna wait for electron
to finish this thing and it normally
doesn't take this long I might have run
the wrong NPM install mmm let me just do
it again npm install here i want to run
npm install why npm install is running
nothing's gonna happen what could go
wrong exactly so it's just gonna pull up
some a couple of things and we should
probably wait for it maybe that was a
bad idea sunny hmm maybe oh there we go
so I don't know what this is I have no
idea and the time we did not see it
happen so what do we do so electron
works like this you have this main dot
JS file that literally points to the
index.html you want to serve right so
which index do you think we should point
to of the Vox application right we
already have our app so what we gonna do
so we're gonna walk back so we are in
the same desktop folder right so we're
just gonna go out and now we're gonna go
into Vox and inside Vox let's actually
look said again
oh okay it's not my fault I had African
education guys it's not my fault it's
totally not my fault so we had Vox seed
and we need to go what we were trying to
get to is this build file and then the
index.html in the billfold are correct
so we're going to go to source www then
build right so Vox vaak siddhi SRC oh of
course
www then index dot HTML correct okay
oh yes build this is why I like my crowd
you see everybody's making sure that I
do not mess this up
good all right so now we have this so
for us to start we just need to run NPM
start and this will go ahead and run a
Lex electron for us so hey nothing is
working
wonderful so let's go back and see if
our so we go back one level up we have
the Oh xxxx AED and we have www then we
have oh we don't need to go into the
build folder it's just that right it's
okay
so we just close that and we do NPM
start again and now we have an actual
application running but this is not just
any application running this is an
actual Mac application like you can see
here electron all of that I can go ahead
like I'm the main ojs and like change
this to two what is going to show here
you can see it's an actual application
here and it has the same thing as those
guys you know the big screen and if we
can make this full screen look we can
make it full screen it's just like
Chrome now we actually have an
application that we have so this is I
think it's really really cool so we've
been able to do that so let's go to go
on ahead and go back to our presentation
so now we have solved all the problems
we've saved the day and we still don't
get a promotion
unfortunately because you know what that
new manager is going to go and take all
the credit and take all the bonuses the
Vella purrs I thought that was awesome I
thought it was like you know it was
really really awesome so other things to
be aware of capacitor is coming
capacitor is basically a new replacement
by the ionic team to basically take over
cordova because we want to have more
control right and you can go and try
this invader today we have stencil if
you like to build well components today
basically central is a tool to build web
components that work anywhere and you
can use that so AB stencil is what's
going to power ionic 4 and I see people
taking me just don't worry I'm gonna
treat these slides and they'll be
available for you we have the ionic pro
basically they have a lot of tools that
like a premium but they have a generous
free tier and one of my favorite is the
deploy I had my workshop yesterday so
the workshop got any workshop people in
the house yeah they got to see the magic
you can update your apps live without
the App Store that's pretty cool so that
yeah you can beat Apple at their own
game
this is these are my predictions and
these are my own predictions you know
the feel free to like to disagree with
them
I think PW is will be accepted into the
App Store in the next year you'll be
able to submit a progressive web app
into that probably starting with the
Google Play Store and you'll be accepted
end of JavaScript frameworks we're not
gonna be killing each other about if
your react or JavaScript or of vanilla
or you still use jQuery we just all get
along and then we find something else to
fight over eventually PW is will make it
to your Mac Linux this is actually
already come true now because in the
last month the Chrome OS allows pwh to
be saved on the Chrome OS chrome is
working on it now for actual the concept
of desktop applications will be changed
because today we have web assembly if we
have web assembly people soon photo you
just go to photoshop comm to use
Photoshop the web is just gonna become
this thin engine that you're just gonna
be running on it's gonna become like a
micro operating system within another
operating system and when we use the
word native sometimes I get really
pissed off because we make it seem that
native is this great great thing and the
web is like this terrible place no the
web will be the new native when you want
to build applications you're not going
to think any other way apart from the
web in a couple of years and shameless
promotion so I'm building this thing
called UI school we
people production driven development we
call it I don't know how he came up with
that name it depends on how drunk we
were but yes it busy teaches you how to
create modern web applications and to
end with angular firebase and other
things so feel free to go sign up to our
mailing list we're still developing this
if you get started you can go to the
ionic side electron side and you can go
to my blog on my twitter and if there
are no questions so I'll open the floor
for questions now and yes any questions
any questions I don't bite sometimes yes
you have a question so flutter is really
interesting because I think water is
don't like I don't have the full details
before my understanding it's very
similar to either native script in terms
of what uses JavaScript engine - like I
said I'm not sure either that or he lets
you compile dart down to a native
application so he's one of the two so
again I always say you know Gruffalo is
probably great it will suit to some
people I would never span on any stage
and tell you this is the best way to go
or that's it the best it depends on your
use case what you're comfortable with
the resources available to you but
there's one thing I will say flutter
these are the things they're not the
first to try to do this problem
you know xamarin has been there for a
while and the web is the future you
cannot will lose if you bet on the web
so if it still feel like these solutions
will be there but they only do have a
definitive lifespan there will be a time
when we would say we wouldn't be using
flutter there'll be a tower would stop
using native to create applications
there will definitely be a time it's not
I'm not predicting this because I feel
that way because it is a reality of our
so that's what I think about floss about
I think it's a great tool like I've one
of the people following it so I I really
I'm excited to see what what I can do
with it - you're welcome questions
you've got around two minutes
any questions okay remember Tesla I'm
giving away Tesla's great scaling for
the application for the images for
baking small screens but for me is the
biggest pain point is the navigation the
menus of the applications and to scale
on on the on big screens on small
screens and on like this electro mm-hmm
how do you will solve this problem
you mean navigation yeah and so when you
say navigation what exactly are you
talking about so have you have you
served education so I you know that
question is very user centric like I
would only tell you what I would do and
and I providing the questions probably
suited for somebody in well into user
experience but the thing I'll say is to
what is comfortable for you and your
users you know you can the hamburger
menu we loved it but now a lot of user
experience researches and say don't use
the hamburger menu I'm completely
comfortable with it but some people are
saying don't use hamburger menu so it
can only be what you and your user
experience person decides to use out
what your users complain because in the
end if user navigation on your users
don't complain maybe they love it
there's anybody know Craigslist com
Craigslist exactly
one of the worst websites ever built but
it's making money you know why people
are used to it they love it and they
don't want it to change and that's why
it will never change and that's why
they're making a lot of money because at
the end of the day you know the most
important person in the business is not
your boss the biggest boss is your user
because he's has the money and he can
fire everybody by not paying his money
so listen to your users and implement
what you think they would like and
there's no one-size-fits-all okay make
around a minute thank you you're welcome
they got a time for last question yeah
yes it's working
oh yeah so performance is the number one
questions I get you know because it's
like the question I always ask is what
is performance what exactly every time I
ask that question I've never really
gotten an answer it's like what is
performance what do we mean by
performance you know no so I'm not
directly asking that question it's like
when you think about it you don't have
one answer because somebody could say
user experiences performance because it
lets you get the job done quicker
somebody could say speed this
performance so performance is this very
big cloak but I know the performance
you're talking about in terms of is it
gonna suck I always say if your app
sucks is because you're probably doing
something wrong or you've chosen the
wrong approach I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you that hey go build fever 10
or FIFA 2090 with ionic no don't do
anything like that on the web because
you need to be as close as the metal as
possible but with webassembly coming
through that's gonna be a thing of the
past now soon we'll be able to do so it
choose the right approach that works for
your team but in terms of performance
with things like anything in the web
performers does not come for free you
would work for it you'd have to work for
it you'd have to optimize but that's
pretty much everywhere but we need if
you get a leeway I've seen a lot of
terrible native applications but because
it's very highly accelerated people seem
to get away with it
you see people nesting for loops within
for loops and thinking it's okay
sayo comes down to your own personality
and what you're implementing and and you
can choose well but be more more
importantly don't let don't choose the
technology lets your user requirements
dictate your technology let what you
want to understand what you're trying to
build
then select the technology don't go be
like hey this is the finest shiniest
thing is my wife has just given back to
four people oh I'm gonna buy a sports
car because that's what I would need to
take them to school you know has sports
car has two seats don't don't go for
what you want
use your oh okay my wife is giving it to
triplets maybe we should get a big
family car because that's practical
that's what we're going to need now it's
not nice but it's what we need you have
the same mindset for applications thank
you okay if there are if there are no
questions then I'll say thank you very
much it's been a pleasure of ox to Rick
and hopefully we see you in the neck
you whenever we meet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
