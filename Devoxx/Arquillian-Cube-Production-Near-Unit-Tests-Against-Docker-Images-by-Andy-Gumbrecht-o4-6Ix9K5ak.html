morning everyone awake everyone had a
good night I had one of those classic
developer nights where you're prepping
everything and you lose it all so I've
been up most of the night redoing it I'm
sure we all had those days I'm Andy gum
Brett I'm from Tommy tribe I'm actually
a committer on the Apache Tommy project
so I'm kind of adding a bit of a
advertising material to my slides hope
you don't mind too much it's about
testing Java EE and Tommy is obviously a
java application server I'll start off
with something that I asked originally
when our client came along what the hell
is our Killian well it turns out that
our Killian was basically taken from the
film men in black and they're the guys
that were going to blow up the earth and
the fam it are the enemies of our
Killian so it turns out they were quite
good guys little cute guys in the body
they're not here to destroy us we're
actually here to take over your testing
world so befriend arquillians and I put
it here phonetically because every time
I say our quillian I owe you a beer
befriend arquillians some of the top
arquillians are not here to destroy it
aslak knutson who's the project lead of
achillion Pete mere as a co-founder and
we also have Alex Soto's the inventor of
our Killian cube and the project lead on
coop they're all great committers to the
open source community they've given a
lot and takin nothin from it
we're basically here to talk about
testing I'm sure you all know what at
test the annotation means are you using
it who's using it so that's probably two
thirds which is pretty good if you're
not using it you should be using it and
you should be understanding it now what
are you actually testing when your unit
testing basically you're creating a
small portion of code that tests your
production code the side effect of that
is that you're actually going to produce
good code because the test ensures that
but what you're actually doing is
facilitating change for the future so
when you're creating the unit test it's
not just about creating the unit test
itself it's about your future
development in your product so every
time you make a change then you're
actually going to be testing that change
in making sure you have broken something
what types of tests are we all running
it's quite important to unit test so a
unit test is obviously just something
very small it should be atomic it should
be the smallest component you can
possibly test the right way
integration tests they should take those
small components that you've just tested
and put them together in some kind of
package and they should be tested
together so your components are testing
your components and then you have your
functional tests where as you take all
your components all your integration
tests and you package them ideally as
close to your production environment as
possible and you test them all together
this is where today a lot of people are
using basically mocks I really don't
like mocks they were good for a while
but they're not good for Jay to show
j2ee I nearly said that word I'm sorry
java ee testing they're not good for EE
testing because yeah basically because
you're not testing your production
environment if you're testing all of
these things then you're probably on the
right path if you're not then you're
probably on the wrong path so how are we
going to test how we're going to start
testing a te environment traditionally
we build things by ourselves and we
create lots of machs to mock features
that our application server is offering
us and this is generally not a good way
of testing your test still need to be
portable so if you're going to be
testing you need to support your tests
on any container so obviously you know
I'm plugging to me from Apache here but
arquillian has nothing to do with Tommy
it has everything to do with containers
so your container should be supported so
things like jboss IBM websphere tomcat
Tommy Oh Tommy
it was a mistake promise your test
should still be executable in a kind of
familiar fashion you shouldn't start
going down a different path and I'm
familiar paths in your testing you've
all become very familiar with unit
testing and the way that works and so
our Killian is basically providing an
environment it's a framework that you
can run in your IDE and on your bill
tool which is these days maven obviously
not alone but you should be testing
within your familiar environments things
like j unit and n units and that's all
supported through the arquillian
framework so I'm just going to introduce
you to the basics of how our Killian
decides to test against our application
server we were initially going to select
a container so it can be any of the
containers any of the four million
containers out there on the market today
and there's an implementation for pretty
much everything so we select the
container we want to test with and then
what we need to do is take our
application so this is where we start to
think okay we're not doing a unit test
we're not doing a functional test we're
not doing the integration test we're
doing everything together how are we
going to do that in our environment well
the way our Killian works is it builds
your application and ships it off to the
container so all containers have some
form of deployment whether it's an
embedded environment or a remote
environment will build the application
and send it to the server and we use a
mechanism called shrink wrap it's an API
and you can use it to build Java simple
java jar files or web archives which
everyone's familiar with these days and
if you're still creating at the seams
are going to be using enterprise archive
zar files
we then take that package application
and we run it in the test container and
again this is all transparent the test
container is any container it's not
designed to be just one specific
container and then we build a test so
what we've done is we've taken our
application we built our application
it's been deployed to our application
server and then we need to test again to
it against it and that's done basically
by sewing in the run with our Killian
class that tells a unit test that we're
going to be firing up that container and
our Killian takes over this role I'll
show you how to configure it later but
basically here in our deployment we're
building a shrink-wrap archive and we're
adding some simple classes and when
we're adding those classes any dependent
classes that are automatically pulled in
by this mechanism so you don't have to
define hundreds and hundreds of classes
only the top layer of classes and
everything that's dependent will be
automatically pulled into that archive
and we're defining here as an example a
resource the beans XML what that does
for me is switches on CDI so we're
basically deploying an application at
CDI aware and then our tests tub and
this is where everything remains
familiar we're just creating a method
and we're testing once we test it we
need to get our results back so our
Killian provides us with mechanisms to
proxy that information back from the
server in order to give us our results
we then simply unda ploy the application
that we've deployed on the server and
shut down the container let's see some
code
while I run really quick
final arrangements
ok
okay so what we're doing here is
basically creating a web server lit mine
the right one I'm in the wrong one sorry
so next step there we go okay start
again we're obviously bringing in our
dependencies into our maven project here
I'm defining everything that's required
to test against my application server in
this example here we're importing the
Java EE API from open ejb which is Tommy
and there's a provided scope so
basically our application server is
providing this API to test against we're
including the arquillian bomb which is
responsible for bringing in all the
files that required morning as lack
morning Alex thanks for coming and we
define our container so our Killian
Tommy remote is the Tommy remote
container for it for the Tommy
application and you will find a
corresponding container maven plugin for
your for your server and then shrink
wrap which brings in a shrink wrap API
and for me personally jacoco to test my
my coverage so that's supported as well
and then simply an HTTP client to test
against my server I like to test my
client as if it is a real client we can
test with an embedded version so there's
basically a remote version of the
container and there's an embedded
version of the container now which one
you use is up to you that's kind of a
deeper tutorial on too much information
to cover a year
and finally at the end our car killian
ornery and herb oil will be there our
Killian j unit container and this is
what j unit uses to actually fire at the
mechanism the next step is to include an
hour Killian XML file everyone's
familiar with XML should be too
difficult to understand how this file is
formatted what we're doing is defining
the environment that our Killian is
going to be using to deploy our
container
I didn't mention this my talk on Tuesday
didn't actually realize how important it
was because it's something we'd be doing
for a long time when i'm specifying my
HTTP port here is minus 1 what we're
doing in Tommy is actually firing up a
random port container we started with
this because we knew we are going to be
testing a parallel as it turns out
Tommy's the only one currently on the
market that is testing using a random
port so we're the only one you can
actually test and run tests in parallel
I hope the other guys adopt that like I
said I didn't actually know that we were
doing that and no other guys were doing
that because it just made sense if
you've got hundreds of tests running
against your container then you want to
run you want to be able to run it in
parallel so a test is obviously
annotated with tests and we should
always be asserting something within our
test so we need to be testing something
within that method and not just running
the application and so as you saw
previously to do that we basically need
the our killian run with and that tells
j unit to fire up this container that is
being defined within the arquillian xml
this is a simple test hence the name our
Killian simple test what we're doing in
the deployment area is building a web
archive we're adding some classes to
test and I'm seeing my book services red
which is making me nervous we're adding
some persistence on we're adding CDI and
then we're running into our test and as
you can see i'm injecting a service from
my deployed application that will
actually be a proxy to the application
and in our test
I'm just going to be adding a simple
book that is persisted to a lightweight
database in the background
yes we'll go ahead and run this
and we knew it would not find this
there's that brilliant demo effect I
just run it two minutes ago over there
just bear with me a second
okay when I'm happy I was chopped onion
this is one of those dumb moments it's
going to take me at moments as well
my interface is being killed okay I'll
just have to add my interface
okay I apologize this have no idea where
this has been deleted this morning this
is one of the things I'm basic trying to
rebuild
okay this now run
I've turned my firewall off was that
someone here okay you can see in the
logs basically quite extensive logging
our Killian takes the information that's
been provided through the configuration
the shrink-wrap mechanism has built our
application as a war file our Killians
fired up the container so you can see
the actual container has been started
everything's run and our application
gets deployed and at the end of the test
it gets shut down so that all looks
pretty simple but actually there's a
hell of a lot of things going on in the
background there I'm sure you understand
that this test is actually now running
in my test environment so the
application server then I'm testing
against this should be my production
system and the system that's deployed
should be as near to my production
system as possible you know obviously if
you got something like SI p on the back
end then you might have to mock out the
back end of SI p in your application but
the rest of it could really be deployed
in this environment we can define
everything that the application should
contain then we want to test against so
rather than just testing a small part of
my application a very isolated
environment I've exploded it right into
my application server and if something's
going to go wrong this test is going to
be far more likely to show you there's
something wrong with your code as it
just did
ok
so this is my arquillian light test this
just takes things a slight step further
I mean it's to show you basically the
flexibility that's involved when we're
building our application every
application is different and we need to
cover as much if not everything that's
possible and feasible to do within your
web application within the shrink-wrap
environment so here you can see I'm
using maven coordinates so rather than
define particular classes multiple times
what I can do is actually pull in maven
dependencies into my application so you
you're building your environment through
the shrink wrap mechanism to be as close
to your production system as possible
and this has made much much easier by
being able to import maven through
coordinates and again shrink wrap
basically takes this information and we
add those libraries that we've resolved
through the maven resolver and again
we're adding persistence and
initializing CDI within our application
and we can merge in all this information
to build our archive which are going to
be deploying to the server and the test
becomes slightly more complex something
that we've all learned pretty much not
to do in unit testing is order your
tests in an EE environment that's not
necessarily friendly rather than
recreate your environment several times
will create it once and we'll test
things in order to ensure that the
application workflow is actually going
to work so if you're testing for example
a website you might want to test some
input and then rebeck that input and
also check that that input was a persist
into your database and those things need
to be done in order you couldn't do them
in any other way and so we have an in
sequence annotation which just basically
tells us we're going to be doing a test
in a particular order and again if i run
this
you can see again the application is
being deployed to our production
environment slightly more information
being generated by the tests and finally
the server shutdown
so just moving on to another more
complex scenario and this is where we're
really pushing everything to the limit
and this is what we want to do with our
application testing we need to push it
to the limit and so everything we need
to push our applications the limits
provided for us initially that this
looks quite nasty compared to the last
one but what we're actually doing is
dynamically building our web descriptor
so we can actually build pretty much
every element that you need to build for
your application through the descriptors
in a dynamic fashion so you're each test
contest as you want to test your you
don't need to define web.xml files for
the test environment but you could do
that if you wanted to and import those
rather than build it dynamically here
this is just to demonstrate the fact
that you can do it dynamically obviously
if you've got multiple tests this
implementation could come from somewhere
else so you can be generating this web
descriptor in your test suite for
different scenarios again we're
importing some may even coordinates
we're building a shrink wrap and this is
where I start to experiment with some
mocking and and that's without using
mojito or any kind of fancy framework
nothing to stop you using makita if you
want to continue using mojito the
problem I see often with mojito is
people test mockito rather than test
their application it's very easy to stub
out some serious information that you
actually should be testing in your in
your real environment so this mock here
is basically a class that I've defined
and I am producing the information I
understand what I'm testing and I'm
governing what I'm testing and where I'm
testing so this is sidestepping any kind
of mock framework
and putting the onus on myself to
actually test the correct information
again we're adding some persistence now
this persistence this can be done on a
test by test basis so it can be a test
resource you'd have your production
persistence environment you can have a
test for persistence environment you're
just adding those resources to your test
scopes and I'm also providing a beans
XML file that tells me I'm going to be
used an alternative class so i could
separate my production book service
however my production book services is
part of my application i don't want to
create a separate library for this but
what I'm testing it I can't use the
production one because it's going to the
production database so I'm creating my
mock and defining a here as an
alternative for use within my test and
that's about as complicated as mocking
something gets in our Killian again
nothing to stop you using mojito it just
makes things more complicated
again we'll run this test
inicia become yet now familiar you'll
see this every time you're testing what
we're not doing with this testing is
replacing everything else you're testing
this is complimenting your test
environment this should be your end
Stadium this should be your goal is to
put everything together and deploy it to
the application and test it
so you can see it's generating a huge
amount of information everything's been
produced as it should be and tested
against my application server as it
should be windows I happen to be a
Windows fan I'm sorry
so now we move on to something that I
can talk about but unfortunately not
able to demonstrate unless as lack or
Alex have a magic solution for our
Killian cube so what are the things that
was destroyed last night and I've been
trying to fix all morning unfortunately
I'm being able to fix it however we can
talk about it I can show you how its put
together and I can assure you that it
does work in a working environment this
is unfortunate not a working environment
so here is the arquillian xml file which
we've seen and what we're doing is
actually defining the arquillian cube
extension so there are many extensions
available for the Arcadian environment
the cube environment is just one of one
of many has actually been written by
anacs otoe who's sat in the front here
so I'm kind of hoping you might be able
to get some kind of demo for you
basically we're defining our extension
and what this is doing is defining how
we're going to be talking to our
document so recently we've got the
docker machine which is supposed to have
made everything much much easier to use
in the doctor environment that's not
being my experience this morning
unfortunately but basically the docker
machine is an API that we can talk to
that deploys docker images the goal here
is then really to define a docker image
that is going to be as close to your in
production environment as possible so
we've already seen how r Killian tests
against our application server our
application server can be built I'm
going to invite Alex upper in a minute
anyway to talk but it is the example
running it's the same example okay same
example we'll just swap this is good
magic this is much much smaller than
mine I've been nudged several times to
get rid of it but you know how you sort
of fall in love with your pc and you
don't want to let it go and there's lots
of stuff on there you know it's going to
take you weeks and weeks and weeks now
and we go into presentation mode on this
do you know the key combination for it's
a big enough can everyone read that okay
okay so we basically got our darker
extension that's the only thing that
we're adding to our Killian XML file
we're using here a tomcat container I'm
not going to experiment that now i'm not
here to sell you Tommy in any way so
yeah basically all we've done here is
we've taken an existing kelly an xml
file and we added the doctor extension
and these are configuration parameters
that are telling us we're going to be
firing up a particular image so darker
compose so what we've got is a yet
another markup language file I don't
know where you chose Alex yamel
basically here we're defining the image
and this is an image that is going to be
on on docker hub so what we can do is
deploy our production images to a
repository they don't need to be
dahab obviously you can have your local
repository in your own development
environment and you can provide as many
different images as you need to test the
games the goal here is to use docker to
build an image that contains as much of
your own production environment as
possible as I said previously you might
have something like a SI p back-end you
don't want to be licensing SI p just to
be testing and you shouldn't really be
testing against the production SI p
anyway so in your doc image you're going
to be mocking your back-end services but
the rest of it is going to be as close
to your production bone as possible
including all the databases and docker
cube is capable of firing up multiple
containers so you don't need to have one
big fat image with all your production
environment enclosed you can have it
spread across several different images
and there's a configuration parameter
within cube that says I want to fire up
container a container be contain the sea
and then finally my test container in
order this is quite a long process and
again it's not designed to replace
anything it's designed to complement
your existing test environment your very
last test your very last integration
unit functional test should be deployed
to this server to test
I need my glasses I can't see this
oh come on i'm sure my agent how do i
right click in on a mac is it a double
to know I'm not getting this oh here we
go oh okay this is this not running
you also have a german keyboard i'm
sorry dev d EP v victor victory
right okay this is this is one way of
doing things you can configure docker to
actually start your container for you
this is one that's actually connecting
to an existing container so you would
have your dacha containers running in
the background prior to starting the
test what that is doing is firing up the
application server and when cube fires
up it actually does all the shrink-wrap
does all the testing that we've just
seen and it deploys it to the server
that's running on your docket image okay
and I'm gonna still struggle with that
hey learn quickly
no way I mean that's just so very easy
I've been fighting that for like four
hours this morning no sleep this is the
exact same program running on my system
but it's not firing for some reason well
we know the reason is windows that's
kind of why I like windows because many
many of my customers actually use
windows in their development environment
we're all deploying to a unix-based
environment that's that's fine but
particularly in Germany a lot of
developers are still developing you know
in a windows environment and you cannot
get away from there and I kind of found
that you know when you're developing the
windows environment I used to have a
Linux box and I had a virtual windows
and that works to a certain degree but
when you're testing stuff like this it's
kind of proof in the pudding that
sometimes it doesn't work and you
actually to run and test on a real
window system so that's that's my
principal reason for staying on a
windows box but I have actually got a
solder a from lugging this thing around
this week so maybe for Christmas John
Louise going to change my mind he's the
one that lasts the loudest well
basically here again it looks very
simple on screen but obviously what's
going on in the background here is we've
had our docker image fired up that SAT
there in the background waiting for us
on remote ports and our test has put
everything together it's deployed it to
that remote server in that remote docket
image and its return those results and
we've got a pass and this is basically
the power of docker cube and thanks very
much for Alex for providing me with a
with a demo environment that's pretty
much it we're early I said
you know my slides went through pretty
quick at the start we've got 20 minutes
for questions or you could all go and
get a drink drink unfortunately is no
free beer yet unless unless Red Hat's
got some stash downstairs so yeah open
questions any questions and don't forget
we've got a slack and Alec here or the
lead developers of this actual
technology they're going to be doing
their talk later today oh you do it
yesterday I missed that because i was
doing this um yeah any questions no
questions okay
okay I'm going to repeat your question
because we do have a microphone up here
but the question is are we are we able
to start the container and leave the
container running is guessing what I
said yeah so we can still we can start
the container we can run multiple tests
against a running container so we're not
actually starting and stopping the
container for the whole test suite we
could start the container at the bidding
beginning of our entire test suite and
shut it down at the end of that test
suite that's obviously entirely up to
you how you would configure that but yes
we can do that ok what's your production
server jboss ok so this is again one of
the selling points of Tommy you might
want to plug those guys and you know I
we're not in competition with anyone
everyone complements each other your
choice of application server is your
choice of application server obviously
I'm a fan of Tommy but this is quite a
big deal with the minus one you're
actually not able to run tests in
parallel on a JBoss because it doesn't
have this feature of random port testing
in fact if we can find it in here are
you injecting the resource in this oh
you've got the URL yet ok yes so there
are several annotations provided when
the within the archaean framework so you
can inject the environment you're
testing against and one of those is the
IEP and and the port number so in your
test your client knows how to
communicate with that remote server and
again with this parallel testing your
testing against several servers all
running in parallel that's very quick
but to solve your current problem
that the best option would probably be
to start the server at the beginning of
the test suite and stop it at the end
welcome anymore
just like a lightweight container
comparison to just thank Michael
application starting today
okay so you're this is the environment
that we're talking about at the
beginning which is where you're defining
your own environment you're building
your own environment this quite easy for
you to build and define your own
environment on your own system but then
when you want to hand that over to
someone else on their machine you're
going to have to rebuild that
environment that test environment for
that other developer and you're going to
have to do that for all of your
developers whereas here all you're doing
is shipping a maven file so you give
them a maven pom in a project and it
will define the entire environment for
them it will download all the
dependencies it will download the
application server so you you can build
this environment yourself or you can
achillion build your environment for you
that's the advantage of our Killian you
don't have to you don't have to download
anything yourself manually you don't
have to install anything yourself
manually all you're doing is telling the
king and how to do it for you so yeah
that's that's at the biggest advantage
over creating your own manual testing
environment you're defining a an
automated testing environment you might
want to change your application server
that's a way down the road kind of so
that scenario that's probably really
pretty rare but what's not rare is you
have one test the environment and then
you have your production environment so
you might have a JBoss in your testing
environment and a websphere in your
production environment and you're not
going to fire up a websphere for
licensing issues so you know trying to
configure that rebuild that test
environment it's done very very simply
by just simply swapping out your
container so it's just one change in a
pond and it will download everything and
build everything for you is that okay
yes there's actually it's a good
question are we able to see our database
with data prior to our tests yes we can
there's another arquillian extension
which is specifically designed to see
databases prior to actually firing up
the test so and again that is database
