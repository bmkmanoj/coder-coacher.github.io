everyone my name is Adnan and this is my
colleague Steven and we're very happy to
be here today we work for a company
called for each which is based just
about a mile from here and we build
custom web applications what we mean by
a custom web application it could be
anything going from a set of
micro-services a crud application a more
complex platform for multiple sites but
basically anything that does not really
fit with your out-of-the-box CMS things
that needs some serious coding but has
the web as a common denominator we've
been doing so for many years and a large
part of our company we use the spring
ecosystem to build those applications
now throughout the years when you build
a lot of custom projects for customers
you notice that there's often the same
things that you need usually site
features so after a while we started
building our own modules on top of
Spring Framework and we after a while we
decided because they were really helping
us out internally to get stuff done but
we're not in the business of creating
commercial products so we decided to
open-source them and put them available
for free for everybody who wants to use
them and we've published them or we
published them under the name across so
they've been really helpful to us and we
want to give a small illustration in
what sparked they in what parts they've
been helping us out and we want to do
that today in this live coding session
what we want to show is we want to show
you how some of the modules help us
tackle two typical challenges that we
occur in larger
some of larger applications that we make
the first one is creating an
administration user interface for your
domain model but really especially in
applications were actually the
administration user interface or the
effort for the administration user
interface is secondary like the focus of
the application might really be on the
domain model and on building a solid API
that goes out there but sometimes it
might also have to do with timing
because in the beginning of the project
we create the entities we create the
domain and we start really focusing on
the API because that's what we need to
integrate with different partners so
there's really not much time for an
admin UI but we still need something
quite often right so what happens is
often we end up with something like this
I'm sure that we've all seen this and by
the way this is not a fake this is
actually a front-end form that was
created that we use on our booth during
the Deaf Hawks and to be fair it's not
even that bad right the text boxes have
placeholders and the labels were
clickable and things like that but still
it's not really an ideal admin UI not
really something you can confront your
users with it's not very high quality or
user friendly so you may have better
ways to deal with that and a second
challenge that we want to we often
encounter and that we want an
illustrated a is the problem of adding
some basic web CMS features to web app
but again when the web app itself is
really not about basic standard CMS
functionality it might be a completely
custom product catalog where almost all
the data comes from different system
services whatnot but they would like you
have that and you have very nice
front-end but then still towards the end
of the project maybe somebody from legal
comes by and says oh yeah by the way in
the footer
you will need like a legal notice link
and there needs to be a page behind that
and and marketing says oh yeah we need
the contact page of course it's still a
website right so we need a contact page
and so can you add that so what happens
then often because since it's so like
and not really the focus of the project
it tends to get forgotten and the result
is usually then if you're lucky the
developers create like a small system
where you can have text boxes and you
can part paste your HTML code in there
if you're unlucky it actually gets added
in the template and it can only be
changed upon a deploy which really costs
developer time in fact and that's not
something we like so we really want to
show you how we got a lot of help and
use a different way of approaching these
and of course you want to illustrate how
we use these across modules to do that
so the rest of this presentation will be
live coding right what we'll be passing
by is some mainly spring stuff some
spring MVC some spring data some JPA and
a bit of time leaf templating which we
very much prefer none of that in-depth
and we will not really take time to
explain a lot of things but I hope
everybody can follow even more if you
have your laptop and you feel like it
and you're a fast typer you can keep up
with certain snippets there's not too
many you can code along will use a
starting point actually online to get
started because I'm going to glance over
a whole lot of details during this talk
because we have limited amount of time
and I really just want to illustrate how
we practically use it but there's a
website which we use as a starting point
where you can find all the documentation
and a whole lot more of details on how
it works and how you can use it so let's
go to the coding and since I'm not a
very good coder or handy keyboard
over to my colleague Steven he doesn't
talk much it's better that way okay so
this is the if yeah you'd probably need
to drag it to that screen so this is the
website across lot for each w/e and
we'll actually start from there there's
a get started button at the top because
like all the cool kids in town if you
know start spring I oh you also have an
app initializer which helps us generate
a project so what this does is we
configure a project we named project
deaf Fox and we're just going to add
some modules to create a starting
application which we will build upon so
let's add web across web support you
want to build yeah we want to add a
message source we want to sample at this
point administration UI so we're going
to add an admin web module which gives
us a basic secure section I want to have
some sample entities so I'm gonna add an
entity manager with some example
entities these are the ones we'll build
upon and I want to add the entity module
and that's it we're generating the
project so what this does if you're
familiar with start springing out
basically the same principle it yeah
this is probably going to take a little
bit longer because the screens were
switching which we didn't take into
account but this actually gives us a zip
file containing a maven project it it's
configured as a spring boot application
and the cross application runs as a
spring boot application so all Stephen
is doing now is unzipping that zip file
and he is going to import it in IntelliJ
which is everybody's favorite IDE
nowadays it it seems so while that is
importing we'll have a very quick glance
at the project structure first so what
we got here depending on the settings I
checked write some code got added and I
added some sample code when you add some
sample code
we add some additional comments
explaining certain things so the
important thing for this talk is the
sample code has added a simple blog
domain right with two entities a blog
entity and an author and the blog is
written by an author so if we look at
the author entity it's really a simple
very simple JPA entity there's some
Lombok annotations that we used and
author repository is a spring data JPA
repository right the whole setup comes
with a local h2 database when we are
developing so this is the stuff we're
actually going to work on the most
important part of the application itself
is like the same the central devoxx
application class people familiar with
spring boot will recognize this right
away
because it's not really a spring boot
application it's an across application
that runs as a spring boot application
important thing here is we can see those
modules that we selected we can see some
of those here so let's start up the
application now when starting in a cross
application the first thing you always
want to do is enable the DEF spring
profile because that activates
development mode development mode does
things like automatic resource reloading
templates integrates with spring def
spring boot dev tools but it also allows
other modules to like provide developer
orient functions if they if they want to
do that so we're starting up the
application the first time it takes a
little bit more time because the local
database gets created because the
example code also adds some insert some
sample entities so we're started why
don't we go to localhost 8080 doesn't
embed a tomcat in there like the default
the spring bootie applications so the
tomcod gives us a 404 which is normal we
didn't add any front-end controllers but
we were simulating a crud application in
this case we did that admin web so admin
web by default configure is a secured
section under the path slash admin which
is configurable
so that's great and here we can login
with a very secure user name and
password admin admin which is configured
in the example configuration so we don't
go to production like that
so when logged in we see that their
stuff in our admin already we have the
orange here it's yellow orange developer
tools that's an example of entity module
providing extra functionality if
development mode is enabled it allows us
to debug certain things and then we have
this menu called entity management and
there we have an author and a blog post
section so if you click on author what
we see here is the imported authors from
the sample data if we click on Bob post
we actually see the blog post if we do
create a blog post we get a form for
creating a blog post where we can add an
author like that
now again I'm going to glance over a
whole lot of details pretty much
everything can be changed but I really
want to show some specifics so let's
assume that we have this model of a blog
post and author we have that it's maybe
from a different library even we can't
touch those and these we have them in
our application but in our small
blocking engine we want to we have a
particular case we have a blogging
engine and we're going to have guest
authors now unfortunately they don't
work for free they are going to send
invoices and I really want to be able to
manage those invoices in this system so
I can see the relationship between the
author and the invoice so let's add a
small invoice entity to our domain so we
go into the code and we're just going to
add package called invoice and we're
going to add two things an invoice
entity and a spring data repository for
it so if the god of snippets is with us
this should go pretty quickly there we
go so all we do is we create a new
entity the add data annotation islambol
creates getter setters things like that
so an invoice has a unique ID it is from
an author that Sen
the invoice and this for a particular
blog post we have received it at a
certain date and of course there's an
amount of money and that is being
invoiced and we can give an invoice as
status I never refused invoices so we
received reprove them or we actually pay
them optionally we can also add a note
an additional description what note
that's a simple entity the two things
special about this entity is that it's
implementing the persistable interface
which is basically required to use the
spring data JPA repository and so that's
something from spring data and the
second thing is that we added the custom
get label method that that generates a
more simple descriptive label invoice
get ID that's it simple entity we still
need repository so let's add our invoice
repository which as well nothing more
but your basic spring data JK repository
nothing special about it that implements
JP a repository and JP a specification
executor for defining custom queries if
you would so like and a silly method
that counts all the invoices by author
which we'll use later on in this example
so that's it we've created our entity
now we don't want to be busy with
defining a schema right now the other
schema was installed through a liquid
base so we're just going to change the
setting on hibernate adding that
hibernate should actually update the
schema automatically upon restart
alright and and now you can probably
just recompile and the application
should get restart because spring boot
dev tools is active okay great
application restarted let's refresh the
interface and now we see we have an
invoice menu option as well which is
giving an exception it is a demo
just scroll down there is no there is no
backup plan added a typo in the
hibernate properly okay alright now we
need to restart I think because I know
it detects a scene all right but we
already saw that the entity got picked
up and isn't user-friendly interface now
it is working let's see if we can
actually create a new invoice and we see
immediately that we get a form or we can
already select the author author is
required blogpost is required let's
create an invoice from the across team
for a certain blog post at a date add
some money set status and add a big blob
of text as a note and this will work so
what actually happens is that one module
the entity module that we added to our
system it inspects it builds a meta
model for entities with a default
implementation that inspects bring data
repositories and so this could in fact
be like a MongoDB repository or another
type spring data data repository and it
tries to find the entities from that
builds an entity and metamodel and based
on that meta model is going to try to
generate a user interface for you we've
added the invoice if we go to the list
and we see the invoice there and what's
also interesting to know is if we go to
author for example and we added one for
the across the whiskey author now has a
top invoices where we can see the
invoices attached to that author now
this is again the relationship is
detected based on the types the class
types it can do the automatic filtering
because it detects that there's a
repository that implements JPA
specification execute
is mapped and to entity module stuff and
that works so but let's have a look at
the form and because I think we want to
add a little bit of customization to
that I see author and blog posts are
required but received date is not that's
okay but the amount of money I will
always need we need to make that one
required and I think status is also
required and states can never be know so
I really want to default value on status
so let's see how we can change that and
as first step let's go back to our
entity right because if we look at our
entity we noticed that it has to not no
annotations which has been validation
annotations on author and blog post and
these were actually inspected to
determine that the controls should be
not only rendered as a required value
but also actually behave as if a value
is required meaning it doesn't offer the
option to enter an empty value so if we
add a nominal on our amount and on our
status then they will become required
also status I would like a default value
which just makes sense right and just to
show you bean validation let's say I am
not very good at business and I do not I
only want actual invoices to receive
invoices that I need to pay a down
receive credit notes or the amount needs
to be at least zero or more right now
there's one more thing just to
illustrate how annotations can make a
difference if we go quickly back to the
form if we select a date we can see that
there is actually date and timestamp
there but that does not make much sense
I'm really only interested in knowing at
what date I received the invoice so I
don't even want to persist the timestamp
in the database so I'll add the temporal
annotation from Java's persistence
so with that we can actually tell the
entity manager that it should only
persist the date so what we did now is
we added some annotations if we simply
recompile and reload go back to our form
I think it's already done so now you see
difference right we see that amount is
required status is required and
prefilled with received and if we select
receive date we can see that there's no
more timestamp because those annotations
were inspected to determine how the
control should be rendered if we let's
say let me try to create a new for
different author different blog post and
and different amount of money why not
okay if let's put the amount now try to
save it with the amount negative no
that's not gonna work
well that would not gonna work but
that's gonna give a different exception
right so we see that also the minimum
validation is now the validation is
actually done by the annotations it just
hooks up with the default annotation
validator that spring provides so so far
we've customized the behavior of the
form and layout of the form simply by
adding sensible annotations to our
entity right but sometimes you can't
change the entity or you don't want to
put pure front-end behavior in your
entity so there's there's other ways
that we can extend let's give an example
let's have a look at the amount now
amount is in this case it's stored as a
big decimal we're going to keep it that
way but I know it's always going to be
an amount of money in Europe right so I
want to in the front end I always wanted
to behave as a currency so what we want
to say is we want to tell entity module
that it should configure the property of
amount to always in all its forms when
it's rendered to display as a currency
so how can we do that well externalizing
configuration and changing it
we can do by creating a simple spring
component which is usually a
configuration class though it does not
really need to be which implements an
interface called entity configure now
entity configure gives us a single
method it actually gives us access to
the entity's metadata builder which and
it allows us to change all metadata of
all entities and you can have as many
configures as you want throughout your
system and they can all build on each
other so in this case what we want to do
is we want to change the invoice entity
and we want to configure the properties
so when we call properties we get access
to the properties build consumer so I'm
going to say we wanted the property
amount we want to have it behave as a
currency and the easiest way to do that
is to specify an attribute of currency
class with the actually currency values
there's no more ways to do that that one
is the easiest one why does that work
because the amount is actually number
type and the default controls for number
type will inspect for certain attributes
or configurations for the front-end and
based on that determine how they want to
display so we add that recompile if we
now go back to the application to our
form open new form we can actually see
that is now prefixed with Euro sign this
is a custom jQuery numeric control so
it's really not like we need to enter
the Euro sign manually in the text box
in order two decimal places even more if
you go to ListView now you'll see that
there as well the amount is rendered in
exactly the same way so this is a very
externalized a configuration of an
entity property so an other example of
doing that and the more slightly more
specific way let's have a look at the
status which is now a select box however
I know
only gonna beat restate these statuses
so basically it's easier if it's a radio
right so let's turn the status property
into radio and exactly well in more or
less the same way we'll change another
property of the invoice which is status
and now we want to say we want to
configure the mode but it's not
attribute in this case we want to
specifically for when the status control
is being rendered we want to enter the
module to generate a different UI
component now your Y component in the
concept of an T module is called a few
element I think the attribute method
needs to be the view element mode right
so what we say is the view element type
for the control mode should be the radio
buttons now the bootstrap UI elements
radio that's just a string that's just a
unique identifier because there's a
another module bootstrap UI module that
for certain types of strings will
generate bootstrap compatible markup
components but you could basically be
anything you can replace the entire
layer of the components being generated
if somebody would want to build a
foreign based interface for example that
should be entirely possible so if we go
back now we should see there we go that
we get radio buttons instead and it's
still if you save you need to prove that
it still works right so these are two
ways of the many ways that we can change
configuration externally but so far
we've done that for the entity as a
whole now let's go to the list view and
let's say that I want to change the list
view because I notice on this list view
that note is being shown but that might
be a big blob of text I really don't
want that one on there and I can also
see that I can sort on the columns again
that's something because we implement
JPA specification executors in spring
data and that that works out of the box
but by default list view is not sorted I
think it's interesting if it's by
default sorted on receive date
so let's customize only the ListView so
how can we do that we go back to our
entity configure and on the still on the
entity invoice now we scope to the
ListView builder and on the ListView
builder we can say show properties and
we want to say because we're lazy show
all the currently configured properties
which is represented by dot except the
note except is with the tilde so we're
saying all the current properties except
note and we want to apply a default sort
on the received a property that's it
let's go back open a new list view and
we should see that it's sorted by
default and note has disappeared from
the view there we go we can still sort
on other columns that's not a problem we
just changed the defaults of ListView
so we've seen a way of customizing the
invoice entity the entity that we added
but we can do a little bit more still
let's say back to the original
proposition I have my blog entity I have
my offer and did they come from
elsewhere right I can not change those
entities however on the author list view
I'd like to add the phenomenally useful
field of seeing how many invoices that
there are for that author so I can't
change the entity I cannot add on the
entity so what I can do is I can define
a fake property on the author entity so
if we again entity configure is the
starting point only now we'll we're
going to create an entity sorry a
property which actually fetches the data
of which how many invoices there are
from a different component in this case
the repository so how we gonna do that
well first we're going to scope our
entity's configuration builder to the
author class and again we go into the
properties and now he's simply going to
define a property with the name
representing the number the total number
of invoices total invoices
we go and say the property type of that
property is an integer because it's just
gonna give me a count and at the minimum
if I don't want to configure much I can
just give a value fetcher which is
basically a functional interface giving
for the author the value that I want to
put there and in this case yeah did you
use yeah I think you need to not only
snapshot I think you need to define it
the old way the next release supports
the lambdas but there was a in this
version there's like a typing type
inference problem so it should be a bit
of uglier hacking well syntax wise right
so same thing we just say value fetcher
we get in an offer we know it's an offer
and we return the count so all we did
now is redefine the property on offer we
didn't specify anything more on that
property which means that by default the
property is readable not writable and
default list views add all properties
that are readable show them by default
unless they are hidden so with nothing
special then it shows readable
properties if we go to the list view we
now see that property total invoices
which gets its data from somewhere
completely else got added as the last
thing I want to show in this part of the
demonstration the label on top right
that's not very user friendly we didn't
define a display name in code so it just
uses the property name
luckily pretty much any label you see be
it the form label you description
placeholder anything comes through
message codes and if you know the
message code you can change any label
and that's documented in the reference
documentation so we have a default
message source which is configured we
selected that so in this case our label
for the entity is well the module where
the entity belongs to and this called
devoxx application module you want to
access an entity
and the entity's name is author you want
to access a property of author and
property is total invoices and we want
to give it a nicer label that's it so
this is just a glimpse of all the
possibilities that you have because you
have very little amount of time and
there's enormous things you can do with
it you can create custom views hide
stuff
add custom controls but this really
helps us in very quickly generating a
pretty decent basic user interface and
customizing that it's not of course a
total tool for the fully optimized user
interface experience it's not meant for
that but because when you need that you
probably have a separate project with
time and budget to be able to do that
right but this and the module really
helps us in generating good user
interfaces with a very small amount of
effort that's the backend of our
blocking engine let's see about moving
on to the front and side right remember
the second case adding some basic web
CMS features to an application that is
you know not really web CMS focused so
what Stephen is doing now he is just for
time sake he is switching to a different
project he has already prepared just so
we don't have to download an unpacked
but what we actually did is we went to
generate project again and we select
like there's a preset website with
custom back-end you just select that one
leave all the samples on and to generate
and then you get this you can see
there's some more modules added in there
but if you look at the domain we will
still see again our author and blog post
exactly the same a difference is there's
a web package that contains like the
block controller maybe you can open the
block controller which is standard
spring MVC controller which renders the
blog post and there's some time leave
templates for visualizing the output so
let's just start up this this
application and this
we will get a front end included from
the sample code
first startup alright let's go to
localhost 8080 there we go front ends
these are the teachers of our blocks I
believe we can older posts or click
through on one yep
that's a pretty heavy image it seems
comes from the net but work so this is
actually a fully functional block
application so this is the the front end
which is nice let's have a little look
at the back end again
admin module is in there so we get same
type thing the same level of security in
the example okay now you see a couple
more things right yeah the demo
controller is an example we see in the
entity management section we see user
module got added that's because we added
that one that that one provides a simple
user domain we're not going to go deeper
in that one our module is now called our
application module is called differently
simply because we named the application
differently but entities are exactly the
same and the web CMS module is added now
a web CMS module is well as name implies
is a module that provides some basic web
CMS features and one of those is a web
component which can serve as a simple
building blocks for slicing up your
templates and making them dynamic so for
example let's create a new web component
I mean again this is not a full-fledged
CMS it's not supposed to be this is just
the module adding some basic features
let's maybe create an HTML component
let's call it footer or test footer and
we can you get a small code mirror
component which allows us to enter some
HTML with some simple highlighting ok so
we created a component basically
manageable by the user it's stored in
the in the database let's go to the home
page and if we look at the footer now
let's say how can I get my component to
render in the footer instead of that
very nice icons I want my ugly
header right so how can we do that well
the footer is part of the layout time
leaf template so let's go to that one
let's scroll down to the footer okay so
here we have the the footer markup and
to make it to turn it into a component
to render the component instead all we
have to do is add an attribute and say
then give it the name of the component
this is because web CMS module comes
with a time leaf dialect we really like
time leaf comes at a time leaf dialect
and we just say name of the component
this test footer if we refresh the page
we see that our footer has now been
replaced by our custom component on
every page since it's in the default
layout if we go back to the backend and
delete our component Naumann then we
will see that we get the original
template again right not very practical
it's not very practical if to turn
things into dynamic components we would
have to go to the markup get to snip it
out put it in the script or manually
copy it in the admin interface right not
very handy luckily we don't have to do
that we can actually get the components
or to create it upon first render how do
we do that well we go back to the time
leaf template and we can add some
additional attributes we're going to say
we want this to auto create this
component and we want to how to create
this component as a global component
shared across all pages and of course
when we're out to creating a component
we might want to specify a type of
component that should be out to create
it in this case HTML that's it
refresh the page and we should see
nothing has changed however if you go to
the backend we get our test footer again
if we edit the footer we can now
actually see that the time leaf markup
got processed and the result of that got
imported in our default component so
when I change that I save I go back to
the page I refresh I can see that my
changes are immediately there if ever I
want to switch back to the original
template markup I can just delete my
component and it will it will get
created again of course global
components are only so so useful on my
home page I have a nice hero section
hero section the large image with the
title above and I'd want to be able to
to change the hero text but I only want
to be able to do that for this
particular page so basically what I want
to do is I want to link components only
to a specific page now to be able to do
that I can do that but I need some kind
of an entity in the backend to which the
components can be linked luckily web CMS
has basic entities one of which is page
for obvious reasons so what we're going
to do now is we're just gonna create a
page record call it home page name does
matter not going into many of the
details here and we are going to map it
on the root path of the website why does
it happen this way because actually a
page can have many many URLs pointing to
the same page which can be useful for
SEO purposes so now we created the page
and and you can see there's web
components tab we can add components to
that page however let's go to our block
controller if we look at the home page
method that's still a basic spring gap
mapping right so there's no notice yet
no knowledge of the fact that a page
needs to be loaded so the entity doesn't
get loaded so the components could not
get detected so what we can do is
because simply in this case replace the
get mapping by our web CMS page mapping
to the path by simply doing this it will
work for all HTTP methods and any URL
that points to that page will end up in
this handler method if I were to only
want it for post methods I could just
leave an outpost nothing mapping there
you can combine in many ways so our
controller method now
knows that it should load the page
entity we define the page entity so now
we can attach components to them right
so if we go to the time leaf template we
can go to the hero block and on the side
heading while we declared as a component
hero text or something you know how to
create in this case we want to specify
an attribute called the scope because we
only want a hero text component from
attach directly to the page to be taken
into consideration because there's a
hierarchy I could define a footer
component on my page and it would
override the one on the global so in
this case I don't want that kind of
behavior only if it's attached to the
page and I want to say let's take a rich
text because this is just your heading
and if i refresh no visual result
however component has been added to the
page and if I make changes to the title
they will persist immediately again
minor changes to the template but no
actually immediate visual differences
when we rendering but when an
flexibility for making changes now of
course HTML component rich text
component they're basically exactly the
same the only difference is how you
enter them in the backend there are only
so-so useful there's another component
called container which is as the name
implies which allows you to add multiple
components and reorder them so let's put
that one to some use as a final example
let's say I want to add I want to be
able to add content on the home page at
the bottom so what I want to do is I
want to put the header and the main
content class inside a container block
so I'm going to create a custom th block
tag which actually doesn't render the
tag only the body of the time
and I'm gonna say that that one is a
component of type section positions
sorry with name section positions and
the type is a container we're going to
out create a component attach it
directly to the page and there's an
additional attribute here parse
placeholders because the two existing
blocks in there we are now going to
define as placeholders if we have a look
at the container this is actually
dynamic time leaf right this iterates
over our blog posts makes decisions and
renders the different teasers so I
cannot make this static so I am going to
both the header I'm going to add a
different tag and say this is a
placeholder there's a bit too many I
think you know and I'm going to do the
same on container and say this is a
placeholder with a main content or
teasers or let's reload the page I see
no difference if we go to the back end
now I can see that I have a container of
section positions in there I have two
components header teasers let's add
let's see if we can add an image right
as image component is also a basic
component in this case Steven has hooked
it up with a cloud inari and image CDN
account okay if I reload the page I
should see my image added at the bottom
and what's really cool about this is I
can start shifting the dynamic parts
about why don't we try if we can like
move the teasers to the top of the page
and the header to the bottom warning the
result will not be very pretty
okay but actually we shifted layout
we've managed to almost make the entire
layout of the homepage configurable
without changing very much of our
template which is really nice in time
lifters because time leave very much
supports natural templating which can
quite handy if your designers can from
tennis can work with that
so the the original template can stay as
much as possible in its original state
but we can add attributes to actually
have sections customizable from a back
end so I hope to give you an
illustration of how the entity module
can help us quickly generate basic user
interfaces with a reasonable level of
quality and user friendliness and at the
same time how web CMS module can helps
us when we need some basic web CMS
features in one of our applications we
can simply plug that one in and we get
some pretty powerful stuff of course
most of our things are focused towards
developers so you need to have some
technical know-how to set it up that's
very deliberate but then it's pretty
user friendly towards end-users from the
get-go so I hope this piqued your
interest again there's a URL across for
ease of a way you can a central starting
point all documentation full list of all
possible modules and yeah if you have
any questions we'll still be down here
for a couple of minutes and otherwise I
think the floor is open until 8:00 this
evening so we have a booth on the
exhibition floor it's the one with the
race car so feel free to drop by there
if you have any questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
