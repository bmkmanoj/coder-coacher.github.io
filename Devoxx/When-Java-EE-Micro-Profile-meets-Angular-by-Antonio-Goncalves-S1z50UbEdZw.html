Gonzalez if you live in Portugal Antonio
Goncalves is live in front and Tania
Goncalves if you want to you know go on
the other countries in the planet who
speak English yes I am a Java champion
yes I do love backhand why because I
hate front-end so it's not like we don't
have a lot of choices
I've studied Java in 97 67 writing
applets they were ugly then I did HTML 2
and HTML 3 and 4 that was ugly and then
I did JSF because I'm a Java EE guy and
everything was ugly so then I thought
let's stick to the backend I usually do
this talk with a friend of mine he's a
Microsoft guy actually I'll talk a
little bit on Microsoft later on is what
we call the truth tag dev so is not
back-end neither front-end either he's
trying to do his best like like everyone
of us so we usually do this talk because
I am the back-end guy and is the
front-end guy so he's not here that I
have to acknowledge that we usually do
that in pairs because I'm going to talk
to you about Java in angular and as I
say I have 20 years of experience of
Java but I only have 20 weeks of
experience of angular so I'll talk about
angular but please do not ask any
questions
first of all thank you you know I've
been giving a lot of talks throughout
the planet in different countries
different languages and whatever
yesterday our the pleasure to do that
and we can feel we are in a very special
place and thank you I feel you know I'm
here to talk about angular in JavaScript
things like meaningless compared to to
those things so thank you for having me
here
so I'm gonna talk about a true story but
because true stories can't be told
because of customers projects code
etcetera etcetera
I'm actually gonna lie a little bit but
this is based on a true story back-end
Java micro services kind of thing
angular front end distributed teams that
was the project I was working for so to
do this talk we are to cheat Sebastian
and I so we just took the devoxx
application actually where you can see
the talks or the conference where you
can see the speakers where you can vote
for talk so instead of taking the
business code of my customer we just
slide a little bit but I wanted to show
you things this is quite a complex
architecture because yes I'll be showing
you different services completely
isolated one from another each one has
its own DB its own business model and so
on and yeah we do have a front end and a
proxy in the middle and of course
registries etc etcetera so this is the
app I'm going to show you but it's based
on a true story let's call it the
conference apps and I will put the
github link at the end so you
go and have a look but you know
everything is on is on github so this is
the front end so you can see that full
stack developer does not mean UI
designer yeah he's just a guy that
appears to make angular and we still
don't have the guy who makes that look
nice but typical application so you have
people attending and because there's
plenty you know you are next your
previous things like that conference are
several rooms so your other rooms you
can come that you are the details then
you are the session so you can look into
it and there's a speaker one or several
speakers so you can click into that and
see the bio of the speaker and with yeah
this one you can also vote so you need
to vote but you need to log in and then
vote so this is the demo application
that I'm going to show you it could be
modeling you know simple that we've
explicitly split that in several service
so we have one service give you all the
information about the speaker another
one gives you information about the room
et cetera et cetera so we try to
complexify that okay so this is the base
now I'm going to slowly build that and
ensure you some bits and pieces are you
know what won't be you know showing
everything that oh sorry I didn't ask
you does Java here okay angular both
okay interesting because I will explain
you why then I am known as oh okay
problem
I am known as a Java EE guy but today I
won't be talking about Java EE I'm more
talking about this new thing called a
micro profile and as you can see there's
no Java EE in the title it's called
Enterprise Java micro profile I'll
explain you why why did we come this
with this idea it's because we all know
that our industry changes a lot and
lately there's two important things that
have happened in the cloud I'm not going
to talk about it
and micro-services I won't be talking
about it either I'm not here to explain
you what is a micro service because like
all of you I do not know I mean but the
idea was okay let's we have to more and
more people are to put things in the
cloud yes it sure that we try to split
things into smaller pieces
and then I will show you at the end when
you do that it's intellectually very you
know appealing to be able to work on
little things but then you have an
entire infrastructure really complex to
to manage and so we thought well let's
talk about this infrastructure you know
why not Java EE has been around for many
many times it does solve a few problems
but not all of them you know now let's
think about the cloud let's think about
micro services what could we do outside
Java EE but still not too far so we have
this idea of micro profile he just
started around beers actually you know
it started at devoxx UK last year so
it's not even a year old we were in
London having beers and talking saying
yeah you know Java is 20 years old me
nearly
they're real they've always been from
micro-services things you know if you
think of the first idea of an EJB of J
or J and D I where you can register
being and another one with air am I not
HTTP but you know where am i and you
could talk
the genesis of java ee is distribution
so there are bits and pieces there but
there's still something missing that's
why throughout the years java ee kept on
involving but we saw different efforts
for people who know JJ both in multi
there's this thing called wildlife swarm
which I'll be using you know as a demo
so I will show you but it's it's of
course comes from Java EE but with a
different mindset so we already had Jay
was doing things outside Java EE
Libertines IBM Pereira Tommy all these
guys coming from Java EE but doing
different things and so we already had a
start Java is already used in micro
services but we can do better that's the
entire idea of this micro profile thing
so what I said it started in June in
London around a few beers and believe it
or not micro profile 1-0 got out in
September the idea was let's focus on
the minimum thing Jack's arrest because
we're doing rest CDI because it's the
basis you know we need a basement and
JSONP for the giant processing then in
december we put that in the Eclipse
Foundation no we didn't go to the JCB we
are working actively on the 1.1 which
will be come soon and we are aiming a
1.2 before the end of the year actually
so just to show you that we are trying
to go faster than the Java EE and the
JTP history so are the said one zero
very basic basically Chuck's eraser CDI
and then JSONP but hey you know trying
to do micro-services there's a lot of
things have to be done still so on one
point one we will add configuration
security based on JSON web token I'm
going to talk about that else check even
for those of you where he had atom VN
talk there there always been some health
check in Java EE but now we're trying to
push that further fault tolerance all
that should be come soon and then a one
point two with River free service
discovery so could break all these
patterns related to micro services okay
so we not talk I'm gonna come I'm going
to show you actually what's happening in
this one point zero even if it's you
know far from we are far from adding all
the pieces I'm going to use this thing
called while slice warm it comes from
JBoss so the people have been using
tables for years that's similar you know
the base code is the same if you look at
the logs they are the same format so you
quite feel comfortable when you come
from the JBoss world so the idea of work
life form is yes it is based on good old
tables any idea is Java EE is this thing
where by design and application server
must implement everything today Java EE
7 is 32 specifications so what we are
saying is you must in tremendous 32
specs
if you implement only 31 bad luck you're
not compliant unfortunately there's
still Koba in Java EE so you know you
must implement go over to be ver
compliant so this idea of hey guys I do
not need everything
so in Java 6 we had this idea of web
profile shrinking the web profile is 14
specifications so good
instead of 432 you would 14 but still
the idea of wall fly swarm and pyaara
and Tommy it's you know put whatever you
need only what you need so swamp comes
with this idea of the fraction I'm gonna
stay in the java ee space so you can
think of a fraction equals to a
specification
I need JTA in CDI that's two fractions
and actually the micro profile as I said
it's Jack's arrest CDI and G's and p3
fractions so in the Java EE one spec one
fraction that's quite easy but there's
other things Josh talked a lot this
morning about ribbon is tricks a lot of
things coming from Netflix spring you
know spring is a fraction on world fly
swarm logstash swagger a lot of things
and so I'm gonna build my micro services
saying I just need a couple of fractions
you know I I do not need the entire
thing how does it work will why fly
swarm the moment because this is not
specified yet every implementation
disease thing pyaara does it differently
Tommy so I'm going to talk about the
specificity of world fly Swan so what
I'm going to show you now is a simple
rest service package in a war file easy
you take the war file you deploy it on
the JBoss that's what we've been doing
for years works
now I'm going to right-size my service
so I'm going to take you the other way
around I do not need the entire JBoss so
I'm going to use a profile I'm still
gonna build a war but I'm gonna use this
profile the Maven profile swarm to say I
need the micro profile fraction jax-rs
CDI in JSONP and please do a bit of
magic in there for me the magic is live
maven to build a war file and take the
war file and put it inside a jar and I'm
gonna you know execute this job so let's
have a look at a demo I'm gonna start
with something small and then I will
show you there the bigger picture so
something small is this is the end point
that gives you the list of the rooms or
the conference so if it's jax-rs the
passage slash rooms and if I have a look
at it it injects so I have CDI
repository which at the moment you know
it's just a map I do not even use JPA
and this room endpoints I can create a
room so I have a post if you get I can
get the entire list of rooms or only one
passing an IV very common rest resting
so if you look at the XML their
packaging is war so if I take hope
everybody can see if I do
maven clean package what's going to
happen well maven is going to build a
wall so if I look targets here is my 27
Ches Rafa but as I said I'm going to use
this magic the swarm profile
saying I only please bundle only the
three fractions that I need here I could
have added one extra JPA or ribbon
districts and please use a bit of magic
use the swamp plugin and I'm telling you
that I'm listening on port 91 91 so here
what I have to do now is clean package
and I'm using the swarm profile what's
going to happen maven is going to build
a war file as usual and look the
Wildlife Swan plugins going to take
slightly longer because is taking the
fractions that I asked for jax-rs the
projector is you need a HTTP server so
we've got a bundle undertone so now if I
look on the target
I feel of mammal war file but what's
going to be interested it's this jar
file 92 Meg's what's inside and the toe
see di Resta jax-rs sorry J NP and my
war file so it will a all the way around
if I unzip this file you can see a walk
inside a jar and not the other way
around
Java jar here we go so I'm just you know
with the cuting a jar file and for
people who know JBoss hey that's more or
less the same logs so you can even
administer that and just to show you
that it's working demo 1 this is my rest
endpoint ok
as Josh this morning would have said
make JA not wha okay but I'm going to
show you is wrong later on okay do not
tell Josh is my friend but he is wrong
and I'll show you why
so okay I talked about the micro profile
the implementation that I'm using wall
flight swarm now let's talk a little bit
about angular another set up 20 weeks of
experience of angular like everyone
because you know regular tool was
released in September so in a nutshell
its component based so for those of you
like me that come from Java EE from JSF
it's a fantastic framework I really feel
at home because everything is a
component like in JSF but a component is
code an HTML so you have this thing
called template and of course you need
some metadata to talk by binding from
the code to the HTML and event from the
HTML to the code when you press a button
because it uses typescript
there's even annotation I know there's
one guy he hates annotation ate
sanitation in Java but now they are in
angular 2 they are in typescript love
them and then if you put a lot of code
in your components you might as well
extract it into a service and guess what
there's injection
it's called injectable there were three
letters short to call it at inject gap
and then to vert is a very good thing
with angular and typescript is you can
put things in two modules like what we
have now with Java 9 so you could click
three components put that in the module
and then tell the other team look here
are the three components and you just
pass around a module so one I'm not
going to talk a lot about angular but
this is a typical component as you can
see it's a class on ameet as you can see
you know what you can think is what's
going to happen once the component is is
initialized post construct if you come
from Java EE same thing
and then look at component so we really
feel at home and we you can even put
attributes and constructors and methods
so this is the business code of my
component and as you can see here that
also the templates there is the HTML
part of the other components so here I'm
pointing saying the component is code
plus a view and the view is HTML with
bits and pieces this is a for loop you
know again if you come from Java EE with
JSP and gstl and Jess have very familiar
so here I'm iterating rooms with the
attributes all my components
I'm just looking through them and of
course I want to display the name of the
room again we feel at home because in
Java EE we have expression language the
pound and and the curly brackets kind of
the same syntax and we have event when
you click on the button that is even
click that it's sent back to the
business code of the component and shows
the room so again we pretty much feel at
home and when your business code is too
complex you extract it from your
components and you put it into a service
what is the service a class with
attribute methods name them and this
injectable thing you know so you now you
have an injectable service another said
you are modules so you can say here I'm
creating a module with my three
components this is component 1 2 3 I'm
importing external components and
providers and exporting things etc etc I
think what I like the most in angular
its typescript I have to be honest I did
try
to go into the GS world you know the
language was too obscure I didn't get
the difference between equal equal equal
and equal equal equal and just like our
Tam much easier with type script love it
so even if I've 20 weeks of experience
in angular I can actually read code
which you know before I would go to a
jazz guy and say you know looks right
and there's a second thing I really love
about angular is angular key I think
that would still missing in the Java
space where we should have created
things like that 20 years ago
I do not know anything about angular I
need to create an app what should I do
they have created an you know work well
a command-line interface actually so you
can create a project from scratch and it
works which is really good you know a
shame we didn't have that in Java EE 20
years ago 10 years ago so that's good
when you start an angular project and
you don't know anything about nothing it
actually works with a few commands I'm
saying works I'm not saying it looks
beautiful two different things
so yeah let me show you what angular
Klee looks like so I'm gonna give you a
demo oops
so here I have my service micro service
venue it's running here I'm gonna leave
it running on port 91 so I can show you
later what I'm gonna do it
am I in the right spot no demo1 okay so
here I have the micro service venue the
one I will show you with the rooms and
sorry I'm gonna cheat a little bit
because as I said are not that confident
with this angular world things change
rapidly in his angular web world so I'm
using the latest greatest beta 32.3 I
was doing that last week and the code
from last week to this week there's a
burger you know it goes really fast
those guys go really fast coming from a
Java EE life cycle you know it just it's
a bit of a shock so let's say ng so
that's for the ng clean new and I'm
gonna give the the project name here
thank God I have the web because for
people who have reached about maven
those guys are worse than us you know
this is downloading the Internet and
it's I will end up with 16 megabytes I
think of line of code just to show it
works at the energy you just you know we
have things to learn from them but I
think there are things to learn from us
good that's why I love about angular
it's now I have this conference web and
it's all that you know when if I do now
I'm not going to do it because I'll have
a port conflict anyway but I could do
yong-ran starts and then you know I have
a web application simple one but you
know it works everything set map package
JSON so that's our Tom XML you know
everything is done this code works which
is really good
I'm gonna leave it like that now just to
show you that that's our SSE main Java
so those guys put everything in RFC app
and um you know the idea is I'm going to
create I'm going to generate a component
my component is called Venu is the idea
which to show the list of the rooms I
have a rest endpoint and now I want a
graphical component to show that and
again with an giclee very easy oh yes
sorry I need to be in in the web and if
I generate a component automatically
it's going to create here a venue
components with the typescript the
components and the HTML okay so yeah if
I do yong-ran start you will see their
new works good so I've set up the basis
there's one team working on the Java
back-end another team working in angular
remote teams we say we love each other
but to be honest when I told my Java
team that they are to install NPM no
Jess young oh no you know not here on
two point one bit so the Java team other
you know difficulties in understanding
the angular team and vice versa so we
used oka good easy that was the killer
feature you know at one point we need to
integrate mocks are graded there's one
point where the angular app has to talk
to all these services so at one point
the Java team would upload the the
docker images and angular team will will
use them docker was perfect you know the
angular guys didn't have to install Java
Nathan you know all these things
brilliant worked good and as I said we
were doing such jars easy what do you
need Java
you explore the port and you copy your
jar file you know what I did
Java - ja that's exactly that and go
Java ChaCha and your fat jar that's what
the Java team docker images were looking
and guys we also asked the angular guys
if you do the docker and for them you
know again really easy you need a web
server you expose a port and you take
the slash deist and you and you put
everything easy but I'm still going to
do one quick demo to show you that my
friend Josh josh Josh Josh long is wrong
because sad jars were very easy you know
to put in the cloud to change etc etc
but when we started to integrate with
angular guys of course things never work
so we had to rebuild 50 times our images
and guess what if you are asked in wha
you know I've showed you that the wall
was I'm not in the right place I've
showed you that then you if I do another
clean package the war file is tiny
27 case if I do a fat jar with
everything in it the jar is much bigger
we go from 27 k2 rather showed you 90
something Meg's why because there's
undertow there's everything in it so the
problem is look at that here I have two
docker files one is executing this jar
okay and the other one is executing a
wall for a while you need the entire
thing you need a Anti JBoss and you just
copy the war file look at that if I go
mavin clean package so I have two
profiles one is docker wha that's going
to build the docker image with this file
so if I do that yes the first time it
will download wall fly from the Internet
that's costs one but then look it's
copying here it's copying a twitter 27k
war file and that's what changes you
know we have bubs
so we have to debug them and build war
files again and again some days we will
be 250 times our dock images 8 seconds
now I'm gonna do I'm gonna ask swarm to
build the fat jar and then ask docker to
build this image and I will go from 8
seconds to much more so make sure not
war
yeah it depends there's a point in
timing your project and for us it was
integration where you spend your day
building docker images and here it's a
simple example but I'm going from 8
seconds to 20 this Russia explosives
when the complexity arises so you know
again we'd used both but between the
Java guys you know it was much easier to
take an executive old jar and just try
things around but with docker when you
are in this docker world copying a
skinny wall its way missed faster than
copying a fat job and if you look at the
images of course the war file is bigger
because you are the entire JBoss plus a
JVM plus the operating systems here I
just have Java but a guys we live in the
docker world you know who cares about
the size of the images there they're all
big anyway so just something to you know
I love Josh but sometimes having skinny
walls are more efficient okay so here we
are we have a back-end guys Java guys
and the front-end guys are we going to
talk well through api's of course
because you know what I said we have all
these micro services they all expose
different things how are we going to you
know we change we go to the web and read
and read and read about you must expose
beautiful api's what's beauty for jason
api's it's something and for the others
it's something else so we spent days and
weeks reading you know what is a
beautiful API very difficult and of
course you end up doing it your way with
inspiration from all the others so
actually we took inspiration from JSON
API so oh yeah and by the way in two
minutes I'm going to tell you the
beautiful api's we don't care anyway and
I will explain you one
so yeah let's build beautiful api's so
when you look at Jason API and most of
them they tell you a resource you know
you should have a s at the end okay
let's do that let's put s at the end and
by the way with the F at the end you're
not going to return 1 million instances
so you're going to bring pages of 10 of
20 so you're going to say give me the
second page give me the third page give
me the second page sort by title sort by
title reverse order comma date so you
have all these things you know building
beautiful APRs is caring about all that
and of course sessions with an S but if
you want one session the session ABC
then you go slash ABC and of course it's
a bit more complex because when you are
the resource there is one megabyte of
jason and you want to show that on your
phone well maybe you should reformat
this output so there's plenty of tricks
but for us we just said I want the
resource ABC and I want to expand it or
not here on the demo it's for the
speaker and if I go expand true it will
bring me the buyer if I go expand false
it will not bring it very useful when
you are thrown in the tube with low
network so there's all these tricks
ah ok now we agreed on the tricks either
you write a word document to explain
your tricks or you use documentation we
use swagger so further the idea is how
to document your API what methods can
you call what parameters what
the status codes tool which I were to
expect from an API and this contract can
be written in jizan or llamo
and swagger it's so you know it's so
famous now that it's it's actually
becoming expended it was given to the
open API initiative and there's plenty
of tools around swagger nice editors and
everything so that's what we did here is
a jax-rs rest endpoint you know speaker
endpoints with a post and a get and now
we're going to put documentation so here
I'm using text to say these endpoints
brings me the details of the speakers of
the conference blah blah blah and the
method had what does it do well I had
the new speaker to the conference and it
can return a 400 400 for 3 or 4 etc etc
once you've put that in your code
there's actually now two strategies you
tell the swagger implementation to
document at runtime so what you do is
you you read acute your rest endpoint
and you go to a specific URL and it
generates automatically the contracts
very useful but swagger needs Jackson
needs a whole bunch of things and
believe it or not but what this
functionality it takes more than 20
Meg's of dependencies so you know doing
micro services with the 20 Meg's just to
show no you know a Jason Jason file it's
a bit of a pain so what we did is we
actually use maven plugin the swagger
maven plug-in in it introspect these
annotations and generates once your
swagger file much easier you put it in
your waffle
you get rid of all the dependencies you
do not have runtime documentation but we
didn't need it so with a bit a bit of
magic
each time you compile your code it
generates a new swagger file very very
easy you package that and now you have
your angular team that can read it with
different tools and better than that
there's even a tool that takes this
swagger and generates angular code very
nice and it generates so my add method
it knows well it calls it add because I
told swagger it was called add you know
the method returns a room so the swagger
color code gen is going to generate code
for my room get get prostitute and
delete very very nice so this is how it
works so again here I have my my end
points ok it's working if I go to
swagger J'son it's the JSON file of
generated so now I just take I just take
this file and I go here you know again
I've so swagger coupe swagger cogent and
I think that you know I can type help so
there's plenty of methods to generate
code and so on and so forth I think I'm
gonna have to go I'm gonna stay here and
what I'm going to do now so I'm gonna
generate code based on my JSON file okay
so my contract and I'm going to tell him
that the language is typed script
angular 2
and I'm going to tell it where to
generate this code so I'm going to put
it in conference am I on the right am i
oh yeah demo I'm not on the right place
sorry oops
yep - micro service you know what guys I
have them somewhere in the readme I have
this very long whoops
so sorry for the copy-paste he just
pulled the swagger jason and here he
generated the api's so the venue api so
here in typescript I have all the get
post put and delete everything in
swagger and I know that the JavaScript
guys hate types that we log type and
just created a room you know the room as
an idea capacity etcetera etcetera
brilliant mmm but still there were still
missing this contract is fantastic
I do not clean a lot of time sorry I'm
skipping that because I wanted to show
you something a bit more interesting
it's we have this contract so now the
guys know out what to call to do a post
get in delete but what else you know we
have all these microservices around what
should I do next what do I do to get all
the talks of Monday what do I do to get
all the talks of Monday on room number
five so we had to do this eight always
thing so eight always it's called EP
media as the engine another application
state in the maturity model it's up
there and basically it's a runtime
contract swagger is good it's your
contract but then what do you do so a
runtime contract is each time someone
invokes resource you tell them what to
do next
so at is call these the idea of IT media
where do i click next you know what can
I do
so you give link to people and the idea
is I give you a link so now you can go
somewhere else
actually Jack's arrest as a link API but
we didn't use it it was a bit too much
we made things simpler but you know
anyway that's one thing with a micro
profile this is actually missing I know
spring as an implementation spring 8oz
the micro profile asked to do something
because it's quite painful to do but the
idea is this is the data of a talk
there's an ID there and there's a title
the team can get that because they have
the swab contract but then well then we
have to give them in you know
information this is the link to myself
so to the talk but these are all you
know water links this is the link if you
want to go to page one this is the link
if you want to go to the last page this
is the link if you want to see all the
talks on Monday and you have to give all
this information each time this self
first last next and Monday most of them
not Monday Tuesday because that's you
know for conference but most of them are
actually standardized if you go to this
page you have all these rels that you
can use so I'm skipping the
implementation because it's just a map
but just to give you an idea this is
what it looks like so this is the nice
interface but behind the scene this is
what we have so if I go to sessions this
is the first batch of the sessions 20 if
I want to have the 20 next well just
click here so that's an information you
give to the other team
like licking on the other next what if
they want to see what's happening on
Tuesday click on Tuesday and what you
want
Tuesday on reel 6 well click on room 6
now Tuesday might not be and then you
are the talk with Martin godness so this
is the link to the speaker and here you
have all the details of the speaker here
you didn't see it but I have seven
micro-services so each time I've clicked
I've been through a different machine so
I was telling you we'd spend ten days
saying API should be beautiful and you
are else should be readable and actually
now your weather new trend is no we
don't have to you know it's much easier
to understand that you know next next
means something the your the URL that
could be called anything okay I'm
completely out of time so we've used
caching mostly with etags etags
are built-in jax-rs so that's nice here
I need to vote and to vote I need to be
authenticated so we use JSON web token
the web the JSON web token support will
be in micro profile 1.1 so here we did a
bit of hand code but it's going to get
much easier so here I'm explaining what
the token is sorry I'm completely out of
time because I didn't tell you but the
this talk that I do with sea bass here
it's a three hours long talk so I try to
shrink it as much as possible but so the
conclusion is we are working on 1.1 it
will bring more features and a JSON web
token support that's going to be nice
he'll check you know out of the box in a
standard way because it's in Eclipse
Foundation and there's
- come one point - before the end of the
year last week I was looking at that
microservices this is what we need to
build micro-services I found it quite
interesting because one guy was
commenting oh god yeah
load balancing service discovery yeah
okay oh and the triangle at the top
what is the empty triangle nothing
business code like oMG that's complex so
the idea of the micro profile is to take
these complex things so we don't have to
worry about that we had to do a lot of a
lot of things by hand the 8 OS the JWT
supports but awfully with micro profile
1.2 1.3 all all these technical things
that we have to deal with now with
microprobe with micro services will also
become easier join please join there's
of course everybody's here except Oracle
yeah I know but you can be there to go
to eclipse deaths like channel mailing
list github we're really working on that
and we need your input
you know the 1.2 should be ready by the
end of the year what do you need but in
1.2 so thank you and you know come to
eclipse foundation Eclipse Foundation is
not just about an ID it's a foundation
and quite welcoming thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
