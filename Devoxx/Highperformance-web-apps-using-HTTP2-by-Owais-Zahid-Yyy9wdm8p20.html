looking to my right as an intimate
friend Maggy new year really a fear of
insulin shock so I start with talk
without medicinal statement what ending
it is a matter fact from all at once
instead of changes so this is I think
the way midnight
so we are business nobility verification
report ah
we are the government as a box with
water monitors periodically and we have
refuge size of 87 rocky we have actually
made a long time so this is not America
select mother this what about the
building and uh at the way everything is
talking in the baby design application
so and
and of computing power more
investigations are utilizing ontology
and it is a major shift from modern
architecture to all of these things are
actually have an effect on the way we
develop them so today our visit
one such scenes which is into the
magician cleansing or basic questions of
you in future the beings on your planet
post laser power is and how you can
create high performance applications
using education so this is for this talk
so you start with the video credits
article then of unity teachers followed
by a mess
according to it I look at some of the
key features of a to an action and then
work
next is the migration strategies tackle
out the some of your questions that if
you want to use HTTP to in your is how
you and not not only women will get the
activation performance from broad
expected and then we will see how easy
to fix it then in the end of twenty so
let's get word that we have some time
ready the
so maybe we don't get anything so it is
the vision of immediate advantage
operable quick revision are inefficient
level of college-educated intersect is
full of joy for equal distribution and
communication one of it is not reported
so largely based on the work to build it
in try away from the ego and August 2
years ago and me
he not there 2016 10 people sartorial
the baby that was my warrant for
education learn more browsers to web
server properties the old targeting to
make identification something happens
our party
labor game is ugly here you can text the
big Ernest so behind good indication
that a new window let me share a little
accent - this is a graphite fiber from
the nutrients so please the substitution
is having theme in the context of
actually we are going from re re routers
learning majority things so that is why
it is a very high property alright so
the next bit of the detail
running okay plus a body good
it is not a teachers are safe it is a
big difference all the prior revision
which were specially from a musical of
assistance
this Bangalore twice our when a
particular treatment users so we don't
need to unlike the texture outer-box
really worried about my treating the
definite or my musical that means the
party grave countenance iPhone parsing
it also optimizes the composition of it
we talked about visiting later so before
I discuss the next beer let's talk about
some way so let's look at how he handles
slice networking so
here are seven with you seven I will
open an image and then moving action
that will accommodate the new mythology
mythology also so this is are you
imagining or detention so if you serve
that I'm going to be one so you know
each web needs to be open a connection
then do a magical perform action and
then close the connection so even bigger
without multi the connection this this
was an argent problem because it isn't
for associated with all these activities
so force important web navigation the
integration one but an application grew
bigger people quickly realizes education
so that are that things like if a my
header stuff then later on
the connection to think this issue but
it is so - solve that problem but again
applications out soon and then became
more complicated and more hard
so the prop the other process surface
and the most automatic the web
developers as we are we talked about
before this orbital satellite this is
talking a bed in an asylum I will have
power everybody locking so it is like if
you when you up Brosius who are some
supermarket it's being you on the
weekend and their little for forgetting
I can check account so this is human
false reality on what's going on without
the help of my god so if one thing is
taking more time then the rest of the
requests are short because even with
multiple counters
connection you are still getting tuned
up so this was one of the sort of
biggest performance drawback of 81 even
is a production arthur vining edifice
was Edition so it's not just about head
of life and 980 were part of that it was
another thing villages ptb slopes are so
pigmented so TVB's ghosts are in the
chilly weather during when the boat goes
in the warm on the network in the form
ax so what if you did you do in the
filling it starts with like this one but
little packets but what is it set and
then it increases the size of the window
reading actually come up with a popular
cyber Beckett represent so if you if you
have so if you have multiple collections
that all the collection will start soon
so even they are a certain connection
or non-participation didn't all start
slow so the argument that more is better
is not many so because one cannot go
I'll be so sad because even my
preparation so ATP you actually edited
issues I am really making my detecting
are so instead of having magical
direction you have a single connection
correlation and because they responded
organizational behavior well so in any
people to come in the form of the
time for tea with my situation possible
because so you're not a novelist
so so the question is how how he is
working the magazine so in order to
other thing we need to inspect the
effects that may be to interview one
disorder three another one for speed so
they stop being so fit Aboriginal if you
is it smaller unit opportunities so for
an hour or so you requested this
environment for request and response are
the things our data and header names but
there are other little things that would
our night
33 window people commenting but these
are all related to mother to generation
so yes and anything is the street
you can he didn't even like a fire acts
of intimidation or sequence of three and
each connection can have more than 100
streets and each engine a rectifier you
mean by identify which is like what we
are
so this is our original title we have a
connection and then I said we have
another state and the rest going back so
that is why this whatever to handling
tonight so this is a proper solution
over time and this is
so those are the only impact you all
right so so the divisions of forgive you
one actually pushed us to move to smart
water and then the smart workarounds
Sigurd became allocated so with a deity
- ah didn't need to actually be with it
all the beautiful and just 300 revival
in yoga the initiation of rest to make
sure ah
the to be charged in mainly done
actually on our application who have
more connections and uh then you have
the designated folder
so in this model nonprofit a central
view
so if you to be in charge so and you
know you spread your application across
movie then you can have like plain
connection export activity this becomes
more great because this one and it must
be arranged very good reason they like
to hear to have a signal it we are not
certain you to be started with the baby
joy or application come because when the
toys resolution on cloud of the
application spirit of course not of
eminence and based on the proximity of
your slide deck introduced wet and
definitional to me avi is different to
each other so he does for the purpose of
an imagination so what is the difficulty
education connection which is our second
time given tribe work and I'll talk
let's take over me to forget itself both
of them I actually sort of behind the
resources in our community so they do
probably wrote one is this thing is not
yet so one of the resources were
updating you need to invalidate or one
pay-per-view and everything is that you
didn't send more emotion to the partners
on the time that copies my protein I
could affect it all they made sense
at that time so didn't mean literally
Eve everything based on the period of
HTTP 2.0 for some reason
okay so within a period we need to
evaluate with an easy thing right so the
original person
let's talk about a limitation of a
shitty one made in England in bikini
competitor beats our within actually
sort of contributing the utilization as
we are dividing it the nuances we are
dividing the request header and data
things that it is evening shift to the
best block Heather Heather so
yeah so watch for that Kira to refer you
to the annual cost and extract which is
based on pocket coding with an ability
to use a new community with other
document is extension and so for
multiple requests
can you find the thing so that means of
aggression rating past variance so all
right so again another most featured fan
of it
the normal flow is an opportunity here
again they in the net you are you are
dead for parking in you are trying to
get out of the dorm employers then once
you eat there is an evil sort of a
dependent resource I think it and then
you will get together and then you will
get even see in the project it smaller
than part of the beauty of tractor dream
so he is discovered by you can Bush so
if if so in general would be a dream
normally the time the paint ekta lighted
up but we also sort of say okay you
might need this one except so a ticket
so that works
so try to ask for it
so we're being really nervous that they
need of the theater so Sarah Bush in
alpha 9 you again need a different like
milky leader is not the menu again music
right
right so enough talk let's see you take
direction
I'm starting the schwinkle are the kite
out taking useful them so the community
to mortgage our community our university
and dinner a happy occasion
so if you need to know more about their
issue you supporting the HUD be against
you get more check it out so they have
many devil here so I will allocate all
them are it is so next start with over
time so this is more about decimal or
debt and you can have it distance
compared add on the difference between a
key to anything one so 4x objective but
how things are going with
so let me know what the page 51
so this world were identical catacomb
automated the time so around 30 minute
low density and unity on their type of
all the difficulty all right
so anyone finish tiny are definitely
later information if we use and then I
mean this is where we are people doing a
half like so and then the
now is the origin ignore the voltage to
30 seconds facilitating an individual
with the same
looking eye pops right daddy
and if what I make here is that this
explosive that it's also started at the
time but you can still see some never
doing are the main reason for it is that
is the maximum for their change in an
alchemist I products are great if you
can configure it to be as you want but
you fight for it
so we hear what a great request some of
them in question even with that it is
this is this is real
all right so so this is our law
this has a Bourdon copy of come
expecting an effect on HP that next year
service
or exactly let's look at the ending so
first put it in the building so clean I
think the faculty over here is the
normal rule that out they domesticated
those so and taking our lives to
fighting settings unless me how
now my wife sustained
for the people here in the GFI
Department push the more this is our
fear and indication technical solid push
to what is happening behind the theme is
have vajura three are very eloquent and
you're getting the despondent ever is
actually ending what is going on so
thousand one of the big stream and then
I accept I promise
and then you also and our technical
review and then this data energy save
for the time side you can they stay on a
push gas or you somewhere no memory is
not interested in cash
we must coordinate a gas one the router
ex-teammate important to consider the
deal with our presently in people is
just in
okay so people but just not like it so
you guys don't think that I'm ready and
exited I just read you the other
I actually design an experiment to the
success of a vision I hear the whole I'm
here to nest Mary the miracle god-given
thing is ended if you have an engine of
the fidgets and soar better than working
with soap and water to the corn so again
this one is of something sort of related
to the over after we talked earlier but
this different given you can set
different scenarios
then our alleged particular business so
the point is to actually match the
direct activation of documents olives on
the wagon and using extra good extra 100
itself with right so we do think the dip
try to cut it off using it not high
vaccination
eight eight one six seconds to Buddha so
I have another service which is run on
TV and then check for the same thing all
right
using an olive oil and
it's an experience with more we got
answers
okay good job recording so again it's
really simple and I'm not making any
changes
in total
so and visitor talked about when we were
operating in
quick inaudible
all right so this is up some interviews
for yourself but others applet sort of
if you think of which actually served
again I love experiment the purpose with
the catchy because that is sort of the
combination or people are struggling
just to give you server vortex of it
so what in a normal course so we didn't
actually getting the job so well as
developing a travel travel is like
competing of your be free travel
accommodations so if I can't ignore me
then yeah so
so this is for my linked reason
just
taking
so I recommended the trainee I be
estimated our fashion so in might
imagine again people is open now that
ain't nice it's not actually requesting
for difficulties or any gaps it is
knowing President Lincoln get serve
problem Agnes
Fred correcto three but I mean one
better
they're calling it work it should give
me the pipe achieve but he what will
happen this time
all right it's just a work off yet but
the main theme that you trying to push
further navigating the olive oil
so I so it is not I because you are
trapped in me this is not an optimal
solution because you are putting order
Delta flight this great city will be our
day by I needed by the time so so much
more
if you need to know more about this
package and everything is working don't
like it awesome support so you can go to
the damn occurrence you can always be do
you have to go to this measurement and
inspected you see all the knobs here in
Italy we call the team level activity
happening and all for the same activity
so so what happens they might have means
that if light quality has come and your
mind report that an idea immediately
that apply will reject your heart it
will better sense we increase what the
problem which is happening is that the
server implementations that we have I
tried multiple server to diminish you
carry a beautiful polarization the node
all are actually not handing the thing
with so this is one limitation so if
something is projecting up to Thomas
that you
indications of immunity big part out of
the book this is not happening right now
so since our love and miss things and
the big problem I think I saw little
business to be the first sort of
contract effect when you create a nation
Israel the same direction between
indigenous unity decide whether you
allow the full rotation on top
my it would have been great if we get to
sort of this despotic agreement so that
I know whether I am pushed or not
so our go around being able to either
use our workers and because you didn't
figure to make the net maybe if you have
something to the schedule ratio that you
can even ask
custom headers your request for revision
American readers so there's our benefit
server look at your your request
it can decide whatever by again
next need some work so you need to come
with their so up recently this available
clock at JP not you know that the agency
to push from sort of dependent by is a
modulated go to put it
so he actually have use push unmonitored
rather and see how the bush work
whenever contrast enabling available
unity match for your dispute doing
everything alright so for the port of
the polio
I get up here and check it out I am
unitary revenues to double so I try to
make all the references that I used to
together my knowledge of each interview
so it might be an advert for president
so that is so
if you even believe that why I'm
bringing you get on it forever say by
doing what
so it is a little bit if you are
observed if you just want to go pfft are
there any pulse where you go and how you
can use that if you can take for several
voyages in here for you can see here so
it was a deliberate over connection
regrets or push it is true and then you
have you push
all right so
Oh
Oh
okay now the question is how can we use
any time so if you are starting to start
with my vision and this is also of that
you have to do all the hacks that we go
but what happen if you are you are
actually working on anything the C
application what options you have so
there are some strategies that beginning
but in the past is that if your margin
of
and special projects
Lori's project if they did that sort of
fury and orders and enterprise of things
my soul is no so what are billions of
pages or appearance are given something
that change that you know he was your
son
so and walk Steven Cochran with the
mutters and striking the second main
evening
bash where that they all serve a higher
amount of media for hospitals for maybe
the difference brother - probably - not
a word strategy for the big party so for
that
start with some negatives so I start
with the appearance again or the
practice because it is sort of disease
risk fear that we're looking back over
things and then is there any of you
tonight physical comedy and you can also
target independence our give you an
effusion server for the sole purpose of
to be charged
are they Oesterle you can even in the
modeling and now the interesting problem
is that for large projects you might
have they need to give us if you think
the money that'll be the number of lines
you have and yet in the devil that is
maybe the most cottage cheese to copy
the I intention is to light coffee and
then create sort of puddles take it
personally this market workshop they've
done is we're getting the new
functionality in the truth of our
culinary was not the circle is that it
kid shows the poor garbage so you have
es5
in the file taking into account of
tactile medication so if you have models
you can use the 48 I hit this topic that
is that I can to deny the problem
so in here
only talk about Batman so I mean sort of
an argument to the painting editing
partnering with radical text so to
produce for the third unit they are
taking to unit displayed your ability
origin which we sort of deploys you
raising me my dignity
right in fact a lot of these TV worker
Sophie
so often these are very poor Robin and
Arthur so that we can't rely on aunt of
that it's one time 182 professional so
here is this fella from regarding both
dr. recording I highly recommend if you
are interested in the tractor so
visibility's you talking about
so if you want to create a light
application you meet and it's going to
be there but this is a server firm
Italian leg around one second point is
to be noted that a unique making
position for aspects of my server
interaction so with that mean we
together are very different it is a very
modern wonder like how to sign your
ability to register given time
your dust even offers almost I've
instituted education community Thomas 9
York University to gather them giving
you the oxygen so the humans in the
network emission for agriculture unit
forty ready
hi Peter common of crostini you on the
proper medical condition in life you
cannot do much so but will be unit to
serve text appear order for this network
I mean you get desperate by dropping
your application for identity after what
you did you suffer genetic atoms are
plentiful that application is raining
down using a paper which is not really
good given user can still see some it
because before giving to them or giving
user something to let you use again
perceive their commitment so it's all
about using certain Jesus every water
homicide education institutions so give
the high rate night one ticket to date
so we need to nothing
again we can't even read the whole
infrastructure that we are using
it's marking the vegetation PDS to be
one goes to the user or the team are so
low income the signal obligation is
expected for the government as a state
you're doing something like a 20 or pull
away energy
so for that you need me wherever you are
what to disrupt showing the silence okay
exploding very makeover and it took we
need to be smart about registration
insight we need to make sure that that
then you that is s going update the is
the bus babyhood is that possible
he ain't gonna be there we can clean up
being an illegal tina the wonders we can
stay in all the papers that we don't
need and we can make out the resources
in the SS know is crucial for the
critical bottom so you can have the on
the gated here
so did thousand things that can be we
can premiere and we're not come into the
picture and you like it multi-step taken
server
so again application for comment is
oracle bigger topic so let me try to sum
it up
within six people remember home visits
or cure or other commentating or global
warming
ss
the statement Aristarchus when changing
and your important piece so it implement
business technique becomes so there she
is one thing
but it doesn't mean that you get stay
happy with 852 you also get another in
we finish that hold it down Eddie I
think we have time for questions right
okay I think I'm done we can do some
questions we all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
