before I start about the talk who am i
as you see and just Java developer JVM
developer may be better a wizard and an
architect I spent as seventeen years of
my professional life with JVM based
techniques before I was programmed
before that I was programming C++ and
generally have lot of Oh pokemons on my
list so things I played and I hate okay
it doesn't matter I work for CSS
insurance so that's a company yeah
we are located under this beautiful
mountain over the lake in Switzerland
the name may be suggested but it's not
true we don't insure your style sheets
yet only only your health but it's
what's funny the company was created
here in 1899 do you think we have lot of
legacy code
I don't know that bad quite honestly
before us legacies like Java e5 but okay
that's not the point of this topic
okay so agenda what is what is the topic
so first of all warning if some of you
came here to hear some details about
Java 8 lambdas you will be quite a
disappointment it's not about Java 8 as
it not about anything from JVM whatever
it's so this presentation is basically
for your regular job completely useless
I even say it would be good if it was
useless because otherwise you might get
into the trouble but even though it's
not not it should be fun
and this presentation is about the basic
fundamental question from the mental
question what is a number and also
generally what is the lambda calculus
what am de calcul e people call
indifferently and then will do this
thing in Java why that would be a good
question why to do it in Java and then
we'll have some fun ok so the the point
of this talk is yeah maybe I'm not a
scientist
one thing sorry
for that you may think I am but I'm
absolutely not so it's one to be very
very scientifically correct everything
otherwise I would have to spend a couple
of weeks here but I've studied
mathematics there is a reason why I've
studied mathematics just because at the
moment I was choosing my studies I was
doing this thing on the Commodore 64 you
know who who had for Commodore 64 yeah
so if you were programming Commodore 64
that was really like well masterpiece so
at the beginning of my studies I decided
come on there is nothing in computer
science I science I can learn so it's
just absolutely nothing because I know
that and my colleague could do this on
his PC so he had the same problem
outcome and I he will he said I will
learn nothing more because that's the
most important thing in a life so
because of that he convinced me to go to
study something really challenging that
was math and that was the first lecture
on this math math studies that 0 is
indeed different than one that was so
the the guy that the professor was
really doing a proof that one is
different than zero it was really it
took like 15 minutes lot of white board
and after that I realized the first time
in my life I've seen that those numbers
are really different
how cool but first time in my life I
have doubts about this nevertheless okay
there is a proof and mathematicians do
that after seeing that I realized this
study's gonna be really terrific that's
great ok yeah so the question is whether
this proof come here what is the number
who knows what is the number who can
tell me what is the number what yeah
that's one of them do you know any other
numbers yeah that's the problem
yeah so what is the number and it is
very is so stupid even fundamental
question that there is very hard to
answer so maybe let me present you that
those are two bottles of water a day
represent two as a number okay that's
one bottle one no bottles zero
okay two bottles great but you see
that's okay to represent numbers with
bottles of water that's quite okay that
it's only the problem is if you have
numbers like 100 200 you need a lot of
water and it starts to be heavy
mathematics from thousand yeah so that's
not perfect idea to represent numbers so
this other idea and by the way like let
me see there is a coin here it's very
important it's two polishes water and
from mathematical perspective it's
really crazy because it's one coin and
represents to what the hell yeah so
there must be something crazy with
numbers so what is the number and
mathematician started to dig into this
problem because that's very useful for
our life to find out what is the number
and there was this concept yeah maybe we
don't have water we don't have coins we
have nothing because this is this
represents the big bank the beginning of
the universe let's pretend it never
happened
we don't have universe we are so unlucky
and even there's this alternative theory
the universe was created by the Flying
Spaghetti Monster so let's pretend for
some of you there was no lying spaghetti
more monster yeah let's imagine that
yeah so universe wasn't created we have
no bottles of water no apples and
nothing how is it even possible here
that in this world we have something and
mathematicians came to the idea yeah
there exists something let's call it set
and let's let's not define what the set
is so we have heard about sets in the in
school yeah set set set of something
here so II do you know any set that you
can define in a universe that wasn't
created can we construct any set who
knows empty set exactly great you are
great so you've started really that's
the start of whole mathematics empty set
with the universe wasn't created doesn't
exist but we can discuss about empty set
how cool okay if we have an empty set we
have something we are right right now
like gods with
rated something we have one fing an
empty set how cool so right now we can
create set which contains this thing
because we have something one one thing
empty set so if we create set containing
empty said we have second elements we
are so powerful universe wasn't created
and we already have constructed two
things
how cool yeah so we can go further this
is the definition but just forget it
let's see this thing this is a set
containing an empty set and set that
contains empty set that's a practical
procedure that allows us to construct
sequences and by the way these sequences
we can call the empty set is 0 the set
containing intestines is 1
this thing is 2 and this this operation
that allows us to create the next
element if sequence is the successor and
this is basically the fundamental I
would say theory that leads us to how to
construct natural numbers and this is
the standard mathematic that you've
learned from school maybe you've never
discussed this maybe you have depends
what you've studied but yeah it works
and it worked pretty well it was like
designed more than 100 years ago it was
quite okay for couple of years and why
the question is why mathematicians
really was so crazy to dig into that
things there was a goal there was a
really holy grail because the idea was
let's define this mathematic pretty
pretty well so that every fundamental
brick everything that we discuss is
precisely defined what is a number what
is an operation like plus whatever if we
have this we have all these building
blocks really well-defined we may get
something really crazy we may get to the
holy grail that maybe we would be able
to build a mathematical procedure a
procedure whatever algorithm that would
say ah tell us if a given theorem so
let's like pitagoras whatever is true or
false just automatic machine that will
tell us is something true or false the
was the initial goal let's build such
machine and if we were building machine
we have to really define good from the
mental blocks that was the reason all of
this was created and that's what's
really its staffing code and shine dogs
problem if we have good axioms so these
building blocks are called axioms then
we maybe will find such a machine that
will tell us here any stupid statement
is true or false and then we'll we won't
need any mathematicians professor
anymore just will run the machine and it
will print all possible theorems how
cool ok yeah so the set story worked but
as you know you've probably worked from
some projects and you know at the
beginning of the project comes the
businesses what you need and of course
then your answer is I will right now
we'll do everything perfectly will take
spring but-- whatever because the
business goals are quite easy and then
we start our system is clean everything
works perfectly till the moment business
comes again and changes the requirements
or refines them yeah and then the system
all you have to adapt something then you
put some hacks more hacks and this this
beautiful concept that you've created
your architecture falls apart typically
after three months yeah so set theory
prevailed couple of years so it was
quite ok but nevertheless then came some
such problems exactly the same story
happened let's go ok that's a question
stated but one of the mathematicians
let's consider the set our of all sets
that you know are not member of
themselves that's sounds crazy and then
there is a question is a member of our
don't dig into that if you don't want to
there is a we can rephrase it in a city
like Vienna let's say it's Vienna there
is a barber who shaves all men who don't
shave themselves and by the way only men
who don't shave themselves so he's like
constrained to share only such men
that's the this statement is quite the
same as the initial one but in a human
human way and then the question should
the baby barber shave himself you see
the problem if he shaves himself he is
not allowed so it's quite quite crazy
but that's that's something that was
called Russell paradox
and that is thing that mathematicians
found out okay in set theory that's
quite well working for defining what the
natural number is etc and everything
even real numbers we can't really fight
with statements like that O's must be
something broken that's like yeah this
crazy requirement so the idea was the
same as we do in a system let's build
some hugs and the hugs in this case were
more axioms so they've defined they had
like six seven really beautiful clean
actions at the beginning for the seat
theory and then they've added through
the years like six seven more I forgot
the exact number which are very crazy
right the first six axioms if you read
them from the Wikipedia are very clean
quite intuitive for everyone the other
are like what are even those guys
talking about on those those axioms were
created to fight with such paradoxes and
even though anytime yeah from time to
time happens new paradoxes so there was
a conclusion maybe this set theory is
not the best thing we can have so and
there was this guy Alonzo Church who has
heard about Alonzo Church before how
could so you know everything yeah so he
proposed another idea let's don't talk
about sets let make a fundamental
particle of everything function not a
set and then comes a question how a
function because the function is
something that converts from set to set
so in order to have function we need to
have a set how stupid yeah but now so
this idea describes function without
talking about sets so sets with
functions we've learned in school are
not exactly the same we think we will be
talking today and yeah that's that's
this presentation about so new world of
lambdas those functions let's call them
lambdas just to make things complicated
so well it wasn't created there is no
universe nothing
what can you create is there any
function that you can create like but
you know you cannot create sets no empty
set can you create can you describe a
function in the world that wasn't
created no big bank no fly
Spaghetti Monster whatever yeah yeah
what sign I identify identity function
yeah that's great I yeah that's a good
answer
the answer is identity function and what
is this that's a function that takes
whatever it returns the same so you
don't have to bring additional concepts
to describe this function so if in this
world existed this presenter device this
identity function would take it and
return the same how cool we don't have
to present our device but we can
describe if if it existed so generally
this function is the first step into the
new world how can we create things yeah
so identity and that's the way the
mathematicians describe it so how they
write it you will see it in your
Wikipedia it's just basically only to
make things more complicated I will
explain this this this definition but
it's just a function identity yeah so
what is the lambda if you go to
Wikipedia you will see this but let's
define our functions this way we use
real use symbol lambda because it was
just fancy symbol that wasn't used at
that time and then we'll provide
something like variable in this case is
6 by because every function needs
something as an input this time it's X
and after the dot will say what we are
going to do with that so what's our
definition of the function that's
basically how in lambda how coolly you
define the lambda so e just for a moment
once again we are going outside this new
world for instance the application we
are going to duplicate the X if it was a
number so lambda from X is X plus 6
that's one function of we define C knows
that lambda from X is C know 6 that's
all those are two valid lambdas the only
problem we are building the mathematic
we cannot use plus Orsino's because they
were not yet created we don't have them
so oh that's that's that's hurts but we
we can we can go with that so what we
can use in fact is we can for sure we
can use one operation create define
lambdas and inside of this expression
what we can do we can reuse other
lambdas and we can use the most
important operation of the functions
that we have in so important that
mathematicians choose the and whitespace
to define it they were so scared to draw
it so and white space means function
application yet only to make it
complicated so if you if you are
thinking about sinus from weeks in in
lambda calculus it would be in fact
sinus spy six like this so maybe let's
take a look at this definition from the
bottom line lambda frou mix it's f and
applied with X that's in the brackets
and then space means we apply it to Y it
means if we do this application in place
of X here Wilke my symbol and we'll get
F from Y that's the result of this
application of the lambda so that's very
simple you could rewrite it with the
normal way you've learned from school
but we'll stick to this representation
during this presentation for a moment
yeah so let's do it with Java because
you can go to the to that with in a
Wikipedia you will see a lot of these
symbols they are really great but it
will be hard for you to really if you
are not really if you don't spend weeks
on that it will be really hard to find
out what the hell is even going on there
so there is a way to make it all easier
for you let's rewrite all these
mathematics terms with Java and the
question is what is in Java a lambda
what do you think how can we describe
with Java a lambda
you know method okay method in word okay
if we start with we can discuss a method
of course we can have a method it would
be what kind how would be a name of
method what will be the name lambda K
lambda
what would the method take okay maybe I
will
make it bigger what would the method
take as an argument X okay
okay what would the method return X huh
so hmm
but it's in case of identity but by the
let's talk about interfaces can we
define lambda as an interface okay so I
will help you hopefully with that so
let's think about functional interface
defined like this functional interface
and we'll define it it's lambda like
this okay and this interface would have
one method 1 method and maybe we won't
call it lambda really it's let's call
let's call it apply because what you do
with lambda you call them we apply it
with something and this method would
take an argument of what type okay
that's the doesn't think I'm fun fact
skipped in a lambda calculus we only
have lumped us though all those
functions I've presented the only thing
that we can put in place of X or Y is
another lambda that's the point and
knowing that we know that the only
argument of apply would be in fact
lambda is an interface that takes some
lambda and what it returns exactly that
so stupid interface it's like that's
basically how we defined the fundaments
of base of lambda recluse in Java
that's this interface is interface
lambda with one function that takes
number the trans lambda so this is the
world of lambdas we only have lambdas
nothing more you cannot with this
interface create anything else how cool
and we'll go with that so let me define
some lambdas for you the first of them
would be and you
you will understand in a second what is
this all about because it's so easy
identity is very easy to define like
this yeah X returns X so we can even
display this it would be stupid but
let's display it that's displaying
identity let's run it
sorry it's so slow because it's running
on Nathan I never had time to change it
to something else so slow compilation
for such simple code please yeah and you
see it's all displayed something stupid
because system.out.print L is just a
some hash of object but we had we have
already created one lambda how cool we
are so right now we can do something
more we can do like this print L
identity and we apply it with identity
great yeah let's start it again so we
are playing right now with lambdas we
don't have much of them but as you see
by the code it works
we had identity and we if we applied
identity to itself we get the same how
cool meeting means identity works so
it's the first thing when we starts to
play with lambdas we take this identity
function and then we apply it with
something but we are a little bit
unlucky at the beginning the only thing
we have is just this identity function
so we are like playing oh let's play it
with self yeah sorry you have no younger
brother or whatever yeah but we will
deal with that so we are at now stucked
with this one unlucky lambda identity
can we do some more and let's go back to
the mathematical world let's take a look
at this definition lambda Rho mix after
the dot is expression and by the way all
of this is definition the mathematicians
don't use brackets so basically it means
this so how can we read that it's a
lambda that takes some X and returns
identity how cool we have identity
already what does it mean if we apply if
to some argument we will get lambda
identity and this argument will be
generally forgotten and then second time
we can apply with something and then
we'll get
so it's like how to create our second
step in this world that's another lambda
it's not identity it's it's a lambda
that produces identity and ignores the
first argument how cool so if we for a
moment have borrowed something from
other universe like maybe a trumpet and
the tomato you will see but lambda flow
mix if we apply it with trumpet and
later with tomatoes in first step in
place of X will be trumpet given but
okay
we don't really have in the definition
anywhere X it means we'll be just
ignored so we'll get at the end lambda
from Y and tomato as a second argument
and then because its identity lambda
from Y is y so lambda from tomato is
tomato we get a tomato after this
operation how cool and then we can give
back the tomato to this other universe
that we have borrowed this week okay so
next step other lambda you see there is
like the difference we take an X and
then we return something like this let's
take lambda from Y and return X so
something silly at the beginning so
let's pray with trumpet and tomato
lambda from X is lambda gives us lambda
from Y that returns the leeks so if we
applied it to trumpet and tomato a play
get to trumpet meats in place of X will
write the trumpets after first step
we'll have this but in place of X will
be trampled so will be the lambda from Y
returning and trumpet and then still
application of tomato and as you see
this gives us at the end trumpet so we
have two different lambdas basically by
the way very interesting fact lambdas
only always take one argument that's one
argument functions but as you see we can
effectively define something that is a
two argument function because that's a
composition of lambdas how could so and
you'll see that we have two more
different lambdas that identity it's
great and even we can go further okay
here should be a space like lambda fro
mix returns lambda from Y that returns X
applied with Y how cool but the problem
is I cannot present it with the trumpet
or the tomato because it would destroy
that
bird or tomato and I only borrowed those
things from other universe so I don't
want to borrow to destroy anything so
let me let let me play with that that
would be great
what will happen so we have alarmed the
identity so right now let's just print
and by the way during this presentation
I will be trying to be very ok I will be
very strict to the lambda calculus it
means every lambda I am creating in the
definition of lambda cannot use integers
floats whatever it can only use other
lambdas created this way and
applications of the lambda so that's
very very strict subset of Java and I'm
using this Java without anything and but
it would be very boring to play with to
not be able to display it because of
that I'm using some external library
that helps me to transfer such terms
into print table lambdas so and by the
way that's the liberal library I've
created and this library is proven not
to work correctly even though I'm using
that because I'm wizard so I don't care
it's just absolutely incorrect every
mathematician can prove it instantly
that it doesn't work so how it works if
we define lambda identity we can with
this smart display display a
mathematical term behind it it's just
like this it doesn't use any reflection
or whatever because of that it cannot
work correctly but let's play right now
with our lambda so funny lambda is like
this X that returns another lambda that
takes Y and the return 6 like we've seen
that before with trumpet and tomato so
let's play with that
so we'll display this lambda it's this
funnel and you will see that the package
works for so we have this statement
display how cool so there is this
package that allows us to work with
plain lambdas in Java and display them
but what for what for so let's define
this lambda it's a true by the way if
you see that's the same as a funny
lambda and by the way it doesn't really
matter in wealth of lambdas as long as
they have the same representation it
doesn't matter how they are called
so by
basically in any place of using through
lambda or funny lambda I can just
replace them but for a month I will use
the true and that may does has there is
a reason why I'm calling this a true
lambda because if I create something
else the lambda that I would call false
you see there is a slight difference
between false and true how they work
because basically the true is the lamp
that takes some of X and then returns a
lambda that takes Y and still returns X
that's so and a fault is the rounded
that takes X and returns lambda that
given some while it returns Y so
basically it's like a true is a function
of two arguments that returns the first
one and the false is a function of two
arguments that returns the second one
you will see how how we play with that
so there is no coincidence that they are
called this way because we can create
this lambda like this and and it's the
function that okay let me put it here
it's a lambda and that takes some P and
returns other lambda that takes some Q
and retains P applied to the Q applied
to P this way okay sounds crazy but that
that has a that has a the purpose and by
the way I will display it a little bit
differently because if I had displayed
it standard way with my standard smart
display web okay maybe I will show you
that if I display this this way I will
get and it's a from X Y because
basically this displaying method doesn't
know how the parameters are named so in
order to make the definition of and
consistent with what I am using here I
will use web be met what it means start
displaying with using P Q and so further
symbols it's just a trick and by the way
it's not coincidence because if you go
to Wikipedia they use the same symbols
so that's to make it more consistent
with what you in watch you read on
Wikipedia so we we went so far so let's
do
this moment that's the most important
part we use end and lambda we have
defined and we apply it so apply means
the first function will apply with false
that's the first that's a P argument
here and then we'll apply with it with a
true something like this and then we'll
display it result what we will we get
you see and the result is what does it
resemble something you've seen before so
as you see an end with false and the
true gives us false how cool maybe we
can do something so let's do something
maybe we can see if it works so we can
use here true we'll see what happens and
you get something that looks like true
and by the way it doesn't matter what
are the symbols here maybe I can use
here lambda with that they blue which
returns I don't know a one which takes a
one and return still W so basically it's
the same as this fan alarmed all true so
it represents it true so this time I
will get what true again and of course
if I change here for instance to return
a 1 a 1 I will get something like false
so as you see having this lambdas I've
created end operation so the basic of
bullying calculus I have true definition
false definition a they seem to work
how cool so maybe to make it just more
complete we can go further with
definitions like sorry just this
lambda or is what so what is n lambda or
sorry for a moment I am just stuck in my
or is this so it would be P that returns
a Q Oh Molly I will do it this way
because either I never recall these
symbols from the memory so I'll do it
this way so lambda or would be like this
or is little bit different than P then
then end it returns this symbol yeah and
then we'll display or and maybe let's
play with that so it's like it's like
result o is or a false and the true and
we'll get this result to displayed and
of course you should expect that it is
yeah in this case something like it's
Rousseau's let's see if or works the
given way so or gives us yeah something
that looks like true how cool yeah it's
like works so we have nth and all and
you in this moment you know you have
true/false and or it means the in fact
the boolean calculus can be done you can
even go further and define sorry for
that and define a not operator like this
and we can display what is not false not
that lie with a false means yeah let's
see if it's true again we should get and
not false yeah it's true so we have fun
J basically with this very very limited
Java with recreated alternative boolean
calculus it's completely useless but it
works how cool so right now we can don't
know so the a boolean calculus is a true
and false yeah it's not complicated can
we do something with numbers like zero
or two so yes indeed so let's define
zero this way zero is by F and takes in
read function from F that returns
identity so by the way it's the same as
false so in boolean calculus they
already knew this decision that's in C
language was taken that false is 0 how
cool so but ok but as you see we have
used different symbols here not Y antics
but F antics and it's only to make it
yeah that's a convention you don't have
to use these symbols it doesn't matter
so let's define one this way
so we'll just display it and then we
will see the thing so and to this way
so we have 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 let me yeah and let's
just see this so you see oh where is -
ah - I haven't displayed so two more to
make it consistent let me display it -
just out println - so in this in this
convention by the way it's only
convention there is not one we have 0 1
&amp;amp; 2 and you see it the number we
represent it's how many times F is
applied tweaks so it's 2x like very
simple we can even define a successor
operation so incrementation this way
looks crazy
but you will see that it works and then
successor from let's see what the
successor of 2 for instance of over 1
better it would be easier for us yeah so
we have successor we can even display
this operation successor and then we
display successor of 1 and as you see
successor of 1 is indeed the same symbol
as 2 so it works it's easy it works so
we have now we've created the way to
introduce natural numbers so how cool
but natural numbers are only complete
when we define other operations well
maybe let's see successor of 10 you will
see how it works and by the way and once
again I borrow something from the
different world what does it mean
cárdenas from integer so I was really
bored writing f from X from X with this
all are
so this constructed for me it's
basically behind this you will see there
is there comes from this library so it's
my library that helps me with lambda
calculus but it's nothing more than
simply this definition written so many
times and you can even see that so
successful from 10 you should see a lot
of F's I wouldn't even count them but
there are a lot of them so 11 probably
ok so let's go with something like this
plus that's a really important operation
plus and as you see it's quite
complicated I wouldn't really try even
to reproduce it from memory
so plus looks like this we can display
it once again you see that I will
display it but with M symbol not a
problem
and then let's do it this lambda a
lambda lambda B it's 6 and 7 and by the
way I was I was just I'm not trying to
use this I'm maybe let's let me do that
so f from it's sorry just a moment it's
f that takes X done and exactly that's
the reason why I am using this sorry not
this business what I wanted to write I
wanted to write it returns F apply X and
then F dot lie this and then yeah you
see that I'm a little bit confused
because it takes a lot of time so
because of that I said to myself no I
will really use this because I know only
at the moment of - so don't don't play
with that let me do it simpler I will
play with that so I will take the simple
six because otherwise as you see
constructing numbers by hand with this
definition is very very ugly so and time
confusing the time time can think
consuming so we let's display it so to
prove that it's exactly the definition
of lambda as we already know and then
we'll do something like this plus so
what is a plus plus a and B we take a
plus
this lambda and we apply it we apply it
with a and then we apply it with B and
then we display the result here maybe
even more we can convert the result the
research operation that to integer is an
operation that converts and counts for
me how many time F was called so like
again coming back to the different world
but only for the back purposes so let's
see if plus works exactly so we have
plus a and B and now it's our job to
count all those FS it's 13 because I
know this function counted it you can
count on your own so we have plus
operation that works how cool we have it
how great so it's like natural numbers
and plus and you can see even it's even
more interesting multiplication so
multiplication looks this way and if we
multiply a by 2 so with this displays
this way we should get some result and
so what's the result
who knows what's the result we can even
convert it multiplication easy so as you
see we finally we came to this one very
important number 42 with multiplication
but we really using Java with nothing
grow so really function definition and
application nothing more we've recreated
alternatively yeah almost integer though
those are not integers those are natural
numbers but we are close if you have if
you have by the way from mathematical
perspective if you have natural numbers
everything else it's very easy how to
create from natural numbers integers and
real numbers and etc it's really not a
problem at all so yeah that's that's
concludes this part so we have right now
yeah what we had we have boolean
calculus we have numbers how cool but
you can say maybe add that's easy
because it's always forward let's do
something more complicated like I don't
know maybe some kind of algorithm and
that is exactly what I am going to
present you very quick
now let's take a nine as a number so
from integer nine and see how for
instance predecessor looks like and
that's really the function I wouldn't
dare to to try to read treat the morning
really very very nasty one
so that's predecessor but we can see if
it works
we saw decrement ation of nine so it's
nine and then we decrement nine so like
this Tom come on neighthan yeah as you
see it is decremented because we have
one F application less how cool so we
have this so we can now go both ways so
maybe we can create something we can
creates abstraction so it looks like
this it's not even that complications
abstraction looks so but we will play in
fact with something more more
interesting than just abstraction we'll
play with if lambda let's represent
something that is a algorithm step if
what is Watson if who knows Watson if
expression if so I will help you if it's
very easy it's a something that takes a
condition and by the way this move must
be something like true or false at the
end and then takes another argument that
is that is what in case it was true and
then takes the third argument what it
takes in case it was false and then
simply it calls true or false operation
so with this magical if lambda this
written we have possibility to write ifs
and we'll use that possibility
so we can for instance create some such
funny lambda like this is zero and by
the way once again this boolean false
lambda is simply in static variable
extract this standard symbol I'm using
for false or for true so this this
operation that takes something and
returns anyhow identity so this is 0
lambda but we can go even further like
less or equal operation and
now but just those are definitions you
can find in Wikipedia but this one is
really great I call it even magical a
section so let me do it
magical a section what's ethical that's
a lambda that takes an X and return X
applied to X so it's it's very rude
nasty lambda because it simply someone
comes and it says do it to yourself yeah
really the bad one but it's useful we
can use it in something called called -
I and maybe some of you have seen this
symbol before before who had seen this
symbol because it's very important
fundamental symbol of the lambda calculi
it's Y Combinator of our fixed point
Combinator we're gonna need it because
this is the symbol that allows us to
construct recursive calls because there
is a problem with recursive calls in
lambda if you have a function in Java
inside of the body of the function we
can call the function again not a
problem that's that's the way we use the
recursion if we define lambda suppose
for instance dance is 0 or less than
equal wanted to call less than equal
somewhere here like here for instance
the problem is oh sorry it's not
possible because because it's like if we
could call this symbol here it's simply
it's not yet defined because we define
it here so we cannot inside of the
variable definition we cannot refer to
variable again so that's that's a nasty
problem and in order to fight with that
we have created
someone must have invented this fixed
point Combinator so if we right now
define a such funny lambda you see how
it works if lambda let's check out the
function text somewhere takes some n by
the way this n is important if this n is
0 we use if lambda and is 0 as condition
then we'll return
cárdenas one is simply this one
definition that we used before it's in
static otherwise that's that's what
happens in case of true otherwise what
we do we'll multiply n by sounds
something strange here but bye-bye
predecessor of n yeah let me check if it
compiles because sometimes it yeah so we
have this and right now any one of you
has idea what I'm trying to construct
here so see if it's zero then I return 1
otherwise I will multiply n by something
using n minus 1 not really multiply
factorial so exactly so sorry
if I use this Y with G I get something
that I can call factorial let me show
you that so a would be 3 I will print
this a and then I will in a result I
will print factorial from from a ok and
by the way at the end I will convert it
so with this operation to integer and
let me let's me to convert so let's see
if it works
how could factorial from 3 and if you
see factorial from 3 is 6
how cool it seems to work seems to work
but it may be to prove that it works we
will do something really nasty with 6 6
oh it's great but if you check it worked
it's exactly so right now you see the
power of this very limited lambda very
limited Java and power of lambda using
only definition of lambda and using only
function application I've recreated even
algorithms like factorial so basically
that's the proof okay that's proof by I
would say by example but there is this
proof that anything we can write on
computers we can represent with lambda
calculus and basically it's proud proven
a long time ago that lambda calculus and
Turing machine are equivalent so
basically for me it's lambda calculus
it's a algorithm on paper it doesn't
need CPU it's so powerful but you can do
everything it's proven so that's cool so
maybe right now we can go to and that's
that almost concludes my talk we can go
to this if we can represent any
statement like theorem like pitagoras
whatever format turin with lambda values
like because we have if we have we can
even construct something like if then
whatever
so let's represent this theorem as big
lambda then maybe we can just call it
and say at the end if it's true or false
how cool we just call it and we'll see
if it's equivalence to true then it
means theorem is true otherwise it's
false and there comes a problem because
people try to do this but happen some
lambdas like this Omega optical so I
will just show you what happens Stack
Overflow exactly it means there are some
nasty lambdas that we cannot analyze
with other lambdas because they are
simply those recursive calls because by
the way and it's the most important
thing from today about lambda calculus
no computable function can find out from
other lambda if it's equivalent to true
or false so basically you cannot having
too complicated lambda using another
lambda find out if there are the same
that's the problem with something like
this doesn't exist and by the way people
on Stack Overflow doesn't don't do not
care they are working on that with a
good result they haven't studied maths
so they not know it's impossible so how
cool so there is so basically
unfortunately the the problem
since the problem of this collar girl
cannot be solved with lambda calculus
and basically it's just because this
problem of F quick violence is the same
as halting problem of Turing machine so
you cannot using a Turing machine to
find out if another to ring machine
stops that's basically the same problem
and by the way there is even a theorem
from Kurt gödel you've probably heard
about this that no matter if we start
with sets it will start with lambdas we
start with something else I don't know
cheese whatever theory we'll build if
it's good enough to cover the arithmetic
click plus or whatever it cannot be
complete so in this theory will happen
statements that are true but you cannot
prove them using this same theory it's
even you can even in this this serum you
can see how how to construct the
statements so you can even exactly
present such statement that it's true
but you cannot prove it how cool so
summary from this talk lambda calculi
can you can do it in java why because
it's funny so we can prove that
everything that's written on Wikipedia
is working it will be working on your
machine you can debug it how cool so I
have skipped lot of problem eager lazy
initialization by the way that wasn't
the best definition of lambda you could
have that was the easiest I have skipped
the problem of for instance typed lambda
calculus so for instance if I do
multiplication what if I put in place of
argument and if that will be stupid but
with this calculus it's possible
so this problems were skipped but
generally the thing I've want to I see
from this that whatever you can imagine
can be done purely functional not that
limited as I've presented here because
it's that's very very poor functional
pure function a pure poor I would say
sorry it's not even so no excuse for you
for sure every giving can be for sure
sometimes it looks crazy so you don't
have to use it everywhere and if you
want to waste a lot of time on lambda
calculus or mathematics there are some
good sources for you so Wikipedia
I used the conventions that are on
Wikipedia so it's easy to follow this
talk and Rick
it so there is a good block on a
seashell version of the same that helped
me also basically the guy was doing the
same at the same thing at the time I was
doing and he really went way way farther
with his block so I do recommend if you
are interested there is a great book
from Roger Penrose they in Paris new
mind which doesn't really treat and it
doesn't really say much about lambda
calculus but says a lot about Turing
question
good old theorem and things like that so
it's very good book for inspiration
about these things and if you want to
visualize your lambdas you can use this
this package I was using this bedlam by
the way it's proven that it cannot work
mathematically but it's on sample simple
lambdas it would work this presentation
you can find with tiny Worrell if you
have at the end Internet so thank you
