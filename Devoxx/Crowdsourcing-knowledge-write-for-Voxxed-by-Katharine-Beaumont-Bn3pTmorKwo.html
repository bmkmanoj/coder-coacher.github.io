of the incredibly busy lunchtime in this
talk so I'm Catherine Bowman I work for
boxed if you nuvox before I am Lucy too
but not very many of you might know her
so you're always a student in software
development which I'm sure you know and
life is a constant journey of learning
but never more so true in software
development where as soon as you know
hello world and you go on to something
else on Iran lambdas and streams and
then modular system and it gets more and
more complicated so foxed is a site
designed to share knowledge and what
better way to keep learning by looking
at Vox reading the articles and maybe
seeing if you've got something to
contribute because box belongs to you
and think of us as an open source site
we don't have any advertising on the
website and its hopefully nice and clear
and easy to read and we accept
contributions and we value those
contributions because it helps us all to
show to grow and learn together so what
we want for foxed is articles news
pieces tutorials videos anything kind of
coming up in Java or associated
languages or the jvm landscape anything
that you think people would be
interested to learn about so what makes
a good news item first of all something
that's fresh and relevant it was a bit
older and it's be we've been around for
a few weeks it might be worth more being
more like an article than a news item
this is time to kind of look into it a
clear introductions isn't it kind of
bounce rate i'm sure you've come across
it when you're kind of flicking through
tabs I always have about 50 tabs open
and I maybe we like the first of many
words of an article and that informs me
as to whether or not I'm going to read
the rest of it the introduction is how
you really let people know what it's
about and persuade them to read it so it
should be basically a who what when
where why and with strong clues as to
what the content is
the middle is a bit more depth and then
this is kind of like sa class in school
with beginning middle and end and the
end is like the takeaways so we've got
this piece of news what do we want to
gain from it in terms of a bad news item
something with unjustified opinion like
speculative maybe quotes content and
images without permission we do
sometimes get submissions to boxed where
they're very clearly taken from other
websites which isn't very good or
anything obtained unfairly so maybe you
ever heard something you weren't
supposed to know it can be cross posted
on your personal blog and it can be on
other sites so I'll just show you see if
I can show you a news item
so this is one we had recently about the
proposal to add ahead of time
compilation to Java so there's an
introduction there which quite clearly
outlines it we've got a new proposal
adds it so it's really really obvious
when it's about a nice heading to lead
you in your kind of reading journey a
little bit of information and then it
finishes the video so it doesn't take
very long to read it was quite quick and
it's very clear what it's about
so good article or a tutorial is
something that's a bit more in depth so
the introduction should really be a
signpost for the rest of the blog I had
a dissertation supervisor once you told
me that your introduction should be like
the funnel of a swimming pool so you
kind of explain the outline of the ideas
and then you draw into what specifically
you're going to focus on that makes any
sense to anyone it took me a very long
time to understand what he's talking
about ahem but basically help the reader
so this is what I'm doing and this how
I'll take you through it clear-headed to
break up the article into segments so if
any of you read a blog post where it's
it just looks like noise and you're
almost especially if you have my
attention span immediately turned off
reading the detail because there's just
so much to go through the head is a
really nice way of keeping your
attention lots of examples and
screenshots and consistent level of
background knowledge is really important
so if you're writing an article for
experts don't go into the kind of
beginner details and vice versa and
quotes or code examples and further
resources at the end so our show you an
example of a really popular article
which i think is the most viewed our
corn boxed with over 50,000 views so it
has a nice introduction like his the
kind of the bulk of the swimming pool
everyone's talking about microservices
you can read a lot about it and then it
kind of narrows it down into this
article is about the challenges of
crimes and best practices so it's really
obvious what you're going to get from
the article the headings break up for
those it's very long and then as we go
further down there are pictures and lots
of links and all wraps up nicely in the
conclusion and if you have time check
out that article so
hey sorry I did that okay bad article
something that's maybe unclear and
there's too much technical jargon if you
looked at it and maybe you'd have to
have a PhD in the particulars that
they're talking about to understand it
something's been done to death so maybe
my first docker container probably
already have a few articles about that
and somebody has been plagiarized which
can is quite a strong word but it can
also just mean replicated or duplicated
maybe you read martin fellows clean code
bob martin sorry he's clean code and you
just essentially rewritten clean code so
that's something that that is a bit
questionable and we'd probably stay away
from them whereas if you were
summarizing it that's different and okay
we're not in France but Tintin didn't
really fit in here so asterisks so what
the statistics so we look for a maximum
of three thousand words it can be a bit
longer but it's very difficult to keep
people's attention and also if it's a
bit longer than you should maybe
consider a career as a technical author
write a book about 15 minutes to read so
again it's just keeping people's
involvement images need to be used with
full permission so no copyright
infringement code examples are great
okay so here are some faq anyway if
you're thinking like oh that sounds
really nice maybe I'll contribute but I
don't have enough experience so what's
this supposed to be a platform for
everyone of different levels of
experience so we don't really have
enough articles at the moment of
instruction to java or introduction to
java effects or the first steps or my
first pojo or anything like that so
there is room for everything I'm not
programmer we have a number of a number
of very successful non programming
articles about DevOps for example or
culture and community there are people
who are better qualified but they're
probably not writing articles so get
involved I don't have any time so it can
take as little as maybe 30 minutes to
write a news piece and it can take as
long as you like to write an article
and what if you don't know what to write
about in which case my response is what
do you want to write about the best way
to learn is to teach so have a look does
anyone have any questions I will show
you oh thank you so the question is how
do you submit an article or news item so
on the website here there is a submit
article section well that would happen
hang on a second
and so if you just go to this page you
can do it there alternatively you can
contact me an email me if you'd rather
do it in google docs Docs or something
and I can go through the pain of putting
it in the WordPress CMS any other
questions it's basically just me I know
and if I need any opinions that I just
ask say mark hazel or Stefan or anyone
else he's hanging around on skype at the
time and yeah I'm the gatekeeper anyone
else cool well thank you very much come
up and ask me afterwards if you have
anything or I'll be at the back of the
exhibition hall in the middle thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
