joined by Dukes choice the winner your
hand birth yeah and thank you very much
for joining us my pleasure and ya han
you're doing that your jigs choice award
was for your work in the JavaFX
community based on something you started
with your company launched on on the job
ref export and you now formed an entity
called glue one can you tell us about
this projects okay yeah so first of all
I think this was an award given to glue
on but the the java community in general
really deserves credit for the work over
the past year not only the java vex
community but also the job of xt
madorigal they did a great job in
maintaining a java vex on the desktop as
part of java vex 8 it's a going it's a
more mature more books or fixed more
performant and we definitely see a huge
increase in adoption of a javax than
many companies that are migrating their
swing applications to java vex many
companies also that are now interested
in mobile and that want to have some
java on mobile and their java vex is a
perfect solution and because we were
working on a job of exports already
which is the open-source effort to poor
job of x2 mobile we got lots of
questions from companies do you support
this can can you do some consulting and
can i get some training and that's one
of the reasons that we decided we have
to put a commercial entity for this
because the open-source effort that we
do is great in the community very much
appreciated and and works together with
us in announcing jia of exxonmobil but
having a comer commercial entity that
provides support training products and
that adds value to the gfx platform made
the ecosystem much much more relevant
because many developers including myself
we love open source and we want all
source code with it to be available but
we want to combine it with requests from
companies that say the source code is
great but you also we also want the
support contracting we want subscription
and so so therefore we needed a company
and that's a good
on gluten is a bit bigger than just what
we did with Lord John and you have
exports because in order to create the
Java vex framework that goes end-to-end
you also need some library that that
allows you to create compelling user
interfaces and while Java vex is a great
platform it does not provide everything
yet so glue on the services on top of
javafx some are in mobile some are more
general but the goal is to to make Java
vex more suitable for real-world usages
on mobile and desktop so you kind of got
that reassurance that you have this
comprehensive package you're not going
to need to dip in and out why do you
think that people refer to our F
exxonmobil everything what whatever it
is relative with Java exxonmobil well
it'sit's Java on mobile and as a
consequence there are between five and
ten million developers that can use it
because five or ten million people are
using Java in their daily job so the
developer base is huge you don't need
separate skills for Android or for iOS
if you program in Java it's not only the
business logic that's executed in Java
but the whole UI layer is is done with
javafx and it's a great modern framework
that takes advantage of hardware
acceleration so the time to development
is much faster and especially the
maintenance is much cheaper so the
company has to support a website java
sorry an Android application and an iOS
application that's expensive and it
requires different code bases
synchronization so their java vex is
really one white ones run anywhere and
it would have a dream that was the java
doing from the beginning and it's really
coming to now I mean especially now with
the importance really everything is
going to be mobile first isn't it going
for especially in the developing markets
if you kind of if you think about some
people's first point of contact now is
to mobile exactly mobile is definitely
taking over the web there was always
going to be some place for the web but
most transactions are originating from
mobile so it's very important and on the
subject of java mobile we publish
something on
earlier this year about plans from
Oracle t-back a full body java on mobile
and what's your opinion on this well I
only see the technical things of course
but what I see is great so the openjdk
project has been a huge catalyze 80 for
java in general and what they are doing
now is they're providing a code that
allows you to build openjdk for modern
mobile mobile platforms so that actually
means that with the new contributions
that this Oracle project is going to
make we have a Java line on mobile we
have java 9 on iOS java 9 on Android and
also java 9 on the microsoft surface
tablet so all the bits are going to be
in open source I think that's that is
really from a technical point a game
changer so we can now build our own java
virtual machine not only for desktop
linux mac but it's also going to work
the same java the same bits are going to
work on mobile and that's that that is
huge and it's huge i think as well it's
kind of obviously talking about having
to learn kind of just specifics for
android people are going to have to do
that you can just take your java and
anyone can do it yes exactly how
hypothetical so obviously this is a
project that is determine on the
momentum of the community as well how
far away do you think we are from
realizing this do you think this is
going to be the work of a few years or
well I was a bit surprised to see how
small the patches are which actually
means that the working openjdk is so
good that it's very generic so there's
of course there's much work needed in
order to have it on Android and iOS but
this is not something that they just
started then they hope to have finished
in five years or so I really think this
is this is it going fast I think by John
one next year we will probably know more
where it stands so you think this is
something people should definitely be
paying attention to oh yeah yeah at
least I'm I'm very very much looking
forward to seeing other contributions in
openjdk and what if affects you what you
do want a tool if
when this project if this project gets
bigger kind of gets a bit of critical
mass yeah well with glue one we
currently bundle your javafx
applications with javax mobile runtime
and then on Android we are currently
running on top of da week and on iOS we
use the hope of Mao decompiler we will
make we will give developers more choice
so we will allow them to still keep
using dalvik for Android but we will
also allow them to use the OpenJDK the
mobile version of the OpenJDK which has
the advantage of a Java nine Java 8 API
switch you currently can't use on
Android first I can enjoy java 6 I think
at the moment yeah something between six
and seven fifteen mj's or anything like
that there yeah it's it's there's no
strange for example on Android and and
as Robert vm is using the same class
part as Android so that means on iOS we
also don't have streams at the moment
but with the mobile OpenJDK project we
we will offer use of the choice to
bundle the application with this openjdk
version on iOS as well and as a
consequence they will have streams in
the full Java 80 Java nine support on
both iOS Android and the microsoft
surface tablet is also that advantage a
lot of people kind of say or Android is
propping up Java working with those yeah
well i think that the nice thing about
this is that it's it's done in the
OpenJDK so it's it's a regardless of all
the discussion on who owns java and the
api in the copyrights this is really
work combined that's combined by
companies like oracle but also by the
community and that's important i think
definitely i think Java's future
regardless of where it's what the
direction is i think it very much is in
the hands of the
and I think Lots developments we've seen
this year very kind of almost
consolidate that there's people out
there that will kind of pushed Java
forward yes so that I think this indent
the ecosystem is working because
companies like Oracle but also
autocompletes like Twitter reddit and so
are contributing code and it's up to the
community and to third parties to to do
something useful and productive with it
so that seems to be working thank you
very much for taking the time to talk to
us see it and again congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
