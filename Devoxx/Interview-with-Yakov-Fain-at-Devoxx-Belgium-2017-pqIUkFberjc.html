joined by Yakov who's given a deep dive
and a conference to talk about angular
so I heard that angle is not angularjs
anymore it's now just angular that's
correct yeah this is angular now and to
be more precise it's angular 5 it was
really the week ago and yesterday I gave
three hour sessions for just to show
people from scratch how we can build an
app and we did today I'll give a shorter
version of this talk for Java developers
we will be using spring boot server on
Java and then angular we'll be talking
to Joe what new features do we have an
angular 5 you know 5 is mainly about
performance improvements about making
smaller bundles when you deploy the app
and switching from angular for regular
fire is very easy it takes and five
minutes for very simple app and maybe 10
15 minutes for the larger one so it's
very easy how easy is it to get started
building an angular app from scratch how
to start mmm well first of all you need
to use a tool excellent tool from
angular team called angular CLI you
install it and you run a command ng new
and name of the project and in a minute
you get a project up and running of
course it's a very simple project and
you need to start adding stuff to it but
it's it's a no event to start a new
application you need to learn angular
sure enough but to start is it's pretty
easy is it easy to learn for someone
who's never used angular before say a
Java developer
I wouldn't say that it is easy but I
would say it's requires some time what
is good for Java developers a we use
typescript language which is very
similar to Java in terms of syntax the
language is very easy to learn but the
API the artifacts of angular what is
available in the API it's a big
framework it's not a small library so it
takes
time to learn you need to learn how to
arrange client-side navigation using
router and there are tons of different
features how dependency injection works
how to create production build versus
development build you need to learn how
to intercommunicate with components so
there are things to learn but it's just
a matter of time rather than being
overly complex when you build apps in
angular and and you're looking at how to
compose your applications do you do it
based on components or do you look at
the page you're trying to build right
you angular is a component based
framework so it consists of components
you have a root component with shell
components with each component head can
have its own children and so on so you
need to look at the prototype or maybe
as the imager so it's created by the web
designer and you need to start splitting
in your mind splitting this page into
components then you can give components
for development for different developers
and brings them back together the other
important thing is which UI library to
use because you want to make your
application as pretty as possible and
more looking so there are different
options one of them is this is something
that we used in our project angular
material it's an excellent library of UI
component that follow material design
principles set by Google it has only
like 30 components for now so we are
adding additional library
for missing components some people keep
using popular library called bootstrap
and there is like maybe half a dozen
other libraries for UI components so you
can pick and choose what you like there
so you mentioned that there are some
components that are missing what
components do you personally want to see
well in the large enterprise apps a
powerful data table is required there is
data table in the angular material but
maybe it's not as powerful like rich
edit controls communication with maps
file uploader
all these things exist for example we
use a library called prime ng they have
70 components so we had components from
zero so we use a mix thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
