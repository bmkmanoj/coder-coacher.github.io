best English because my native language
is Dutch so once in a while there will
be a Dutch word in the English text I
want to tell you a story about
innovation and entrepreneurship and i
want to tell you this by my own story my
own startup that i found it a few years
ago and the startup is called started
it's the largest incubator in belgium
for early-stage startups today i was
told that over ninety percent of the
people here in this room are engineers
and i must say i like engineers a lot
you all know how to build things and
that's fantastic you are all interested
in new technologies to do that so the
way I see it when you have
entrepreneurial blood running through
your veins and I hope there are a lot of
people with entrepreneurial blood today
you have two options first one and
that's the way I will and that's the way
I will do my presentation the first one
is you can start your career and a
corporate you know then it will be an
entrepreneur an intrapreneur is an
entrepreneur on the payroll of a
corporate or a company that's not your
own second option if you are
entrepreneurial blood you can do a
start-up of your own it's a little bit
similar similar now
the important thing who the is this
guy you know my name is Luther and I
found it started and I took both choices
I started as an entrepreneur I found it
several companies and that I became an
intrapreneur and I now I'm an
entrepreneur again so it's a complicated
story but most important thing of all if
you I think you all know that is that
that star and a little ship parts from
it started was born three years ago out
of a big corporate corporate is called
KBC I don't know if you know that people
who are not from Belgium KBC is a large
banking group and they're not banks are
not so known for their innovation and
what you should know about most
corporates and that's that's advice to
know is that they're structured like
this there are structured like silos and
from the moment you get that into your
head you will know how to innovate in
corporate structures like this each
department has a silo you have legal
silo you have an HR silo you have one
for communication you have one from
marketing you have one for sales you
have one for R&amp;amp;D ICT and so on the
reason why there are silos is because
the people who are in that silos do
everything to protect what's in it
namely information those are the people
you have the mr. yellows the mr. Reds
the mr. reds or the bosses the mr.
yellows are the employees and all the
mr. yellows they have to report to the
mr. Reds and you have several of those
groups in each and every silo they want
to keep all the experience and all the
information in one silo and fifty years
ago people must have thought big
managers must have thought well that's a
good idea let's organize or corporates
like there are machines or like they're
our armies
so we can control everything and it
doesn't end there there are a few layers
added to this you have the mr. blacks
then you have the mr. blues very on top
of there that's a CEO of a business unit
you have the senior general management
layer and you have a lot of layers who
all report to one another and that
complicates stuff if you want to be an
innovator in a company like that for the
record a company a corporate like KBC
had eight of those business units you
know eight not eight silos but eight of
those silos structures so if you want a
strict management it's fantastic a
structure like this if you want to do
innovation in a company like this it's a
hell of a job and it won't work
why is that because you are that mr.
green and a mr. green of the silo of HR
wants to talk with a mr. green of
communication or marketing in order to
do that and now I will explain something
very very complex in order to do that
this guy needs that guy that guy that
guy and that guy he has to go to this
guy this has to improve this idea which
usually doesn't happen he has to lay a
meeting with this one this one and this
one he has to put together an agenda
those three to report to that one that
one has to go to this one who pulls a
meeting with this one this one and this
one and you're a year further because
then the information goes from this one
back to this one to that one to that one
he goes to hear that one gets attracted
that one gets attract that's why
innovation and big corporates don't work
that's why innovation in KBC for a
period of time didn't work and if you
were an entrepreneur in an organization
like that it weighs on you you know and
your position is somewhere there you're
here and I will explain to you how it
started we came from here to being a
towboat no tugboat trying to get the big
corporate flagship a little bit of
course it all starts with the idea and
the idea was look we want to support
early stage startups why because they
have the hardest lives if you are a
normal starter like like a lawyer or
like plumber we all know what to do with
you but if you are a start-up in a new
economy a disruptive or innovative
economy a lot of risk we don't know what
to do
and we don't know how to how to handle
you as a bank so we we didn't give them
money at the time because the risk was
too high we just left a crisis what we
had a gigantic network and our goal was
to open up that network for
entrepreneurial people in early stage we
wanted to give every startup one-on-one
coaching every star where as it gets a
mentor every startup gets one of the
biggest startup academies in Belgium we
open up our networks like I said they
got workspace they got workshops events
a lot of fun and there's the catch we
want to do it for free we don't take
equity you don't obey one single cent at
our program so imagine when you have a
business model like that and you go to a
management of a bank it's not well
received so how did we succeed well
there was a good timing the timing was
right for our idea if you are an
innovator in a company and you want to
push forward one of your IDs and you're
all engineers so you have ideas every
day every day you see problems you can
solve because you're engineer's and
you're very good at it your company has
to be ready for innovation and banks I
guess you know they were we just had a
financial crisis there were complex
systems we had complex experience for
our customers there was a broken trust
relation with our customers there were
redundant and the meteor is it ever
there were a lot of hurdles to get to a
bank and if you got there there was a
limited access they were as good as not
online and so on and so on
so there was a room for improvement and
that i always think about one of the
biggest philosophers of human history
Mike Tyson who says everybody has a
strategy until you got punched on your
face and the banks they got punched on
their face and what KBC that did as one
of the bankses they put all the brains
together they you had a keynote about
the community few minutes ago so they
put together communities of brains they
said look we have 35 40 thousand people
in our company that's 40,000 brains we
can use 40,000 IDs so let's put them all
together and I was I got just one of
those brains and one of the ideas but I
had an employer who was ready for it
second thing I did so first thing was
time set was right second thing was I
put together a complimentary team and I
will explain a bit later on and when you
want to start your own startup as an
engineer from our experience because we
saw ready 650 700 startups a lot of them
founded by engineers what are our
experiences with engineer startups I
built a complimentary team because you
need someone to challenge you someone
who has skills and talents that you
don't have and then you grow faster this
one I know it's recorded so I will take
a little bit of time because he doesn't
like to get in the picture eric is a
decision maker from KBC he is one of the
mr. pink's he is one of the mr. banks so
he's situated over there he has a direct
hotline to the CEO and he can kick the
ass of directors and general managers
below him and that's very good if you
want to do is start up then if you do a
start-up yourself that's your business
angel the fourth thing I did is built
leverage
and that's an important one because then
the company you work for doesn't decide
alone anymore you build a partnership
with a sort of team of the Willing other
companies government agencies
universities high schools and so on so
you get leverage and the company I
worked for was one of the seven and each
had a h-had an equal voice in the steel
co that gains you credibility it gains
you growth you have a cross-industry
innovation going on and I'm built I'm
building up this is the most important
one work and act like a start-up it's a
hard work to build a start-up of your
own but if you're passionate guy before
set it to if you're passionate you will
get there you don't mind to work 14 15
16 hours a day because the result is
there and that's the advantage of
working for a company when you're not an
entrepreneur is that everything is taken
care for you you don't have to be
worried about HR you don't have to be
worried about your facilities or your
ICT infrastructure or your marketing or
your branding or your sales whatever if
you work in a company with a structured
silo then everything is done for you if
you do a start-up you have to do
everything yourself where we are now we
have one of the biggest networks in
Belgium for early-stage startups we have
approximately 227 startups at this time
that we coach and manage they all raised
at because there are early stages not so
much but nevertheless five more than
five million euro we saw over more than
650 startups like I said and we have a
rather good male female
stuff so that's nice for all you guy
engineers here I don't see a lot of
girls for the moment so that's good
because we have a lot of female
entrepreneurship as well and we support
that a lot if you want to build a
start-up of your own I ask myself our
engineers good startup founders are
there and then I search for a few
examples and there are some examples you
have to larry's marry Allison of Oracle
then you have Larry Page from google
then you have young from yahoo Elon Musk
everyone knows of course Bill Gates too
and the funny guy right is steve wozniak
of Apple so it's possible but after we
saw 650 startups and this one may come
hard what is the same as if I would talk
to a room of marketeers now it's
engineers but if I talk to a room of
marketeers I will try to give you some
golden tips and tricks if you want to
found a start-up how to be successful
don't over develop we see a lot of
engineers who try to overdevelop they
are so in love with a product they want
to do it fantastic they want to do it
right and they over develop a product
without without going to the market
first please interact with customers in
an early stage prove your MVP to the
market validated iterate and then change
it's so important we have seen a lot of
startups fail and with some depth
because they went to the market too late
and they build a product put a lot of
money in it and the market to set sorry
I don't want to buy it and then then
you're screwed second one and you cannot
read it very well and that's there's a
reason for that don't focus on a noise
focus on a signal it's something that
Elon Musk always says and he's so right
focus on the signal engineers are people
who want to resolve things make them
better so instead of building lots of
features make the key product better
poor products they require big
investments and marketing Nikola and the
the Tesla of Elon Musk and that love
Elon Musk he can put all his money in
development because he has a fantastic
product that no one else in the market
has but it's a market where a lot of
people drive cars so if he wants to
build a car he has to build a fantastic
car
a lot of Engineers we see are a bit risc
avoidant and that's bad for a start-up
you don't have to eliminate risk we see
it a lot from people who had an engineer
job in big companies where it was the
role to manage and eliminate risk
managing risk is fantastic eliminating
risk is bad for a start-up that's a one
that we found especially with engineers
with marketeers we don't see that that
often not all not all so often with the
sales people but there is a profile in
breed engineer's like to work with other
engineers they understand each other
they feel good amongst each other if the
skills are complementary it's ok but
most of the times they stimulate each
other and over developing so please if
you look if you're looking for a
co-founder and you want to build your
own startup file found find someone who
has complementary skills every startup
wants to be funded once in a while by a
VC or buy a business angel always keep
in mind that a VC will never ever ever
maybe some do but most of the vc's will
never invest in research they will
invest in a company in a team and in a
product that has a market validation yet
that already has a market validation
that has already been to the market
first customers and so on so I would
like to end with a very positive note
because we have over 220 companies they
are all looking for top engineers
engineers in silicon valley technical
engineers in silicon
today their payroll is up to 250
thousand dollars a year so there are a
lot of opportunities so please if you
have entrepreneurial blood in you if
it's running through the veins think
about starting your own startup and if
you do then you can always come and talk
to us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
