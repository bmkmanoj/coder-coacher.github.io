and Josh I'm going to talk about spring
five so what's coming up you again and
it's exciting times at the moment we are
which just released like to go in five
actually just yesterday and the the m5
releases for the final milestone the
last milestone in the we are about to
enter the release candidate face the 575
is almost feature complete but we've got
a few feature areas that we still wanna
tackle and you in particular our
reactive efforts already coming coming
together very nicely I'm sure you agree
Josh the the five to the m5 feiss very
significant update if anybody is about
to try what we're doing this this is the
chance to but we have a few areas that
we are venturing in its not just a
reactive efforts the reactive web stack
which we actually calling spring web
flux now it has a name now to me a
weapon me see swing whether whether we
see has a companion framework a separate
but aligned framework called spring wet
flux but it's not just about the
reactive ness of it all it's also about
a certain functional style showing up in
in several parts of the framework for
being registration for endpoint
registration which I'm really exploring
a bit of a different perspective onto
onto the framework for my age of eight
perspective from a from a coupling
perspective we have first coupling
support now buoyed by the being based on
da way right yeah yeah it's an enabler
it's a great enabler we finally have a
job a baseline we can expose Java 8 API
type so everywhere whatever and whenever
we want right not just reflectively
support them in application code which
we have been doing for many years but
also in the framework itself in the
framework KPIs themselves which is a
great great opportunity which we really
embrace house
finding working with javed an effective
balance it's it's of course a almost
liberating right but I mean just to take
the perspective we head of the the past
couple of years we've already had a Java
8 enable test suite so we've already
we're very used to using Java a to
texting the framework in Java 8 context
to enabling java 8 in application code
finally it creeps into the production
code place now and we're actually
somewhat defensive right it's we
primarily focusing on edit value' from
an application development perspective
because improving the internals of the
source code well it's kind of nice it's
a bonus but it's only something we
really benefit from it the contributors
possibly benefit from our primary
perspective is the application
development experience and having an
even stronger javed story there endicott
I'm sorry side by side with that a great
just tearing from from my perspective
that that's the cotton stuff is
particularly interesting I think that
just happened earlier this year late
last year we decided rather late it came
to a 5-2 the 14 we actually tracking the
latest clapping one that won it so it's
a it's a collaboration we say the
copying team at jetbrains we were really
benefit from each other's immediate
feedback so yeah there's even a sort of
alignment between the release cycles in
the meantime we are we are trying to use
copying as input as an opportunity to
take a specific slightly different
perspective on to our own api's and our
own API usage style so it's to us it's
not just another language to support
it's a very specific style that we're
trying to apply and we're trying to make
sure that the framework is not only an
ideal citizen in Java 8 world in with
Java the language but also in a slightly
different design philosophy which is
copying and the functional styling
copying is actually really nice it makes
it yeah when we have javed as the only
other player now we can talk about this
basic functional programming in Java
right so it makes sense to go to another
functional languages say let's make it
work both in both places equally well in
a kind of this as we often often see
this an API is only really
hard and if you take different
perspective if it satisfies different
requirements from different perspectives
so it's great timing what's done the
same with Ruby inspring come back for
added an even stronger groovy story and
now Kotlin basically gets equal first
class treatment yeah cause the coupling
team as even as you say what I find very
interesting is they're super responsive
right yeah they are really aggressively
trying to make this the best language
for all the people are using it live
added things to language proper into the
tooling so it's just become this really
great runs it's from a from a mainstream
perspective we are entirely aware that
the Java 8 is the reference so the our
reference language certainly is Java and
Java in its Java 8 inclination and we
are also looking forward to embracing
Jay Dickey 92 the best possible degree
so this is a a key theme in its own
right jdk 9 not so much from a language
perspective but from an infrastructural
perspective yeah we're really looking
forward to the virtual machine
improvements duty to compact strings ddd
out of the box protocol stack that's
ready for HTTP 2e it's worth upgrading
to Cherokee 9 inches for infrastructural
reasons and we've already went the extra
mile to make that work for for for more
than one a year already more than one
year where we are tracing GD canine
tracking DJ declaring snapshots and kind
of even the CI building jadek in 90
we're really trying to be there when JT
canine fells life hopefully end of july
we've already done everything we can
possibly do and then we even enable
people to to opt into jigsaw so it you
actually expect people to to upgrade in
classic of milk the easiest smooth the
stuff great past the one that I
certainly recommend is staying in class
puff mode take your Java 8 based
architecture and just run it on JD t9
that's the smooth the spa but if if
people choose to opt in to click so into
the module path then our spring
framework deliverables our spring from a
jar artifacts are fine companions on the
module path
it can be deployed as automatic modules
again we're trying to take the
application development perspective so
the only thing that really matters is
that the as an application developer
choosing to use jigsaw for your own
application modules you'll have to find
experience with the spring with the
spring przemek supporting your
application modules it's less relevant
what we are internally doing and whether
we benefit from cheats or whether we
deploy its automatic modules or with
explicit descriptives doesn't make a
difference as long as the applications
perspective remains as as first-class as
it should be so there's also an
interesting time of course we're a
little bit ahead of Cherokee nine well
we've been ahead of jdk 8 back with
sprinkler looks like this is a thing
where you get at least three months so
head over to DHEA right they can swing
from a point that now we're a little bit
closer to the gdq nine timeline so that
the timing works perfectly from my
perspective and we do a good job of
following up but there is there's
usually not inconsistencies with the
release and then the genie cavers and
they're impulsive government efforts but
it's now hey there's always a quite
reach that we do if there's any kind of
yeah yeah it's to me those those efforts
are ongoing anyway all of them jdk nine
is kind of a an ongoing theme that we're
going to explore along with coupling
along with the reactive story along with
the functional style springtime book
five is the beginning basically of a new
generation of the framework but we
really mean it as a starting point just
going to be a 5 to 1 Peter release a
factor 2 Peter release continuing along
those those those trends along those
things and reaching a maybe more
complete more more comprehensive
arrangement we see this as an ongoing
mission that we're on and we are so
dependent on peek back at the moment we
already have early adopters even for
decoupling support in particular for the
reactive stack but the moment that we
open this up to the general public right
that's the way that I'm seeing the ga
release early adopters are great but the
general public has so many different
perspectives to bring in so much
feedback to feedback to us they can try
it out the spring initializer yeah you
can kinda spring a spring their spring
boot to the dough of course is going to
be late later this year is going to be
the next kind of bring it to the masses
pointing in the road maps you can try
spring five if you want to keep the tyre
soor speed yeah it's entirely possible
right now right ed the spring web
reactive starter yeah already delivers a
spring comic five milestone with
sprinkle to do those snapshots
soon-to-be milestones in spring boot
land as well so it's already all in
place but it's not the spring put to the
dough is not going to go ta before later
this year so I bring comic 5 is about
how how about the earlier I'm looking
forward to seeing where we go with jdk
java.util concurrent flow and reactor
and spring five that seems like every
the convergence around reactive
programming these days that's
alternative all timed it's it's very
much a yeah it is a convergence point at
the moment it it is a very collaborative
effort so didi in our reactive efforts
we couldn't do this on our own when we
we are we we are the main sponsor of the
director project ID the we have a lot of
people around us we're doing really
great work within within the company
here but also it wouldn't actually make
as much sense in practice if it is only
we would venture into this territory but
their status so drivers coming up there
is there are many industry stakeholders
lady things come together this year and
is now that now that the foundational
bitter in place I really am enjoying
seeing what we're doing in the spring
ecosystem and the R&amp;amp;D team around spring
favorite proper of course the web
endpoints the console reactive where I'm
going to the web client director web
client spring data has been upgraded to
call it back to programming sprinkled
stream for messaging will be will
support reactive programming spring tile
itself as there's a few new project with
that we haven't even announced yet which
will support reactive programming that
are going to be amazing there's just
innovations with the existing this as
well I mean the reactive stuff is
permeating the whole stack so you can
take advantage of it and gain that
support where you have a long-running
sort of i/o Island tips workloads you
know really ideal suppose your
experience using that we actually
program in spring which window so
there's things you've just done the
record spring the first night we dive in
the air of this I'm starting to do in a
new toy
data here i will be doing a better
version of that deluxe poland yeah
there's the next opportune the both of
us be together but from somewhere where
i've been i've been world working with
the community members in with
organizations and the spring the spring
cloud stories been well received right
they appreciate the support for micro
services but there is at one small use
case where they've got potentially long
large amounts of data Ryan just large or
deny the better than when I move across
different partitions and traditional
synchronous i/o isn't a great fit there
that that one little hole the stack and
that isn't something to do that isn't no
deficiency in any way with a spring
proper it's just a way that it's just a
DaVinci with the way that the certainly
API works by and large is not really
tuneful and anybody go to the database
layer it's not been tuned for that so
it's just nice to be able to say this
and we've got a great story here you
know yeah it's not just about this
holistic right the different stylistic
perspective that we're taking which is
important in its own right it's it's
it's very it's actually very motivated
by by hardware resources by efficient
use of available hardware resources and
there are several factors involved here
you use of HTTP to actually goes very
nicely with a reactive stack that makes
sense well ideally stream processing
more efficient than before with threats
not walking waiting on strings with
leading it up to a runtime event loop
trying to do the best possible job in in
processing concurrently processing
strings so we were really see it as an
enabling facility and enabling model
that we're providing here in order to
let architect so knowledgeable
architects out there build really
efficient highly efficient web
architectures for 2017 and beyond and
you're not in this at all in you can
you're still using spring and still the
tools and technologies you know no it's
just now you have this extra tool in the
toolbox which is really good at the same
time we have the assembly based web
stack in terror and we have two parallel
web sticks now it's actually it's not
unusual we had a Soviet in the portrait
segment for we the bullets that doesn't
actually exist anymore in five but we
have a new
parallel lipstick so spring stupid web
embassy and it's the spring wedlock
stack on reactor in parallel we are
still very committed to a highly
efficient service tax embracing save it
for coming along now the latest
generation of civic containers so it's a
it's a it's a parallel strategy both for
existing systems having a
straightforward upgrade path to spring
embassy in in the spring five generation
but also for in newly written code of
course spring Soviet embassy remains a
first-class part of the framework
offering so it's up to the architects
out there to decide what makes the most
sense in in any in any particular
environment in under particular
circumstances with the requirements that
they are facing and the spring ecosystem
is dedicated to making sure that that
choice is not something you have to pay
a cost for so as I say it's bring data
spring security spring framework itself
spring integration spring cut screams
you can have proper new technologies are
all going to they all never just where
appropriate you know you won't have to
give up parts of the given parts of
ecosystem just to be able to make a jump
which is I think one thing that people
when they it's possible to reactive
programming with spring and some other
technology today that you give up so
that those are the layers you know thank
you very much well so more I guess
people can watch your talks which are
going to be recorded I mean when I can
check out what's coming up in spring
five as well as what you've shown us and
then how do you get to programming wispy
and come to our target deluxe board oh
yeah absolutely yeah you can usually
agree the dirt ography you could get you
to go Oh Sees I want to do that so stay
tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
