Erika - ah I'm working in the IBM cloud
unit as Technical Sales and one of my
hobbies there is working with blockchain
and blockchain deployment we have in the
cloud and as you might or might not know
wait we base ourselves on this hyper
ledger open source hyper ledger fabric
and there is rather recently a version
one of this and there is a lot of things
that happened with this version one
which make it much more consumable which
make it much more easy to use and that
is actually what what I'm gonna try to
explain in this 15 minutes that we have
here for this session just a quick recap
so what this blockchains blockchain is
all about business networks were
multiple participants exchanged some
assets you want to immutable record
transactions those transactions are
typically based on the usage of smart
contracts which are written in code in
the end in the blockchain itself as a
transaction so that kind of the the the
big kind of ideas of blockchain now what
what is the the hyper ledger doing so on
the one hand you have the hyper ledger
of fabric which is the blockchain fabric
implementation and and of course you can
just write code for that so you can
write your own smart contracts and use
the API z'n and and all those things and
until the version one that was the only
thing that was there which wasn't that
easy
you have to understand quite well the
API is you had to write the smart
contracts in go code which is not
necessarily everybody's most well known
programming language so the work quite
some skills needed to do something in
the hyper ledger version zero six a lot
has changed with the version one because
there we have something which is called
hyper ledger composer and the whole idea
about hyper ledger composer is that the
instead of reasoning in GU code you're
gonna start reasoning in business
concepts you're gonna reason with
entities and and all those kind of
things at a higher abstraction level and
then the composer is gonna help you by
generating things like your smart
contracts etc and then once you have
done that you can of you well of course
they'll make your business application
whatever user interface whatever
integrations you want to build you gonna
you're gonna do that now people
immediately also because that's the
purpose also of the session I will show
you but the composer but so if you want
to get started with it it's available in
the cloud so you can just go to that
link which is shown here and you can get
started we will later also see there is
also a possibility to install it
in-house
it's basically delivered as docker
container which you can as soon as you
have a docker infrastructure you can
spin it up and and get it running local
now with the with the composer there is
also a to that which comes with it which
helps you in working as a developer and
so the Rozonda on the one hand we will
see the composer web interface where you
can do a lot of things and generate from
there but there is also possibilities
that you just work with your models in
set of code files so there is a modeling
language
which allows you to model the entities
and and all those kind of things you
write your business logic in JavaScript
and then there is a number of supports
so to build as an into a devops chain
with a usage of over lot of open source
things so there is for example from an
ad vitur viewpoint there is some support
for Adam or Visual Studio code which you
can use there is a there are some
plugins for that which then allow help
you with the same tack so for example
the modeling language there is a number
of command line utilities there is some
human a code generation which we have
which helps you've been building the
skeleton for your application so it's
even possible to generate an angular
based for example UI to your blockchain
back-end that you built with with the
composer and there is also some
integration possibilities to integrate
with api's in the backend based on the
loopback framework so that kind of the
components that are being used in and in
the solution it's all open source stuff
etcetera so you can easily get started
with these things install them on your
machine and get going now what we gonna
look into and I'm gonna show you just
the user interface of the composer
because that's about the time which we
will have in this session and the
example we gonna use is the example of
implementing a solution for vehicle
options and that it's one of the
examples that also comes delivered with
the tools so it's born which you could
easily reproduce yourself and go in more
detail yourself after the session so
what do you typically need in a vehicle
auction and it's a good example because
almost everybody knows the kind of eBay
or other like auction websites where you
on the one hand have two kinds of
parties you have some parties selling
and buying the the the the vehicles and
then you will also have some people
monitoring the whole network the
auctioneers who might have some more
rights and might exercise some control
on the network then of course from a
viewpoint of entities that play a bigger
role in deserts the con be the less
things of the cars or describing what
the car is what is the the the the the
minimum price and all those kind of
things and then there will be basically
the the transactions will be bids on the
car and then those bits will follow
certain rules and those rules you're
obviously gonna bake them in the in the
smart contract so here is a bit of of
things so that the entities that will
play a role in this kind of example will
be the vehicle identified by its a
unique identification number and then
the vehicle listing which will describe
what the state is the color etc the type
of the Curan and all those kind of
informations that are useful for the
people wanted to buy the cars then we
also need to model the participant so
there will be the the members which will
be the people either selling or buying
cars and then there will be the kind of
governor of the of the whole thing which
will be the auctioneer and then the the
transaction logic we will put it in some
some script and there will basically be
a number
of types of transactions here there will
be the the possibility to bet on a car
which follows certain rules for example
that the bid this binding and all those
kind of things and then there is also
the the logic that needs to happen when
the time is up when the auction closes
what needs to happen then to a close of
the the sales transaction so that's the
kind of things that you would need for a
vehicle action business network so let's
now go to the composer playground so as
I already said you can just go to this
URL and then you will be able to use it
and there is also the possibility to
install it locally using docker
containers and that's also the same
applies for the hyper ledger fabric in
the past it was much more difficult to
install your own installation of the
blockchain Network now you can easily
spend up nodes by using docker and using
the docker images which are provided at
the hyper ledger foundation so let's now
move to some demonstrations so if you
want to find this you can just go to the
hyper ledger org and there look at the
composer project and if you click on the
getting started that will take you to
the page where you can access either the
playground online which is just this
docker containing running in the IBM
cloud or you can install the composer
locally using docker so if we if we go
to the
it's already open so if we go to the
composer playground so let's get started
so the first thing you're gonna need to
do is create some new project and you
can give it the name
and at the description and then of
course if you do your own stuff you will
probably start with one of the empty
template or with the base example
Network you can also take one of the the
examples which is a quick way to have
something to play around with and look
at so we can do this
and now I already have it so if you
would create your own empty project you
of course would not have anything here
we already have a number of entries and
it it's a good way to to see how it
works
here is this model description language
so it's quite easy you just anybody who
knows how to program should be able to
do this so you see here that there is a
number of entities defined the vehicle
listing the participant with each time a
number of attributes and some indicators
whether attributes are mandatory or not
and all those kind of thing so that is
basic the basic start you define this
network and then once you have that you
can also start to define your smart
contracts and this is being done in
JavaScript code so here for example in
this example we have the clothes bedding
what is happening when the when when the
auction ends and there is also the code
for makin offer and you see the business
logic and again this is much more simple
than it was in the past because now it's
just simple JavaScript code the last
thing which you can still do is because
one of the concepts of hyper ledger is
that it's a permission based network so
you can also do access control lists
which allow you again in an easy way to
specify some security for example what
kind of operations somebody some
participant in the network will be able
to do and then
you will be able to specify even on the
attribute basis if attributes are
modifiable or not by certain members of
the of the of the network and that is
being done by specifying those rules and
in these files and then the nice thing
is that you can immediately start to
test it so you could and we will I will
not start to do that right here because
we will not have the time to do that but
you can just create now some members
create your network and etc and try out
your transactions to test but that's of
course not the final thing this is just
a tool to allow you to develop those
things the the next thing you're going
to do is then it's done basically export
this and that will allow you then to use
all those other tools to really start
coding deploy a zone on on a blockchain
fabric and and so on one other remark as
you see now here we're doing these
entities etcetera through the browser
interface if you like more just the
coding approach and you're anyhow gonna
use your code editor you can also do
this for example in Adam or in Visual
Studio code and through the plugins for
those tools you will also have
validations on the syntax of those those
things that come under composure things
so this was just a short introduction
about about the hyper latter one and
what you can do with this composer there
is of course a lot more you can do with
this than we could show here in the
fifteen minute but if you want to know
more here are some links you can find
all this code you can get started and
also in the hyper ledger documentation
there is a number of tutorials that get
you started with this so if we go
quickly back to this so here there is
also the tutorials on how to how to do
it
etc so so you can get easily started so
that was it I don't know if there is any
questions I will also be around that the
IBM boots or if anybody has longer
questions we can also handle them over
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
