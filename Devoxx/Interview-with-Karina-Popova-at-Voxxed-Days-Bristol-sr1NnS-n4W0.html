Karina he's talking about AI and the
Internet of Things what excites you the
most about the Internet of Things I
think it's very exciting that we've had
a lot of sensors around us it can record
everything about our life and somehow be
a part of our lifestyle right now and
that they can not only records it data
but also analyze with the time and I
think it will be a really huge
revolution in our lives because of this
ayah T it's really cool that we have it
and so in your talk about IOT and AI
what do you expect to be the biggest
benefit from AI playing a part I think
is a very helpful tool for us to analyze
a big data because all these devices
will accumulate a lot of data and at
some point it will be the biggest source
of data on the planet but this data will
mean nothing if we were to analyze it in
the right way if we will not find this a
needle in a haystack somehow because
only relevant data will bring us some as
to some actions and will help us to
realize how we should improve our life
so and of course on the artificial
intelligence can help us to process this
huge amount of data do you see what you
see connecting all of the different data
points at the moment because we have
data coming from our phones data coming
from our laptops data coming from our
central heating at home plumbing or our
fridge yeah so we need to have a kind of
more aggregation systems where all this
day they can become actionable how so in
my company where I work the connectivity
solution is GSM because it's basically
not limited to the access point as a
connectivity solution and it's exists
everywhere we provide access to most and
to hundreds worldwide so it's
a main point that we can collect data
from all these devices located in
different countries and we need a system
which can also produces which can store
this data this is a challenge somehow
right now a poke of peyote
yeah can you give me any examples of IOT
and AI playing a part in people's
everyday lives everyday lives I really
like this example with agriculture
industry because if we think about a
simple organism on our planet so usually
do I write sing in the right moment and
say program to do it this way
people are different but United Nations
predicts that in the next century we
will have 11 billions of people they all
have to be paired and at the same time a
farming is Springs
one of the biggest sole source of
pollution on our planet so we need to do
it precise so at this point nowadays we
have a special drones which can monitor
the whole field an intelligence system
which can analyze if there is any
deficits of water of nutrition top light
on the in specific fields which makes
the whole process much more
cost-effective of course there is also
another things that they can understand
which plans needs a hairpiece for
example so to applied only in specific
place that don't affect all huge
territories and also these drones they
can even bring some animals to a
specific plant to make it grow and to
give more product there so I think it's
really cool it can dramatically change
our life from the future if it alters is
farming most besides I actually complete
you didn't think about AI and IOT
applying to farming is it my little
closed world it's just thinking about my
fridge then yeah like smart home or
something yeah but the reason we have so
many possibilities of course as farming
is it's very expensive right now for
farmers to do so but with the time it
will get
turn better and then maybe you will also
hear about smart farming the same as we
hear about smart called smart home smart
cities yes
but the smart cities also have some
cases for example about this alarm
system providers that they monitor all
the areas and that's an intelligent
system can predict where the next
accident will happen and in which areas
they need to provide more policemen to
secure the public so it's also maybe
thank you very much you're welcome it
was nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
