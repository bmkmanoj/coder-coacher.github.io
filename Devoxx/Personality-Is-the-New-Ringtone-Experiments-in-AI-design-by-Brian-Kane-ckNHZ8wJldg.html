Brian Kane and I teach at Rhode Island
School of Design and maybe some of you
have seen this fish so before I get into
my presentation I'm going to start with
the Discovery Channel just did a segment
on on me in the class so I figured
that's a good way to get started I gotta
say sometimes in a week like this I get
a little overwhelmed by the amount of
genius that's displayed by all the
inventors but there's hope now the sky
is the limit but we can start small we
could even repurpose what we've already
got kicking around in the house what do
you get when you mix artificial
intelligence with a retro wall ornament
a viral video featuring the coolest
bigmouth Billy bass you've ever seen
prepare to be hooked Alexa what is
artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence means the branch of
computer science that deal with writing
computer programs that can solve
problems creatively hi I'm Brian Kane
and I hacked Amazon Alexa into a big
mouth Billy bass for those who don't
know Amazon's Alexa is a personal
assistant that uses artificial
intelligence for your home you can ask
her to play your favorite music give you
traffic and weather reports make to-do
lists and a whole bunch more this is
what she normally looks like
and this is what Brian turned her into
I'm an artist and a designer and I also
am a professor here at Rhode Island
School of Design last semester we
started a new course called AI design
and the idea there was to take a look
ahead and see where artificial
intelligence is going a lot of what
we're seeing from these AI products are
mostly boring they're pretty sterile and
bland and there's not much that people
can relate to in any kind of ways as
artists and designers we work with
emotional and social intelligence all
day long
that's our meat and potatoes it's our
drawn point we've been thinking about
how can we make these characters and
personalities and so that just seems to
me a really funny thing a talking fish
here we can see the optical sensor and
the sound sensor Alexa what time is it
it's 1:30 4:00 p.m. so when the light
turns on the optical sensor tilts up the
fish's head and when the sound plays it
moves the mouth on the fish here we have
the Arduino and the Arduino has a motor
controller connected to it and the motor
controller is directly connected into
the motors on the Billy backs when I
first got it to work and we were in
class and all the students were here the
first time that that we heard Billy bass
speak like Alexa it was a real sort of
breakthrough moment because it was the
first time for us that we'd been able to
actually talk to an object this video
has reached thousands of hits and
Counting but that's not the most
important thing that's come out of this
the best feeling of being a teacher is
really inspiring the students to do
their own
and I think you walk away after an
experience like this was a teacher
thinking wow I really generated a lot of
ideas and I got the students excited I
gave him a sense of wonder using tools
like Google vision and open AI programs
his band of pupils are putting their own
spin on the world of artificial
intelligence what I wanted to do was to
investigate what happens when AI becomes
able to hold a conversation similar to a
human so what I did was I co-opted an
Adobe software and used it to create a
live interactive artificial intelligence
I actually use my own face that's
tracked on to the illustration to create
the appearance that someone's talking to
Van Gogh in this case who's the best
artist I think we in a very sort of
Lewis and Clark way cut a path into the
wilderness of these new types of
characters and smart personalities when
other people can follow and start really
flushing that out now and bringing a
next generation of products that are
exciting and fun and humorous and
emotional it'll be hard to top this AI
hack but as they say there are plenty of
fish in the sea and bigger fish to fry
Oh excellent
I love you that's really nice thanks
alright so there we go and pretty
exciting to be able to do that with
Discovery Channel let's talk a little
bit about what's really going on there
so name of my talk is personality is the
new ringtone and that's really because
after working with this and and
researching it and and making stuff I've
started to think about what I think the
big new markets gonna be as this stuff
evolves as these products come online so
a little bit of background so five years
ago my friend Catherine and I we started
the you might call it wearables although
I don't like that word so I call it
fashion interaction we started the
wearables program over at RISD and we're
focused on technology and fashion and
coming up with stuff that's that's
intriguing a new and novel but mostly
focused on the fashion side because we
really feel that a lot of the wearable
stuff is it's too techie it's not
fashion enough so we really focused on
the fashion stuff and that was a very
very successful program and we've gotten
a lot of attention from the fashion and
the museum world and then this year I
started looking at night and I started
saying you know all of these all of
these AI products are starting to hit
the market and it's really time to to
get artists and designers thinking about
this stuff so how can we be how can we
be leading in this how can we be looking
at it from a user perspective and and
cutting a swath forward so that as these
products get designed they don't fail
and that people love them so we took
this is maybe I don't know if there's
any product designers in the room but
this is sort of the standard design
thinking process this is from the Don
Norman who wrote emotional design and
this is your standard iterative design
process so we took this process and we
applied it to designing AI products and
if you haven't worked at this before you
start by empathizing and in general
that's an observational project process
so you actually go out and watch people
and that's a real
a really great skill to have especially
when you're trying to understand how
they're gonna interact with products
then you define whatever problem that
you're trying to solve UUID 8 which is
just a buzzword for coming up with ideas
and then you get to the part that I love
and that's prototyping so everything
that that I try to emphasize whether
it's in the professional world of really
building products or working with
students as the prototyping is the most
important thing you're gonna do in the
whole process and that's why I brought
some some toys here that we can play
with I can show you and we can talk I'm
going to bring these outside after the
conference and we can we could play with
them and break them whatever and what's
interesting about the the fish in
particular is that that was I did that
in class just as an example of how to
create a really really fast prototype so
I got these parts it's all very
inexpensive parts and put it together in
class in a couple hours
and said okay now you know here we made
this thing but do we know to people like
it does it work so with my with my cell
phone I just took a quick video of it
and I said let's let's do the easiest
form of user testing that we can let's
just post it on the internet and see if
people liked it and then it went like
unbelievably viral and everybody loved
it and I said okay that's how you can do
really fast really really quick
prototyping and get feedback in the real
world so don't feel like you have to
have your stuff in the lab and you can't
show anyone get it out there as quick as
possible and in that case it worked so
all right so these are these are a
couple different ideas that that I'm
interested and I just want to throw them
out there to you that some of this
stuff's gonna be provocative and maybe a
little controversial but as I started to
research what's going on
with AI I started I ran across this
Marvin Minsky's emotion Machine
cognitive architecture and maybe some of
you are familiar with that and I worked
with a fellow named beau Morgan on this
and that's on the left side and that
goes from from low to high so
built in reactive learned reactive
deliberative reflective self reflective
self conscious that's how mathematically
analytically we start to analyze the
mind in terms of thinking but then on
the right hand side that's Robert child
Dinis six principles of persuasion and
that's the stuff that as a user
experience designer we use all the time
this is what we're this is these are the
principles that we're using in designing
products so that you like them so that
you do you have a good experience and
you run into this all the time in pretty
much everything that you use and
marketing and etc but when you put those
together you start combining thinking
and persuading and that becomes an
incredibly powerful tool box and I
personally think that there's really a
lot that can be done here and I don't
want to get too deep into that but I
think that when I was looking watching
the IBM presentation yesterday and
they're starting to talk about sentiment
analysis that starts getting into this
so this is something that I look forward
to researching as time goes by the other
thing that I'm really interested in this
is just my personal thing there's been a
lot of talk recently about can can
computers be creative and and I say yes
I think that they can so I'm very much
on the yes side of that and I think that
the stuff that they're gonna do is going
to be really cool and really exciting
and people are gonna love it but what I
put up here is this is sort of like a
designer artists secret understanding of
the way that we way do things and that's
basically you can understand creativity
is a series of transformations so by
changing things modifying them
reordering moving them inverting them
negating them you transform them and you
come up with something new so there's
really no reason to think that that
can't be automated in a way that comes
up with unbelievable things that
nobody's ever seen before that that they
just absolutely love and this is another
area that I think is really really ripe
for research I think that artificial
creativity is going to be super hot then
it's going to hit soon so thinking about
AI where we are right now so to me AI in
2017 it's really like
the world wide web in 1994 I was there
for that is this new thing and everybody
is excited and there's this like
something's gonna happen but we don't
know what some people are working on it
still mostly techy people it's not in
everybody's hands yet and then some of
the some of the odd things that if you
if any of you guys remember in the night
in the early nineties the people would
say things like well no one's ever gonna
buy anything on the web like no one's
ever gonna type their credit card into a
computer on the network well we know
that that didn't work out that way
there was this early product called web
TV if there's anyone here that remembers
that and the reason I brought up Web TV
is because in we're seeing that now with
a lot of these autonomous vehicles and
in many ways you can think of these
driverless cars like horseless carriages
so the picture below shows that's a
that's a horseless carriage and it's
basically it was literally a carriage
where they got rid of the horse they
hadn't really thought about what a car
is yet and over time that's evolved and
now we know that a car is a car and it
really has nothing to do with a
horse-drawn carriage it's a
fundamentally new thing and on the left
you can see that's an image of one of
the autonomous vehicles it's being
designed and tested right now and it's
it's basically a car with this thing
strapped on the top it's like driverless
well we can actually rethink the vehicle
completely and and as we start to make
these products smart they're gonna
change in such fundamental ways that the
new thing it probably isn't going to be
like the old thing at all and there's
nothing wrong with this it's a very it's
a very typical thing but you tend to
think of the new thing in terms of what
it used to be so it becomes important to
sort of throw away your understanding of
what things are now but in that way you
can envision what they're gonna be we
spent a lot of time thinking about
autonomous vehicles and that's a really
exciting topic too and again I don't
think it's going to be what people think
that they're going to be so in looking
part of what we did is we just looked
around and said well what are the
products right now that are out there
they're not
terribly engaging they're kind of new
that they're kind of boring they're
they're all passive and they're kind of
creepy so I think we have to really
admit that there are some people that
are creeped out by this stuff it's weird
some people love it but it's not like
it's not like the kind of product that
you're gonna get and you just fall in
love with it and use it more and more
and more so this first generation
product it's great there's fantastic
work but it's really going to evolve one
of the weirder things is who put that
poop with that woman in the cylinder so
there's some very strange cultural
things going on and I think a lot of
that has to do with the companies that
are developing these products and also
some other stuff that's going on but
there's I think some psychoanalysis that
needs to go on the industry as a whole
and and the other thing that we've done
with these products is that they're it's
don't speak unless spoken to and that's
a very odd relationship to have it's not
the kind of relationship that we really
have with other people and so we're
setting up this sort of digital slavery
thing that's that we need to at least
think about moving forward it's not
totally natural and I and I think that
that that's not going to stick for very
long one of the more controversial
things that that that we observed in
doing tests on different types of
devices is that I think that if you
leave the mic on that it's a more
natural way of interacting with these
objects so all of these all these
products now you need to invoke them you
need to say Alexa and then it starts but
it's actually when you start to look
long-term what it's like to have one of
these products in your life if it's
always listening to you then it can be a
part of the conversation with you as
opposed to something that you need to
always go and have this like
master/slave relationship with and it's
much more natural and I know that's like
a controversial thing but I think it's
better another thing that we noticed
early on is that in making these voice
recognition technologies they took the
screen away but
are good so put the screen back when we
took we took Alexa and gave it to some
kids to play with it and they were they
it wasn't fun
they didn't Alexa stop okay so so we
took we took that product that I won't
say his name and we gave it to some
system kids and they sort of played with
a little bit but not really they were
standoffish and it wasn't very cool and
then one of my students Esther took it
and put it back with the screen into
this fun box that's that you see there
and then all of a sudden the kids
started picking it up and playing with
it and especially kids they loved
screens all of a sudden it became a toy
and they knew how to play with it and it
was just a very simple transformation
with a laser cutter and some cardboard
and then on the lower side that was one
of my experiments so I that was a I took
that product and I put it inside of
that's a hamster ball it's like a three
dollar hamster ball and you could roll
it around and throw it and play with it
like a ball all of a sudden the kids
just love that so we can really improve
on these products just at the product
design level and make them much more
engaging the most important thing is
that I think we need new narratives and
what we're doing is we're building the
stuff that we grew up on in sci-fi
movies we're literally building trying
to build the Starship Enterprise and
there's a lot of interest in doing that
but if you can forget about building the
Starship Enterprise and I love sci-fi
then you can start to design and make
these new products that don't exist that
nobody's thought of yet so in many ways
that those old narratives need to go
away and one of the narratives that's
coming out now is the show of the
Frankenstein narrative so everybody you
see on the news how you know hey hi is
gonna take over the world and these are
old narratives we can we can chuck them
away and and the more that you work with
these products the less you get afraid
of them as well
and I just disappear so I'd like to
retire her I'd like to make her go away
we know enough about her there's no
there's really no value and that so
let's just make her go away so from a
user experience perspective and that's
what I'm primarily interested and that's
what I spend most of my time doing and
talking to people in the in the AI
business on many levels at what I keep
hearing is that the last mile for them
is this thing with emotional and social
intelligence so there's unbelievable
products out there you guys can do
amazing things and you're gonna do
amazing things over the next few years
but it's getting this emotional and
social intelligence piece right that
makes it so that people will really have
a enjoy and fall in love with it or use
it and trust it and that's what we do so
that's the domain of designers artists
writers musicians we know that stuff so
I think it's really important to start
bringing in poets and writers and
musicians and screen writers into this
process because we understand the things
like story arcs and narratives and humor
and flowing through emotional states
it's just what we do but we also need
designers with new skills so your
ability to to mock up some web screens
that doesn't help you in this world
now we're talking about objects and
people and connected objects and things
that do different things and you really
need to see the bigger picture and
that's why I thought it was important to
start up this new program and we're
trying to push out a generation of new
designers to you guys to work with that
have these new skills they get to test
it faking it is great so it doesn't
matter if it's real or not you can make
anything a fake experience and test it
on people it's real easy there's
incredible tools out there for doing
online testing or for doing testing in
the real world and you know the goal is
to rapid prototype and when I say rapid
prototype I mean really fast like make
something in a couple hours like
come in that morning and after lunch be
ready to test it
don't don't waste any time on making it
perfect just make it do that thing that
you want to test and that's what these
things are and one of the new things
with AI is that usually when we say user
experience we think the user is humor is
human but it might not be so now that we
have these intelligent machines that are
going to be filling our lives we may
need to have two or three machines
talking to each other and we need to
start thinking about those interfaces so
that you may need to design one type of
experience for a human but another one
for another machine and that's I think
another another area that it's just
fundamentally new and we need to think
about what's it like to live with these
smart products so a couple things so we
want to in general we're giving up
control as you start to use these things
you're going to give it a high level
command and it's going to do something
for you and a lot mostly we think of
software products as giving you
increasing control like it gets more and
more and more specific you can do all
these tiny little things so this helps
us give up control from a marketing
perspective that's great it appeals to
people's laziness and laziness as people
love to be lazy and they improve over
time so a lot of times we buy these
digital products and we think well maybe
I'll use that for a year and then I need
to upgrade it and update it and throw it
away but these products they actually
get better the more that you use them
and it requires a commitment you train
it but then over time it actually gets
better and that's a new experience
there's all sorts of huge trust issues
so specifically with the autonomous
vehicles is just trust issues all over
the place and the hardest one answer I
think is what would it take to put your
kid alone in an autonomous vehicle let's
stop and think about that that's a huge
leap of faith that you're gonna have to
do and we can solve that with design
because we know that the technology can
figure out how to make that vehicle go
from here to there but what does it take
for someone to actually trust it on that
level that's a design problem and then
there's issues with digital loneliness
in the world that's sort of a big
problem right now and so we can look to
a lot of these
intelligent products to work not solving
problems necessarily but being there is
more of an emotional companion and that
may have a bigger value than necessarily
being a problem-solving product and then
there's all this backlash culture and I
put up the picture of the turntable so
if vinyl records are really popular now
don't ask me why but with all these
products as they get more and more in my
more high-tech there's always a backlash
against it so it's you can and you want
to think about that when you're
designing these new things so you can
imagine in ten years that the most
romantic thing you could possibly do
would be to take a date on a drive where
you're manually driving a car like right
like yeah I drove her to I drove her to
the restaurant and that's like such a
romantic thing you know in a 2002
Chevrolet it's coming so now I'd like to
bring up one of my grad students Lokesh
so pay and he can talk very quickly
we're a little short on time but he's
going to talk very quickly about some of
these tools that we use for designing
new narratives and looking at these new
products hi my name is Luke SOP
I'm the finally a grad student at Rhode
Island School of Design and my work is
about trying to understand how emotional
intelligence fits into artificial
intelligence and what sort of
classifiers would be required in order
to make these machines emotionally
intelligent and Brian Kane has been a
great mentor and guide throughout my
process over here and so
building on what Brian Brian just said
it's like we need more narratives and we
need new narratives so I build these few
research tools to understand what people
think about when they interact with
emotion they interact with all these
objects and how emotions fit into there
so I build these are interactive tools
where you have this mood wheel and
objects so people would be placing the
objects near the moods and they would be
talking about how they felt as they were
interacting with these objects and the
second one is this little card game that
I have here which I call story engine
where people make these random
combinations as cranky vacuum cleaner or
depressed bed or fearful vacuum cleaner
and stuff like that and what these
objects would be like and what they are
talking about is how they would imagine
an object behaving in an emotional
manner so this gave rise to another
project that I worked on with Brian Kane
about this which was one person came up
with this prompt of cranky microwave and
I asked what's a cranky microwave so
it's a the person said maybe it's just
sends out cranky sounds at me like why
would it be cranky what made it cranky
then he said oh maybe my food choice is
something that made it cranky then that
gave rise to another project where what
if I had a microwave and make it do the
same thing so I just took a microwave to
guard the magnetron and then put a
camera in there and so the the the the
microwave detects the food that's in
there and tries to compare it with the
or use an API to see what the food is
and makes a log of what the person has
been eating and based on whether or not
the food is healthy it'll either make a
sad sound or a happy sound and I use the
sound of the yellow minions from
Despicable Me and this kind of brings me
to the point where these animation
artists and character artists they put
so much effort into understanding what
adore what what is adorable for people
and try to build that so for a project
like this I would definitely like to
work with animation artists and like
story writers on that we're trying to
get this compressed so we're moving very
quickly so this is really exciting and
it all of a sudden you start to think
about like yeah how does how does the
how does the cranky toaster talk to the
excited vacuum cleaner and that's like
an interesting story and that's we need
to figure that out because that's that's
coming in the next few years
so moving quickly so we've learned a few
lessons so so one is I think that this
whole idea of assistant and agent is not
that cool
and I think that there's a lot more
action on this concept of a companion a
friend or a pet and if we start to think
about our relationship with with other
people and especially with animals I
think there's a lot they're thinking
about AI as a pet that those are the
ones that people are going to get really
connected to one-size-fits-all isn't
such a great approach so all these
products now that there's one there's
one Alexa for everyone there's one Siri
for everyone that's probably not good
and that gets to the topic of my
conversation where we want to be able to
customize it we actually want to get
that out to the point where people can
make their own they need to be able to
sit at home and edit their own
personality and upload it and share it
and send it because that's what people
do on the internet right so you think of
it taking it commodifying an AI into
this little thing that you can send all
around and share and who's got the cool
personality now or these smart moments
that you can send to people I think
that's going to explode in the next few
years but we I think it should be open
source and we need to make these editors
and someone's gonna make the product so
if these guys don't do it some other new
startups gonna make a programmable
interface all sorts of barriers to
connectivity it's a mess I probably
don't need to tell you guys that but
between the Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi and
the apps and these things don't work
together their pain synthetic emotions
are really important so we don't
necessarily need to we don't need to
replicate human human interactions
people like machines and it's okay to
think about synthetic emotions and
synthetic reactions because that may
actually be more appealing to interact
with than something that's not doing
that good a job of being a human
dumbness and humor is really important
these things can be not too smart and
and I think that we want to actually
program a lot of these machines to
periodically make non hurtful mistakes
that way they don't seem too superior to
you so one of the things just on a human
emotional level is the last person that
you want to hang out with is the person
that's always smarter than you that
always knows the answer that's perfectly
polite that never makes a mistake and
looks better than you like you don't
want to be with that person so we want
these things to have flaws right it's
it's annoying and weak and we can in
many ways as the product as the as the
market evolves we can stop thinking
about solving problems because we can we
can think beyond function so if you look
at the way that the internet is evolved
there's some stuff that's really useful
but the you know the huge majority of it
is Twitter Facebook YouTube all of this
stuff that's just
cultural it's just human stuff it's not
there the original vision that it was
going to create this you know in a
information superhighway and everybody's
going to be super educated because
they're reading take hard all day long
that didn't happen what they're doing is
they're posting memes on Twitter and so
that's like the dominant modality you're
going through this again I think there's
an opportunity to create this emotional
markup language so that these objects
can talk to each other with a
standardized schema for emotions lots of
opportunity to use existing objects so
we don't necessarily need to introduce
new objects into into the house and
everybody's got a phone right so there's
so much smart in the phone that it's
really possible and that's why I brought
this that you could take your phone and
when you you know when you go home at
night you've got this object that you
connected to and all of a sudden there's
all sorts of stuff in here and this can
be animated and move all around so we
can we can expand on the phone to do new
functions because there's so much power
in there
AI celebrities are coming soon that's my
prediction in the next few years
probably within the next 18 months
there's going to be this AI celebrity
that's either telling jokes or making
videos or making paintings and selling
them for $100,000 we don't know and we
need a lot more deep testing and there's
a huge opportunity there we don't need
these super smart machines to do the
testing so if you want to you know I've
always been fascinated by how NASA puts
people on the side of a volcano for six
months to see what it's like to live you
know on Mars so we can do that we can
build a fake autonomous car and send
somebody from from Boston to Washington
and see what it's like to be in this
thing for for eight hours because we
don't know people might panic and if it
doesn't do what you want it to do that
could be all sorts of issues with
claustrophobia that we just don't know
about so there's a lot of opportunity to
test that stuff now I want to leave you
with one thing so everybody's like oh
how you're gonna top that fish you heard
that well we're gonna I got it so we
topped it I think and here it is here's
what I think is the kind of product that
people I think are gonna fall in love
with tada
so it's a microwave and we want to try
to jump
I know I'm running real
this is only a 30-second video and then
we'll demo that real quick here's what
it is go
you
you
you
you
you
all right so the jiff microwave we're
going to run it we're actually going to
actually going to try it so you know
locator said he was working on his
project and then we sort of turned it
into this but this is super fun I think
because like people love it everybody we
showed who loves it but it's also a
great example of you know we this is a
super low-cost real easy thing you can
put together in terms of prototyping
this was a junky old microwave that we
found and it's connected with some other
parts and using these super super
low-cost api's there's all these
incredible API is out there that we can
use now so let's give it a shot and see
if it actually works let's put the beads
on there yeah the word
got internet slow no that's why we have
video there we go
alright so that way got pepperoni it's
awesome so you know we added a couple
minor features to it so if you hit it
it'll bring up a new one for you we have
coffee
yeah yeah
alright so let's let's try that instead
if you didn't want pizza maybe you
wanted to have a cup of coffee or
something please give that a shot let's
see if that works I don't know if you
guys can see the screen or not
espresso okay not bad right if you
didn't like that then you can the
Internet's really slow so we're actually
doing the API calls through the room in
uh oh there we go Homer okay so as
you're cooking your foods you can have
something really entertaining and part
of I have 50 seconds left so let me just
explain some of the inspiration behind
this so when we're doing user experience
what we're thinking is how can we take
something terrible so we thought what's
the most what's the saddest most
depressing appliance well this is a
microwave right and how can we make that
into the best thing the best experience
for you and so we think that this is a
way that like you'd actually enjoy
heating up your cup of coffee all of a
sudden the microwave becomes something
really really cool for you and that's
what we try to do with the user
experience is take something that's
yucky and make it something great and
using the all this AI stuff like there's
I just want to say this this is all that
there's gonna be some amazingly fun
products that come out in the next two
years as unbelievable opportunities and
people are going to be making things
that we can't even really imagine and I
have 10 seconds left my coffee is warmed
up and thank you very much for the
opportunity to do this
thank you thanks Brian I love the idea
of an AI celebrity so finally Max
Headroom comes back it's gonna be
awesome
I don't know how dated that reference is
for everybody some very quick notes we
did push the time so it's 10 o'clock now
on the schedule it says sessions at
10:00 instead of starting at the hour
they're gonna start 10:00 after the hour
and run to the hour also Brian said
Brian and Lukesh will be outside to play
around with stuff and answer questions
if people have any so they'll be right
outside the room here there's going to
be another session or break in the room
we can play with it and break it and do
whatever anybody wants it would break
their stuff and Olivier is also up for
questions you can find him outside the
room very shortly as well let's see we
push the time they'll be outside and
finally there's a closing session today
how many people actually remember the
Java posse okay so there's like five
people it should be a fun session to
close it out also there's beer and pizza
sponsored by Atlassian please join us
for the closing session at fine at 5:00
and in the meantime have a great time at
the conference today and learn lots of
stuff thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
