okay today I want to tell you something
about Coco's review and to be more
accurate about the way how to make it
more efficient and overall II make it
better
but before we start Who am I I'm
Sebastian my marathon and I'm a
fanatical of a well written code of the
code that has really high quality but
not the best one the good enough because
this is a what our captain I really want
to have I'm also writing a bit you can
find me on my personal blog let's talk
about the Java also on DS on and if you
want to share with me your feedback
regarding the presentation regarding the
ideas or whatever other ideas you have
to talk about just catch me on Twitter
and currently I'm working outlook soft
for UBS so this is something that you
should know so what is in our again
agenda for today
first with I would like to build some
basic knowledge base for us so we'll
remind what the code really really is
why we are using it and then we think
about the problems that we may face
whenever we are using this activity
because usually something something
something that happens whenever we are
doing something new for us or we are
just may we are just becoming too
confident
in some activity then I will share with
you some tips that I found with my with
the teams that I working with and the
last last part will be about challenges
that are still waiting for us and
unfortunately I don't have a easy way to
solve them only only a tips that maybe
will let you make them easier to talk a
week okay
what is the value in code review that's
the question to
do you know why we are doing code review
okay so yeah do you reduce the feedback
okay yes to find a problems bugs issue
with the code really fast okay something
more okay to share knowledge here and
this is really important because we are
shelling showing the notes knowledge as
the outer of the code because we are
sharing the way how we solve the problem
and other you review are as well because
we can find the problems yes yes
standard rules some common ways of
solving something our patterns in our
application okay yeah and code reviews
also about readability
whenever I'm putting the code to the
review at the outer of their code I'm
challenging my code with another
developer I ask them to verify whether
it's readable whether you can still
understand it or not so this is about
readability when I will go go from the
company or definitely from the project
someone skill will be able to understand
my code also about quality that is
something that your colleague colleague
mentioned second ago we want to find the
pitfalls the problems with our code as
soon as possible and about knowledge
sharing okay if you could imagine the
perfect code review how it will look
like an ideas what are the
characteristic of the perfect code
review other other reviewer other outer
you you spend some time on the code you
wrote you solve the problem you were the
king of code and you put into the review
and you add the read you have to look at
it as a reviewer what are the
characteristic of this code how this
should look like sorry
okay so I don't see any problems with
the code okay yeah it would be good to
have to review only the code like which
we look in this in this way something
more okay yeah it should be easy to
understand to read go through the code
without any concern for me unless the
person really lies in case of an
activity that I'm doing whether it's
personal private private or and
something individual that I'm doing at
work so for me perfect code really
should be fast I don't want to spend our
Oh
looking at the cause of the other
developer I want to write a code yeah I
want to click in the keys on my keyboard
and do something productive not reading
the code so this should be fast code
review should be small because if it's
too big it's really hard to understand
it there are so many files so many
changes if something was modified
something was added something was
removed I have to understand everything
it's really hard to process it in in my
mind and also it should be as easy as
possible I shouldn't be exhausted after
doing this code review it should be yet
another activity and then I'm grabbing a
coffee and get back to working on my
code and it shouldn't take too much time
it's too much time 15 minutes this is
something that we agree in in the
project that I'm working with the things
we do time where I'm working with 15
minutes is the maximum task time that we
should spend on the review everything
more it's just too much everything more
more shows us there is a problem with
the code sent to the review okay are you
doing code review do you have some
experience with code review ok some are
shaking the head as for yes and some for
no
so for those who are who has some
because it has been some experience with
code review is your code review perfect
are you happy with each code review no
okay so can you list any problem that
you find find okay so I found you maybe
you will agree or maybe not hope you
will agree because then I can help you
with solution so for me there are a few
problems with code review mmm
when I'm looking at the code and I'm a
reviewer it's some part of my human
women behavior that I want to find a
problem I want to show someone that I
spot the thing that he missed this this
is something nice for me I always try to
find it and that leads to plenty of
comments you are pointing everything
well it doesn't know whether it's really
crucial it is really problematic this is
just not in the not done in the way how
I would do that in the in example
brackets are not in new line but in the
same line a you didn't use the internal
operator body files is it a problem for
me no this is just a really annoying
comment someone just want to put right
something point something in my code and
they did it my one of my friend
sometimes whenever she look at the code
and find a design issue he always wrote
that she just don't like it and that's a
problem where you are writing something
that you don't like something there is
no feedback for me okay so another
comment you can make it better
I usually assume that I'm working with
professionals so anyone who is putting
the code in the review
I assume that he or she they done the
best they could to make it as good as
possible so comment like make it better
is really unproductive because first I
assume that they will just I know came
into my head and find this better
solution
it won't happen and probably Optima
after my comment they won't read it and
then then they will the real life yes I
really can make it better
it won't work either another thing
details
this is DJ's are those tiny things
they're like it's ternary operator
mmm like these brackets those are really
really things that doesn't matter for me
it doesn't matter whether it will be in
the same line or with different line it
doesn't matter it is it's a ternary
operator or not we just don't care it
won't affect readability quality it
won't change functionality with the code
another feeling are with the
conversation about the design and I know
I prefer strategy over the temporary
method I prefer common instead of
strategy maybe you should use tell it
and you know some you are just you think
that the guy just read a book about the
design in patterns and they want to put
it each single line of code
here's another design pattern these code
review is not the place for talking
about design code design should be
already done all the season should be
already made default code listen to the
radio this is not the moment to discuss
the design why because there can be a
plenty code reader all over with
assumption that we are going forward for
what we did with design it should be
agreed okay another thing is there for
the time with a lot of comments we're
talking about design we're talking about
you know I mention on also also also
this endless
- on this never-ending course software
developer developers were like we should
inducing Layton because it's bad yeah
it's obvious it's bad so we should
shouldn't use it but sometimes sometimes
you just we just use it why because it
will be really hard to change whole
complex the design are around the code
some sometimes the effort and time from
the developer's perspective would be
just too big so we are just reusing
commonly used pattern um is it better or
not okay maybe it is but sometimes we
don't have a time power to change the
world to fix whole world but with all of
the all those discussion we are spending
more time with with you in video because
if someone write a comment they had to
expect the answer and the problem is is
getting bigger if I won't agree with
your comment because then we are
starting arguing with ourselves and this
argue take time also I can agree with
your comment and then what I should
change my code my code then I'm getting
back to the code I'm modifying it a bit
and I'm sending it to the review once
again it increasing the time when we are
so that we are spending in the radio I
don't know whether you explain some
situation like that that you wrote you
solve the problem within an hour but you
were waiting for merging the coding to
the master for one day today it happened
to me many many times and this is yet
another problem that showing that we are
just creating two big reviews and it it
makes our development process longer
longer and longer and when we are
spending too much time on in the review
we are not doing the thing that we
really like to do
we will like to write a code create
something solve the problem it doesn't
have to be even writing the code but
solving the problem this is what our
customers are paying for this is what we
really like to do and this is really
motivating when you are constantly
reading reading discussing arguing this
is not the way how our development
should look like
so we face all of the problems with my
previous team and after all during one
retrospective we ask ourself so maybe
called you the doesn't work maybe this
is not a activity for us maybe it's
worthless maybe we should just merge
everything to the master and live with
it maybe this is a solution we did the
experiment mmm but we thought about
experiment to removing colleague
completely but during the conversation
we agree that no code really make sense
it really was to have this activity why
because we are sharing the knowledge and
this is not only about you know these
great features new features of Java new
features of library that we just upgrade
this is not about this one we're sharing
those also information about our domain
well there in towers we are learning
learning learning and teaching others
this is the benefit we are making we're
spreading the knowledge we are making
all of us better because of those code
review okay so we agree that this is not
the solution for us so we agree for not
putting any single comment into the code
review no comment about better solution
no comment about moving something to
different line
we agree that
any comment that has that will appear in
cold review shows it back no bug no
comment
we live with this experiment for two
weeks and then we agree that we should
have to put some some more light into
our code review because II whenever you
are focused only on bugs you are missing
a lot a lot of the knowledge is around
that you are not sharing it because
someone knows something more but you
cannot write a comment so focusing on
box is not also not know the solution
and I want to share with you a few ideas
how to improve code review within your
project how to make it faster and
definitely how to spend less time on it
and do it with less effort
okay comments as I described we have we
have an experiment with no comments but
as I said you lose a lot lost a lot so
yet another thing we introduced question
before you are you are putting a comment
into the code video you were asking
yourself are you okay with the
dissolution does it really change
something if the developer will change
the code it will increase readability it
will remove some issue concept to a
conceptual or functionality they only
then you could only answer was yes you
could put the comment but it is also too
much because then you know you remember
each comment you have to expect the
answer so what we could better because
sometimes it's something you just want
to share some thoughts okay you solve
this in this way but maybe next time I
want to add yet another tool into your
toolbox there is yet another possibility
to solve this problem I don't want to I
don't want to force you to change
your current code because I'm fine with
it but next time you may consider some
different solution so we introduced the
tax I like on Twitter we've had few tax
mMmmm
back so without fix or without other
agreement over this you can no one will
merge this code so this is that was
first act another thing was whatever
whatever means is it information to you
I just want to share something sure idea
share link share my concern but you
don't have to give me an answer for that
this is just a question or suggestion
and we can leave it there was also one
more delegate because sometimes we know
that it has to be done but - don't - we
don't want to block further development
because sometimes it happens that first
community blocks another committee as
well so to not to not make this blocker
to not change this committee into the
blocker we just add yet another tack
delegating so we create an issue and we
were fine with this current solution for
now another thing in this case in this
case with this back because of course
sometimes I me as an author can disagree
with the reviewer I will tell them that
no you're wrong it's fine it's not an
issue it's not a bug it should work in
the exactly this way it should be named
in this way but this type of
conversation the conversation sometimes
changes into a bottles because
unfortunately we cannot always convince
other to our way of thinking and it's
good from the perspective of the team is
good to have different set of mine
because it allows us to create better
solutions so how to solve it we agree
for an
so whenever there are there were two
people who are arguing we themselves
with themselves and after five minutes
talk there was no common agreement we
asked yet another developed development
for making a decision should we change
it or not and this developer doesn't
have to give us any other information
just yes you should change it or not no
you should leave it no explanation we
were okay with that because as I said I
believe that within a team we all know
each other well we know that other
developer are pretty good with with what
they are doing so that was solution for
us it make our discussion shorter it
decreased almost all of the discussion
and in case of this discussion usually
our the answer of arbiter was what is
written is better than something that
has to be written so we usually if it
was not a huge issue we usually leave
with the current state okay yet another
thing mmm
usually how many files you are see in
the code in the review 5 10 20 50 okay
for me it was values sometimes it was 10
sometimes in - it was 20 sometimes it
was - but now we can imagine - is not an
issue the problem happen starts when
there are more files and what are the
problems which is so huge pull requests
it's not usually us it's not usually an
atomic change usually is the things that
we could split further so let me give
you an example American code I'm solving
some some issue or I want to just
introduce you
and I spot a place where I can introduce
strategy so instead of using this direct
type iMac attracting an interface then
I'm using this interface yeah
then I mean implementing this interface
by the class that was currently used
previously
then I'm implementing this intuitive
interface by my new object and then I'm
trying to put all puzzles into into the
one big picture there are steps many
steps and me as an author I know the
code
pretty well why because I had to
understand what the code that I'm
working with right now I've had to
understand the dependencies between the
objects I had to understand what are the
relationship over over the objects how
they are talking with them with
themselves I had to I have to know that
but for the reviewer it's not not always
so clear and the problem is that some
developer are putting all of those
changes under the one commit and sending
to the review is like I know introduce
new way of generating a report in
example for example remember that one
commit should be one change whenever you
spot a place where it's worth to rename
the method rename the variable Committee
that as a separate commit
make it as a separate committee why
let's imagine how great it would be for
other reviewer to look at the commit
where is where the name of the
committee's rename method two more
describe descriptive there's only one
thing that you have to do you are
checking the previous name you are
comparing with current name and you are
thinking okay so whether the new one is
more descriptive more descriptive for me
or not if yes then I'm merging it with
too many things I have to switch the
switch
context because I'm thinking okay so
this removal is regarding this interface
and these remove the objects is to be
honest this one split into two then I'm
adding yet another class even if I'm
when I'm explaining this it's kind of
context remember that if you context
versus context if you are putting too
many changes into one commit that it's
not like mmm developer will spend I know
there's also five changes it won't be
like five reviews of five small changes
five times one poor request no it will
be five times one pair one change of
five times change plus switching the
context you have to always have in mind
what is part of which context it's
really problematic and it's really
exhausting after switching those
contexts we have to keep in mind few
things from move I once read that we
have to keep connected keep in mind only
seven context so if there will be a nine
changes in one commit then you don't
have a memory to remember everything and
this is a problem and you can really you
can simply fix it make separate commit
even if it would be in the one poodle
request reviewer can go one by one it
makes things easier okay this reviewer
will spend a lot of time doing this
review but you just reduce his effort by
removing this context switch which is
really good and by this context which we
are also losing quality why because we
can miss the things if I will have a
committee which will be named extra
interface extraction everything that
won't be this interface extraction I
would throw the treated as a backup
clear I don't have to even think about
it
everything with what will be new
everything good will be removed is not
an interface extraction it's a back but
if I got plenty of change the changes
put into one commit then I don't know
maybe I'm just losing something maybe
there is something that I don't see
maybe there is one that I don't
recognize yet
it affects quality the more time I will
have to spend on the review the bigger
the effort will be the more quality we
are losing during this code review and
with those pull requests as I said you I
don't think that we should have code
review that contains only one commit I'm
okay with putting I don't see a few
refactorings if during the development I
think that it will easily words to
rename this method to change the Apple
of this method I'm okay with that but
each change should be treated as one
commit it also helps us to be the story
when you are looking at your revision of
the code when you are looking to get
over their history then you can simply
filter out all of those refactorings
improvements and so on you can filter
out everything with this not needed you
are looking on the only on the change
changes that are crucial to the
understand of the whole picture that's
good
this is why we've got this commitment
message we are building the history the
story over them okay but you hear the
change chance if it won't be a big
problem
do as much politico's as you can so if
you spot a place where you can do a fact
refactoring and you don't have to I know
too much put too much time into
separating in some it somehow just send
it to the review it would be great to
look at at so tiny refactorings
extraction of the interface you are only
about two things whether the name of the
interface is proper and whether the name
of the class is good that's all that's
all though what we are interested in
your checking or one more thing you are
checking also the dependencies does the
dependencies change from the class to
the interface and that's all renaming of
the method it's also simple extraction
extraction of the method that that's
really good to have so tiny poodle
because because then you are spending on
them five minutes ten minutes top you
can do it during the break it it won't
affect your productivity because you
want to be tired after doing that such a
call to do but some sometimes huge
public-wise happened and this is the
example that I mention we got these
steps like instruction of the interface
and so on and so on sometimes it really
makes sense to put a few comments into
the one poor request why because it
gives you whole picture
you know sometimes extraction of the
interface introducing new new object
introducing yet another object then in
the fourth pull request I'm using those
newly created objects in the place where
they should be used then you are using
losing the big picture someone can look
at each separate pull request can verify
the code it can be good but without the
knowledge how you want to use it they
all lose the most important information
whether you really wrote something that
should be created and another thing
refactorings
renaming the method if it's a public
method you can observe like no 6075
files in these cases most of the job is
done normally by our either you we are
not searching through the whole code to
change each invocation of the method and
so on and so no it's just simple like
pressing too few keyboard key other
shortcuts rename the method and it's
done
then in this case I think it is good for
the reviewer for the reviewer to write a
comment as an outer a Amen
this is the place where I'm doing the
changes to change all other places are
just 100 automatically by our either
don't bother this this is the important
important change and with these steps
why question marketer because a huge
pull request it's always a warning sign
a big picture it's also really hard to
define term what big how big is too big
how big is small enough that's why
whenever you can split it without losing
a context meaning you should do that it
will be better for your reviewer and if
you can be better for your reviewer it
will be better for you because then you
will lose less bugs less bugs will go to
into the production quality of the code
will be better because it won't be so
exhausting as me forward standard and
rules on the beginning some of you
mention about Paul explain the code
review as a way to build common ways of
solving the issues unfortunately we
cannot solve everything automatically
but we can remove plenty
with the tools we've got plenty of tools
to do aesthetical analyzes - to check
some dependencies and so on and so on we
should use tools for that we don't want
to spend time - verifying if we agree
that brackets should be in the same
align I don't want to look at the
bracket during the review we've got a
food tool for that - the review if you
say you should send the code that is
free of these problems it should be
verified before it will be in the review
so use the tools I don't want to tell
you that whether the bracket in new line
or next line is better it doesn't matter
until it's the you are writing the code
in the same way in your team and the if
you are if you don't agree for such
standards if you'll affect the
readability of the code it's hard from
the aesthetic point of view it's hard to
read when the standard the way of
writing the code is changing all the
time it's harder to look at this code
but we can remove this effort from us by
using the tools there are really
powerful tools and why not even can do
less this is really good for us and what
is even better it the violation of the
rule in our application we are doing
sometimes ago that five dependencies is
the maximum you cannot create a class
object that will get will have more than
five dependencies whether it's five is
enough or not it doesn't matter
also it depends on the project but what
these gifts will give me whenever I see
the code that violate this rule then I'm
starting to think about it okay so if
someone mark ID no PMD role as suppress
warning don't treat it as a violation of
this particular rule then I should start
to think okay so maybe my rule is not so
perfect
maybe the dependency limited that we
agree some time ago is not the Silver
Bullet for us maybe we should change the
rule because someone just found a judge
just found a place where they think it
would be good to don't follow this rule
and this is important this is the
greatest value that came with those
tools that we can use we are we see the
violation it's clear for us we don't
care whether you when you are following
the rules when you are following the
style standards it will be done verified
automatically you don't bother that you
don't spend your time you don't spend
your effort on that but whenever you see
violation over the rule this is the
place when you should stop and think
once once again okay next week
explanation mmm
sometimes I saw the coding reviewed
where when I started to think what the
code is about I were going through the
code
I checked all dependencies okay it was
small everything look looks fine but I
still didn't get what is behind the code
so I went to the outer and I asked for
explanation um it likes it makes sense
it sounds reasonable if I don't
understand something I'm going to the
outer outer and delicately they
explained to me but it creates a problem
because if I'm the developer canola's
the code that is already written and I
have to ask the outer what will happen
in five months from
now when outer will change the project
there will be no person that will I will
can ask about the code there will be no
explanation I will just live with the
code that is total total mystery for me
that's why we agree that it would be
good to don't ask for explanation if
there is no one except the outer who can
read the code with clear understanding
that mean that code has to be rewritten
of course I don't always have the
knowledge to understand everything the
bigger project is more nice is that
I don't know exist so what we can do
within each team you usually have some
seniors some people who spend 1 year 2
years 3 years or even more with the
project they should know more or less
each aspect of the code if they don't
know they know the people who have this
knowledge so you should find the answer
find the answer above the code that you
are looking at but not by asking the
author of this code there have to be
someone who can understand it also
sometimes also we are creating the code
that is really specific mmm I don't know
I can be not familiar with SQL and there
can be really complex SQL procedure
Euler then there should be an expert for
that there should be a senior who can
tell me what is behind the code and what
happened when I don't ask for
explanation the outer first thing the
guy or the developer that I am asking
for the Hult reminds and knowledge
reminds some fact about the domain
reminds some specific aspect of the
language that we are working with it's
good for them it's also good for me
because by this question I also learn a
lot and it's good for outer because with
this knowledge I can
if I die record okay move on asking the
next part one more time hmm
sometimes we happen to meet as an outer
I know that there is a really
problematic a really hard problem that I
just solved and I've got doubt it
sometimes happened you know once again I
will get back to the SQL I'm not good
with SQL and I had to solve some complex
issue so at the outer I can challenge my
solution I don't want don't need to send
this review to whoever can look at it no
I can go directly to the expert and tell
share my doubts not explain the solution
but shed my show my doubts
tell them up about problem and s then
ask for the review and once again I
learner oh I learned a lot and I'm not
decreasing the quality of the code on
the other hand and this really won't
land in the hand of the developer that
cannot verify it so it's good for
quality of the code for looking for the
box and for knowledge sharing that
doesn't think that I put into the
presentation on outer conversation with
my colleague from the current project we
are talking about code review and drink
one of the talk I mentioned that code
review created here in developers most
usually in those who are new in the
project why because if you are new
enjoyed the project it doesn't matter
how long how long you are working with
particle language with particular
libraries domain G is new for you for
you when you are at an outer where you
are sending something to the review you
can feel the fear of the review whenever
some
one will give you a comment you can feel
the pressure to change it even if you
don't agree you you've got this thinking
that okay I don't agree with this guy
but here all work with this product
project around five years so they know
they know better on the other hand other
reviewer I also can feel this fear
because it's someone some developer is
putting something to the review and I
don't agree the solution but I explain
myself
okay they are working with this project
five years from now they should know
they know better maybe there is
something that I'm missing this is not
the fear that you cannot can allow in
your team why first think you are not
learning second think you are not
teaching even new joiner can teach other
developer send your developers new
tricks you can learn a lot we when you
are not asking loudly those questions
when you are not sharing your concern
you are not learning and on the other
hand the finger that you spot it can be
a problem no one knows everything maybe
your senior forget about some tiny
aspect of your language of this domain
that you just refresh few days ago it's
worth to ask because a lot that can
happen there are two solutions either
they will admit oh man
you right I have to change it it's good
that you spoke this on the on the other
hand they will tell you no this is the
way how we are doing and why we are
doing it it's because and you are
learning that's great there is only one
fear that you should feel when you are
doing a code review and you are so
sending codes to the review that you are
decreasing the quality of the code is
coding the review
won't be easy
read where if there will be too much
files in the review then you are putting
into the indenter the quality of the
code this is the fear that you have to
feel that's why we want to make it
better okay so those are tips for you
suggestions my thoughts about improving
a code review there are few challenges
that are still waiting for us big
changes and I mentioned a few minutes
ago about this I write this question
when a beak is too big when it's small
enough and it the problem are happen it
usually visible with the really huge
change why because you are creating a
lot of new objects new functionality and
each aspect each commit each pull
request can be fine but putting them
together can be wrong this is a problem
how we try to solve it with our in our
project whenever we've got a huge
functionality to introduce or big change
to introduce we are always showing up
front our idea design have to be done
before code is written it doesn't matter
whether you will share it or not this
design will be done maybe only in your
head maybe not but you will have an idea
how to solve the problem
share it challenge your idea the more
people will know your idea the more
valuable input you will receive and
maybe you forget about something maybe
maybe it can be solved easier faster
doesn't matter know it matter it doesn't
matter whether you will the result will
be a lot of new ideas a lot of
improvements overall your idea maybe
your idea will be the best but by by
this by doing it by sharing your idea
for any code will be written then other
developer will know how you want to
solve it adult developer will know the
big picture other developer will know
why those tiny pebbles are created they
will know the connotation between them
relation between the objects not very
good because then they won't look at the
single review as a separate thing no
they will always keep in mind the big
picture and another thing is sharing the
whole solution after everything we can
lose something someone can remind
important aspect after the agreement is
made sharing everything after it's done
just after it's done it's good because
first thing all people will have a
clearer picture of the new functionality
and maybe there is still some work to be
done okay and another thing we want to
create as good code as possible but
sometimes there are those emergency
issues it's hard to do it hard to track
any promise of the from developer that
she will tell you I will fix it later
it's hard to track it so in that case
you are always creating an issue in the
deidre and we are assigning that to two
people we are assigning these two
developers that have to improve the code
and we are setting as a reporter or
water
the person who know right the concern
this allows us to track the progress of
the emergency issue because sometimes we
need to solve it really fast it's really
problematic a problem of products really
problematic and a mistake on production
we need to solve it as far as possible
and then we should change it
another thing what if someone will arise
a concern or issue during the code
review I know the two approaches we are
thinking it later we are fixing it
before it will be merged and what's the
problem with fixing it later if there
are you are placing on the wrong
conception assumptions if the problem is
really big then your assumption are
incorrect you want to do something good
because you don't want to block other
developer other developers from de
changes but the code they are basing con
is wrong from the scratch it is not this
is the way this is why we introduced
this delegate stack we are okay with
mechanic better but it cannot be about
domina domain understanding it cannot
allow for misinterpretation of their
functionality it have to be clear so
when when it okay to fix it later
only if assumption will be still correct
it can be some tiny problem then move on
and fix it later
okay and this is something that I
already mentioned quality and big
picture
you always can lose lose the big picture
because someone didn't share with you
someone already just don't for the you
just forget about all these all this
detail I'd behind that's why we
introduced two steps of called video
first is within a team or within a group
of people that are currently working
with this part of functionality because
they know whether the piece of the code
fits in to the change they are with we
are currently working on they are
verifying whether the puzzle fits the
big picture this is the first step then
we are sending to the different team
only another team
is powerful enough to merge our code
then they can verify the box quality of
the code and also they can find some
some things that we missed during our
code maybe they'll remind about some
aspect that we miss during to showing
our big picture or we just forget about
it and the last but not the least
remember
code review is only one tool we cannot
depend only on code review there are so
many other things static analyzers tool
you can use tests even development you
can write tests anyway you can use third
programming there are so many tools that
you may use improve each of them master
them spend us less time as possible and
make it better
constantly make it better okay so do it
or not I hope I convinced you to do code
review improve it constantly and spend
as small time as possible if you are
spending more time than 15 minutes it
should be treated as a warning sign you
are developers you are solving the
problem solve this one okay so that's
all for me you've got some question just
catch me right now okay thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
